In his speeches, the theme repeats itself endlessly - that revolutions are won not by debates or cringing appeals to democratic forms, but thanks to the iron dictatorship of the only class that can lead the exploited to their liberation and which does not exclude any means to achieve this goal - the proletariat. Those who preach the inviolability of certain principles, such as universal suffrage or the abolition of the death penalty, offer the power of the bourgeoisie on a tray. Only by subjecting themselves to the rule of the proletariat and its advanced vanguard can all the exploited classes move towards communism and free themselves from class society. "

### Focuses ###
Russia_Socialist: "Russian Focus Tree"

SOV_Proletarian_Humanism: "Proletarian Humanism"
SOV_Proletarian_Humanism_desc: "Through his rhetorical skills and clever maneuvering, Bukharin's vision of Russia and beyond has seen him retain his dominant role at the Congress. He supports a course of socialism at a snail's pace, to avoid the creation of a massive state bureaucracy and preserve the victories of the proletariat in the recent revolution."

SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation: "Voluntary Collectivization"
SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation_desc: "Russia had barely begun to move beyond feudalism by the time we liberated the country. The New Economic Policy of the Soviet Republic should include a program of voluntary farm collectivization, something that will allow the poorest peasants to unite and pool their resources together without uprooting the entire agricultural system."

SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation: "Cautious Industrialisation"
SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation_desc: "The super industrialism of the left-wing of the party will lead to a massive state bureaucracy which will dominate over the proletariat. Only a moderate industrialisation, one which also preserves the Smychka, which is a necessary requirement in the short-term, will be a successful one, preventing many issues in its path."

SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard: "Revolutionary Vanguard"
SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc: "After a long struggle, Karl Radek's vision for a revolutionary future has won out against all others. A radical among radicals, Radek is a firebrand, insisting that primitive socialist accumulation and a series of five-year plans will allow the production of the productive forces necessary to begin the transition towards true communism."

SOV_Mass_Collectivisation: "Dekulakization"
SOV_Mass_Collectivisation_desc: "The farmlands of Russia's great expanses have never been controlled by the farmer, but instead by the Grand Prince, the Tsar, and the capitalist. But now there is another enemy in the village - the Kulak, a capitalist farmer, who seeks only profit margin. This repression of the worker cannot be allowed to persist, and as such we must embark on a radical program of dekulakization of our agricultural industry. Only under collective ownership can they truly be free from the capitalist's jackboot."

SOV_Proletarian_Revolution: "Proletarian Revolution"
SOV_Proletarian_Revolution_desc: "The revolution must be complete and all-encompassing. For socialism to be achieved we must put all our efforts towards its accomplishment and radically change society from top to bottom. Only by removing the rotten core left behind by the previous regime can the workers truly be free from its oppression."

SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan: "First Five-Year Plan"
SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan_desc: "The taxation of the peasantry, and thus taking the surplus value of the peasants, will allow for the productive forces to transition to socialism. This is best done through a central planning agency creating plans which allow for rapid industrialisation. The mainstay of these plans shall be the 5-Year Plans: set economic plans with goals to reach within the allotted time to keep our industrialization efforts on track and at rapid pace."


SOV_Break_The_Smychka: "Break The Smychka"
SOV_Break_The_Smychka_desc: "As a result of centuries of feudal and capitalist rule, Russia has few true peasants. It's therefore inconceivable that the farmer will be at the center of the revolution, albeit through no fault of their own. No, it's the worker and not the peasant that will be the vanguard of the revolution, and he should be elevated as such."

SOV_Create_the_VSR: "Create the VSR"
SOV_Create_the_VSR_desc: "By establishing the All-Russian Union of Producers (VSR - Vserossiysky Soyuz Rabochikh), the trade unions will be granted a far greater influence over labor and the economy as a whole. In the end, this will serve to strengthen the worker and the Union alike."

SOV_Separation_Of_Powers: "Separation of Powers"
SOV_Separation_Of_Powers_desc: "The interest of the unions have been ignored far too much, we will create a separation of power between the unions, the Soviets and the Communist Party, which will allow to represent the proletariat while also allowing for the effective defence against reactionaries."

SOV_Rebuild_the_Country: "Rebuild the Country"
SOV_Rebuild_the_Country_desc: "While recent years have seen some of the worst of it, the Russian lands have been ravaged by the scourges of war and tyranny for the entirety of our living memory. The process of rebuilding the country will be a long and difficult one, and one that we must focus all our efforts towards."

SOV_Help_The_People: "Help the People"
SOV_Help_The_People_desc: "The Second Russian Civil War has devastated large swaths of the nation, it has also impoverished many people. We will have to fix this disaster and end the great suffering created for many by the Civil War, else we would be failing at our central mission to improve the living situation of the general population."

SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy: "Rebuild the Bureaucracy"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc: "Kerensky's reign and its aftermath hardly improved matters from the times of the Tsars. If we are to have a functioning state apparatus capable of serving the workers rather than the interests of a handful of capitalists and their cronies, the entire state bureaucracy must be rebuilt from the ground up."

SOV_Promote_Industrialisation: "Promote Industrialisation"
SOV_Promote_Industrialisation_desc: "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."

SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution: "Spreading the Revolution"
SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution_desc: "The revolution will not be contained within just the borders of Russia. The worker abroad must be freed from tyranny as well and it's our duty to aid them in their struggle."

SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits: "Force Open the Straits"
SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits_desc: "We're no strangers to conflict with the Ottomans. In the past however, monarchs fought against each other for the sake of pride and prizes. Now it is the people that will fight against the monarchs for the sake of worker liberation."

SOV_Into_The_Caucasus: "Into the Caucasus"
SOV_Into_The_Caucasus_desc: "Lost after the Weltkrieg, the Don-Kuban Union is a reactionary state run by Cossack warlords. Beyond their tyranny lies counter-revolutionaries and religious fundamentalists right at the edge of the theocratic Islamic Empire in the south. As long as they remain at large, these states pose an active threat to our revolution."

SOV_Secure_Central_Asia: "Secure Central Asia"
SOV_Secure_Central_Asia_desc: "Formerly part of Russia, the central Asian plains have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring Russian leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defence on our part, but also an act of liberation of the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."

SOV_The_Final_Battle: "The Final Battle"
SOV_The_Final_Battle_desc: "The treaty of Brest-Litovsk handed over millions of workers to the German industrialists on a silver platter and gave them Russia's most heavily industrialised lands on top of it. It's our duty to liberate the people of the East from the German yoke once and for all."

SOV_Enemy_In_The_East: "Enemy in the East"
SOV_Enemy_In_The_East_desc: "The Empire of Japan holds a large portion of Asia's workers hostage under its despotic military rule. These workers and peasants of Asia yearn to be freed from Japan and her band of warlords and only Russian might is capable of achieving this!"

SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias: "Mobilise Urban Militias"
SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias_desc: "The cities have been the heartland of the revolution ever since the beginning - they were its birth land. We must rally militias from the cities to serve in the revolution and allow for its spread, for if we do not, the revolution may be crushed yet again."

SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units: "Krasnaya Gvardiya Units"
SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units_desc: "Many members of the Bolshevik Party are still in hiding. We must mobilise and organise these people into military formations, as we need every soldier we can at this point if we want to survive the incoming onslaught."

SOV_Rally_The_Defectors: "Rally the Defectors"
SOV_Rally_The_Defectors_desc: "Many in the Russian army are dissatisfied with the status quo, which makes them perfect to recruit to the revolution, so they can serve in a true attempt to change the status quo and improve the life of the population and make the army serve the people, not the bankers."

SOV_The_War_Effort: "The War Effort"
SOV_The_War_Effort_desc: "We will need to organise the revolutionary war effort, as it has been a pure disaster beforehand. We will re-establish much of the bureaucracy and state apparatus which was destroyed in the wake of the failure of the First Civil War. "

SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army: "Rebuild the Red Army"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_desc: "The Red Army will have to be rebuilt, if we want to win this revolution. A centralised army proved itself to be a capable fighting force the first time around, and it will be a capable one the second time around too. Even so, we must be aware of the failures and mistakes of its first incarnation."

SOV_Establish_The_VVS: "Establish the VVS"
SOV_Establish_The_VVS_desc: "The VVS (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, 'Military Air Force') is badly outdated. We use the same planes and tactics today that we did twenty years ago. By expanding our air-bases and training new recruits we could change this."

SOV_Airspace_Defence: "Airspace Defence"
SOV_Airspace_Defence_desc: "Nothing is more important than the defence of the airspace, as our enemies will try to utilise aircraft in every possible way to conquer our airspace and terrorise the land troops, something we will have to avoid at all costs if we want to be victorious in future encounters."

SOV_The_ORT_System: "The ORT System"
SOV_The_ORT_System_desc: "Modern wars are only partially won on the battlefield. Equally important are the men and women behind desks and radios, dealing with intelligence and transmissions. We need to make their work easier."

SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry: "Nationalise the Aircraft Industry"
SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry_desc: "We have a highly modern aircraft industry, however often it is still private. We will have to nationalise this aircraft industry and integrate it into the state apparatus if we want to create a modern and strong air force."

SOV_Aviation_Bureaus: "Aviation Bureaus"
SOV_Aviation_Bureaus_desc: "Opening aviation bureaus throughout the nation will allow us to improve our pilots, something which is always an important duty of the nation, if we want to create a capable air force."

SOV_New_Fighters: "New Fighters"
SOV_New_Fighters_desc: "While bombers may damage our opposition, not a single one of them will reach their targets without sufficient protection from our fighters. These fighters can also provide cover for our own troops and industry."

SOV_Chairman_Zinoviev_desc: "Grigory Zinoviev, the self perpetuating leader of the Russian Communist Party since 1918 has finally achieved to become the real leader of the Russian Socialist Republic. Surrounded by his associates, it is now time to radically reform Russia. Long live the Revolution!"

SOV_The_Party_Guides_All: "The Party Guides All"
SOV_The_Party_Guides_All_desc: "No organ, no office, no Soviet can exist apart from the will of the Party. The dictatorship of the Proletariat is the dictatorship of the Party as the representative of the will of the class. The Council of People's Commissars, trade unions, the Red Army, cultural institutions, and even the Revolutionary tribunals are all just tools of the Party's vanguard. From now on, we are not building a union of Soviets, but a single party apparatus - the state."
SOV_Secure_The_Soviets: "Secure the Soviets"
SOV_Secure_The_Soviets_desc: "There can be no socialism without the power of the working people, and there can be no power of the working people without the Party leadership.

SOV_Purge_Bureaucracy: "Purge the Bureaucracy"
SOV_Purge_Bureaucracy_desc: "The state machine, inherited from the Popular Front, is in need of renovation. The Party inspectorate and workers' control commissions are given the right to conduct a thorough purge of departments and institutions. Yesterday's bureaucrats and opportunists will be replaced by proven Party members whose only loyalty remains the Revolution."
SOV_Proletarian_Charter: "The Proletarian Charter"
SOV_Proletarian_Charter_desc: "In order to strengthen the faith of the masses in their leadership, the Party must not only lead, but also formulate. The \"Proletarian Charter\" is not only a declaration of goals, but also the theoretical basis of a new socialist way of life. The document enshrines the basic rights of workers, the mechanisms of Party control over the state, as well as the role of the avant-garde in educating the people."

SOV_Enforce_Democratic_Centralism: "Enforce Democratic Centralism"
SOV_Enforce_Democratic_Centralism_desc: "Freedom of discussion and unity of action - this is the formula that the Party must follow in its ranks. In the name of discipline and victory, the Party must focus on restoring the mechanism of democratic centralism: encouraging discussions within the framework established by the Party and fully submitting to the will of the majority after making decisions."

SOV_Comprehensive_Nationalization: "Comprehensive Nationalization"
SOV_Comprehensive_Nationalization_desc: "In order to eliminate the duality in the economy, the Party proceeds to the last stage: the takeover of all private, cooperative and intermediate forms of ownership. From now on, all means of production, from the factory to the last warehouse, are subordinated to the people's power, expressed through the Party-State."
SOV_Artisan_Workshops: "Artisan Workshops"
SOV_Artisan_Workshops_desc: "Artisans, blacksmiths, carpenters, and shoemakers remain in villages and county centers - their work should not be suppressed, but it should be streamlined. By allowing limited small-scale production outside the industrial sector, the party introduces strict registration, taxation and ideological supervision."
SOV_The_Countryside_Vanguard: "The Vanguard in the Countryside"
SOV_The_Countryside_Vanguard_desc: "The hour of the great transformation of the village has come. The kulaks will be disarmed morally and financially, and the poor will be organized as allies of the Revolution. The Party should become a force determining the future of the peasantry."

SOV_The_Red_Tribunals: "Empowering the Revolutionary Tribunals"
SOV_The_Red_Tribunals_desc: "In the face of the threat of reaction and sabotage, a fast, ideologically sound court is needed. The Revolutionary Tribunals shall receive expanded powers to combat counterrevolution, sabotage and anti-Party agitation. From now on, their decisions are not subject to appeal, and the composition is made up of verified Party members."
SOV_The_New_Party_Schools: "The New Party Schools"
SOV_The_New_Party_Schools_desc: "Without theory, there is no movement. New Party schools are to be established throughout the country, where young cadres will be trained in dialectics, revolutionary history and management. Education is turning into a tool for personnel renewal, and teaching is becoming an act of political mobilization."

SOV_The_October_Lessons: "Lessons of October"
SOV_The_October_Lessons_desc: "Lenin's path was winding, but glorious. With the help of new publications, lectures and mass events, the Party is conducting an ideological rethinking of October as the initial stage of the world revolution. Zinoviev - as Lenin's main interpreter and 'student', forms the canon of victory, the heroism of the proletarian feat, and the morality of the future."

SOV_Preserve_Party_Discipline: "Preserve Party Discipline"
SOV_Preserve_Party_Discipline_desc: "When the enemies inside and out are getting more active, we can't afford to wobble. Strengthening discipline is not repression, but the prevention of division. All Party organs are obliged to work as a single mechanism, and evading the decisions of the Central Committee will be considered a political betrayal."

SOV_Celebrate_Proletarian_Dictatorship: "Celebrate the Proletarian Dictatorship"
SOV_Celebrate_Proletarian_Dictatorship_desc: "The dictatorship of the Proletariat is not only necessary, but also wonderful. This is not a tyranny, but the conscious power of the majority. With the Party now truly leading the vanguard of the workers' class in Russia, time to rewrite the old Constitution."
SOV_Heirs_Of_Marx_Lenin: "Heirs of Marx and Lenin"
SOV_Heirs_Of_Marx_Lenin_desc: "The Party is not just a tool, but a successor to a great historical task. The ideological campaign to affirm the Zinovievite line asserts that only the current leadership is capable of realizing the true Leninist legacy. Grigory Zinoviev will be portrayed not only as the continuator of the cause, but also as its theoretical and organizational finalizer."
SOV_Headquarters_Of_The_World_Revolution: "Headquarters of World Revolution"
SOV_Headquarters_Of_The_World_Revolution_desc: "[ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] is no longer just the capital of the state - it is the center of the world proletariat. The Internationale announces a new stage of its work, but the Party insists that Russia is one of the strongholds, not a citadel. Congresses, theoretical documents, coordination with parties in Europe and Asia - we rely on the consciousness of the masses, not on the bayonets of armies."

SOV_Purify_The_Revolution: "Purify the Revolution"
SOV_Purify_The_Revolution_desc: "The Revolution cannot stand still - it either develops or perishes. We must purge it of everything that slows it down. The surviving representatives of the old parties, hostile elements in the state apparatus, and double-dealers within the party will all be identified and eliminated. This is an act of historical hygiene necessary to preserve the gains of October."
SOV_A_Party_Without_Weakness: "A Party Without Weakness"
SOV_A_Party_Without_Weakness_desc: "The Communist Party is not a club, not a circle, not a direct democracy. It is an organization that leads the Proletariat to victory. We cannot afford the luxury of mistakes, weak links, and indecision. From now on, each member of the party will be evaluated by deeds: work, discipline, loyalty to the cause. We will establish mechanisms for internal responsibility and constant verification, and eliminate careerism and unscrupulousness."

SOV_Empower_Urban_Soviets: "Empower Urban Soviets"
SOV_Empower_Urban_Soviets_desc: "Local soviets, especially in large industrial centers, should be given expanded powers in the areas of social planning, housing policy, labor standards, and cultural initiatives. This is a step towards real socialist self-government. Zinoviev believes that it is in the cities that a new form of socialist life will be forged."
SOV_Tolerate_Platformism: "Tolerate Factionalism"
SOV_Tolerate_Platformism_desc: "Democratic centralism does not mean silence. On the contrary, it requires a meaningful and honest discussion. Within the framework of the new regulations, the party officially allows the existence of factions, with reservations: they are obliged to act within the framework of the party program, obey final decisions and not interfere in public authorities."

SOV_The_New_Soviet_Man: "The New Soviet Man"
SOV_The_New_Soviet_Man_desc: "The next generation is already being indoctrinated with the true and supreme lessons of our Party's most brilliant minds, fostering a love of pure Bolshevik-Leninism within the hearts and minds of the youth across our nation. Our Party leaders' words echo throughout every office, school, and public hotspot in the nation, every bombarding our people with the righteous truth of Communism. With these steps, we shall ensure that all future generations conform to these perfect ideals as Zinoviev strives to create the new Soviet man that shall inherit the Earth."


SOV_Internationalists_In_Power: "Internationalist Politburo"
SOV_Internationalists_In_Power_desc: "We need to bring back not administrators, but theorists and fighters. The Politburo must once again become the brain of the Revolution, guiding not only the Party, but also the global movement. We will include committed internationalists in the leadership, for whom Paris, Warsaw and Berlin are as important as Moscow and Kharkov."
SOV_Reject_NatBol_Herecy: "Reject National-Bolshevik Heresy"
SOV_Reject_NatBol_Herecy_desc: "Pseudo-socialism, disguised by national slogans, is the path to counter-revolution. We condemn attempts to turn the Revolution into a one-nation cause. Communism is a worldwide project that knows no borders, titles, or "state traditions". National Bolshevism is a heresy, and its preachers should not dictate the course of the proletarian dictatorship."
SOV_Moderate_Pluralism: "Accept Moderate Pluralism"
SOV_Moderate_Pluralism_desc: "Revolution is about debate and creativity. We will open a space for the expression of alternative socialist views within the Party and allied organizations. If one is loyal to the basic principles, factional strife, ideological debate, and political competition become acceptable. This is a conscious step towards the maturity of the workers' state."
SOV_Radical_Revolutionary_Struggle: "Radical Revolutionary Struggle"
SOV_Radical_Revolutionary_Struggle_desc: "As long as the bourgeoisie is breathing, the struggle continues. We will not compromise with capital, with reformism, with nationalists and "democrats". Instead, it is a tough, furious course to undermine the global system of exploitation. Supporting uprisings, exporting revolutions, organizing the underground - all this is becoming a priority again."
SOV_Ressurect_Memory_Of_Trotsky: "Resurrect the Memory of Trotsky"
SOV_Ressurect_Memory_Of_Trotsky_desc: "Although he fell in battle, his ideas are still alive. We will declare Lev Trotsky a martyr of the World Revolution and an outstanding theorist whose legacy and vision must be restored. His works will be included in the curriculum, his portrait will be included in the gallery of heroes, and his name will be included in battle slogans."
SOV_Magnify_Personality_Of_Zinoviev: "Magnify the Personality of Zinoviev"
SOV_Magnify_Personality_Of_Zinoviev_desc: "We were accused of "opportunism," but history says otherwise. Zinoviev was the only one who, after Lenin, managed to hold the red banner in a storm. We will once again recognize his intellectual and political contribution, put his portrait next to the leaders, republish his speeches, and say bluntly that his line was correct."

SOV_Worker_SelfManagement_Production: "Workers' Self-Management and Production"
SOV_Worker_SelfManagement_Production_desc: "Without the participation of workers in the management of enterprises, the Revolution is degenerating.

This is how true socialism is born."

A new era awaits our state, an era of darkness from which the light of Socialism shall soon emerge."
SOV_Empower_GPU: "Empower the Security Services"
SOV_Empower_GPU_desc: "The security services are of great importance in our state. Both [GetChekaName], Osoaviakhim, Political Departments in the military, and GRU are our nation's primary defenders.

SOV_Illusion_Of_Party_Collegial_desc: "Like a perfect organism working in unison and utter harmony, so too has our Union evolved into a perfect organism of its own. Like some fine beast or perfectly-crafted machine, every piece of our society has its exact place. From the lowliest farmer to the Chairman himself, all have their purpose in our society. If one piece falls out of place, our Proletarian Utopia could come crashing down, and so we must ensure everyone and everything remains in place. In perfect synchrony with each other, we shall build a perfect society."

Christened ‘Yezhovshchina,' Yezhov's regime seeks to create an atmosphere of complete perfection and total control under the mastermind Yezhov himself. All shall be made loyal to the state and to their Chairman, and all shall be purified. Like a master-crafted machine or a perfect organism, our Union shall function and prosper without hitch or issue, for Yezhov shall quickly see to any irregularity that dare challenge his power. The era of the Tsars and Kerensky is long dead, and the era of Yezhov has just begun."

SOV_Spread_Loyal_Agents_desc: "We must introduce a system of loyal agents in trade unions, universities and colleges, Soviets and army. With such a wide network of people responsible for monitoring dangerous behavior no traitor shall escape.

SOV_Chekist_State_desc: "The State of Security under the [GetChekaName] has prevailed, making it impossible for elements hostile to our rule to ever rise up.

Comrade Molotov will create an administrative vertical, where every link is accountable and every step is verified - Bolshevism is a system!"
SOV_Blow_To_Syndies: "Blow to Syndicalism"
SOV_Blow_To_Syndies_desc: "Western Syndicalist states have rejected Marxian Socialism that our Party has always been loyal to. We cannot allow traitors and revisionists to infest our homeland, and thus our agents have to stay vigilant against everyone that would agitate for the degenerated laborist vision. No matter if they stand on street corners or try to organize inside factories, the syndicalist scum shall be found and exposed."
SOV_Crush_Zinovievites: "Crush the Factionalists"
SOV_Crush_Zinovievites_desc: "The Zinovievites are nothing more than a cult of personality around the notorious factionalist and profligate Grigory Zinoviev. Unless we deal with them first, they will surely seek to remove us from power through instituting a coup against state organs. We must not allow this to happen, and thus have to strike first against this threat!"

SOV_Expand_The_Cheka: "Expand the [GetChekaName]"
SOV_Expand_The_Cheka_desc: "The [GetChekaName] is the most important group within our state, but we can make them even more important through massive funding of the [GetChekaName]. It is projected they can seep into every part of the state being the ministry that commands all other ministries."

SOV_Labor_For_The_Revolution_desc: "From the lowliest peasant through the strongest worker and ending up on the most intellectual of the apparatchiks, everyone is on the labor front. To ensure that administrative-productive efficiency is not disturbed the state will now introduce a system of labor duties. By switching to the shock method as the norm, and developing a network of labor camps for the "rehabilitation" of parasites and draft dodgers, loyalty to creation will become the measure of every man."
SOV_Centralized_Industrialization: "Centralized Industrialization"
SOV_Centralized_Industrialization_desc: "Our great comrade Lenin once said that Communism is Soviet power plus electrification, outlining a grand vision for the transformation of the backwards tsarist fiefdom. We shall take the spirit of his words and apply it to the Gosplan - quickly becoming the backbone of our regime - and carry forth the opening of new factories, allocation of resources and planned rationing with one slogan in our hearts. National Bolshevism is supreme power plus industrialization!"
SOV_Red_Autarky: "Red Autarky"

SOV_Fortress_Of_Socialism_desc: "The Revolution is surrounded by enemies. But it will survive.

SOV_Socialist_Fatherland_For_All: "Socialist Fatherland for All"
SOV_Socialist_Fatherland_For_All_desc: "The Great Socialist Fatherland is not a slogan, but the fate of all her sons and daughters.

SOV_All_Roads_Lead_To_Moscow: "All Roads Lead to Moscow"
SOV_All_Roads_Lead_To_Moscow_desc: "Moscow, as the beating heart of Russia, shall become the new centre of the Revolution.

SOV_With_A_Hammer_Blow: "With A Hammer Blow"
SOV_With_A_Hammer_Blow_desc: "Not every institution left over from Kerensky's days wants to take part in our glorious project, as the recent months have made abundantly clear.

SOV_Socialism_In_One_Nation: "Socialism in One State"
SOV_Socialism_In_One_Nation_desc: "Contrary to what some deluded people may think, the vision of a world revolution has already passed when we were defeated for the first time. Only through the construction of a great Socialist State within the bounds of one nation shall the whole globe be made to realize the errors of their reactionary ways.

SOV_The_Politburo_Supreme: "The Politburo Supreme"
SOV_The_Politburo_Supreme_desc: "The country needs clear hierarchy and the Collective leadership, envisioned by Sverdlov and Lenin and embodied in the Politburo.

SOV_Iron_Commissar_desc: "Lazar Kaganovich is not only a loyal associate of our Chairman, but also an efficient organizer and a devout ideologue of the true Leninist cause.

SOV_Etatist_National_Bolshevism_desc: "Instead of balancing the interests of industries and collectives, we must pursue a policy of completely subordinating the economy to state planning.

SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour: "Militarization of Labor"
SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour_desc: "Man, at his base, wants to avoid work. Thus, we must use state coercion to establish a society based around the interests of the laboring majority.

SOV_Strike_Industrialization: "Striking Industrialization"
SOV_Strike_Industrialization_desc: "The reserves of society are being mobilized for an unprecedented industrial breakthrough. The emphasis is on heavy industry, the construction of giant factories and squeezing the maximum out of the workforce.

This is a war for metal, concrete and electricity - and victory will be at any cost."
SOV_Liquidate_Natsoviets: "Liquidate Natssoviets"
SOV_Liquidate_Natsoviets_desc: "The idea of national and cultural autonomy is considered hostile to the unity of the socialist state.

SOV_Propaganda_Of_Worker_Heroism: "Propaganda of Worker Heroism"
SOV_Propaganda_Of_Worker_Heroism_desc: "Labor becomes not only a duty, but also the highest form of socialist service. The cult of the worker, the hero of the machine and the collective is being created.

This is a new morality in which there is no place for weakness."
SOV_Integrate_Army_Into_State: "Integrate Army into the State System"
SOV_Integrate_Army_Into_State_desc: "The line between a soldier and a civilian is blurring. The army is becoming not just a defense tool, but a key element of the state order.

SOV_Iron_Front_Of_Socialism: "Iron Front of Socialism"
SOV_Iron_Front_Of_Socialism_desc: "The final stage of building a new society is the complete mobilization of all forces for the sake of preserving and expanding the socialist order.

He became famous all over the world for his scientific research in the field of labor organization, significantly expanding the ideas of Taylor and Ford's assumptions. As one of the ideologists of the Proletkult, Gastev's ideas had considerable success in France.

SOV_Conquest_Of_Nature_desc: "As part of the improvement of society and the country, we must not forget about nature - it is time to tame it, to conquer it, so that it serves the goals of socialism and provides our Soviet people with everything they need.

SOV_Lead_The_Avant_Guarde_desc: "With the victory of Social Futurism, it became necessary to support all such movements around the world. At its core, Social Futurism is an international movement.

SOV_Soviet_Technocracy_desc: "Once upon a time, when Zamyatin published his novel "We", the achievements of scientific and technological progress seemed so far away and impossible.

SOV_Free_Land_For_All: "Free Land For All"
SOV_Free_Land_For_All_desc: "The concept of land ownership is archaic and based on greed. The Earth is a resource we all share and all men are entitled to, equally and without favoritism or bias.

SOV_Rely_On_Militia: "Rely on Militias"
SOV_Rely_On_Militia_desc: "The idea of a formal, standing army by definition is an institute based on uneven power structures and hierarchical tendencies that fly completely in the face of our ideals.

The socialist reforms, made by the government, helped us in our so-called 'Evolution'. It is time to hold an emergency congress to decide on the leadership of our young socialist republic."
russoc.1.a: "Hold the Emergency Congress"
russoc.1.b: "Yegorov Remains in Power."

russoc.2.t: "The Emergency Congress of Soviets"
russoc.2.d: "As the power has been concentrated in the hands of workers' and peasants' councils, the Popular Front government decided to hold the Emergency Congress of the Soviets to solve some vital problems we have in our young republic."
russoc.2.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"

russoc.4.t: "Fate of the Banks"
russoc.4.d: "When the Bolsheviks nationalized the banks in 1917, their decision had nothing to do with theory, it was purely political and even opportunistic. It was a response to the financial boycott of the Soviets by the banks, as they refused to open an account for the Bolsheviks and stopped issuing money to pay wages. Large deposits were confiscated. All foreign and domestic loans contracted by both the Tsarist and Provisional Governments were canceled. Nationalization was also an foreign policy act - foreigners owned at that time 34% of the share capital of banks, they owned the industry of Russia. The Moscow Narodny Bank was not nationalized for the longest time, until December 1918. The reason was that it was the central bank of cooperators and the government wanted to avoid conflict with them and its peasant depositors.\n\nAfter the end of the civil war, the new SR-Kadet government began negotiations with the bankers to denationalize the banks. However, the State Bank (Gosbank) remained as the central bank of the Republic, and it was engaged in restoring and supervising the circulation of money; promoting the development of industry, agriculture and commodity turnover; and issuing chervonets, which ended the galloping post-war inflation. Banks were eventually denationalized, including the return to the hands of former owners of such giants as the Russo-Asiatic Bank and the Petrograd International Commercial Bank, the bright star of the capital's financial market, where more than half of the capital was soon to be owned by the German Deutsche Bank.\n\nWith the new revolution, the fate of the banks became acute. Some delegates demanded that the mistakes of the Bolsheviks should not be made - to nationalize the banks of the big capitalists, but to allow the free operation of cooperative banks. As for foreign banks, the unconditional opinion of the majority of delegates is to nationalize them immediately. Those of the delegates who stand on the rights of centralization are convinced that the banks should still be nationalized and placed under the control of the Gosbank."
russoc.4.a: "Nationalize all banks in the country!"
russoc.4.b: "Nationalize only the banks of oligarchs and foreigners."

russoc.5.t: "Monopoly on Foreign Trade?"
russoc.5.d: "The Bolsheviks believed that without a state monopoly of foreign trade it was impossible to restore the economy as quickly as possible. In addition, this step would prevent the penetration of Western capital into Russia, whereas on the eve of 1917 French, British and German banks controlled a significant part of Russian industry and exports. A decree of the Sovnarkom nationalized foreign trade. However, as the post-war recovery showed, the penetration of Western capital could, in the short term, quickly revitalize the economy, albeit by once again taking control of industry. Nevertheless, the issue remained relevant.\n\nThus, Bukharin's party strongly advocated the creation of the Gostorg (State Export-Import Office), an organization with a monopoly on foreign trade and the right to participate in foreign transactions and the implementation of such, controlled by the state, of course. Some delegates, however, opposed such a decision, calling for the cessation of all trade with capitalist countries, while others, on the contrary, were in favor of free trade."
russoc.5.a: "Trade with capitalists? No way!"
russoc.5.b: "Establish Gostorg - a perfect addition to the NEP."
russoc.5.c: "Allow free commercial trade, but keep foreign capital out of the ownership."

russoc.6.t: "General Labor Conscription"
russoc.6.d: "In Bolshevik Russia, conscription was introduced by a decree of the Sovnarkom, which established compulsory labor for "bourgeois elements", then in late 1918 the Labor Code established conscription for all Russian citizens. Separate decrees prohibited unauthorized transfer to a new job and absenteeism.\n\nThe general labor conscription, in the opinion of the majority of those assembled, was undoubtedly barshchina (statute labor). And in the conditions of building a socialist labor democracy it was recognized as violating the rights and freedoms of citizens. Instead, the most popular solution was to suppress the rights of non-working citizens, but not deliberately, but proceeding from the very essence of Soviet democracy - only the labor people could participate in and create a socialist labor democracy. A compromise solution, however, seemed impossible to achieve. The radicals nevertheless advocated labor conscription, while the moderates, on the contrary, called for freedom of choice to work or not."
russoc.6.a: "He who does not work neither shall he eat."
russoc.6.b: "We will not allow a new barshchina for our people!"

russoc.7.t: "Question of the Ethnic Councils and National Autonomies"
russoc.7.d: "Russia has been proclaimed a federation and, for many delegates, this has become an indisputable fact. However, the focus is more on the organization of autonomous regions. \"We condemn nationalism and oppose counterrevolutionary bourgeois nationalist forces\", delegates said. Others argued that every nation has the right not only to self-determination but also to representation, education in their native language, and the preservation of their culture. Therefore, the discussion naturally turned to the fate of autonomous regions and the establishment of councils based on national identity. The following solutions can be considered: banning the establishment of national-based councils, abolishing territorial and administrative autonomous entities. Alternatively, it could be allowed to establish autonomous entities within the unitary Russian republic. The third option would be to maintain the federal structure and permit free entry (but not secession) into the Russian republic. The final choice is to adopt an Austromarxist idea of a national-cultural autonomy, albeit allowing ethnic councils without high-level autonomous structure."
russoc.7.a: "Russia is a unitary republic of Soviets."
russoc.7.b: "Russia is a unitary republic with national-cultural autonomies."
russoc.7.c: "Russia is a unitary republic with autonomous subjects."
russoc.7.e: "Russia is a federal republic of equal subjects."

russoc_7_rise_level_of_autonomy: "All "

russoc.8.t: "Matter of Trade Unions"
russoc.8.d: "One of the most significant topics of discussion was the matter of trade unions. Certain delegates maintained a clear stance that trade unions ought to be under the supervision of the state and subordinate to the Russian Central Council of Trade Unions (RTsSPS), and only this authority, also accountable to the government, has the power to address any issues pertaining to trade union members.\n\nThis, naturally, conflicted with the views of representatives from the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and Trade-Unionists affiliated with the [GetRadSocParty]. Both factions viewed trade unions as the highest form of workers' organization and believed they should have the capacity to lead and guide the nation's economic direction. A third group of delegates likewise supported trade unions that are not under state control, yet they rejected the demand for state management of the economy."
russoc.8.a: "The leading role of the state in trade unions is necessary."
russoc.8.b: "Transfer to trade unions the rights to manage the national economy."
russoc.8.c: "Independent trade unions without influence on public administration."

russoc.9.t: "Foreign Policy"
russoc.9.d: "The question of the foreign policy is also important. The majority of the factions believe that we should join the Internationale, but some believe that we should create our own alliance."
russoc.9.a: "Join the Internationale."
russoc.9.b: "Create our own alliance."

russoc.10.t: "Issue of Land"
russoc.10.d: "The issue of land ownership is more pressing than ever. The peasant \"black redistribution\" of land during the recent revolution and civil war brought only chaos and devastation. Under the leadership of President Kerensky, attempts were made to find a compromise on this issue: some land was returned to its former owners, but lack of state support and economic stagnation made it difficult to fully implement these measures. In response to economic hardship and social unrest, the government decided to increase state control and promote the formation of cooperatives. However, the implementation of these plans was hindered by the economic crisis of 1929.\n\nAs before, the Socialist Revolutionaries advocated for the socialization of privately owned land, which entails its transfer from individual ownership to public ownership managed by democratically elected local communities and regional unions. This approach aims to ensure equitable distribution and use of resources. The fundamental concept espoused by the Narodnik faction among the delegates remains steadfast: to expel capitalism from agriculture and achieve the socialization of land not through the chaotic leadership of the Bolsheviks but through an organized redistribution among communities.\n\nThe adherents of the Menshevik ideology, drawing closer to the principles of the SRs, advocate for the transfer of land ownership to municipal councils established based on strict regulations, rather than advocating for the spontaneous formation of land committees operating on undefined grounds.\n\nThe latest cohort of radical legislators are predisposed to the Leninist conception of land nationalization - the transfer of all land, primarily, into state ownership, with subsequent distribution being contingent upon the particular circumstances \"on the ground.\""
russoc.10.a: "Land should be nationalized by our socialist state!"
russoc.10.b: "Full socialization of land"
russoc.10.c: "Land should be owned by municipal councils."

russoc.11.t: "End of the Congress"
russoc.11.d: "Some of the decisions taken at this congress were not in vain - based on the fundamental interests of the elected Soviet deputies, a new constitution of our state was developed, replacing the temporary emergency decrees issued during the war by the Revolutionary Military Council and, of course, the ChVSRK.\n\nIn accordance with the new constitution, the Soviets of People's Deputies became the highest authority in the country, electing the central body every 4 years - the All-Russian Congress of Soviets of People's Deputies. The VSSND, in turn, forms the executive committee (Ispolkom) - the government of the Soviet Republic. The VSSND may recall the commissars (ministers), including the Chairman of the Executive Committee, at any time. Similarly, the Councils of People's Deputies may recall deputies from the VSSND. Local power is decentralized and belongs exclusively to the council of People's Deputies elected by the population, and can also be recalled at any time.\n\nOf course, there are other articles in the constitution, including fundamental ones that cannot be changed by anyone, and contained in the first chapter of the constitution. In connection with the adoption of the Constitution, the emergency Congress completes its work and announces the elections to the VSSND and the formation of a new government."

russoc.14.d: "Recently, congresses of soviets across the country had formed their lists of candidates to the new Congress of Soviet.

russoc.20.t: "'Pravda'"
russoc.20.d: "'Pravda' or 'Truth' is an official newspaper of the RKP, now - the official newspaper of the Russian Socialist Republic. With the new order consolidated in the country, the [ROOT.GetLeader] has made bail to prohibit all non-socialist newspapers in the country, shutting down the 'Popular Messenger' of the SR party and the 'Socialist Messenger' of the Mensheviks, the most distributed newspapers in former Russian Republic. With the prohibition confirmed, communist newspapers with 'Pravda' as the main source of the news became the only allowed and available in the country. However, it seems that people really don't care what to read - citizens of the young socialist republic purchase all the newspapers available."

### New events ###

russoc.23.t: "Question of Kulaks"
russoc.23.d: "Kulaks, or well-to-do peasants, are a petty-bourgeois class from a certain point of view, who were able to enrich themselves through the use of wage labor and engaged in rural usury. On the one hand, reliance on the petty-bourgeois peasants in our agrarian policy contributes to the entrenchment of capitalist relations in the countryside, and from the point of view of the Socialist-Revolutionary doctrine, this is an inevitable sabotage against the Soviet government. On the other hand, we can allow the Kulaks to coexist with the Soviet government, hoping for the enrichment of the village and cooperation."
russoc.23.a: "Seize the Kulak land  in favor of cooperatives!"
russoc.23.b: "Let them be... for now."

russoc.24.t: "Ethnic Soviets?"
russoc.24.d: "One of the main questions about the nature of the Soviet system is the representation of minorities. The Left SRs have suggested to create Ethnic Soviets in order to represent various ethnicities in the lands of the former Russian Empire. However, critics say that this is against internationalist doctrine and can bolster nationalism in the country."
russoc.24.a: "This will definitely help."
russoc.24.b: "This will only stimulate nationalism!"

russoc.25.t: "Formation of Profintern"
russoc.25.d: "Solomon Lozovsky has delivered a speech, offering the government to establish the Profintern - the Internationale of Trade Unions that will help the workers globally. Even though in many syndicalist countries the Trade Unions congresses are controlling the government, there are still many democracies where trade unions are still allowed and workers need more social security."
russoc.25.a: "Send the invitations."

russoc.26.t: "Invitation to Profintern"
russoc.26.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has offered us to assist our trade unions and join the Profintern organisation. The 'Internationale of Trade Unions' aims to create an organisation of trade unions in order to achieve security of workers rights globally. They also stated that their task is not the destruction, but the conquest of the trade unions, that is, the multimillion mass that is in the old trade unions."
russoc.26.a: "That sounds shady..."
russoc.26.b: "We see benefits in this organisation. Let us join."

russoc.27.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Join Profintern"

russoc.29.a: "Sad!"

russoc.30.t: "New Female Image"
russoc.30.d: "The new Soviet culture equally rejects both the bourgeois consumer approach to life and the commercial attitude to the dominance of sexuality in female beauty, offering its own solution to the issue: a new type of femininity, based on naturalness, health, hygiene and a complete rejection of the use of decorative cosmetics. An exemplary Soviet beauty should adhere to the following fundamental principles of femininity: neatness / neatness, cleanliness, professionalism, modesty and only in special cases - elegance.\n\nIn addition, the point of view began to dominate that a woman is not only equal in rights to men, but should also be a mother-worker. The image of a working-mother (Rabotnitsa-Mat'), universally propagandizing work and family values, became the basis of our new Soviet culture. The new female image should become an example for the whole world."
russoc.30.a: "All the women of the world are following you to fight against capital!"

russoc.31.t: "Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution"
russoc.31.d: "Maria Spiridonova is not just a revolutionary terrorist, but now the leader of a capital-free Russia, so the image of the "Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution" immediately began to take shape around her. Participation in the first Russian revolution and the subsequent ones largely secured this complimentary nickname for her. Moreover, Maria Spiridonova became the first woman at the head of Russia, which in many ways spurred feminists, suffragettes and women all over the world. Ready to lead Revolutions forward and liberate all women of the world, Maria Spiridonova became the new idol of socialism all over the world.\n\nA cult of personality also began to form spontaneously around her, which, however, manifests itself in the universal imitation of the image of Spiridonova, as well as the mass movement of women in Councils at all levels."
russoc.31.a: "Long live Russian Revolution!"

russoc.35.t: "Suspicious Nomination"
russoc.35.d: "Today was the most ordinary day in Soviet Russia. Peasants and workers were working, and almost no one noticed how something terrible happened in the country. Few people have heard that by yesterday's decree, the Soviet government intended to disband the counterintelligence bodies, the [GetChekaName], and give more power to the police, since it no longer saw the need for the existence of this organization for revolutionary terror.\n\nHowever, this did not happen. Instead, today the new deputy head of the country is Yakov Fishman, the head of the [GetChekaName], who clearly claims to be the subsequent nomination for the post of head of the Soviet republic."
russoc.35.a: "That's really strange!"
russoc.35.b: "Sounds like a coup, better remove him from any power!"

russoc.36.t: "Decree on Abolising the Parties"
russoc.36.d: "With the filing of Yakov Fishman, today the government adopted a decree on the abolition of political parties for their uselessness and the transfer of full power to the Soviets. The decree caused a wide resonance among the political elite, as well as the public, although, in fact, it does not imply a rejection of the ideology of parties or their ideas, but only makes all Councils non-partisan authorities."
russoc.36.a: "Do the government has authority to do so?"

russoc.37.t: "Legalist Coup"
russoc.37.d: "After the creation of a virtually shadow government, the abolition of parties and the implementation of terror on an even larger scale, a group of left-wing Socialist-Revolutionary politicians and revolutionaries led by Vladimir Trutovsky.\n\nThey declared the presence of the Chekists in power illegal and unjustified and demanded immediate resignation from leadership positions as well as the abolition of the Cheka.\n\nFurther events developed quite quickly, however, it all ended with the fact that..."

russoc.49.t: "The Trade Union Congress"
russoc.49.d: "The Old Soviets are now destroyed, with the new system of Trade Union Congresses now implemented instead. The Central Congress of Trade Unions, the RTsSPS, now holds the supreme power in the country, with the just elected chairman Kuznetsov as head of the Congress and our Republic."
russoc.49.a: "Long live Kuznetsov!"

russoc.50.t: "I Congress of the NSP"
russoc.50.d: "The People's Socialist Party, which was established in the lead-up to the upcoming elections, was intended as yet another proxy list of candidates from among the Moscow Bolsheviks. However, the turmoil and crisis that characterized the early months of 1936 appeared to present Bukharin and his allies with an opportunity to establish their own political entity.\n\nThe inaugural congress of the newly formed People's Socialist Party - now officially recognized as a party - was held in Moscow today. Its supporters express the hope that their leaders will no longer be subject to prohibitions and other impediments.\n\nThe congress commenced with an inaugural address delivered by Nikolay Bukharin. At this gathering, the Central Committee of the party was constituted, with the subsequent election of its Politburo and Secretariat. The congress articulated the party's programme, at the core of which lay the New Economic Policy and its implementation.\n\nFurthermore, the congress expressed its stance on the Popular Front, affirming that it was the sole viable governmental entity during the state of emergency, which would remain in place until the convening of a special congress of Soviets. A separate discussion was held on the position of Zinoviev's RKP, but no resolution was reached."
russoc.50.a: "There is such a party!"

russoc.51.t: "Two Cities - One Party"
russoc.51.d: "As we know, in many ways, the Bolsheviks of the \"Petrograd dictator\" Zinoviev and the Moscow Bolsheviks, were divided artificially as a result of the Civil War. While the former were able to go abroad and continue there as an overseas group, the Moscow Bolsheviks were convicted and then engaged in political activity in Russia as part of creating proxy lists of candidates for various elections. Now that the RKP has returned to Russia, although they are not welcome here, there has been some discussion of uniting the so-called NSP and the RKP. The main ideologue of this unification is the former chairman of the Bolshevik Mossoviet, Lev Kamenev, who has maintained relations with the Bolsheviks abroad.\n\nThe Petrograd Bolsheviks have significant differences with the Bukharinists, but they have a common history and internationalist platform. Perhaps, if they are not prevented from doing so, the Bolsheviks will indeed unite and plunge into the struggle with new forces."
russoc.51.a: "For our own good, exclude the NSP from the Popular Front"
russoc.51.b: "Their contradictions will eat them up."

russoc.52.t: "RKP Returns From Exile"
russoc.52.d: "In the wake of the news of the revolution in Russia, and undoubtedly capitalizing on the turmoil at the border, we have received credible reports that the Bolsheviks have arrived in Petrograd after their exile. Led by Zinoviev and his comrades, the Russian Communist Party has returned to Russia, aware of the prevailing anti-Bolshevist sentiment and fearful of arrest, compelled to operate clandestinely.\n\nIt is currently known with certainty that the party has commenced distributing flyers extolling the significance of the RKP platform and urging support for the \"communist vanguard of the revolution.\" Given that among our military leaders there are numerous individuals who fought alongside the Bolsheviks during the initial Civil War, and considering that a portion of the Popular Front comprises former members of the Moscow Committee of the RKP, the risk of Bolshevik influence remains substantial. The attitudes of Bukharin and Rykov towards the current situation remain unknown. Meanwhile, the left SRs and Mensheviks vigorously oppose any possibility of the return of the Bolsheviks to power. They recall the disastrous consequences of the last such attempt, which resulted in a crushing defeat.\n\nThere is growing suspicion towards Bukharin and Rykov themselves, as despite their differences with the 'exiled bureau' led by Zinoviev, they remain associates of Lenin and true Bolsheviks in spirit, regardless of their self-proclaimed labels."
russoc.52.a: "We must watch the Bolshevist threat closer."

russoc.53.t: "Success of the RKP Unification Congress"
russoc.53.d: "It was a grave error to exclude the Moscow Bolsheviks from government and the Popular Front, for we have only created new foes. When animosity surpassed the necessity for collaboration in the pursuit of socialist triumph and revolution, it became evident that the Bolsheviks would henceforth unite, prepared to sacrifice even their own power for this unity. When, by a narrow majority of votes, the Left SRs and Mensheviks still managed to pass a resolution prohibiting the Communist Party and any alliances or coalitions with Zinoviev and his allies, the split became increasingly evident. Despite their own disagreements with Zinoviev, the Bolshevik faction led by Bukharin chose to take a stand, announcing their resignation in protest. Consequently, when the decision was made to expel the NSP from the People's Front, it became meaningless.\n\nSubsequently, the authorities took the ill-fated step of arresting Bukharin, Rykov, and other prominent members of their party, accusing them of treason and counter-revolutionary activities. At this point, the government was unaware that the Moscow Bolsheviks had already gone underground, establishing contacts with Zinoviev's faction and planning an underground unification conference. Indeed, such a congress did take place. Now, having \"united Moscow and Petrograd\", the RKP is prepared to engage in joint efforts against our government. It remains to be seen whether we will be able to provide them with a fitting rebuff."

Despite the fact that this party, following the death of its permanent leader, who believed he was following "the precepts of Ilyich," in every respect, has significantly weakened its standing, becoming more of a cult following, we must not underestimate them and maintain close monitoring of these individuals."

Of particular concern is General Yegorov, a popular figure within the military who initially supported the SRs and was once a member of it. Following the workers' uprising in Petrograd, Yegorov emerged as an active participant in the creation of the new Red Army, clearly claiming the same position that Comrade Trotsky held at the time. In this context, several members of the Politburo have advocated for the necessity of purging the military and the general staff to prevent a potential counter-revolutionary uprising led by a popular military leader. However, at present, our government remains fragile, and there exists a lack of unity within the party.

Furthemore, he was supported by Sergey Kirov - a moderate Bolshevik from Bukharin's own camp.\n\nIn collaboration with his accomplices, including Vladimir Trutovsky, the head of the revolutionary headquarters for the Left SR Party, and Sergey Kirov, Yegorov succeeded in seizing control of the country and establishing a dictatorial regime. With the support of loyal Red Guard members and sympathizers within the [GetChekaName], he detained our government and declared the restoration of the constitutional order. Nonetheless, not all parties embraced this putsch.

The Mensheviks and all Bolshevik associates were horrified to discover that their worst fears had come to pass once again. The Left SRs, now holding a majority in the Soviets, have declared the dictatorship of the proletariat, effectively ruling through the dictatorship of their party.\n\nFrom the pages of the newspapers, Spiridonova proclaimed a struggle against the revisionists who had engaged in significant ideological disagreements with the government, effectively going to war against the people's representatives. Having secured a majority within the Central Committee, the party declared its refusal to collaborate with the petty bourgeois parties, demanding their surrender of their seats.\n\nDescribing this as nothing less than a coup d'état, the opposition parties vowed immediate resistance. However, as it transpired, the military was not prepared to support the opposition.\n\nPerhaps the only significant challenge at present is the strike action initiated by certain enterprises that have been supported by workers aligned with the opposition and minor peasant unrest in pro-Bolshevik regions. However, there is no doubt that these problems will soon come to an end."

He was also supported by the Workers' Group of Aleksandr Shlyapnikov.\n\nKirov declared that the decisions of the government were unconstitutional and that the fruits of the Revolution belonged rightfully to the entire Popular Front, not merely to Bukharin's faction. In this context, Kirov initiated the establishment of an opposition bloc. While it appears that this endeavor is destined for failure, it is possible that military figures aligned with the left SRs, such as Aleksandr Yegorov, Mikhail Levandovsky, and Yuri Sablin, are supporting Kirov's cause. Oppositional parties, particularly the Menshevik internationalists, have expressed their backing for Kirov's position as well."

The resignation, however, has triggered a fierce power struggle among the nation's top military figures. Many eyes turn toward the formidable General Zhukov, a rising star in the Red Army, as a potential successor. Supporters of Zhukov see him as a beacon of hope and a symbol of the future's promise.\n\nHowever, the echoes of the First Civil War resound in the halls of power, with seasoned veterans of that era stepping forward to stake their claims. Both Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Mikhail Frunze, despite their twenty-year exile, have cast long shadows within the General Staff. Their experiences and historical significance have garnered them respect and support from various quarters. The three factions - those aligned with Zhukov, Tukhachevsky, and Frunze - have embarked on an intense political maneuvering that threatens to plunge the [ROOT.GetName] into a new era of turmoil. Reports from Moscow and beyond remain unconfirmed, but a shadowy faction within the Soviet Army has made a brazen move.

russoc.102.d: "The party has come to be divided between three factions, one led by Bukharin, one by Kollontay and one by Radek. The one by Bukharin champions a path of socialism at a snail's pace, where cautious industrialisation prevents the creation of a massive state bureaucracy as well as wanting to preserve the smychka at all costs and wanting to bridge the general urban-rural divide in the country.\n\nThe faction lead by Kollontay promotes the unions managing the economy, seeing them as the best way to give workers a voice in the economy and the nation. They also are very opposed to the perceived influence of the peasants and thus want to break-up the smychka strongly, supporting the further workerisation of the party.\n\nLast but not least, the faction lead by Radek supports the idea of primitive socialist accumulation, that is to extract the peasant surplus value and to use this to develop the productive forces to transition to make Russia ready for socialism, which is best developed in their mind through five-year plan."

russoc.105.d: "For years, the course of events during the October Revolution have been a mystery to the world and the general population. The White forces and the Republic they founded made sure to paint the Bolshevik uprising in a negative light, many of the witnesses of the events died in the Civil War, and those who survived were unable to spread the word. Now that the socialist revolution has won in Russia, however, the seven volume memoirs of Nikolai N. Sukhanov, the most comprehensive account of the Revolution available, has been published in Moscow. Sukhanov, a member of the Petrograd Soviet, composed the memoirs in exile, but was unable to release them until today.\n\nThe Memoirs of the Revolution tell the story of the October Revolution from 1917 to its defeat in 1920, and destroy many of the myths which have been perpetuated about its events. For years, the fate of Leon Trotsky, one of the main leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the chief of the Red Army, was a mystery, as unlike the other revolutionaries such as Lenin, his death was never fully confirmed. Sukhanov asserts that Trotsky is dead, however - he perished in an artillery barrage at the last days of the Civil War. His account of Trotsky is a lot more flattering than street knowledge in Moscow, too - White propaganda painted Trotsky as a terrible leader who sacrificed thousands of men in failed offensives, and this perception has since become accepted fact, but Sukhanov describes him as competent and capable, if arrogant and conflicting. The exile states that Trotsky is not to blame for the Bolshevik defeat, foreign intervention and Lenin's death at Fanny Kaplan's hands is.\n\nThe Memoirs have since become commonplace in Russian elementary schools and universities as mandatory learning material for the new generation. They shall learn about the heroism of the original Bolsheviks and their struggle for the rights of the people."

russoc.106.d: "The government's program of mass collectivization, seeing it as necessary to obtain the grain necessary to industrialize in the fashion that the government sees as necessary, has been generally disliked by the peasant masses. Some have even evoked the program of collectivization to the Tsarist time, seeing it as a return of the time as serfdoms, which is rooted in the issue that collective farms (kolkhozs) do not even pay their farmer a formal wage. Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivized, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivization of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivization and has generally destablized our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialize the nation."

However, while curbing their cultural influence will take out longer, the government has begun eroding the influence of the Orthodox Church legally.\n\nThe [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government has begun measures to take away the control and forming of marriages away from the Church and making it a civil affair of the government, they also greatly simplified divorce, where it is now a simple matter of registration, instead of the former hard process in Tsarist and Republican Russia.\n\nHowever, while this has greatly improved the mobility of women to leave abusive families, it also resulted in a massive spike of divorce rates on a level never seen before, with the divorce rate being the highest in the world now, thanks to divorce being this easy now."

However, the full undertaking of Latinisation of all languages in Russia will take a long time, considering the amount of languages there are.\n\nThus the government has begun the Latinisation of the alphabets of the many, many languages which are spoken in the land compromising this nations. The move is spearheaded by the Commissar of Enlightenment, Anatoliy Lunacharsky, who is known for his more unorthodox opinions, like his opinion that scientific socialism is the deification of humanity, saying that socialists were the most religious groups."

While we are not yet able to integrate a majority of the youth into the pioneer organization, we have already been able to have 1 in 5 children be members of the young pioneers.\n\nThe routine of the young pioneers consist of a lot of marching and singing, gymnastics and sport. Young pioneers also have their own uniform - a white shirt and red scarf -, banners, flags and songs; which has given the young pioneers a great amount of popularity among the youth, as it gives many in the youth, who feel alone and atomised some feeling of belonging in the world."

russoc.121.t: "Death of Bukharin"
russoc.121.d: "The leader of the [GetRadSocParty], Nikolay Bukharin has passed away in his house in Moscow. He was one of the symbols of the new Soviet state. The Soviet people will remember Bukharin and his great deeds forever. His duties will be carried out by the Supreme Soviet until the general elections next year. Supreme Soviet has decided to build a Mausoleum in his honour which will be situated in the Red Square, and consist of a big tower, crowned with a sculpture of Bukharin, to glorify their friend and comrade."
russoc.121.a: "Goodbye, Nikolai. You can now rest."

russoc.122.t: "Echoes of the Red Harbin"
russoc.122.d: "One of the new arrivals at the recent congress of the [GetRadSocParty]'s Moscow Committee was Martemyan Ryutin. He is a true Bolshevik, having served as chairman of the Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in Harbin, Manchuria in 1917. However, the uprising in the city was unsuccessful, forcing Ryutin to flee to Irkutsk.\n\nFollowing the civil war, Ryutin remained in relative obscurity for an extended period, joining the ranks of the SR–Bolshevik People's Revolutionary Army (NRA), which operated within Transbaikalia and the Far-Eastern regions. Despite Zhang Zuolin's continued opposition to socialists within his domain, the so-called "Red Emigration" was still able to establish itself in Harbin, albeit clandestinely.\n\nThe \"Red Harbin\" posed a significant challenge to Kolchak, the Japanese and the Chinese, hindering their operations for an extended duration. Nevertheless, it proved elusive to fully eradicate the NRA from its influence.\n\nFollowing the transition of power in Russia to the Soviets, Ryutin departed Harbin and returned to his homeland as a representative of the Bolshevik faction within the NRA, assuming a position in the Moscow Committee of the [GetRadSocParty]'s propaganda department. Similar to many other prominent figures within the Moscow Bolshevist circle, Ryutin swiftly aligned himself with the prevailing current, actively endorsing Bukharin's policy of NEP."
russoc.122.a: "Interesting."

russoc.123.t: "Young Economist"
russoc.123.d: "In the past, a minister who was too young might have been viewed with suspicion or deemed inexperienced for a position of leadership. With the establishment of the Soviet state, however, these concerns can be safely set aside - now, anyone can advance to the pinnacle of their career based on their abilities. One such young reformer is Aleksei Kosygin, a youthful cooperator from Petrograd who rose to significant heights in administrative roles during the implementation of the New Economic Policy. Prior to fully committing himself to the cause of socialism, Kosygin, as an unaffiliated but clearly sympathetic to the [ROOT.GetRulingParty], worked within the Novosibirsk Union of Consumer Societies under the rule of Kerensky.\n\nIn 1935, after graduating from an institute in Petrograd, Kosygin was now eligible to pursue leadership positions. Shortly after the Revolution, Kosygin, then the head of a workshop at a textile mill, was promoted to director, and subsequently, on the recommendation of the Petrograd Party leadership, he was appointed Commissar of Light Industry. In this role, he established himself as a staunch supporter of the New Economic Policy and of Bukharin, aspiring to lead the Party in Petrograd.\n\nKosygin consistently advocated that the NEP was ideal for Russia, and its preservation was a boon for the nation. He further sought to expand the system, despite criticism from some Party members who viewed him as a revisionist. His ideas resonated with Soviet citizens, particularly in Petrograd, where they appeared particularly appealing. Bukharin proposed that Kosygin be elevated to the Politburo due to his unwavering commitment to the cause and his proletarian background."
russoc.123.a: "We must rejuvenate the Politburo!"
russoc.123.b: "Not every People's Commissar should be included in the Politburo."

russoc.124.t: "National-Syndicalist Faction"
russoc.124.d: "Shortly after Bukharin's death, it became known about the creation of a faction of national syndicalists within the [GetRadSocParty], led by Aleksey Kuznetsov, a young politician who joined the [GetRadSocParty] in 1930. Considering themselves opponents of the NEP and ideological successors of the Rykov and Tomsky cause, the national syndicalists seek to combine centralism and syndicalism, and also, most importantly, to disband the Union, which, in their opinion, should not have existed. In addition, they demand to abandon the Soviet system and switch to the Western model of trade unions as real representatives of the working class. Having criticized Ryutin and Kosygin, the national syndicalists accused them of betraying Russia's national interests."
russoc.124.a: "A dangerous movement."

russoc.125.t: "[GetYear] [GetRadSocParty] Chairman Elections"
russoc.125.d: "The time has come to elect the new chairman after the death of Nikolay Bukharin. There are currently several factions struggling for power, notably: Kosygin's Bukharinists, Ryutin's True Leninists and Kuznetsov's National Syndicalists."
russoc.125.a: "We should continue with Bukharin's legacy: Kosygin!"

russoc.126.t: "Congress of Labor Collectives"
russoc.126.d: "The Congress of Fabkoms (Factory Committees) or Labor Collectives is to be held in Moscow and unite all the syndicates, recently established in the republic. It shall become the first Congress of such kind and it shall now navigate our economy instead of the Congress of Soviets. Similar to the French Commune system, the Congress of Labor Collectives will be elected only by the workers from the trade unions of all level."
russoc.126.a: "Towards workers' democracy!"

russoc.127.t: "Amnesty"
russoc.127.d: "Today, many of the prisoners of the regime were pardoned by the government. Most of them included the politicians and activists of liberal and bourgeois parties, as well as the Right SR members, like Avksentiev and Chernov. The radical anti-socialists and monarchists, at the same time are still under arrest or imprisoned. The decision was made in order to show that the new revolutionary government won't oppress its opponents by taking away their freedom. Despite that the parties are still banned, the Right SR members were allowed to re-join the new PSR party and take part in politics for the good of peasants and workers."
russoc.127.a: "That would be fair."

russoc.128.t: "On the Cult of Capital and Its Consequences"
russoc.128.d: "Comrades, in the report of the Central Committee of the Party, and in a number of speeches held by delegates to the Congress, quite a lot has been said about the Cult of Capital and about its harmful consequences. Comrade Andrei Zhdanov has reminded us how severely the classics of Bolshevik-Leninism denounced every manifestation of this Cult of Capital, and with the genius of the Revolution that is Comrade Zhdanov at our helm, we shall make it our mission to eradicate this caustic and decaying force.\n\nCiting that Comrade Nikolay Bukharin and his crypto-capitalist allies as the main source of this corrosive cult, Comrade Zhdanov has declared these sycophants to the damaging New Economic Policy to be traitors to the Revolution, with their revisionist acts being tantamount to national betrayal. Their influence must be thoroughly eradicated so that the wider Union can be secured, and Comrade Zhdanov knows just the way to do so without crippling the State. Through mass centralization, close adherence to Party doctrine and proven ideology and theory as dictated by Comrades Lenin, Rykov, and himself, and through the complete dismantling of the NEP along with the expulsion of its proprietors and supporters, the Nation, the State, the Party, and the People shall all know security and prosperity under a truly red dawn. We are absolutely certain that our Party, armed with the historical resolutions of Comrade Zhdanov, will lead the Soviet people along the Bolshevik-Leninist path to new successes and to new victories!"
russoc.128.a: "Long live the victorious banner of our party - Leninism-Rykovism-Zhdanovism!"

russoc.129.t: "The Downfall of Comrade Malenkov"
russoc.129.d: "As Chairman Zhdanov progresses the Party and the State towards our new future tied inexorably to total ideological devotion, anti-technocratic and anti-moderate tensions have exploded in recent months as Zhdanov's own views against these groups leak into wider public consciousness. Major cities such as Tstentrograd face large riots and protests against these so-called crypto-capitalist traitors, and what was once to be handled internally has now devolved into a very public scene.\n\nSeeking to quell the unrest and boost his popularity and support while simultaneously eliminating his largest source of detractors and potential obstacles to his plans of centralization, Chairman Zhdanov has publicly proclaimed all enemies to his faction to be traitors to the State. These detractors, centered around Zhdanov's most fervent rival Comrade Georgy Malenkov, as well as the Techno-Pragmatist whelps, are to be expelled from all government positions or any other seat of power and influenced, reduced to common citizens and forced into secluded early ‘retirements.' In one fell swoop, Zhdanov has easily been able to legally eliminate most of his political rivals, all with the support of the people, allowing him free reign to reform the State as he saw fit. However, the chaos would not stop for all, for fate had more in store for poor Comrade Malenkov.\n\nExpelled from all public posts and forced into obscurity, Georgy Malenkov had fallen from grace. Once one of the most senior party officials, Malenkov was now reduced to practical imprisonment to a State-provided dacha just a few miles outside his hometown of Orenburg, and it is here - so close to the place of his birth - where Malenkov would meet his final and pitiable end. Eating his buckwheat porridge, blinis, and syrniki with warm Russian tea in the morning air, a single shot rang out from the treeline just a few yards from his patio. Without a whimper or fuss, without commotion, drama, or gravitas, Malenkov slumped back in his lounge chair, lifeless as he bled rapidly from a rifle wound to the neck. Newspapers would pick up the story shortly, with rumors circulating that some lone radical or perhaps a [GetChekaName] agent carried out the hit. However, an investigation would never be held, for the State and its new direction did not care - or perhaps already knew. Malenkov represented a pragmatic and compromising past that has no place in our new Union, and for that, he shall be forgotten to history as we march forth into our Soviet future."
russoc.129.a: "Do not shed a tear for poor Malenkov, for there is better history to be made!"

russoc.130.t: "Relentless Drive Towards Sovietification"
russoc.130.d: "With the policy of Sovietification among ethnic Russians themselves well under way, the time soon came for various minorities scattered around the nation to partake in this new cultural revolution as well. Their choice was simple: either renounce the imperialist errors that cling to the backwards idea of 'ethnicity', or deal with the consequences of being stuck in the tsarist past.\n\nWhile most realized the foolishness of their old ways and joined the greatest collective ever known to man - the Soviet identity - some foolishly refused. Those who refused this new glorious destiny were transported to special Sovietification education centers, located across the farthest reaches of the State. The main critics and detractors of our government say that these centers are nothing more than brutal labor camps meant to break the spirit of innocent people who don't follow the party line, but that is nothing more than venomous slander spat out by nationalist madmen and former russificators themselves, all afraid of Great Russian chauvinism disappearing forever. Regardless, their numbers are small, and our republic only grows more centralized, united, and cohesive with every soul reeducated or inducted into this new society. We alone know the true path forward, and we shall show it to all within the State!"
russoc.130.a: "We shall not rest until the superstition of 'ethnicity' itself is swept away!"

russoc.131.t: "Alcohol Declared 'Capitalist Debauchery'"
russoc.131.d: "For far too long, alcoholism has been the greatest vice and sin afflicting the Russian, and now the Soviet, people. From the first vodka plants operated by the Tsars to keep us permanently drunk, stupid, and distracted to the rise of mass-scaled production with the advent of modern Capitalism, alcohol has been a plague for centuries.\n\nWith this in mind, Zhdanov himself has put down the bottle as the first step in a plan to totally rid our union of this liquid sin. Alcohol in all forms is to be declared nothing more than ‘Capitalist Debauchery', fully outlawing alcohol production and consumption while also making it illegal to keep any alcohol in the home or on your person without permission. The only allowed alcohols shall be certain wines and spirits for culinary and other cultural uses, and will be heavily controlled by the State to ensure there is no abuse of this new law. Additionally, new water bottling plants shall replace the old vodka factories in order to provide the Soviet people with good, wholesome drink that is not a detriment to their physical and mental health, with distribution centers rising in every major city.\n\nThis has led to some pushback, but also a resurgence in other cultural drinks of our people, such as Russian Tea which has exploded in popularity once again as people jump from alcohol to caffeine to curb their addictions. With samovars being a common sight in Soviet households around the nation, Zhdanov is sure that this alcohol-ban is here to stay."
russoc.131.a: "No longer shall our nation be a land of drunks and wastrels."

russoc.132.t: "Cementing the Cult of Rykov?"
russoc.132.d: "A devoted follower of the late Rykov and his principles, Premier Zhdanov has long felt it fitting to honor his former mentor and friend. Before him lies two plans for how to honor the great Rykov.\n\nThe first plan is opulent and grandiose, but still far from gaudy, and revolves around the expansion of Rykov's cult of personality, with new statues, shrines, and other small offerings and homages to the great Rykov being built all across the State. From the smallest towns to the largest metropolises, everywhere you go, Rykov's face shall be there, shining his wisdom down onto any onlooker. Though this plan is expansive, it pales in comparison to the alternative.\n\nThe second plan is to not only build these statues and shrines across our Union, but to also build a monumentally-large mausoleum in the heart of the capital in order to permanently house Rykov and other Heroes of the Union once they finally pass. This mausoleum would be one of the largest buildings in the Union, scraping the heavens with its marble spinnerets while decorated in the most extravagant decorations our State can muster, with the beloved Rykov entombed inside a glass sarcophagus for all Soviet citizens to witness. Though some see this as idolatry and borderline dogma, with many critics stating it would overshadow Lenin's legacy and be a huge waste of resources while also inching far too close to religion or spirituality, Premier Zhdanov has assured these warry minds that this is what Rykov and Lenin would have truly wanted. The final choice however, lies solely on Zhdanov's shoulders, so how should we honor the great Rykov?"
russoc.132.a: "Rykov shall not know true rest until his mausoleum touches the heavens!"
russoc.132.b: "New statues and shrines shall be enough to honor the great Rykov."

russoc.133.t: "The Forgotten Commission"
russoc.133.d: "During our reorganization efforts as we work to centralize the state and prepare Moscow for new development, it was discovered that there was a committee from the original revolution that has been entirely forgotten about - the Commission on Road Paving. A bit of a strange group, it has been deduced that this group once sought to not only modernize the infrastructure network of old Russia, but to also work towards the total urbanization of our capital region as a whole. Their highly ambitious plan would take decades at the least and would cost untold billions, but the prospect of controlling the largest, most advanced, most well-planned city in history is almost too good an opportunity to pass up.\n\nWe can either resign this forgotten commission to the pages of history, condemning them to be forgotten fully as the madmen they were, or we can humor this old plan, establishing the Central Commission of Urban Development and tasking them to slowly transform Tstentrograd into the largest urban center ever known or even attempted. If they are successful, Tstentrograd will one day come to span across every square mile of our great State, but until then, this will largely be a job-creating money sink. What shall be our final decision?"
russoc.133.a: "They are nothing but fools and madmen, disband the Commission at once!"
russoc.133.b: "Perhaps they are onto something. Our metropolis shall span from coast to coast, pole to pole!"

russoc.134.t: "Mariupol, the City of Music"
russoc.134.d: "Premier Zhdanov has always been a patron of the fine arts. From childhood as a boy in Mariupol, Zhdanov loved to play piano, compose music, and listen to the classics on the radio or on old wax pressings. Now, with Zhdanov rising from that mere boy to become the leader of our glorious new Union, this love of music has not left our Premier, and with his newfound power and with his home city of Mariupol now finally back within Soviet hands, perhaps something can be done to pay homage to this legacy.\n\nA plan has been drafted to construct a massive and ornate concert hall in the city, built in the newly popularized Soviet Realism style, so that Mariupol may truly become the Soviet capital of music and composition. Furthermore, the concert hall shall serve as a gathering space and workshop for our Union's most popular and beloved musicians and composers so that these fine artists may have a place to work on their masterpieces in peace in the company of other geniuses of their ilk. The plan has been supported heavily by Zhadanov himself, but many of his most dedicated supporters wish to take it a step further, renaming Maripol to be named after Zhdanov himself as a final and ultimate homage to our beloved Premier. Though a name change is not necessary to the completion of the concert hall, perhaps it would be good to cement Zhdanov's lasting legacy."
russoc.134.a: "Mariupol shall become the heartland of new Soviet music!"

russoc.135.t: "A New Soviet Language?"
russoc.135.d: "Under the rule of Rykov, the Russian language was encouraged to be used, but was not mandatory in any sense, for his Union was open to all children of the lands of Rus regardless of their actual ethnicity, as long as they were devoted to the Soviet cause. This plan, while flexible and successful so far, leaves much to be desired in the mind of Zhdanov, who seeks to fully eradicate the modern Russian language in favor of a new shared Soviet tongue. Zhdanov and his allies have two main ideas on how this new Soviet Language could be formed.\n\nThe first plan, far less far-reaching of the two, is to transliterate Russian into the Latin alphabet before making it mandatory for all Soviet citizens to use as the one accepted language. Despite the relative ease of this plan compared to Zhdanov's other idea, it would likely greatly anger any non-Russian speaker in the nation. Alternatively, Zhdanov's more wide-sweeping plan is to combine the many languages of old Russia into one cohesive language based around a Russian foundation, then transliterating it to the Latin alphabet before making it the one accepted language for all Soviet citizens. Though this plan would require far more effort, it would also include aspects of all Soviet groups, creating a truly comprehensive and inclusive Soviet language for all in the State to use without playing favorites with any one group. However, both of these ideas require great effort and fly in the face of the late Rykov's dream, so the debate around this move has been fierce to say the least. In the end, it is up to Premier Zhdanov to decide the fate of Soviet language."
russoc.135.a: "Create a new Soviet language combining Latin script with Russian and other pre-Soviet tongues."
russoc.135.b: "Simply convert Russian to the Latin alphabet and make it mandatory for all Soviet citizens."
russoc.135.c: "Keep true to Rykov's voluntary language program."

### New flavour events ###
russoc.136.t: "The Shot Heard Across Time"
russoc.136.d: "Isaak Steinberg, a prominent figure within the PLSR and a leader of its Legalist wing, penned a compelling biography delving into the extraordinary life of Maria Spiridonova, the party's charismatic chairwoman. The narrative traces Spiridonova's journey from her tumultuous years as a convict to her pivotal role as the leader of revolutionary Russia. Maria's fearless critiques of authority became apparent during her studies at the Tambov Women's Gymnasium. Despite frequent clashes with teachers and numerous scandals, Spiridonova managed to graduate in 1902. Financial hardships led her to work as a clerk in the provincial noble assembly, where her remarkable oratory skills caught the attention of local Socialist-Revolutionaries. Recognizing her potential as an eloquent leader, she soon joined the party's Combat Squads. Maria's fiery gaze and compelling oratory became her trademark, earning her a reputation in numerous party meetings and protest demonstrations. Her activism resulted in her first arrest in the spring of 1905, an experience that convinced Spiridonova of the need for more radical methods to achieve their goals.\n\nIn 1906, the Socialist-Revolutionary Committee faced the task of eliminating Gavriil Luzhenovsky, an adviser to the Tambov provincial government known for his brutality. Spiridonova volunteered for the task and, after meticulous planning, confronted Luzhenovsky on the streets, firing several shots at him. The aftermath remains shrouded in conflicting accounts, with some suggesting Spiridonova contemplated suicide, while others describe her pacing back and forth, exclaiming, \"I killed him! I killed him!\"\n\nThis pivotal event marked a turning point in Spiridonova's life, leading to over a decade of imprisonment until her amnesty by the Provisional Government in 1917. Subsequently, Maria actively participated in the Bolshevik Putsch, aligning herself with the Bolsheviks. However, her alliance with the Bolsheviks was not without its pitfalls, as both the bureaucratic nature of the party and the right-wing SRs posed challenges. As the second revolution unfolded, Maria Alexandrovna's socialist utopian ideals triumphed, witnessing the collapse of Russian capitalism and the realization of her revolutionary aspirations."
russoc.136.a: "She's the great example for all of us"

russoc.137.t: "The Women's Department of the PLSR"
russoc.137.d: "Under the Left Socialist Revolutionary rule, a series of laws were enacted to safeguard the rights of women, ushering in a new era of expanded rights within the family. In a progressive move, the government now announces the establishment of the Women's Department of the Party. This crucial initiative will be led by Irina Kakhovskaya, a trusted ally of Maria Spiridonova and a dedicated Social Revolutionary. The Women's Department is entrusted with a multifaceted agenda, including organizing women's rallies, conferences, and delegate meetings. Its scope extends to childcare, support for the homeless, school inspections, and the distribution of food and housing. This comprehensive approach aims to significantly enhance the well-being of Soviet women and children, fostering improvements within Soviet families at large."
russoc.137.a: "Glory to our women!"

russoc.138.t: "Defending Centralism"
russoc.138.d: "As Comrade Rykov spearheads the new doctrine, aiming to centralize the country and dissolve the national autonomies within Russia, a wave of false rumors inundates the political landscape. In response, the Bolsheviks in exile, under the leadership of Zinoviev, issued an open proclamation accusing Rykov of betraying internationalist ideals and harboring crypto-Russian chauvinism. They brand him an imitator of Western European national-syndicalists and a xenophobe. However, these accusations are baseless and unfounded, mere echoes from a group of alleged traitors and Western agents who seek to undermine Lenin's accomplishments. Rykov's commitment to centralism stands in stark contrast to the allegations, and his vision aligns with the principles laid down by Lenin."
russoc.138.a: "Nonsense!"

russoc.139.t: "Comrade Zhdanov"
russoc.139.d: "Andrei Zhdanov, a relatively obscure revolutionary who aligned himself with Bukharin and Rykov during the post-war period, emerged as one of the staunchest Bolsheviks within the [247.GetName] governorate during the course of his service. Following the triumph of our party, Zhdanov ascended the ranks as a proponent of the New Economic Policy, ultimately becoming a confidant of Aleksey Rykov.\n\nOn Rykov's recommendation, Zhdanov was dispatched to engage in party work in [252.GetName], where he assumed leadership of the propaganda department. He further proposed to Rykov that, as part of regional industrialization, substantial investments be made in the automotive sector, aimed at establishing a production line for civilian automobiles, in collaboration with Ford. The initiative involved leveraging the existing automobile factory, which had been constructed several years prior in partnership with the Americans. Speculation suggests that Zhdanov may have secured a concession for Ford, although the details of this arrangement remain unclear.\n\nHowever, Zhdanov's contributions extended beyond this initiative. As head of agitprop, he spearheaded the extensive promotion of Russian language and culture as a basis for the potential unification of the non-Russian nations with the great Russian people into a unified Soviet entity. During this brief period, Zhdanov has achieved remarkable success and been elected to the Central Committee at the [GetPreviousBolshevikPartyCongressNumber] Congress. Now, at Rykov's instigation, he is endeavouring to secure his place under the sun - in the Central Committee of the Party."
russoc.139.d2: "Once a mere name among the regional cadre, Andrei Zhdanov has, with quiet discipline and unwavering ideological clarity, stepped onto the broader stage of Soviet politics. Long a disciplined regional organizer and voice for central unity, has been quietly promoted to the Central Committee - his ascent guided in no small part by the confidence of Executive Secretary Sergey Chutskayev.\n\nThough lacking the charismatic radicalism of the old guard, Zhdanov's political instincts are sharp. His consistent emphasis on linguistic and cultural consolidation around the Russian identity has been interpreted as an ideological complement to the Molotovite line of "Socialism in One State" - a tool for drawing borders not only on maps but in hearts and minds.\n\nWhile officially a neutral functionary, Zhdanov's appointment signals a deeper truth: the Secretariat under Chutskayev is shaping the Central Committee in its image - pragmatic, orthodox, and ever watchful of deviation."
russoc.139.d3: "Once a mere name among the regional cadre, Andrei Zhdanov has, with quiet discipline and unwavering ideological clarity, stepped onto the broader stage of Soviet politics. His work in [247.GetName] and [252.GetName] has attracted the attention of the Secretariat, particularly for his tireless promotion of a unifying proletarian identity rooted in Russian language and culture - not as chauvinism, but as a rallying thread for the many peoples of the Soviet East.\n\nNow, under the watchful eye of the Executive Secretary, Zhdanov has been elevated to a full member of the Central Committee. Though his role is still without a formal portfolio, observers note his proximity to the ideological apparatus and agitprop departments - a sign of possible future responsibilities.\n\nAmong Zinoviev's allies, Zhdanov is seen as a functionary of discipline and vision: a man who may help weave together the ideological narrative that can hold the country and its periphery intact, not by coercion but by belief. Others, however, whisper about the dangers of concentrating too much cultural power in one man's hands."

russoc.140.d: "Volsky, the chairman of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, has authored and published a manifesto titled \"The Program and Tactics of the Socialist-Revolutionaries.\" Originally penned in the autumn of 1917, the updated version of the pamphlet represents a comprehensive reevaluation of the party's ideology, discarding the bourgeois-democratic foundations laid by Chernov and Avksentiev.\n\nIn this revised publication, Volsky advocates for the imperative to combat the bourgeois capitalist system, emphasizing the goals of building democratic socialism and a welfare state. Notably, he vehemently rejects any inclination towards opportunism or collaboration with bourgeois parties, particularly the Kadets or the right Mensheviks. Simultaneously, Volsky does not spare criticism for the Bolsheviks, viewing Lenin's Russia as a state-capitalist formation devoid of authentic socialist principles. The manifesto marks a significant shift in the ideological landscape of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party."

russoc.141.d: "\"Notes on the Revolution,\" penned by N.N. Sukhanov, stands as a venerable source offering profound insights into the history of the revolutionary movement in Petrograd during 1917 and the unfolding of the civil war from 1917 to 1920. Beyond its comprehensive coverage of major events, these memoirs delve into lesser-known facets of the behind-the-scenes dynamics of petty-bourgeois parties, delivering witty characterizations of political figures and offering curious observations on the life, morals, and psychology of the era's populace. Sukhanov provides a detailed account of the fate of Bolshevik Party leaders, chronicling the party's fracture following Lenin's demise and its ultimate collapse in 1920.

The congress delved into pivotal issues, including the fortification of labor legislation, amplifying the role of trade union organizations in the nation's political landscape, and contemplating the complete separation of trade unions from the party.\n\nKey figures such as Alexander Shlyapnikov and Alexandra Kollontai, alongside other luminaries in the trade union movements, actively participated in the congress. The inaugural event proved a success, laying the groundwork for subsequent discussions. Anticipations run high for the forthcoming second congress scheduled a year later."

russoc.143.d: "Director Friedrich Ermler brings to life the remarkable journey of Premier Sergei Kirov in the film \"Great Civilian.\" The cinematic masterpiece unravels Kirov's arduous life path, tracing his political evolution from the early days with the RSDRP in 1904, active involvement in the October Revolution and Civil War, to his pivotal role in leading the People's Socialist Party after parting ways with the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe film sheds light on Kirov's commitment to political collaboration across party lines, exemplified by his work with the Kadet Party in 1909, contributing to the North Caucasian newspaper \"Terek\" under the alias Sergei Mironov. It further explores Kirov's post-Civil War alliance with the Menshevik Party, reflecting his shift towards a more moderate stance on socialism and democracy. Delving into Kirov's personal qualities, actor Nikolai Bogolyubov captures the essence of the Premier's character. \"Great Civilian\" has garnered widespread acclaim from citizens, earning prestigious state awards for its compelling portrayal of Sergei Kirov's life and political journey."

While opponents of the 'People's Premier' have decried it as a meaningless term with no substance, according to them much alike Nikolay Bukharin's eclectic menagerie of the New Economic Policy, the die-hard supporters of Sergei Kirov were quick to accept the truth of the matter. For the Democratic Doctrine is a fresh start for our Socialist Republic, a true beginning of not the dictatorship, but the democracy of the proletariat. With his mesmerizing charisma Premier Kirov managed to unite a wide coalition of Mensheviks, Centre-Left SRs and even a portion of the Left Kadets into one block willing to support the continuing establishment of a truly visionary and democratic system for Russia and beyond. With the unending devotion of his people and the political capital with endless supply, Sergei Kirov can turn the party into whatever he wills, thus making the government embrace a great humanitarian face.

Wearing it everywhere, she became known as Little Red Riding Hood. One day, her mother entrusted her with the task of visiting her grandmother, bearing pies and butter and inquiring about her health. Undaunted by the dense forest that lay ahead, Little Red Riding Hood embarked on her journey. Along the way, she encountered the Wolf, who inquired about her haste. Little Red Riding Hood candidly shared her mission, unaware of the Wolf's sinister intentions. Seizing the opportunity, the Wolf raced to the grandmother's house, devoured her, and assumed her place in bed, lying in wait for Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nWhen the girl arrived and knocked on the door, the Wolf, imitating the grandmother's voice, invited her inside. Unaware of the deception, Little Red Riding Hood noticed the peculiar size of her \"grandmother's\" eyes, hands, ears, and teeth. It was only when the Wolf attacked and swallowed her that she realized the danger. Fortunately, lumberjacks nearby heard the commotion, rushed to the scene, and, with swift action, rescued the grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood by tearing open the Wolf's belly.

russoc.146.d: "\"The ABC of Communism\" (Azbuka Kommunizma) originally penned in 1919 by Nikolay Bukharin and Evgeniy Preobrazhensky, underwent a significant transformation in its recent republication. Initially conceived as a communist primer for the largely uneducated population, particularly the peasantry, the book served as a guide to elucidate the foundational concepts of communism and Marxism in accessible language. It functioned as a methodological handbook for the burgeoning members of communist and socialist parties.\n\nHowever, in its revised edition, personally curated by Bukharin, the text has undergone substantial changes. Gone are any references to the imperative Red Terror, the era of war communism, and the advocacy for a planned economy enforced by communists. The updated version now explores the potential for a market system within a socialist framework. Notably, it aligns with Bukharin's economic program, the \"New Economic Policy (NEP).\"\n\nWitness the evolution of communist thought in this revised ABC, tailored for a changing era and reflective of a more nuanced approach to socialist ideals."

russoc.147.d: "Vyacheslav Molotov, the chairman of the Russian Communist Party of National Bolsheviks, took the stage in front of the Kremlin, delivering a powerful address to thousands gathered. In his solemn speech, Molotov sought to elucidate the true essence of the Soviet state's new ideology - National Bolshevism.\n\nMolotov declared that National Bolshevism is not a novel phenomenon for their Communist Party but a lineage rooted in the ideology of Vladimir Lenin. According to Molotov, Lenin was the inaugural National Bolshevik who spearheaded a national liberation revolution against British, German, and French exploiters that had subjugated the Russian people for over two centuries. Lenin's triumph over capitalism, marked by the nationalization of bourgeois property, severed ties with an elite that had long forsaken any connection with the Russian people. Delving into history, Molotov asserted that landlords and bourgeois, disdainful of all things Russian, oppressed peasants and workers, viewing them as second-class citizens. The Bolshevik Party's struggle against foreign invaders found support among the Russian people and other ethnicities within Russia. Molotov recounted Lenin's pivotal decree, \"The socialist Fatherland is in danger,\" issued during the 1918 offensive against German imperialist forces. The decree rallied support for the Red Army in the face of imperialist aggression. The subsequent victory of the White Guards, Molotov argued, was only possible with the assistance of German imperialists, exposing them as puppets and traitors to Russia.\n\nThe essence of National Bolshevism, Molotov explained, lies in a fervent hatred for the anti-human trinity system: liberalism, bourgeois democracy, and capitalism. The National Bolshevik, a rebel at heart, sees their mission in the complete obliteration of the old system, paving the way for a proletarian and communist society built on the ideals of social and national justice."

russoc.148.d: "In a clandestine meeting held today in Moscow, Comrade Molotov and Red Army commander Mikhail Frunze convened to discuss critical military and political reforms deemed essential for the Soviet state. During the meeting, Frunze presented Molotov with his comprehensive draft, outlining a strategic overhaul. At the core of Frunze's proposals for political reform is the concept of state centralization, embodied in what he termed the \"autonomization plan.\" This plan advocates for a substantial concentration of power within the autonomous republics and regions of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (RSFSR). Frunze contends that, in preparation for an impending conflict with Germany and Japan, a robust centralization of the state is paramount.\n\nCentral to Frunze's vision is the delegation of power within the autonomous republics to members of the Communist Party hailing from the respective nationalities of those regions. The rationale behind this approach is to foster effective governance and local representation, ensuring that the diverse ethnicities within the Soviet state are actively involved in decision-making processes. Molotov, in agreement with Frunze's strategic proposals, has already initiated the process of developing a comprehensive state project to translate these ideas into tangible reforms. The forthcoming implementation of these reforms is poised to reshape the political landscape of the Soviet state, laying the groundwork for a more centralized and strategically prepared nation."

russoc.149.d: "In a momentous address to the Soviet people, the Chairman of the Communist Party, Comrade Krestinsky, delivered a resounding message that echoed the revolutionary spirit of the Bolsheviks. Declaring the continuation of the ongoing revolution, Krestinsky heralded the expulsion of foreign agents, saboteurs, and disruptors from the Communist Party's ranks. Krestinsky emphasized the commitment to constructing genuine socialism, guided by the foundational principles of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. In his impassioned speech, he underscored the supremacy of Bolshevik-Leninism as the only true ideology of socialism, destined to permeate Russia and eventually the world. This ideological stance, according to Krestinsky, is the beacon that will lead the proletarian masses to unparalleled and genuine happiness.\n\nExplicitly rejecting competing ideologies, Krestinsky denounced the petty-bourgeois ideas of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, the revisionism of figures like Bukharin and Western syndicalists, and the bourgeois ideology propagated by Savinkov. The proclamation resounded with the rallying cry, \"Long live the great proletarian Bolshevik party of Lenin-Krestinsky!\" as Krestinsky asserted that only this party could secure unprecedented victories for the people.\n\nThe resolute message concluded with a stark call to arms: \"Death to the revisionists and capitalists!\" Krestinsky's address left an indelible mark, urging the Soviet populace to steadfastly remember the ideological path laid out by the Bolshevik party in pursuit of true socialism."

Recognized as one of Vladimir Lenin's most loyal comrades-in-arms and theoretical students, Dzerzhinsky led the infamous Extraordinary Commission (Cheka), striking terror into the hearts of the bourgeoisie.\n\nDzerzhinsky's unwavering dedication to eliminating counterrevolutionaries and traitors earned him a place as a symbol of Bolshevik resolve. The Cheka, standing alongside the Red Army and the Red Navy, served as a formidable shield protecting Soviet Russia. The tragic passing of \"Iron Felix\" left a void felt deeply by true Bolshevik revolutionaries, none more so than Comrade Blagonravov. To immortalize the memory of Dzerzhinsky, Chairman Blagonravov announced a directive to name villages, towns, and even cities after this great revolutionary. The decision reflects a commitment to preserving and honoring the legacy of Dzerzhinsky as an integral part of the revolutionary narrative.

Her vision extended beyond regional considerations, aiming to unite all peoples of Russia into a singular, inclusive entity. Bryullova-Shaskolskaya's influence continued at the IV Congress, where she championed the reorganization of the party on a federal basis and the consolidation of national socialist parties. Following the revolution of the center-left Socialist Revolutionaries, she spearheaded an ambitious project to unify all peoples of Russia under the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, transcending both Great Russian nationalism and narrow parochialism.

russoc.159.d: "With the failures of Trotsky being painfully apparent to all during the Russian Civil War and the failed revolution, the old face of Communist Internationalism has been forced into a life of exile and disgrace, forever blacklisted from any self-respecting Socialist organization on Earth and formerly forever in hiding and on the run until he met his timely demise while attempting to cross the Bering Sea into Alaska, sinking beneath the frigid waters and icy waves, forever freeing the world from the stench of his failure. However, with his absence, a void was created - a void filled by Osip Aaronovitch Piatnitsky.\n\nBorn under the Tsardom in the Kovno Governorate to Jewish-Lithuanian parents, his original surname was Tarshis before he changed it to the pseudonym Piatnitsky to avoid the Okhrana's purges, coming from the word Piatnitsa, or ‘Friday' - his first Socialist revolutionary group made up of local union workers and tailors in his hometown. From these humble origins, ‘The Man Known as Friday' as he was nicknamed rose to become a true revolutionary, joining Lenin in the Internationalist wing of the RSDRP and rising to the top while running a newspaper in the heart of the Eastern Front during the Great War.\n\nA contemporary of other Internationalists active in Russia such as the great General Tukhachevsky, Piatnitsky has risen to become the political and civilian face of Russian Internationalism, and he has worked hard to clean the image and reputation of his movement and thoughtform from the stain left by the foul failure he replaced. Going so far as to try to entirely erase the term ‘Trotskyism' from the Russian lexicon as an alternative word for Russian International Communism, this new shining red star instead pushes the term Piatniskyism as a suitable replacement. Though he is without much support aside from his friends under the Red Napoleon in the Red Army, Piatnitsky is still a brilliant theorist and another example of a true Socialist patriot here in Russia."

russoc.160.d: "With the advent of the New Economic Policy, a critical issue emerged - namely, the state regulation of prices. Economists express concern that without imposing a monopoly on prices for industrial and agricultural products, there will be a dramatic rise in inflation. Furthermore, in the agricultural sector, a bountiful harvest could potentially lead to a significant drop in prices, negatively impacting the livelihoods of farmers. Additionally, the absence of stable pricing mechanisms could exacerbate inequality and foster social unrest among the wealthier sections of society.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that unstable pricing practices can result in shortages of essential commodities, particularly grains. On the other hand, implementing fixed prices also poses its own challenges. This approach may spark discontent among farmers, potentially leading to a decline in their well-being. Nonetheless, higher prices for manufactured goods could contribute to the revival of our economy and pave the way for the liberation of countries in Eastern Europe."

A precipitous rise in industrial production resulted in an influx of urban residents, while the prices of manufactured goods continued to escalate, leaving agricultural products undervalued. Consequently, the income of peasants diminished, compelling them to prioritize subsistence rather than surplus production.\n\nOpposition calls for decisive action - specifically, an end to market freedoms and the introduction of heavy-handed state intervention."

This approach, which diverges sharply from the views of Bukharin's erstwhile comrades in the Petrograd Bolshevik faction led by Zinoviev, has served as the guiding principle of the newly formed party for several years, and it will continue to be pursued during the period of its leadership.\n\nSimultaneously, workers' enterprises will undergo transformation into socialist entities, with the nationalization of all property owned by industrialists and other capitalists, placing it under the control of workers who will organize their labor in a socialist manner.\n\nDespite this largely \"revisionist\" course, according to the radical communists, Nikolay Bukharin maintained that through a gradual transition, it would be possible to circumvent many of the contradictions that were bound to arise in the event of forced collectivization and the destruction of the peasantry. Bukharin argued that Russia is an agrarian nation, and that party should proceed with the transition to industrial society cautiously, so that the Russian peasant could thrive.\n\nHowever, there was still some resistance to these ideas within the party, particularly from 'old Bolsheviks' like Kamenev and Kirov. Despite the fact that there was still no consensus on the fundamental issue, a new Central Committee and 'Politburo' of the party were nonetheless elected. The Congress also discussed the question of the party's name, which had been forced to operate under various aliases in order to take part in unfair bourgeois elections all this time.

Having secured a majority within the Central Committee, the party declared its refusal to collaborate with the petty bourgeois parties, demanding their surrender of their seats.\n\nDescribing this as nothing less than a coup d'état, the opposition parties vowed immediate resistance. However, as it transpired, the military was not prepared to support them.\n\nTo the surprise of many observers, the opposition was bolstered by some prominent members of the Politburo who expressed their lack of confidence in Bukharin following the 'attempted coup d'état'. In a show of protest, these individuals resigned from their positions, but that was the peak of their demarche.

Alongside Yegorov, several other associates of the SRs were also removed from general staff positions. Thus, the military came under the complete control of the Party.\n\nThe attempts of the SRs to instigate peasant revolts have likewise not been successful, owing to Comrade Bukharin's astute policies in the countryside. Overall, any attempts by opposition groups to disrupt the Soviet state thus far have been futile. Many of these factions, in an effort to distance themselves from counter-revolutionaries, have resigned their seats and aligned with the Soviet government and [ROOT.GetRulingParty]. Many members of the Menshevik faction have also chosen to support the government, although their leadership dissociated themselves from this.

Like many of Sokolnikov's decisions, this one is highly contentious.\n\nMany believe that by accepting money from capitalist sources, we are allowing them to shape our economy according to their own agenda. However, this is far from the truth. Indeed, what could be more advantageous than having the imperialists and capitalists contribute to the socialist state, thereby supporting the very fabric of socialism itself?"

russoc.173.d: "At the personal invitation of Nikolay Bukharin, several individuals affiliated with the Proletkult movement and Aleksandr Boganov's 'Vpered (Forward) group', arrived in Russia from France. Lunacharsky, Bogdanov, and Gastev were among those who arrived at the invitation, aiming to propagate the ideology of Proletarian culture in Russia.\n\nIn conjunction with their arrival, it was determined to allocate financial support for the People's Commissariat for Enlightenment and select one of the 'Proletkultists' to fill this position. Lunacharsky, as a leading expert in Proletarian Culture and having already occupied this role during the Civil War, appeared to be the most suitable candidate. However, another choice is Aleksander Bogdanov, formerly the leader of the Vperedists, and a figure who significantly influenced the development of Bukharin's thinking. Ultimately, the labor unions, under the guidance of Shlyapnikov, advocate for Gastev, a young proletarian, to assume the position of head of the People's Commissariat for Enlightenment, due to his proven expertise in the field and his development of the now renowned method of labor."

russoc.174.d: "The recent decision to vest the VSNKh in the hands of trade unions, with Aleksander Shlyapnikov at the helm, has sparked a wave of criticism directed at Comrade Bukharin. He has been accused of harbouring an \"anarcho-syndicalist\" inclination, and the question of confidence in the chairmanship has been raised. Many party leaders have opposed this decision, including Mikhail Tomsky and Sergey Kirov, who have formed an opposition bloc. Although the Bolsheviks who have joined this bloc may have significant internal differences, they are united in their opposition to the syndicalists who have infiltrated the Central Committee and Politburo - Shlyapnikov, Kollontai, and Bukharin, in particular."
russoc.174.a: "That's serious."

russoc.175.t: "The Workers' Opposition"
russoc.175.d: "Perhaps Chairman Bukharin's decision to ultimately \"subjugate\" the trade unions and make them accountable to the state, contributed to a further deepening of the rift. While in this regard, Bukharin remained consistent with the party's program and Bolshevik-Leninist principles, which the party had adhered to throughout this period, his actions nevertheless sparked resistance.\n\nProminent Bolshevik figures such as Aleksander Shlyapnikov and Aleksandra Kollontai had long been advocating for greater autonomy for trade unions - not merely their independence from governmental oversight, but also for their active involvement in economic affairs and management of national economy. In this respect, their views aligned with those of the left SRs, which likewise advocated for workers' control over the organisation of a socialist economy. Despite the fact that at the Extraordinary Congress of Soviets, Shlyapnikov harbored a faint hope that a more rational decision on the issue of trade unions could be reached, it is now clear in his view that the Party has no intention of deviating from its initial principles, even on such a fundamental matter for the proletariat. Consequently, Shlyapnikov and Kollontai publicly declared their opposition on the \"workers' issue\", forming the so-called Workers' Opposition."
russoc.175.a: "A serious drift of affairs."

russoc.176.t: "Secretariat of the Party"
russoc.176.d: "The supreme governing body of the Bolshevik Party was its Congress, or party conference. This body elected the Central Committee, which served as the interim governing body between Congresses. Due to the infrequency of full Central Committee sessions, known as plenums, for making decisions on pressing issues, other collegial bodies were formed: the Political Bureau (Politburo), the Organizational Bureau (Orgburo), and the Secretariat, comprising the Chairman of the Secretariat in 1918 and, starting from 1919, the Executive Secretary.\n\nFollowing the triumph of the Revolution, the newly established ruling party faced the urgent need to address numerous challenges in a context where convening a full Central Committee plenum was impractical or even impossible. The VIII Congress of the RKP, convened in Moscow in March 1919, served as a platform for consolidating the accumulated experience in addressing the demands of day-to-day management, establishing a permanent Secretariat.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of 1919, Nikolay Krestinsky assumed the role of Executive Secretary, concurrently serving as a member of both the Politburo and the People's Commissariat for Finance. His tenure in this position continued even after the demise of Bolshevist rule in Russia, making him the party's representative abroad. With the ascendancy of Bukharin's faction within the party, the question of reinstating the Secretariat also emerged, necessitating the selection of a new Executive Secretary based on the outcomes of the recent [GetPreviousBolshevikPartyCongressNumber] Congress"

russoc.177.d: "To date, all negotiations with the faction of Zinoviev within our party have been put on hold, as they have actively undermined our credibility at every turn, with Zinoviev himself openly refusing to acknowledge our party as the rightful successor to the Leninist cause.\n\nNevertheless, one of our members of the Politburo, Lev Kamenev, has maintained contact with Zinoviev throughout this time, as an old colleague. Recently, during an informal gathering, he once again proposed a reunion with Zinoviev. However, the demands put forth by Zinoviev in response proved to be rather contradictory. The erstwhile 'Dictator' of Petrograd has demanded a seat on the nation's Politburo, as well as the appointment of Nikolay Krestinsky as party's Executive Secretary, the role he served before the exile. It is undeniable that we cannot accede to these terms, at least insofar as the Central Committee elects both members of the Politburo and of the Secretariat. Nonetheless, for the sake of harmony, we can pledge our assistance in promoting these two individuals to positions within the Central Committee as well as to the positions of their choice."

The main topic of discussion was the issue of the dictatorship of the party, which had been raised by Bukharin in his political report. Following Bukharin, other comrades presented reports on various subjects, after which a discussion ensued regarding the nature of the government.\n\nBukharin and his supporters advocated for the continuation of the revolution, dissolution of the Popular Front, and establishment of the party dictatorship. Their reasoning is that in the present circumstances, petty-bourgeois parties like the Mensheviks and left SRs are essentially counter-revolutionary, as they openly oppose their party and government. However, prominent figures within the party, including Sergey Kirov and Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, rejected this proposal.\n\nThis opposition saw in Bukharin's suggestion a repetition of mistakes made by the party in 1918. Nonetheless, Bukharin reiterated to the opposition that the Bolshevik government had not outlawed other political parties until they actively opposed the revolution. He further recalled how some of those in attendance had attempted to disengage from the revolutionary movement in 1917 by resigning their positions, only to be compelled to rejoin the party following the events.\n\nRegardless, a vote was taken on the question of the party's dictatorial authority, and the Congress resolved:"

From the outset, the party maintained the stance that trade unions ought to be subject to state control, as the state itself was a workers' state elected through workers' councils.\n\nDespite the fact that discussions regarding the future of trade unions had been ongoing for many years, dating back to even during the Civil War, when trade unionists expressed concerns about the militarisation of the economy and the implementation of the War Communism, the newly formulated party programme, authored jointly by Bukharin, Rykov, and Tomsky, advocated for the view that trade unions should not merge with the state but remain independent. However, they would remain accountable and subject to state oversight based on the principles of democratic centralism, with decisions made by higher councils binding on all subordinate councils. According to Tomsky, a prominent figure within the party who was known for his close ties to trade unions and working-class activism, trade unions were best suited to play a pivotal role in organizing labor. This perspective, however, was challenged by fellow comrades like Shlyapnikov and Kollontai, who argued that it was the responsibility of trade unions to shape the economic agenda of the nation, while Soviets ought to concentrate on political and administrative matters.\n\nAt the Congress, Bukharin, perhaps unexpectedly to many, advocated for the position of Shlyapnikov, proposing to transfer the control of the VSNKh, the supreme body responsible for establishing general principles governing the economic life of the Soviet republic and coordinating the actions of central and local economic authorities, to trade unions. Specifically, he proposed that this control be transferred to the Central Council of Trade Unions (RTsSPS). The VSNKh had been established as a regulatory body and was tasked with implementing the economic dictatorship of the proletariat."

Tomsky, an influential party figure known for his close association with trade unions and his activism among the working class, believed that trade unions were ideally suited to play a crucial role in labor organization. This perspective, however, was contested by fellow comrades such as Shlyapnikov and Kollontai, who maintained that it was the duty of trade unions to determine the economic course of the nation, whereas soviets should focus on political and administrative matters.\n\nAt the congress, Bukharin explicitly defended the standpoint of his colleague Tomsky, advocating for placing trade unions under tighter scrutiny and solidifying this decision. In light of the presence of the Workers' Opposition, led by Shlyapnikov, the issue was brought before the congress.

Who shall mold the soul of the rising generation?\n\nThe Russian Young Communist League (RKSM), first envisioned by Nadezhda Krupskaya in the heat of the Civil War, was once a torchbearer of Bolshevik ideals. Crushed by the reactionary regime and denounced as extremist, it was dissolved, and its leader Lazar Shatskin cast into prison. Even after his release, the youth movement languished, stifled by compromise and muddled by Bukharinist revisionism.\n\nNow, the Party has decreed the reconstitution of the youth vanguard - not as a secondary appendage, but as an organically fused arm of the proletarian dictatorship. The RKSM is restored and reborn under a new name: the  All-Russian Leninist Young Communist League - the Komsomol, subordinated to the Narkompros and guided by the Central Committee of the Party.\n\nWhile Lazar Shatskin was considered 'too Bukharinist' to lead the organization, Pyotr Smorodin, the founder of the Petrograd Socialist Union of Working Youth and a loyal son of Zinoviev's Petrograd clan, is elevated as the Komsomol's Chairman.\n\nAlongside the Komsomol, the Vladimir Lenin All-Russian Pioneer Organization (VPO) is founded, a preparatory path for revolutionary youth. From childhood to cadre, the path is now unified.\n\nIt is not enough for youth to witness the revolution. They must become its vanguard."

russoc.196.d: "Now our party faces a critical challenge - our primary strength lies in Moscow, where we maintain a vast network of connections, with the Mossoviet firmly under our control and the broad backing of the working class. The situation in [195.GetName] is more precarious, as without a substantial party presence, power in the [195.GetName] Soviet primarily rests with the left SRs and Mensheviks, leaving our position there less secure.\n\nThe situation is further exacerbated by the ongoing Bolshevisation of the Soviets in [195.GetName]. However, it is only Zinoviev who seeks to seize power there for himself, viewing Petrograd as his personal fiefdom and clearly intent on reasserting his authority. It is imperative that we prevent this from occurring! Through intensive agitation and the establishment of contacts in Petrograd, we must counterbalance Zinoviev's influence and subjugate the [195.GetName] Soviet to our will."

A number of candidates from our party were elected to the [195.GetName] Soviet, though not all of them could be described as strictly following the party line. Aleksey Kuznetsov is one of these, having previously been a mere sorting worker but having managed to rise through the ranks of the party through a youth organisation. In the newly constituted [195.GetName] Soviet, Kuznetsov serves as the second secretary of the regional committee.

russoc.199.t: "Fight Against the Bottle"
russoc.199.d: "Following the conclusion of the civil war in 1920, the prohibition policy implemented under the Tsarist regime was abolished. Throughout this period, the consistent stance of the Bolsheviks, particularly advocated by Rykov, remained steadfast in its opposition to the measures instituted by the Kerensky government, aimed at restricting the consumption of alcohol.\n\nHowever, it was recognized that prohibition could potentially foster the rise of criminal activities, leading to the adoption of a comprehensive approach involving both medical interventions and law enforcement measures. Under the leadership of Rykov, a seminal and directive legislation was enacted to address this social issue. The primary strategies encompassed mandatory treatment for chronic alcoholics and an intensive campaign against illicit distillation. Today, the government has enacted the law \"On Immediate Measures in the Field of Preventive Treatment and Cultural and Educational Work with Alcoholism\", which provides for a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue. This includes the implementation of state-level measures to combat moonshine production, the development of extensive anti-alcohol propaganda campaigns, and the introduction of mandatory treatment programs for alcoholics.\n\nTo oversee and coordinate these efforts, Commissions for the improvement of work and life (KOTIBs) have been established throughout the country. These commissions, known as \"drug guard\" (Narkodruzhinniki), will be responsible for organizing public hearings, \"show trials\" of alcoholics, and anti-alcohol events, featuring mandatory reports from medical professionals and a \"live newspaper\" produced by local amateur collectives.\n\nMoreover, during the meeting of one of these \"enthusiastic fighters\", a Society for Combating Alcoholism has been established, with Nikolai Semashko serving as its leader. Nikolai is a close friend of Aleksey Ivanovich and shares many of his views on the issue of alcoholism. Rykov himself has been appointed to oversee the work of this combative organization."

russoc.200.t: "The Rykovka"
russoc.200.d: "As part of its efforts to combat alcoholism, Rykov's government proposed a gradual phasing out of alcohol from production and distribution. Simultaneously, they proposed introducing novel, genuinely proletarian beverages in nationalised distilleries. Following the prohibition of the majority of potent alcoholic beverages, including those manufactured by the Kadet Smirnov's company of the same name, which had been drugging millions of Russians with vodka after the Civil War, it was planned to launch a new Soviet vodka brand - \"Rykovka\" with a 30% alcohol content.\n\nDespite the fact that news about this beverage elicited much merriment and became the subject of numerous anecdotes, and despite Rykov himself being subjected to accusations of alcoholism on the part of ordinary citizens, future generations of Soviet citizens will no longer imbibe potent spirits, but rather turn to liqueurs, tinctures and wines with a maximum alcohol content of 20 degrees. A generation later, the most potent beverage that a true working communist may partake of will be kvass, and beer - but only on special occasions."

russoc.201.d: "At the recent Central Committee Plenum, Aleksey Rykov proposed an unexpected initiative to commemorate the memory of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, who served as the first and sole leader of the Soviet Cheka during the tumultuous Civil War. In his speech, Rykov delved into the details of his personal interactions with Dzerzhinsky, sharing insights into their correspondence.\n\nRykov emphasized that Dzerzhinsky (may his soul rest in peace) also recognized the necessity of the New Economic Policy and rejected dogmatic approaches when it came to rebuilding the national economy along socialist lines. Rykov hastened to complete his remarks before the Central Committee, noting that Dzerzhinsky had often been ahead of Rykov himself in his support for the NEP. Had Dzerzhinsky been alive, he would undoubtedly have taken the helm of the VSNKh.\n\nIn honor of this revolutionary figure, plans are underway to erect a monument in Moscow, as well as to rename streets in various Russian cities."

russoc.202.d: "Grigory Sokolnikov, the new People's Commissar for Finance, has enthusiastically assumed his responsibilities with the goal of implementing comprehensive financial reforms in the country following the end of the capitalist era. Within the first few weeks of his tenure, efforts commenced to establish state-owned savings banks, differentiate between state and local budgets, and introduce financial discipline and accountability.\n\nSokolnikov, advocating for a stringent financial approach and opposing unrealistic economic plans that relied on inflationary measures for accelerated industrial development, delivered a speech at the VSNKh, proclaiming that \"Emission is the opioid of the national economy!\". However, one of his most significant projects over the past two months has been the transformation of the insurance system.\n\nFollowing the Revolution, insurance was designated as a state monopoly, with all assets and capital previously held by private enterprises being transferred to the government. However, as private farming and small businesses were not prohibited, the reorganization of insurance was particularly significant. Consequently, the Main Directorate of State Insurance, known as Gosstrakh, was established as part of the People's Commissariat of Finance. This move aimed to reinstate property insurance as a state-run monopoly. The decree issued by the government mandated the establishment of state-sponsored insurance for private farms in all regions of [ROOT.GetNameDef], both rural and urban. This insurance was to cover agricultural properties against a range of natural disasters, including fires, livestock losses, hail-induced crop damage, as well as incidents involving water and land transportation routes. Shortly thereafter, Gosstrakh ventured into the international market, offering insurance services for Soviet imports and exports that were previously either under the coverage of defunct private insurance companies or foreign insurers."

This institute aims to conduct theoretical research on economic conditions and systematically monitor their fluctuations globally, with a particular focus on [RUS.GetNameDef].\n\nThe status as a structural component of the People's Commissariat allows the institute to recruit highly skilled professionals, and under [ROOT.GetLeader]'s supervision, it gained autonomy in determining its research directions, ensuring that the findings were closely aligned with the practical challenges faced by the national economy."

Following the nominal dissolution of the Bolshevik Party after the First Civil War, not only were there those who found themselves imprisoned by the White Army and attempted to engage in legal activity after being granted amnesty, but there were also those who assumed leadership positions within the Foreign Bureau of the Party and were forced into exile in the French Commune. Many of these individuals, such as Grigory Zinoviev, who was closely associated with Lev Kamenev, were not strangers to exile.\n\nDespite Zinoviev's faction's opposition to Bukharin's revisionist views on capitalism and their lack of high-ranking government positions, Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader] proceeded to make new appointments. Specifically, Grigory Zinoviev was assigned responsibility for foreign affairs and relations with the Third Internationale, while Nadezhda Krupskaya was tasked with the education of the people."

russoc.209.d: "Notwithstanding the fact that our party’s victory was legally secured and vested in us at the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, there has been a growing murmur among the left-leaning elements and hardliners of the party regarding the necessity for the dictatorship of a single party, as advocated by Lenin. In response to this, Bukharin’s government today issued a formal appeal to the people regarding the formation of a new, unified socialist government comprising representatives from all socialist parties.\n\nThe Cause of the Popular Front is alive - the Revolution has occurred, and, unlike in October, the entire nation has united in opposition to Kornilov and those who betrayed democracy.\n\nBut this act, ostensibly noble and upright, failed to elicit a response from what is known as the "Foreign Bureau" - the Communists led by Zinoviev and his confederates, who had in fact nothin to do with our victory.\n\nToday, in a speech delivered in [195.GetName], Zinoviev formally announced the establishment of a "United Opposition" - directed against the Politburo of the party and its chairman, Bukharin, as well as against all other "sympathizers" - declaring us no less than enemies and revisionists, petty bourgeois traitors to the cause of October and to the legacy of Lenin. Furthermore, he was joined by a number of people whom we considered to be our supporters, who defected to the side of those inconsiderate individuals.\n\nIn response, the newspapers supporting Bukharin made explicit allusions to Zinoviev’s own demarche in October 1917. In any case, tensions are rising, and it appears that we must remain vigilant against the risk of the party falling under the influence of the hardliners."

russoc.210.d: "When the Revolutionary Committees, in concert with sympathizing garrison troops and militant workers, seized control over strategic communication hubs, industrial facilities, and administrative centers, the so-called Popular Front government in the capital swiftly disintegrated. Spiridonova, condemned by the Bolsheviks as an "apostle of false socialism," fled the city in the dead of night, seeking refuge in the Volga region, where SR and Menshevik factions loyal to the ChVSRK still held sway.\n\nThe long-gestating revolution finally erupted, with Petrograd once again serving as its epicenter. Grigory Zinoviev, now first among equals within the newly reconstituted Council of People's Commissars, declared the restoration of the Russian Communist Party as the sole legitimate vanguard of the working class.. Addressing the rapturous throng from the balustrade of the Smolny Institute, Grigory Zinoviev vowed that the treachery of October would find retribution, and the vision of socialism would be rekindled in the conflagration of proletarian ascendancy."

A crowd of workers, soldiers, and students wept openly as he spoke, not only of power, but of faith.\n\nHours after his proclamation, Zinoviev convened the Council of People's Commissars and assumed the position of Chairman. To his right stood Nikolay Krestinsky, an impeccable and loyal administrator, whose dedication could only be matched by his own personal commitment. On the other side stood Georgy Blagonravov, a revolutionary and Chekist, still "well" remembered in Petrograd. The government is still being formed, yet there is no doubt that it will be an eclectic mix of believers, survivors, and fanatics. They will form the initial directives of the new regime: the complete nationalisation of industry and banking; workers' control over factories and enterprises, under the guidance of the party; and an immediate transfer of all land to peasants.\n\nMoreover, the Communist Party will be proclaimed the moral vanguard of humanity. Zinoviev's populist rhetoric has alienated many of the old guard members of the party, yet people continue to chant his name. Red banners are once again flying high."

russoc.212.d: "In the scorching streets of post-revolutionary Moscow, where barricades still stood, the capital's workers cast their votes in the inaugural elections to the Mossoviet. These elections, open only to members of the ruling Communist Party, saw an overwhelming majority of votes cast in favor of those advocating for a cautious transition towards semi-market economics and political pluralism under party leadership - the faction of Nikolay Bukharin.\n\nUnlike the Petrograd 'exiles', Bukharin, along with his supporters Mikhail Tomsky and Aleksey Rykov, had survived imprisonment and persecution following the White victory. Having established proxy parties and legal associations, they infiltrated peasants' councils and factory committees, returning to the ranks of the RKP only recently. Their connections and credibility were particularly strong in Moscow. Lev Kamenev, elected chairman of the Mossoviet, have been one of Bukharin's confidants in their joint struggle against the bourgeois class in recent years, was nonetheless a seasoned member of the Communist Party, with connections in both Petrograd and Moscow. With Bukharin departing for Petrograd to engage actively in the work of the Politburo, Kamenev remained in Moscow as the neutral administrator of the capital, wary of factional excesses."

The Council for Labor and Defense was officially established - as the successor to the SRKO (Council of Workers' and Peasants' Defense), that existed during the First Civil War. Grigory Zinoviev as chairman of the Sovnarkom was appointed chairman of the STO, but the real role was given to the Vyacheslav Molotov as its secretary. There were no impassioned speeches, no appeals to mass emotions; only paper and red stamps.\n\nThe Council's remit is broad, encompassing the coordination of industrial recovery, ensuring discipline in the workplace, oversight of the defense industry, and safeguarding the economic foundation of the Revolution. To many party members, this institution represents a necessary bulwark of stability. However, it is no secret that Molotov, with his sombre and methodical demeanour, harbours suspicions towards the populist rhetoric emanating from the office of Chairman Zinoviev. While Zinoviev speaks of the \"new Soviet man\", Molotov sets out to build factories, issue requisitions, and reconstruct railways. The board must be robust and long-lasting."

Despite the fact that the war is far from over, diplomatic representatives from both [FRA.GetNameDef] and [ENG.GetNameDef] have already dispatched messages to Smolny seeking clarification regarding the intentions of the newly formed government.\n\nHowever, before any meetings can take place, an essential appointment of the Narkomindel must be made. Zinovievites led by Karl Radek argue that the Russian Revolution must join the global revolution. The flames of workers' struggle for power burn from Berlin to Paris. Unification with both [FRA.GetNameDef] and [ENG.GetNameDef] is, according to Radek, an ideological obligation, a step toward restoring the shattered unity of the socialist world.\n\nHis appointment would serve as an immediate signal that Soviet Russia is a revolutionary force destined to stand alongside the Third International. However, there is another path to consider. Aleksey Merekalov, nominated for the position by Vyacheslav Molotov, was a skeptic of Western syndicalism and its interminable theoretical debates. He advocated for Soviet Russia to prioritize its own interests over the doctrines of Parisian intellectuals. While acknowledging the utility of diplomatic relations with the Third International, he cautioned against blind obedience to its directives. Under his guidance, Soviet diplomacy would be characterized by pragmatism, engaging in cooperation when necessary but always placing Russia's independence at the forefront."

Behind him stands the faction of [FROM.GetLeader], already reshaping Russia in their vision of proletarian unity. The message is clear: the Soviet Republic seeks alignment."
russoc.215.d2: "The newly appointed Commissar Merekalov is a quiet man. Reserved, steely-eyed, he speaks of trade guarantees, diplomatic protocols, and territorial security. His tone is formal, and his proposals precise - but behind the careful words lies something else: distance.\n\nWhile he expresses commitment to peaceful relations and potential cooperation, he makes no mention of common revolutionary destiny, nor invokes the Internationale with fervor. His delegation insists on sovereignty and equal status in all agreements.\n\nIt is clear that in this Soviet Russia, ideological loyalty may not outweigh strategic interests.

Officially, this campaign is directed against "reactionaries, obstructors, and bourgeois elements" - the administrative apparatus that was inherited from the defunct Popular Front and Russian Republic. In reality, it represents a concerted effort to consolidate revolutionary power within the Soviet state.\n\nAcross the country, offices are being closed as investigators with search warrants arrive. In Petrograd, the Cheka under the leadership of Comrade Blagonravov has launched parallel trials against suspected sympathizers of counter-revolution, particularly officials associated with the dissolved PLSR, as well as compromised Menshevik and SR networks. Arrests have already commenced.\n\nAlthough the Zinovievite press extols the purge as a "preventive blow against bourgeois degeneration", some observers discreetly observe the increasing influence of the conservative faction centered around Molotov and Yagoda.

Throughout [195.GetName] and beyond, government officials loyal to the old regime refuse to recognize the authority of the Council of People's Commissars. Citing "legality" and the "constitutional process", ministries remain empty, and entire departments have declared a boycott of the Soviet government. The most dangerous thing is that employees of the Ministry of Railways went on strike, who seized depots and telegraph stations, stopping all food supplies to the capital. Supplies of food, fuel and mail are paralyzed. The workers' militias, who tried to reopen the most important lines, met with armed resistance from the railway guards, still loyal to the Popular Front.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] has condemned the sabotage as "petty-bourgeois terrorism", while Chekist agents begin preparing dossiers on ringleaders.

Now, with the assistance of trusted employees of the [GetChekaName] under the leadership of [GetChekaLeader] and a group of Red Guards, the bank was forcibly reopened.

His offices were empty because typists and clerks refused to cooperate with the new order, and even his trade union relations department had collapsed. The irony of fate did not escape many - the very institution that was supposed to organize labor was itself paralyzed by the strike. Nevertheless, under the leadership of Mikhail Tomsky, a trade union veteran and close associate of Bukharin, the commissariat resumed its work. Emergency personnel from factory councils and railway committees have been involved, and basic data on the employment of workers and industrial assignments is being collected. The resumption of work was a preliminary success, but it had to be paid for with political costs. Hardliners and Zinovievites are now whispering that Tomsky is not suitable for this position, blaming the prolonged strike of civil servants on Tomsky. Zinovievite firebrands accuse Tomsky of naivety; Hardliners, of treachery."

Though Tomsky was not beloved by all, his departure is viewed by many in the trade unions as an attack on their autonomy. Mass meetings have erupted across the major union halls, particularly in Petrograd. Delegates of the All-Russian Central Union of Trade Unions (RTsSPS) have called an emergency session.\n\nAleksandr Shlyapnikov, a respected representative of the Bukharinites, broke the order by saying that the proletariat should not become a shadow of itself. Meanwhile, Zinovievite newspapers paint the unions as "backward-leaning remnants of Frontist opportunism," urging their ideological integration.

russoc.222.d: "The collapse of the Popular Front government plunged the Russian trade union movement into a maelstrom of chaos, defiance, and ideological reckoning. Although the trade unions never fully integrated into the state machinery, they were among the most prominent supporters of the Popular Front, symbols of workers' self-government, democratic socialism, and syndicalist aspirations. Now the unions feel orphaned. Many of their leaders, previously loyal to the coalition of the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, are not sure how to navigate the new conditions. Some of them called for strikes to protest the coming to power of the RKP, condemning the seizure of power as a betrayal of workers' autonomy. At the center of this maelstrom is the Russian Central Union of Trade Unions (RTsSPS), still led by Solomon Lozovsky, an internationalist Menshevik who stunned his old comrades by declaring loyalty to the new government of the RCP and deepened the split in the ranks of the Mensheviks. Lozovsky's continued tenure at the helm of the All-Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is not accidental. Thanks to the intervention of Nikolay Bukharin and Alexander Shlyapnikov, he retained his post for the time being, serving as a link between the needs of the revolution and the workers' faith in their trade unions. However, this compromise is fragile. The Zinovievites grumble that Lozovsky is a relic of the petty-bourgeois socialism of the Popular Front. Blagonravov announced that the Cheka would monitor spontaneous protests and criminal syndicates.

russoc.223.d: "The revolution has seized power, and now the task is to exercise it. The Supreme Council of National Economy (VSNKh), which once served as the bureaucratic facade of the Popular Front, now stands at the forefront of efforts to rebuild socialism. The council aims to restore order to the industrial chaos, reinstating discipline in factories, coordinating military production, and implementing central directives.\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse of private enterprises, the Supreme Economic Council assumes the role of the brain and spine of the national economy. During the formation of the Council of People's Commissars, two figures emerged, representing different factions of the Zinovievite line, whom Comrade Zinoviev can entrust with the task of organizing and rebuilding the economy.\n\nEvgeny Preobrazhensky, a fervent theorist of industrial accumulation at the expense of the village, earned his influence during the exile in France. On the other hand, Nikolai Krestinsky brought to the table experience and moderation, having been a proponent of conciliation and having once led the People's Commissariat for Finance during the early days of the Civil War, advocating a delicate balance between revolutionary zeal and economic pragmatism."

However, the Council of Labor and Defense was not content to simply sit idly by and watch. After several weeks of intense deliberations and consultations with experts, they arrived at a momentous decision: to establish a State Planning Commission, Gosplan.\n\nGosplan, entrusted with the task of formulating a comprehensive national economic plan and ensuring its successful implementation, is poised to serve as the driving force behind the transformation of the Soviet economy. It will coordinate the efforts of industry, supply, and labor in service of the proletarian state. Gosplan will operate under the supervision of the Council, with the leadership entrusted to a capable individual who can translate ideas into production targets. This individual, according to Vyacheslav Molotov, is Valerian Kuybyshev, is a veteran Bolshevik dating back to 1904. An associate of Yakov Sverdlov and leader of Samara prior to its capture by Czechoslovaks in 1918, he was arrested after the war, collaborating with the Republican government and Bukharinists and served in the RTsSPS. Kuybyshev is known for his loyalty and ruthlessness when necessary, albeit with a penchant for alcohol. He is expected to enforce strict discipline within the planning body, under close government supervision."

After several weeks of intense deliberations and consultations with experts, the government arrived at a momentous decision: to establish a State Planning Commission, Gosplan.\n\nGosplan, entrusted with the task of formulating a comprehensive national economic plan and ensuring its successful implementation, is poised to serve as the driving force behind the gradual transformation of the Soviet economy. Gosplan will operate under the supervision of the VSNKh, with the leadership entrusted to a capable individual who can translate ideas into production targets.

russoc.225.d: "The momentum of reconstruction is gathering pace, with furnaces ablaze, hammers pounding, and central planning setting the tempo. However, behind the closed doors of economic ministries, a heated discussion has erupted regarding the essence of socialist economics.\n\nIn recent weeks, prominent economic theorists and administrators, notably Gleb Krzhizhanovsky, Miron Vladimirov, Konstantin Striyevsky and Pyotr Bogdanov, have sharply criticised the increasing dominance of the glavki: the main committees of the VSNKh. These entities, originally intended to coordinate production across key sectors, have evolved into a rigid and controlling bureaucracy, stifling the initiative of both workers and managers.\n\nThe critics, largely associated with the Bukharinist tendency, advocate for the formation of trusts, state-run industrial associations granted wide operational autonomy. In theory, such trusts would combine centralized control with economic flexibility, liberating factories from micromanagement while maintaining overall oversight: decentralizing the factory while centralizing the industry.\n\nHowever, within the VSNKh and the inner circles of the Party's economic leadership - dominated by the Molotovite Hardliners - advocates of Glavkism strike back. To them these ideas reek of petty-bourgeois and technocratic tendencies. For the Zinovievites, who see proletarian hegemony as dependent on an ideology-driven economy, the glavki are not chains but levers of control.\n\nFor now, the official line remained unchanged. Glavkism, while not without its flaws, is declared a necessary step in building the machinery of socialism. Decentralization only opens the floodgates to bourgeois influences. Yet, as complaints mount and inefficiencies multiply, the impending years of economic development are threatened by a growing tension between central control and local autonomy."

russoc.226.t: "[GetBolshevikPartyCongressNumber] Congress of the RKP"
russoc.226.d: "The recent congress of the party opened under the shadow of a question that had been haunting the revolution since its inception: what should be the role of trade unions in the newly established workers' state? Although this issue had been postponed for quite some time due to pressing concerns regarding power and reconstruction, with the state apparatus now firmly under the control of the Bolsheviks, it had resurfaced with renewed urgency.\n\nIn the official doctrine, the answer appeared clear. Zinoviev, currently holding significant influence within the Central Committee, reaffirmed that trade unions were to function as "schools of communism", serving as loyal intermediaries between the party and the working class. After all, if the Soviet state was a state of the workers, and the party its vanguard, the independence of the trade unions is impossible.\n\nHowever, as often happens, reality fell short of theory. It was the VSNKh that broke the impasse, issuing a decree that all trade unions be subordinated to economic planning and production bodies. The pretext was familiar: sabotage, disorganisation, and petty syndicalism had infiltrated workplaces, where "independent" trade unions sowed discord instead of discipline.\n\nMikhail Tomsky, revered for his deep ties with the industrial working class, issued a rare rejoinder: trade unions were not impediments to socialism but its instruments. His vision of trade unions assisting in grassroots coordination was swiftly challenged by Shlyapnikov and Kollontai, the last two bastions of the old labor movement.. For these individuals, trade unions were envisioned as the architects of economic progress, guiding the nation's industrial renaissance from the ground up. Councils were seen as responsible for legislation and governance, while trade unions assumed the role of economic management.\n\nBukharin, himself, fearful of unchecked fragmentation, hesitated to fully endorse either perspective. Nikolai Krestinsky, echoing similar sentiments, dismissed the entire discussion as a relic of the Popular Front, advocating for the complete nationalization of the trade unions. Unexpectedly, the Molotovites aligned with Krestinsky in this stance. The Zinovievites, while nominally more accommodating, proposed that trade unions' role was not to formulate policy but rather to disseminate and popularize party policies."

russoc.227.d: "After the heated discussions at the [GetPreviousBolshevikPartyCongressNumber] Party Congress, the growing split within the Bolshevik Party became impossible to ignore. The official formation of the Workers' Opposition marked a new chapter in the internal party struggle.\n\nAleksander Shlyapnikov, a staunch proponent of the syndicalist vision of revolution, advocated for a decentralized system where production would be determined by workers in collective councils, a sharp departure from the centralized top-down economic system represented by the Sovnarkom. Solomon Lozovsky, a former Menshevik turned Bolshevik and leader of the RTsSPS, joined their ranks. Although his initial commitment to revolution was pragmatic, his disillusionment with Bolshevik economic policies and centralization led him to support the Workers' Opposition openly. Many small trade unions also supported the workers' opposition, seeing in it the hope of restoring the achievements of the Popular Front. Although, in general, the All-Union Central Committee could not or did not want to take a position on the matter. Despite increasing pressure from the Bolshevik government to suppress this opposition, for the time being, the workers' opposition remains a minor obstacle to the regime. While they do not have the substantial support or the momentum to directly challenge Zinoviev's rule, they continue to undermine the foundations of party unity."

It would be the conduit through which proletarian ideology, according to Zinoviev's plan, would permeate the minds of millions.\n\nVarious candidates emerged for the role of People's Commissar, each with their own vision of how the cultural revolution ought to proceed."

While the Bolsheviks have long claimed the state to be a dictatorship of the proletariat, internal party structures have remained dominated by long-time revolutionaries, administrators, and increasingly, bureaucrats. Zinoviev's move is intended to symbolically reforge the link between the Party and the people - and, more importantly, to reaffirm his personal commitment to a workers-first vision of socialism.\n\nThe resolution outlines a structured process for new membership applications. Local Party committees are to coordinate with trade unions and factory cells, evaluating candidates based on class background, workplace activity, and loyalty to socialist ideals. Though Zinoviev has demanded the campaign bring in one million new members, few believe such a number can be realistically achieved. Nevertheless, enrollment centers have begun appearing across the Republic, plastered with slogans calling on "Proletarians, take your rightful place in the Party of October!"\n\nThe Zinoviev Enrolment also intersects with the emerging Proletkult movement and the broader cultural campaign inaugurated by the Proletarian Charter. Together, these efforts signal an attempt to redefine socialism not merely through economics and governance, but through the cultural, moral, and symbolic dominance of the working class as an idealized force."

At the heart of this debate lies the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission - the Cheka - an institution born in blood and forged for vigilance\n\nUnder the leadership of Georgy Blagonravov, a veteran revolutionary and a comrade of Zinoviev in exile, the Cheka has remained a faithful instrument of the Zinovievite leadership. Blagonravov himself, a hero of the October uprising and a stalwart of the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee, personally oversaw the first arrests in the Trubetskoy Bastion.\n\nYet among the moderates, a new wind blows. Lev Kamenev, alongside Zinoviev's ally during exile years Viktor Serzh (Kibalchich), has raised the question of normalization. As the state apparatus matures, they argue, its guardians must be subordinated to legality - not stand outside it. The People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs under the leadership of Aleksandr Beloborodov is already overseeing public order and administration, ready to absorb the Cheka's functions.\n\nThe proposal is simple: disband the Cheka and transfer its competencies to the State Political Directorate (GPU) under the NKVD. The NKVD, a commissariat of the state rather than the revolution, would oversee intelligence and internal security - under law, not terror.\n\nBut the Cheka harbors many Hardliners, such as Genrikh Yagoda, who see Kamenev's "normalization" as weakness - while viewing Beloborodov with suspicion. Meanwhile, the Bukharinists eye the reform with quiet support, hoping for the eventual erosion of institutions they deem incompatible with socialism's ethical core."

His days are divided between administrative work at the commissariat and inspections of garrisons.\n\nHowever, power in Siberia remains contested. The vestiges of populist, Bukharinist, and regionalist networks persist, clinging to their wartime autonomy. A critical issue has emerged in Novosibirsk, where Boris Shumyatsky - an experienced revolutionary and one of the leaders of the NRA partisans and the 'Red Harbiners' - operates outside the purview of Lashevich. Shumyatsky, a moderate Bukharinite, advocates for decentralization, espouses the need for Buryat-Mongol autonomy, and maintains connections with the Mongolian revolutionary underground. Lashevich considers this a mild form of incitement to insurrection. He calls for Shumyatsky's removal from the Novosibirsk Soviet and the restoration of central military command. However, the Politburo must tread carefully. Harsh actions risk alienating the Siberian Left and turning them into the opposition at a time when national reconstruction is beginning."

A brother-in-law of Zinoviev and a former collaborator of Parvus in the days of the sealed trains and German money, Zaks had lived many lives before becoming a trusted voice of the Party in Russia's revolutionary capital.\n\nNow that voice is beginning to grate.\n\nCommissars in Petrograd express dissatisfaction with the tone of the Pravda. Too vitriolic, too personal, and too staged. Even those who supported the party were taken aback by the weekly editorials that denounced "romantic deviationists" and "residue Mensheviks" with remarkable precision and venom.\n\nA particularly harsh editorial that did not name specific individuals but denounced "platformist sabotage" sparked a sharp protest from younger members of the city's party committee.

Primarily centered around the camp of Mikhail Tukhachevsky, also known as the Red Napoleon or the Bolshevik Marshal, and his closest comrades, like Vitovt Putna, Ieronim Uborevich and Iona Yakir, these varied Left Communists come in numerous forms, but the most influential groups are the Bordigists who were inspired by Amadeo Bordiga during their time serving in Italy, the few remaining Trotskyists left around that have rallied around Tukhachevsky's chief theorist Osip Piatnitsky, and the Council Communists who, while fighting in Germany where Tukachevsky himself was even temporarily held captive by forces of the Kaiserreich at Ingolstadt, have since largely taken inspiration from the stunted German radical Left and by the failed German Spartacists.\n\nWith each of these factions holding internationalism to be key to the proletarian struggle, they all have come to align with Tukhachevsky‘s own views on socialist internationalism, and as such they all have come to have a place in General Tukhachevsky's inner-circle as they each whisper in his ear and try to fully sway him to their cause. However, having gone through his own political journey himself, perhaps he is a bit more resistant to outside pressure than we thought. Coming from a noble background, Tukhachevsky was once, in his own words, just a childish neo-pagan infatuated with the story of Napoleon while seeking to use opportunism and a faux understanding of socialist theory to climb the revolutionary ladder, but he has since evolved into a committed communist revolutionary following the initial failures of the Bolsheviks, or so he says, and a honest herald of global proletarian cooperation in his own right, so perhaps he can manage to juggle these various influences. Regardless, we will have to keep an eye on the Red Napoleon's clique and hope that he stays loyal to the Party over his advisors and comrades if we are to ensure that our own army stays loyal to the party line."

A man of unwavering discipline and unyielding clarity, he was more of a party administrator than a theoretician, and to his supporters, he embodied the ideals of Bolshevik centralism.\n\nThe proposal put forward by Zagorsky, which was also endorsed by Sergei Chutskayev, another Sverdlov's appointees, called for the establishment of an official Day of Remembrance for Sverdlov, the opening of a party archive bearing his name, and the inclusion of his writings and directives in party education programs. This initiative was explicitly supported by Vyacheslav Molotov, who regards Sverdlov as his spiritual precursor and a shining exemplar of bureaucratic efficiency and revolutionary resolve.

But now, surrounded by bureaucrats, legalists, and paper-men, his disillusionment is growing. He sees courtrooms replacing rifles, verdicts wrapped in parchment instead of delivered from the barrel of a gun.

His meetings with Vyacheslav Molotov, have grown more frequent. Beloborodov may not love Molotov - but he sees in him a bulwark against rot.\n\nMolotov, for his part, sees opportunity.

Comrades describe him as brilliant yet unbearable, tireless yet merciless, possessed of a sharp mind and a sharper tongue.\n\nThough his formal loyalty lies with the Molotovite wing, many within that faction view him warily, suspicious of his old populist habits and unpredictable temperament. [ROOT.GetLeader], however, sees him as a useful tool in the final purge of the Popular Front's remnants - the Mensheviks, the SRs, the old moderates and vacillators who have outlived their usefulness.\n\nWith the legal system once more reshaped, a quiet struggle is now underway - one not of guns and slogans, but of doctrines, decrees, and judicial control. And at its center stands Krylenko: revolutionary, rhetorician, and now, state prosecutor."

russoc.242.t: "Secretariat of the Party"
russoc.242.d: "With the overthrow of the Popular Front and the re-establishment of Bolshevik rule, the Russian Communist Party now governs not in exile, but from Petrograd once again. The enormous strain of restoring centralized control, reestablishing party unity, and coordinating the apparatus of revolutionary governance necessitates the revival of an institution once central to the smooth functioning of party operations - the Secretariat.\n\nFormed after the VIII Party Congress in 1919, the Secretariat had functioned as the practical nerve center of the Party's apparatus. Under the leadership of Nikolay Krestinsky, it oversaw personnel management, interdepartmental coordination, and the maintenance of party discipline across the vast and fractured land. Even after the fall of Bolshevik Russia, Krestinsky retained the title of Executive Secretary within the exiled Foreign Bureau of the Central Committee, a position more symbolic than operational - but one he never abandoned.\n\nNow, as Congress reconvenes in Petrograd and a new Central Committee is elected, the question arises: Who should take up the reins of the Secretariat? The role remains bureaucratic for now - the real center of power lies with the Chairman of the Sovnarkom, Grigory Zinoviev - but the Secretariat's reach into the party's personnel and regional structures makes this appointment far from inconsequential.\n\nZinoviev himself views the role as technical and prefers to keep power in the Politburo. Yet others - particularly the Molotovites - may view the post as a foothold from which influence can quietly expand."

russoc.243.t: "A Party Without a Country"
russoc.243.d: "For years, the Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) of Ukraine - the KP(b)U - has existed in exile, a marginal offshoot of the Russian Communist Party, living on only in Red émigré circles and RKP committee reports. The party has returned to Russia from abroad together with the RKP, but not as a voice of Ukrainian socialism, but as a remnant of an older dream - that of a Soviet Ukraine integrated wholly into the Russian revolutionary project.\n\nThe KP(b)U was born not from the Ukrainian soil, but from the directives of the Petrograd Soviet and the Commissariat for Nationalities. In December 1917, as the Bolsheviks sought to undermine the Ukrainian Central Rada, they organized a congress in Kiev - only to be in a very minority, shamefully. The defeated Bolsheviks absconded to Kharkov, where they held an alternative congress, where only they were present - a nominal gathering with no true authority, which nevertheless proclaimed Soviet power and declared the Rada dissolved. By January 1918, the Red Army was at war with the nascent Ukrainian People's Republic. During their brutal five-day siege of Kiev in February, Bolshevik units shelled the city indiscriminately, using poison gas and launching a campaign of red terror afterward - mass executions and wholesale slaughter in the name of class war. The population of Ukraine never forgave this.\n\nThe KP(b)U was only formally constituted in April 1918 in exile, at Taganrog, and confirmed its subordinate status to the Russian Communist Party at its first congress in Moscow that July. It never ruled a day in Ukraine. Even many Ukrainian Marxists who once cooperated with the Bolsheviks, such as those in the peasant-insurgent tradition or the Central Rada's left, soon joined the Ukapists - the Ukrainian Communist Party - instead, drawn to the idea of an independent Soviet Ukraine.\n\nToday, the KP(b)U is a Russian party, led by Yevgeniya Bosh, a fierce and doctrinaire revolutionary, unwavering in her vision of Ukraine as a breakaway province to be restored. Accompanying her are fellow centralists Grigory Petrovsky, a seasoned Bolshevik apparatchik, and Vlas Chubar, a hardline administrator. They do not speak for Ukraine, but they speak loudly about it. Their plan is straightforward - proclaim a "Provisional Workers' and Peasants' Government of Ukraine" in Kursk. From there, they hope to assemble a Ukrainian Red Army, return in force, and ignite another insurrection."

russoc.244.d: "With banners red and proclamations bold, the Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) of Ukraine [KP(b)U] has declared the formation of the Provisional Workers' and Peasants' Government of Ukraine in the Russian city of Kursk. This exiled committee, under the leadership of Yevgeniya Bosh and backed by the Central Committee, claims to speak in the name of Ukraine's industrial workers and impoverished peasants - despite having neither a foothold in Ukrainian territory nor any meaningful support from Ukrainian society.\n\nThe declaration, written in a style familiar from the civil war years, condemns \"the bourgeois usurpers and petty-bourgeois nationalists who sabotage the dictatorship of labor\" and announces the KP(b)U's historic mission: to restore Soviet power in Ukraine. It further promises sweeping land redistribution, centralized economic planning, and the full extension of proletarian internationalism - \"once the Ukrainian people are freed from their current captivity under nationalist illusion\".\n\nThough grand in rhetoric, the government exists only on paper for now. The city of Kursk, barely beyond the Ukrainian border, functions as little more than a logistical staging post and publishing hub. Yet within its train depots and commandeered offices, the KP(b)U has begun forming the first battalions of what it calls the Ukrainian Red Army, envisioned as the military arm of the future workers' republic.\n\nTo many in Ukraine, however, this "government" is a grotesque charade: a non-Ukrainian party, backed by a foreign power, presuming to govern a nation from exile. For Ukrainian socialists and communists alike - from the independentist Ukapists to the populist Borotbysts - the event is a mere provocation. Already, satirical pamphlets circulate in Kyiv and Kharkiv mocking the “Kursk Sovnarkom”."
russoc.244.d.UKR: "News has arrived from across the northern border: in the Russian city of Kursk, Yevhenia Bosh and a small group of émigré Bolsheviks have declared the formation of a so-called "Provisional Workers' and Peasants' Government of Ukraine". With no presence on Ukrainian soil and little but the support of the Russian Communist Party behind them, this self-appointed government claims to speak for the Ukrainian working class. It consists almost entirely of non-Ukrainians, organized in exile, proclaiming decrees no one in Ukraine asked for.\n\nMost curiously, it purports to represent a country it does not reside in, govern, or understand-issuing statements from a logistical hub on the Russian side of the border, as if shouting over the fence will win the people over. Whether this is a prelude to invasion or just a desperate stunt, the symbolism is hard to ignore: a \"Ukrainian\" government formed in Russia, for the benefit of Russia.\n\nReactions from across the political spectrum are swift and unforgiving. Many demand an official response. Others suggest mocking dismissal. Some whisper of opportunity: if they want to govern from Kursk - perhaps we should stake a claim to Kursk."

russoc.245.d: "The tension within the NKVD has reached a breaking point. Months of bureaucratic inertia, sudden reshufflings, and subtle obstructions have hollowed out Commissar Aleksandr Beloborodov's authority. Though still formally loyal to the revolutionary line, he started to openly criticize the Party's recent reforms - particularly the disbanding of the Revolutionary Tribunal system.\n\nThe final blow came not through scandal, but through a quietly circulated memorandum from the Council of Labor and Defense, questioning the \"operational cohesion\" of the NKVD under Beloborodov's stewardship. While vague and formally non-accusatory, it was enough to shake Zinoviev's remaining confidence.\n\nYet the Politburo retains its voice, suggesting either to leave Beloborodov in his place or appoint Georgy Blagonravov, the trusted chief of the GPU, to succeed Beloborodov."
russoc.245.d2: "The campaign against Commissar Beloborodov has borne fruit - though not with noise or trials, but through the deliberate, clinical erosion of trust. A series of \"administrative misalignments\" were quietly compiled by allies of Molotov within the Council of Labor and Defense. A misfiled directive here, a lapse in chain-of-command there - small enough to ignore individually, damning in accumulation.\n\nPresented with a dossier implying \"operational destabilization\", Zinoviev did not protest. Though no formal charges were made, the implication was clear: Beloborodov was a relic, perhaps even a liability. Under the guise of restoring discipline, Zinoviev approved the appointment of Genrikh Yagoda, a veteran of the Petrograd Cheka and one-time protégé of Sverdlov, as the new People's Commissar of Internal Affairs. Publicly, Yagoda is cast as a technocratic stabilizer. Privately, the Molotovites are jubilant. With a loyal man at the helm, the NKVD - and soon the GPU - may finally become instruments of proper ideological discipline."

Today, the Central Committee was rocked by a fierce confrontation initiated by Vyacheslav Molotov and several of his allies. Molotov announced the emergence of a right-opportunist deviation, a sickness disguised under the slogans of national reconstruction and "the smychka of workers and peasants." In addition, this "right-wing opportunist deviation" was accused of excessive leniency towards the peasantry, romantic notions of the decentralized Soviet power, and flirtations with Franco-British syndicalism. The most terrible thing was that the Molotovites pointed out that many Bukharinist-affiliated unions and soviets had engaged in premature political discussions without Party direction, and questioned the Bukharinists' loyalty to the centralized revolutionary state.\n\nBut others, notably Zinoviev's closest allies such as Kamenev and Preobrazhensky, cautioned that disagreement should not be confused with sabotage, and unity between the so-called \"Foreign Delegation\" and the \"Russian Bureau\" should be unquestionable. The chairman is now expected to intervene."

russoc.247.d: "Iosif Unshlikht, veteran Bolshevik and one of the Cheka founders, has long stood as the senior Polish revolutionary on Russian soil. Once a close ally of Zinoviev, and now a loyal adherent of the Party line in exile, Unshlikht remains a prominent force among the so-called Mniejszościowcy - the minority faction of the Polish Communist Party (KPP), formed after bitter disputes in exile.\n\nWith the KPP banned in Poland and the so-called “majority” headquartered in Paris, Unshlikht now makes his case: the time has come for our Party to throw its ideological and material weight behind his tendency, as the only legitimate vanguard of the Polish proletariat. With support from Party cells, Red Army officers of Polish origin, and elements in the Zinovievite press, he proposes to consolidate Mniejszościowcy activity under the umbrella of a future Polish Soviet Republic, to be established with our backing - by force, if necessary.\n\nSome of the Narkomindel advisors, however, suggest that should we move forward, this can lead to diplomatic consequences with [FRA.GetNameDef], still host to the Warsaw leadership in exile. But for the Communist cause, the symbolic and strategic importance of Poland cannot be overstated."
russoc.247.d2: "[POL.GetNameDefCap], founded with French and Internationale support, claims to speak for the Polish working class. Yet in [ROOT.Capital.GetName], a different narrative is taking shape. Iosif Unshlikht, veteran Bolshevik and senior member of the Mniejszościowcy - the minority faction of the Polish Communist Party - argues that the Warsaw regime is tainted by syndicalist deviation, foreign dependence, and a deep hostility to true Leninist internationalism.\n\nBacked by several Soviet institutions, including our Narkomindel Karl Radek, and a circle of Polish exile revolutionaries, Unshlikht believes that the KPP(m), led by Julian Leszczyński, no longer truly represents the Polish proletariat. Though not yet calling for a new party to take the lead of the Revolutionary Polan, he demands ideological primacy, and offers a blueprint for the political “liberation” of Poland from reformist rule.\n\nThis would risk a serious rift with [FRA.GetNameDef] thought and may destabilize the entire Third Internationale - but it may also offer a path to a Polish Soviet Republic aligned with our cause, not theirs."

russoc.250.d: "As the Zinoviev Enrolment continued to swell the Party's ranks - already surpassing two hundred thousand new members in mere months - it drew fire from unexpected directions. While the Party leadership celebrated the influx of fresh proletarian blood, some voiced doubts about the ideological and class composition of the newcomers.\n\nAt the forefront of the criticism stood Nikolay Bukharin. Speaking in a closed Politburo session, he raised concerns that the ongoing campaign risked alienating the countryside and distorting the Party's revolutionary balance. He pointed to statistics revealing the sharp drop in peasant representation within the Party since the enrolment had begun. The proletarian influx, Bukharin argued, was no substitute for a living alliance with the peasantry. He warned that a Party of the city alone is no vanguard, but a sect.\n\nIn Bukharin's view, Zinoviev's approach created a Party of eager post-chasers - workers "from the machine" who lacked grounding in Bolshevism, Leninism, or even basic social democracy. These new members, he feared, would vote for the Zinoviev's resolutions not out of understanding, but ambition.\n\nProposing a corrective course, Bukharin and his allies advocated for a new campaign under the slogan: \"Let's face the village\". A peasant enrolment drive, they argued, would restore class equilibrium and reconnect the Party with the rural majority of the Soviet republics. Only through such dual recruitment could the spirit of the October Revolution survive mass bureaucratization."

Among the Party's more rigid and security-minded elements, the campaign was seen with growing skepticism - none more vocal than Lazar Kaganovich, the rising tribune of the Molotovite faction.\n\nSpeaking before a joint session of cadre commissars, Kaganovich derisively noted that the new recruits "looked at the Party like a pie with stuffing." They did not come to sacrifice, but to partake. The Party, he warned, was in danger of becoming a ladder for social mobility rather than a tool for revolutionary transformation.\n\nAt the same time, the Molotovites were not blind to the opportunity. Though critical of Zinoviev's theatrical push for a "mass Party", they saw in the enrolment a source of loyal, moldable personnel - new men with little ideological grounding but strong discipline, ideal for building the bureaucratic machinery of the emerging Soviet state.\n\nIndeed, in the quiet halls of Party apparatus offices, Molotovite instructors had already begun identifying and cultivating potential allies among the new recruits. While Zinoviev basked in the public success of the enrolment, his rivals quietly ensured that its fruits would not be harvested solely by his own camp."

Sovereignty is no longer divided among classes or nations; it is vested solely in the working class as the vanguard of world revolution.

russoc.253.d: "After the victory in the Second Civil War in Russia, the Soviet state is faced with the urgent issue of reorganizing the judicial system. The Sixth All-Russian Congress of Soviet Justice Workers was convened to consider the structure and role of the revolutionary judicial system, formed in the crucible of the civil war and supported by extraordinary institutions. The revolutionary tribunals, established by the Decree on the Court of November 22, 1917, served as a swift and militant response to the counterrevolution, while the Cheka, founded in December of the same year, became the punitive shield of the Soviet Republic, endowed with broad powers to suppress enemies within the country. Subsequent 1918 decrees formalized a multi-level system of people's courts, district courts, and cassation tribunals based on the principle of revolutionary legality. The same principles applied after the new Socialist Revolution.\n\nHowever, after the cessation of mass hostilities and the gradual normalization of Soviet power, the delegates of the Congress expressed concern about the continuing need for extraordinary tribunals and the broad judicial and administrative powers possessed by political bodies. The majority of delegates support the complete elimination of the revolutionary tribunals and the gradual limitation of the judicial competence of the Cheka, considering such measures as necessary steps towards the establishment of a stable socialist rule of law.\n\nMost critically, a faction of legal specialists, supported by several regional judicial soviets, has proposed the re-establishment of the Prosecutor's Office to ensure uniform oversight of legality and discipline within the judicial system. They argue that, in the absence of a centralized prosecutorial body, legal norms vary dangerously from region to region. However, fierce debate has emerged regarding the proposed subordination of this office. Some favor dual subordination - to the provincial executive committees in the field and to the republic's chief prosecutor in the center. Others argue for full centralization under the ministry of Justice.\n\nThe Politburo, which took a special interest in the outcome of the case, demanded that the Congress submit the final decision for approval. This decision, at first glance administrative, may well determine the further trajectory of the development of Soviet justice - between the desire for legal normalization and the preservation of revolutionary vigilance."

At the heart of his plan: the abolition of the Presidium and Plenum of the Supreme Court, the transfer of supervisory powers to the People's Commissariat of Justice, and the streamlining of oversight by placing disciplinary authority over judges squarely under the prosecutorial apparatus.\n\nChairman of the Supreme Court Aleksandr Vinokurov, a venerable Old Bolshevik and long-standing legalist, listened with visible concern. Krylenko's proposals, he argued, amounted to nothing less than the bureaucratic subjugation of the courts. He countered with his own vision - one where courts maintained relative autonomy under coordinated oversight by the Narkomyust, and where legal supervision was reduced cautiously, not obliterated.\n\nSome commissars, sympathetic to Krylenko's radical energy and ambitions, see in his plans the makings of a stronger, more centralized state. Others view Vinokurov's legalism and institutional caution as a necessary brake against the creeping authoritarianism of unchecked prosecutorial power.\n\nThe Sovnarkom must weigh in - or risk a deepening fracture between the state's two principal organs of justice."

Their language, though careful, is suffused with ideas of smychka, 'milestone way to socialism' and the "rational cooperation" of worker and peasant. The Zinovievite line is clear: the countryside must be drawin into the urban orbit of the Proletarian Hegemony, rather than being accepted on its own terms. But in Moscow, the wheels of policy are grinding slower than anywhere else. No direct confrontation has occured - yet. But silence can be louder than any protest."

Nonetheless, their questions were unusually sharp: why has the Mossoviet failed to implement a plan for supplying food to neighbouring rural areas? And why do local administrators continue to talk about the "smychka of city and village"?\n\nChairman Kamenev, renowned for his diplomatic skills, personally greeted the delegation and offered complete transparency. However, the visiting analysts - dispatched under the pretext of reviewing budget efficiency across Soviet urban centers - uncovered what they called "deep inconsistencies" in the financial reporting of several departments within the Mossoviet.

Whispers circulate in the workshops about leniency, food shortages, and unwarranted punishments. Within this resentment Yefim Ignatov, an Old Bolshevik from Bukharinist wing of the party, gains prominence. At the recent Moscow Provincial Party Conference, Ignatov delivered a scathing speech, denouncing the rise of a "communist caste of responsible workers" - bureaucrats with cars and private dachas - who, in his view, "feast behind drawn curtains while the worker eats rationed bread". He does not directly challenge the Party. But he dares to champion the striking non-Party workers as "misguided comrades" and openly proclaims that the Workers' Opposition has seen clearly what the Party would become. His bloc, nicknamed the Ignatovites, quickly gains popularity in the Moscow Committee of the Party.\n\nKamenev, as Chairman of the Moscow Soviet, publicly denounced Ignatov's rhetoric as "irresponsible" and "divisive". The Molotites are livid, accusing the Mossoviet of harbouring Decist remnants - an early 1919 anti-Sverdlovite trend within the Party - under a new name. Some demand that Ignatov be arrested.

With the beginning of collectivization, the center of gravity in the party shifted dramatically. Bukharin, who was once cautious, now no longer masks his opposition to the peasant policies of the Zinovievite majority. His speeches sound persistent, his connections have intensified. And in the center of his attention is Moscow, the last bastion still under Bukharinist dominance, where Kamenev remains chairman of the Mossoviet not because of the power of the Soviets, but because of the weighty support of the Zinovievite backing.\n\nBut Kamenev's silence - his refusal to publicly condemn collectivization, his unwillingness to challenge Zinoviev, despite the fact that mass requisitions were wreaking havoc in the countryside - is increasingly forcing Bukharinists to go on the attack. Nikolay Uglanov is actively promoted by the Bukharin opposition as their main candidate for the Mossoviet presidium, who is not afraid to speak out against the party line when the peasant welfare is at stake. The Molotovites also launched a quiet campaign to add fuel to the fire. Although they are forced to support Kamenev as an alternative to Bukharin's revisionism, denouncing "double-dealing bourgeois careerism in the Moscow Committee", at the same time they fan the flames of distrust between Petrograd and Moscow, silently advancing Vladimir Zagorsky as their man for the first capital.\n\nThe factions are now actively preparing to re-elect the Moscow Party Committee and the Mossoviet, including its leader.

He offered no resistance when the Central Committee approved a quiet purge of the Moscow Party Committee. Bukharinist officials were replaced with Zinovievite cadres, many of them efficient and fiercely loyal to the Sovnarkom.

In public, it was a question of "administrative efficiency" and "proper policy implementation," but everyone understood the deeper truth - Zinoviev's line in Moscow had failed. For several weeks, Kamenev tried to balance between Zinoviev's program and the local party apparatus, which was dominated by Bukharinites. He did not suppress the slightest excitement, softened the sharpest rhetoric, but failed to turn loyalty to Zinoviev into firm domination by Moscow. He didn't lose the city-it just never really belonged to him."

russoc.261.d: "The confrontation over Moscow's leadership has not exploded into open factional warfare - not for lack of pressure, but due to one man's quiet resolve. Lev Kamenev, long seen as the balancing hand of the Politburo, has successfully mediated a fragile truce between the Zinovievites and the regrouped Bukharinists.\n\nIn discussions brokered by Kamenev, an unexpected consensus emerged. Zinoviev, ever the internationalist, conceded that Russia could not leap into socialism alone - a position Bukharin echoed through his call for a "gradual displacement" of private rural economies by cooperatives and public forms. Kamenev's own contribution - framing the technical backwardness of the countryside as the central obstacle - laid the groundwork for a narrative both factions could agree on.\n\nZinovievites maintain political control of Moscow, but in an act of trust and compromise, the influential Bukharinist figure Nikolay Uglanov has been appointed Secretary of the Mossoviet. Kamenev remains as head of the Moscow's presidium, no longer as a contested placeholder but as the keystone holding together an uneasy but critical alliance.\n\n[russoc_261_rykov]As the Zinovievite-Bukharinist bloc now dominates the Politburo, yet the kulaks remain, the countryside seethes in places unseen, and the Molotovites retreat - sharpening their knives.\n\nKamenev has built a bridge.

russoc.262.t: "A More Reliable Line"
russoc.262.d: "The thaw between the Zinovievites and the Bukharinists has begun to solidify into fixed form. With the support of the Mossoviet and a stable majority in the Politburo, the Sovnarkom began to redistribute responsibilities among trusted officials. One of the most symbolic appointments was the appointment of Aleksey Rykov, who had been isolated for a long time, and who has now been appointed People's Commissar of Communications.\n\nPeople's Commissariat of Communications as the central government body of the RSFSR, is responsible for the organization and operation of various types of communications, including telephone, mail and telegraph. Although Rykov will have no influence on agricultural directives or industrial policy and is unlikely to be allowed to take real power in Gosplan, this appointment has great symbolic significance. This is a signal to both party members and regional councils that the new unity of the Politburo is more than just a statement to the press.\n\nRykov himself, always obedient to duty, accepted this role with restrained optimism. In his first internal directive, he emphasized clarity, discipline, and ideological sobriety in all communication bodies. Although the Zinovievite Sovnarkom is still wary of its new allies, not allowing them to influence politics, this is an important step towards the unity of the country's leadership."

russoc.263.d: "The atmosphere in the Great Hall of the House of Soviets was tense as the delegates of the Russian Communist Party convened for the [GetBolshevikPartyCongressNumber] Congress. The debates were long anticipated, but no one could mistake the real target: the entrenched influence of the so-called Molotovite line.\n\nChairman of the Sovnarkom Zinoviev opened the session with a sweeping condemnation of "bureaucratic sclerosis" and "mechanical governance", denouncing recent years of "sectarian reductionism" as the source of grave distortion within the Party's ideological compass. His words were echoed by a string of speakers - some fiery, some weary - each aligning with the Party's consensus: that a new spirit of cadre renewal, ideological clarity, and comradely unity must define the Party.\n\nThe Congress adopted a historic resolution, On the Correction of Errors in Party Leadership, which emphasized the need to combat "factional delusionism". Though the faction was not formally outlawed, the resolution declared their recent political conduct to be "incompatible with the dialectical method of Bolshevik-Leninism" and an "insult to the creative capacity of the working class."\n\nWhile no names were named, the implications were clear. Vyacheslav Molotov, Aleksey Merekalov, Sergey Chutskayev, and several top Molotovite bureaucrats were relieved of their party functions or reassigned to posts of lesser responsibility, under the guise of a broader rotation of cadres.\n\nAmid applause and silent purges, a new vision was ratified: the Molotovites, gaslit as idealists lost to abstraction and disconnected from the workers, were politically shattered."

russoc.264.d: "The close of the latest Party Congress brings with it a host of organizational tasks - not least among them, the reappointment of the Executive Secretary of the Central Committee. Once considered a largely procedural role, the Secretariat has recently become a quiet but critical node of party activity. With the growing friction between the factions of the party, especially the persistent influence of the Molotovites, the decision on who should hold this position has once again come into focus.\n\nThe Bukharinists, newly empowered by the bloc with the ruling Zinovievites, have put forward Martemyan Ryutin as their candidate. A former chairman of the Workers' and Soldiers' Council in Harbin during the days of the First Revolution, Ryutin has a long - if turbulent - revolutionary pedigree. However, his ideological leanings align clearly with the Moscow Bolsheviks - and more importantly, with Bukharin's cautious, populist socialism.\n\nZinovievites, in turn, have suggested retaining Nikolay Krestinsky, the last Executive Secretary of the party during the pre-emigration years. Respected for his bureaucratic discipline and absolute loyalty, Krestinsky is seen by many as a stabilizing force in the Central Committee machine. Despite lacking bold ideological direction, he is trustworthy and competent - and unlikely to provoke internal squabbles."

russoc.265.t: "The Question of the VTsIK Chairman"
russoc.265.d: "The Revolution has brought not only the restoration of Bolshevik power, but the arduous task of rebuilding the very mechanism of Soviet governance. Among the newly restored institutions is the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK), formally the highest body of legislative and administrative power of Soviet Russia. While the 1918 Constitution clearly establishes the powers of the VTsIK and its Presidium, the practical supremacy of the Sovnarkom - and its chairman - has become the norm. Under Lenin, dual power was masked by his personal stature. But with Lenin gone, the question of whether the Sovnarkom or VTsIK is the true sovereign of the republic remains unresolved.\n\nIn the years before the Bolsheviks were forced into emigration, the post of Chairman was held by Yakov Sverdlov, most notably, whose moral and organizational authority helped unify a fragmented state apparatus. After his death, an active phase of the struggle for power began, and Mikhail Vladimirsky, Sverdlov's loyalist was appointed in his place. With the disintegration of the central Soviet institutions during the retreat and exile, the VTsIK was dissolved.\n\nNow, on the sidelines of the Central Committee, there is a fierce struggle for this position. Among the Zinovievites, the favored candidate is Pyotr Zalutsky, a loyal Petrograd cadre worker who served as a political officer in the Red Army during the darkest years of the Civil War. A more moderate option, also from the Zinovievite wing, is Nikolay Krestinsky, a respected old Bolshevik.\n\nThe name of Leonid Serebryakov, a Trotsky ex-supporter who defected to Zinoviev after his death, also surfaced. The Molotovites, in contrast, are pressing for Mikhail Vladimirsky, seeking to restore a sense of continuity. Another Molotovite proposal is Mikhail Kalinin, a compromise candidate connected to the Zinovievites, although he lacks an independent position. From the Bukharinist faction, the nominee is Vladimir Smirnov, an experienced administrator of the VSNKh and the Mossoviet during 1918-1920. Smirnov represents the technocratic and moderate elements of the party, those who oppose the central diktat."

russoc.266.d.intro: "Following extended deliberations within the Central Committee and behind-the-scenes negotiations among factional representatives, a vote was held to determine the new Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. As the highest nominal office of the Republic - presiding over the Congress of Soviets and formally supervising both legislative and executive bodies - the chairmanship is both symbolic and institutional, tying the Soviets directly to the Party's revolutionary leadership.\n\nWhile in practice real power rests within the Council of People's Commissars and the Politburo, the selection will likely shape the emerging administrative landscape for months, if not years, to come."
russoc.266.d: "$russoc.266.d.intro$\n\nPyotr Zalutsky, a Petrograd militant and trusted ally of Zinoviev since the early days of the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee, has been confirmed as Chairman. His appointment marks the consolidation of Petrograd's political class at the helm of the new Soviet Republic. As a political officer in the Red Army and a steady Party loyalist, Zalutsky's elevation signals a quiet but definitive return of the old Petrograd guard to center stage."
russoc.266.d2: "$russoc.266.d.intro$\n\nNikolay Krestinsky has been selected as the new Chairman of the VTsIK. A seasoned organizer and former Executive Secretary, Krestinsky is considered a reliable figure across various party currents, though closely aligned with Zinoviev's moderate allies."

On the second day of proceedings, Grigory Zinoviev, flanked by his allies Pyotr Zalutsky, Yevgeny Preobrazhensky, and Georgy Safarov, addressed the delegates with a keynote speech titled \"On the Regeneration of the Revolutionary Spirit and the Crisis of Party Morality\".\n\nWith fervor Zinoviev denounced the "pestilent relics of bourgeois pluralism" that, he claimed, had infected the Party under the guise of platformism and internal democracy. Declaring that the Revolution must now enter its second, moral-political phase, he warned that \"to preserve the hegemony of the proletariat, the Party must purge itself of the ideological rot brought forth by deviation, compromise, and factionalism\".\n\nIn carefully choreographed succession, Zalutsky and Preobrazhensky followed with invocations of Marx and Lenin to legitimize the initiative. Yevdokimov presented a short resolution calling for an intensification of agitational work across Party cells and a new campaign of ideological education.\n\nDespite scattered private murmurings, no open opposition was voiced on the floor."

What followed was a silent but coordinated campaign of appointments and structural redirection. In regional party bureaus, city committees, Red Army political departments, and the Soviets themselves, trusted partisans of the revolutionary line have begun occupying key posts of influence. These were not marked by public declarations, but by quiet reassignments, revisions of internal bylaws, and the sidelining of "undisciplined elements".\n\nIt is no longer sufficient, the Party has declared, to tolerate tendencies which disguise themselves under the name of internal debate. Instead, the Soviets - organs of genuine proletarian authority - must be harmonized with the Party's line in deed as well as in word. However, the grassroots are awaiting the Center's call - which ideological deviation is to face the tightening ring of proletarian vigilance?"

The debate this time did not concern trade figures, nor border fortifications or agricultural output, but the very structure of Party life itself.\n\nIt was Comrade [GetChekaLeader] from the [GetChekaName] and a known partisan of the current majority, who opened the matter. His voice, calm but unwavering, presented the proposal in terms that were difficult to ignore: the time had come to reaffirm Party unity by abolishing the formalized existence of factions. He cited recent disruptions in soviets, trade unions, and even among agitprop departments as examples of the "bureaucratic pluralism" that now infected the Party's bloodstream.\n\nFrom the floor, voices of concern emerged.

russoc.270.t2: "A Voice from the Right"
russoc.270.d: "During the current session of the Congress of Soviets, Comrade Vladimir Smirnov, an outspoken delegate and veteran revolutionary, took the floor in what many observers have described as a fiery and impassioned speech. In tandem with the publication of a formally structured appeal - entitled "For the Renewal of Party Democracy" - Smirnov has publicly denounced what he calls the "ossification of proletarian initiative under the strain of central authority". The signatories identified themselves as a "Group of Democratic Centralism".\n\nSmirnov's speech, grounded in ideological fidelity to the original tenets of democratic centralism, decried the current regime's "elevation of Party supervision over mass participation", warning of a creeping departure from the dictatorship of the proletariat toward what he euphemistically labeled "a dictatorship over the proletariat". Without naming specific figures, he clearly referred to the concentration of Party authority under the emerging line of Comrade Zinoviev.\n\nWhile Smirnov was immediately accused of engaging in platformist deviationism, others note that his critique represents a new ideological rupture distinct from both the Bukharinists and the Workers' Opposition. Emerging from within the broader Bukharinist milieu, Smirnov and his co-thinkers advocate a restoration of ideological pluralism, worker initiative, and decentralization - not merely within the state but within the Party itself. These interventions have stirred unrest among segments of the factory committees and local Soviets, especially in urban centers with active histories of syndicalist thought.\n\nIn a formal statement issued through the Presidium, Comrade Yefimov denounced the initiative as "democratic fetish"."
russoc.270.d2: "At the opening of the Congress of Soviets, Chairman of the VTsIK Vladimir Smirnov took the tribune not to ceremonially welcome delegates - but to deliver a searing political declaration. In a move unprecedented in the Soviet state's history, the presiding officer of its highest constitutional body broke with Party leadership on fundamental questions of governance.\n\nSmirnov's statement, published simultaneously in major Party and union press, called for the restoration of inner-Party democracy, the lifting of restrictions on ideological tendencies within the RKP, and the return of "the dictatorship of the proletariat, not of a single apparatus". The speech sharply criticized the growing concentration of power and accused the Party center of "liquidating initiative from below"\n\nThe speech was met with muted shock from the Congress delegates - few daring to applaud, many unsure of the implications. In private, however, Smirnov's public intervention triggered alarm among the Zinovievite leadership. By leveraging his state position, Smirnov had transformed a fringe ideological appeal into an institutional challenge, one that might theoretically be used to claim Party illegitimacy or even challenge its composition of Sovnarkom.\n\nThough his group styled itself the Platform of Democratic Centralism, Comrade Zinoviev dismissed the appellation as "constitutional adventurism". He accused Smirnov of blurring the boundary between the party's legitimate internal life and the external organs of power, warning that such a maneuver threatened "the unity of the proletarian dictatorship"."

russoc.271.t: "Rationalization of the Planning Apparatus"
russoc.271.d.intro: "In a report delivered to the Party, Comrade Preobrazhensky presented a sweeping initiative for the reorganization of the Gosplan. The proposal, formally backed by the Central Committee, advocates a return to what he termed "a conscious alignment of planning with the ideological hegemony of the proletariat", accusing certain technocratic tendencies of drifting into instrumentalism devoid of revolutionary vision. The proposed restructuring is to be overseen by the Central Committee and shall prioritize ideological coherence and long-range industrial mobilization.[russoc_271_smilga] Debate at the Plenum focused primarily on the future of the current leadership of Gosplan."
russoc_271_d_smilga: " Comrade Smilga, deputy Chairman of the Gosplan, endorsed the initiative, denouncing "passive-functionalist planning" as a deviation from Bolshevik methods."
russoc.271.d: "$russoc.271.d.intro$\n\nKrzhizhanovsky, a veteran of the Party's planning efforts and a moderate voice in recent years, expressed concern about the "premature politicization" of technical functions. While not directly opposed, he questioned the subordination of autonomous economic forecasting to "executive impatience."\n\nSome Party members suggested his quiet transfer to the Academy of Sciences. The proposal, though not yet formalized, reflects growing discomfort with his preference for decentralist tendencies and reluctance to subordinate planning entirely to Party primacy."
russoc.271.d2: "Comrade Kuybyshev welcomed the initiative with guarded approval. His speech before the Central Committee reaffirmed his loyalty to the Plenum's directive.\n\nFor now, his position appears secure - though some observers note his calculated alignment with Zinovievite currents and speculate on his motives. The Politburo has opted to retain him in the post, praising his organizational talent."
russoc.271.d3: "Mezhlauk, known for his technical efficiency and low political profile, accepted the reforms in full. He received cautious praise from Preobrazhensky as an "engineer of proletarian economy".\n\nThe Politburo will probably retain Mezhlauk, but he has been instructed to undergo regular oversight by Party commissars to ensure continued loyalty to the new direction."
russoc.271.d4: "The presence of Kaganovich, a known partisan of the Hardline faction, sparked the sharpest controversy. His opposition to the reforms was denounced by the Plenum as "a reactionary distortion of Leninist statecraft".\n\nA motion was passed recommending his immediate dismissal, with a temporary oversight body established to manage Gosplan pending new leadership."
russoc.271.d5: "Strumilin's scholarly critique of the reforms - which he accused of conflating Party oversight with "economic voluntarism" - failed to persuade the Politburo.

The People's Commissariat of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection (Rabkrin) will be tasked with supervising the conduct and efficiency of the state administration, while the newly constituted Central Control Commission (TsKK) will serve as the party's internal watchdog, empowered to investigate violations of party discipline, ethical norms, and signs of factionalism, corruption, and personal misconduct.\n\nBoth bodies will serve as bulwarks against what has been described in internal party memoranda as a creeping "moral corrosion" of grassroots organizations, citing incidents of careerism, drunkenness, nepotism, and disloyalty. The TsKK, in particular, will be granted decisive voting power at joint plenums of the Central Committee and Control Commission.\n\nWhile formally justified in terms of Leninist vigilance and proletarian accountability, these organs are also widely understood to mark a new stage in the centralization of intra-party control. Their creation has stirred unease among the ranks of both Bukharinist and Molotovite-aligned members, who quietly voice concerns over the potential for these commissions to be used as instruments of political cleansing. Nonetheless, the decree is already passed; only the question of leadership remains."

Alongside it, the Central Control Commission (TsKK) has been constituted to enforce Party discipline, ethical standards, and adherence to ideological norms.\n\nThese bodies are designed to function as continuous oversight structures, embedded into the workflow of Soviet governance. Their reports will be submitted directly to the Secretariat and relevant Party bodies, allowing for early detection of inefficiencies, misconduct, or signs of internal deviation. This development is part of a broader reassertion of organizational coherence following recent disruptions to state authority.\n\nComrade Nikolay Shvernik has been appointed People's Commissar of Rabkrin.

Therefore, it was dissolved.\n\nThough the decree praises the past utility of the STO during the period of war and reconstruction, it explicitly states that the body has in recent years hindered the unification and rationalization of planning and reproduced outdated dualisms between the Party's economic mandate and the old administrative apparatus. The elimination of the STO comes as part of a broader drive toward streamlining economic governance and eliminating parallel hierarchies of control. The now-former Chairman of the Council, Vyacheslav Molotov, was thanked in a brief official statement for his past service and is to be retired from all governmental duties. No successor institution or post will be established in his place.\n\nIn internal discussions, several members of the Central Committee characterized the STO as having become a redoubt of procedural obstructionism, and its dissolution marks a final blow to the political grouping informally associated with the so-called Molotov current.\n\nThe coordination of planning and defense-related industry will henceforth be redistributed among appropriate commissariats and the organs of VSNKh, under Party guidance."

Even the unions no longer listen. His circle - stubborn, aging radicals, old factory delegates, and a few Menshevik-adjacent intellectuals - has become an intellectual curiosity at best, a security risk at worst. But Zinoviev has no intention of allowing the revolution to be haunted by the ghosts of deviation. Though the Workers' Opposition is defeated in form, it survives in memory - and memory is dangerous.\n\nThe Orgburo and the NKVD have presented a final proposal: to remove the last remnants of the Workers' Opposition from political life entirely - as a "cleansing of ideological dead matter."

Their conduct, couched in outdated syndicalist rhetoric, was found to be incompatible with the current stage of proletarian governance.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the Party Control Commission and the legal findings of the Commissariat of Justice, the following measures have been enacted: Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, as the group's central figure, has been sentenced to ten years' internal exile in the Far North. Gavriil Myasnikov has been sentenced to twelve years' imprisonment in a secure facility. Vladimir Nevsky and Sergey Medvedev have received terms of five to eight years' confinement, with the possibility of early release upon demonstration of political correction.

What remains of this tendency, led by Nikolay Bukharin,[russoc_276_rykov_check] Mikhail Tomsky, and others, has long since been ideologically hollowed out by the failure of its core economic vision.\n\nThroughout the years of the Soviet Republic's rebirth, the Bukharinists maintained a call for economic moderation: a reformed market economy, lenient industrial management, and cautious collectivization. None of this materialized. Instead, the true Leninist Party took the opposite course - pursuing collectivization, eliminating private property, and restoring state control over planning and distribution. The Bukharinists lost their foothold in the Mossoviet and their remaining base among the technical intelligentsia became fragmented, with many former allies, such as Grigory Sokolnikov and Aleksey Stetsky, now supporting the Party line. Even Sergey Kirov, once one of Bukharin's allies, now speaks openly from our positions.\n\nNow, the Party Control Commission has opened an official case on the ideological deviation of the remaining Bukharinists. The inquiry accuses the group not of direct counter-revolutionary activity, but of fostering political confusion and sabotage through "systematic revisionism", obstructing central economic planning, and maintaining illegal personal networks hostile to the Party's leadership.\n\nThe Commission has submitted a resolution for approval: the expulsion of Bukharin, Rykov, and Tomsky from the Party and the trial of several second-tier cadre for anti-Party activity."

The accusations focus not merely on their ideological heresy, but also their deliberate obstruction of the party line on collectivization, their informal influence over Moscow's economic administration, and their quiet coordination with bourgeois academic and managerial cliques.\n\nProsecutors cite as evidence a series of private memoranda circulated by Bukharin during his tenure as member of the Politburo, in which he advocated for the preservation of private property in agriculture, autonomy in pricing, and "long-term tolerance" of the NEP - all contrary to the proletarian line.\n\nGrigory Zinoviev has been cautious in tone.

Silent during most proceedings, he refused to testify in his defense, nor did he seek to appeal to the court's mercy.\n\nTomsky, once the "worker's voice" in the RTsSPS, had long since lost his influence - first to Bukharin's soft-spoken moderation, then to Zinoviev's unrelenting restructuring of the party-state. His role in sheltering technocrats, undermining labor centralization, and quietly opposing the dissolution of independent union functions had been cited in the indictment.\n\nThe Party has released a short communiqué:\n\"Comrade M. P. Tomsky, once a participant in the labor movement, ended his life in the midst of the investigation into the Rightist Opposition.

russoc.279.d: "The final report of the Commission is on the [GetZinovievTitle]'s desk, each page is an accusation not only of the misconduct of individuals, but also of a cynical kind of Bolshevism that promoted coercion, hierarchy, and most importantly administrative centralism, doctrinaire discipline, and the rejection of dialectics in favor of moralism masquerading as Marxism. Zinovievite theorists of Bolshevik-Leninism had long warned of 'bureaucratic degeneration' that threatened to stifle the revolutionary initiative and fervor of the proletariat. And so it was - an informal network of former officials, apparatchiks and all those bureaucrats who checked the numbers to a few zeros after the decimal point, loyal to Vyacheslav Molotov, stubbornly ignored the Party directives. With the help of covert agitation, the cover of reactionary figures, and mechanical work to discredit the most prominent members of the Party and the Central Committee, the Molotovites tried to resist the ideological renewal that Zinoviev declared necessary for the new Soviet state.\n\nVyacheslav Molotov himself, a the grey bureaucrat who posed himself the heir to the Sverdlovite-Leninist vigilance, had long since been removed from his post in the Council of Labor and Defense. His undignified tenure as Minister Plenipotentiary to Paris, a position he neither wanted nor ideologically respected, served as a final chapter in a career marked only by procedural rigidity. He denies the charges. A wide swath of Molotov's former allies - from Genrikh Yagoda and Lazar Kaganovich to Vladimir Zagorsky and Mikhail Vladimirsky - deny the charges too. However, some of the former members of this "tendency", such as Mikhail Kalinin, have publicly distanced themselves from the clique, aligning with the Party's renewed revolutionary spirit. Others, like Zemlyachka and Shvernik, are attempting quite compliance. However, they all testified against Molotov, Kaganovich, and other names, whom they considered important figures in this counterrevolutionary movement.\n\nNow the Party must choose how history will remember this deviation. The trial, if it takes place, will be public - not for theatrical reasons, but in order to arm the working masses with knowledge about what corrupted their institutions and why it should never be allowed again."

russoc.280.t: "The Party Divided"
russoc.280.d: "In August 1918, Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik party, was assassinated in Moscow. His death marked not only the end of an era but also a critical juncture for the future of the Bolshevik movement. The civil war raged across the Volga region, and the Red Army struggled to maintain control over Petrograd and Moscow. After Lenin's death, the party lost not only its theoretical and political leader, but also a guarantor of the balance of power between various factions. Simultaneously, a power struggle erupted, mainly between Lev Trotsky, Chairman of the RVSR and de-facto head of the Red Army, and Yakov Sverdlov - Chairman of the VTsIK.\n\nThe Emergency VIII Congress of the RKP(b) was hastily convened in September to address these issues. Aleksey Rykov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, was appointed as Lenin's successor in title, though not in stature. At the 8th Congress, the ideological and political center, control over the Sovnarkom and the Central Committee after Lenin's death, was immediately seized by the majority in the newly elected collective body of the party leadership - the Politburo of the RKP, represented by the Troika of Sverdlov, Zinoviev and Kamenev, as well as Bukharin and Rykov, who joined them, and the Executive Secretary Krestinsky and People's Commissar of Nationalities, Stalin. This powerful "Semyorka" left Trotsky all alone in the Politburo. In the background, the "Military Opposition" to Trotsky's reforms in the Red Army, has already taken shape ideologically. Its supporters - often provincial organizers and Red Army officers - condemned his return to "bourgeois command culture".\n\nBy tactically supporting the "Military Opposition", the Politburo significantly weakened Trotsky and prevented him from implementing many of his plans. But everything had to be decided by the upcoming 9th Party Congress..."
russoc.280.a: "What happened next?"

russoc.281.t: "The Fall of Moscow and Petrograd"
russoc.281.d: "The 9th Congress of the RKP was convened earlier than scheduled. The catalyst for this event was the sudden death of Yakov Sverdlov in March 1919. Sverdlov had been the de facto leader of the party's inner circle and central apparatus. His untimely demise caused a temporary disruption in the party's unity, but so far Trotsky controlled only the Red Army, while his opponents controlled the Cheka, the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets, the Sovnarkom and the Party's ideology.\n\nThe 9th Congress elected Mikhail Vladimirsky, a loyal Sverdlovite, as the new head of the VTsIK, while Trotsky's military reform was absolutely defeated by the party majority. The party's position was clear - no tsarist military experts (voenspetsy), but increased power for party commissars, support for the workers' militia and the Red Guards. This predetermined not only the victory over Trotsky, but also the collapse of the front.\n\nWhile Zinoviev assumed control over the Politburo, the Sovnarkom, and the Secretariat, the situation on the front was deteriorating, and the rear was becoming increasingly unstable. The White forces captured Moscow, arresting almost the entire Moscow Party organization for a sham trial. Trotsky disappeared during the battle for Moscow, leaving Revolutionary Petrograd as the sole bastion of Bolshevism.\n\nAs a result of the Emergency 10th Party Congress, Zinoviev became the new Chairman of the Sovnarkom, effectively assuming sole rule over the doomed Soviet republic. He transformed into a messianic figure, delivering speeches filled with revolutionary fatalism and promising retribution. He blamed both Trotsky and the "Military Opposition" for the setbacks.\n\nThis Red Petrograd, the final bastion of the Russian Revolution, would fall soon after Moscow, with the "Worker's Dictator" Zinoviev fleeing to revolutionary-torn Commune of France."

russoc.282.t: "[GetBolshevikPartyCongressNumber] Congress of the RKP"
russoc.282.d: "The new resolution, officially adopted at the plenary session of the Central Committee and disseminated throughout Party branches, affirms what Zinoviev terms the dialectical tension inherent in the Leninist Party – a dynamic of ideological contention and disciplined cohesion. This resolution represents a re-evaluation of Democratic Centralism, aimed at reestablishing the unity of the fractured Bolshevik movement.\n\nZinoviev contends that factionalism is an essential process of elucidation prior to arriving at a resolution. The Party must continue to be a forum for vigorous internal debates on political matters, leadership, and socialist development. As long as these discussions culminate in a vote, with the opposition yielding to a collective decision, the spirit of Leninism persists.\n\nThis doctrine directly challenges both the legacy of Trotskyite maximalism and the authoritarianism of the Molotovite faction. The Party is not a monolithic entity, but a collective will. Zinoviev cites the writings of left-leaning communists and the controversies surrounding the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty to demonstrate that even Lenin himself tolerated debate as long as it remained within the confines of the Party and resulted in a decision.\n\nSimultaneously, in accordance with this novel framework, it is prohibited to establish parallel centres of power or to descend into parliamentary chaos. The dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be substituted by the dictatorship of commissars. Although the opposition viewed this as a liberalisation and a tactical retreat, the Cheka persists, the propaganda machine operates uninterruptedly, and Petrogradskaya Pravda continues to report on the successes of the Zinovievites."

russoc.283.t: "Collectivization Begins"
russoc.283.d: "In the shadow of ruined harvests and mounting reports of rural hoarding, the Party has moved decisively. Comrade Zinoviev, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, has announced the beginning of full collectivization across the territories under Soviet control. Rejecting the hesitation of Rightist elements as remnants of petty-bourgeois sentimentality, Zinoviev framed the policy as a decisive turn toward the "Revolution in the village" - the long-deferred alliance of the proletariat and the poor peasantry against kulak parasitism. Collectivization, he argued in a thunderous address before the Central Committee, is not a mere economic reform, but the extension of proletarian hegemony to the last corner of Russian life.\n\nThe Zinovievite line is clear: the kulak is a class enemy, the village must be reorganized along revolutionary lines, and the Party must lead, guide, and - if necessary - discipline the countryside into its socialist future.\n\nNot all within the party welcomed the move. The Bukharinists protested and warned that coercion in the village could rupture the worker-peasant smychka. Their objections were swiftly overruled. In a closed session, Zinoviev dismissed their concerns as "infantile rightism", and reminded the gathering that unity in action is the bedrock of Leninism.\n\nThe machinery of collectivization now grinds into motion - backed by the commissariats, Party agitators, and the organs of proletarian vigilance. Grain, land, and labor shall be socialized."
russoc.283.a: "Hesitation is counter-revolution."

russoc.284.t: "The Goskhoz Debate"
russoc.284.d: "Ideological disputes are reigniting in the halls of the Central Committee. Despite the fact that the plenum of the Central Committee has confidently adopted a directive on general collectivization, the challenge is no longer whether to collectivize, but how. The peasantry remains the bedrock of the countryside, yet the method by which it is integrated into socialism remains the subject of fierce disputes between the factions.\n\nAt the center of the discussion is the issue of organizational form. The Zinovievites argue for an aggressive but structured transition to the agricultural artels (SKhA), which, while upholding collective labor and property, still allows limited personal subsistence and preserves peasant dignity. Zinoviev, referring to Lenin, speaks of "constructive proletarian leadership of the countryside".\n\nBukharinists find themselves divided. While Bukharin himself advocates a cautious fight against the kulaks in combination with support for voluntary collectives and cooperation, Aleksey Rykov demands a halt to the entire plan. These new 'Rykovites' advocate an evolutionary path to "peasant socialism" based on the autonomy of small farmers and respect for market forms. Zinoviev and the majority accused Rykov of "neo-Narodnik drift".\n\nThe Molotovites, who are less interested in ideological nuances and more interested in quick results, propose an agricultural commune (SKhK) as an ideal. They view the total socialization of rural life as a test of the will of the proletariat, supporting forced dispossession and arguing that equal consumption and full collectivism will form a new socialist man.\n\nAlthough the factions continue to argue endlessly, the [GetBolshevikPartyCongressNumber] Party congress has been convened to put a final end to this issue."

With Bukharin himself increasingly seen as conciliatory toward the Zinovievites, a group of resolute agrarian socialists has declared their ideological independence under the leadership of Aleksey Rykov. In fiery speeches circulating throughout rural cadres, regional officials and even the Central Committee, the Rykovites have begun denouncing the "defeatist" tendencies of their erstwhile leader, accusing Bukharin of betraying the village and abandoning the foundational principles of evolutionary socialism in favor of opportunism and careerism.\n\nPositioning themselves as the champions of peasant socialism, the Rykovites reject forced collectivization, advocating instead a model of gradual involvement of peasants into socialism through the spirit of cooperatives and TOZ, the predominant form of collective farming in rural areas as of now.\n\nPredictably, the Zinovievite ideologues have moved quickly to contain the deviation, reminding that while free discussion is encouraged, the Party had already spoken at the last Congress. In party publications, Rykov's propositions were denounced as right-wing, quasi-Narodnik distortions - an "anti-Marxist delusion about socialism without class struggle". The new deviation is labeled "agrarian utopianism" at best, sabotage at worst.\n\nBukharin himself openly distanced from the schism, calling for unity within the party. To the Molotovites, the Rykovites are simply the final degeneration of Bukharinism - a reactionary formation clinging to obsolete illusions."

russoc.286.t: "The Long Eclipse of Bukharin"
russoc.286.d: "Surprisingly, despite the resolution of the Party Congress which permitted discussions and which tolerated 'intra-party democracy', the influence of the Bukharinist faction has slowly begun to fade. Their platform, once the backbone of moderate politics among the peasantry, now appears to be a relic, having been smoothed over and absorbed by the policies advocated by Zinoviev. The recent integration of several key Bukharinist economic planners into joint committees with the VSNKh, frequently under the nominal leadership of Zinovievites, has further weakened the coherence of the faction.\n\nGrigory Sokolnikov, once an advocate of the NEP, never saw its implementation and formally renounced his support for this unfulfilled policy. Sergey Kirov, formerly sympathetic to the Popular Front, had long since joined the ranks of the bureaucracy within the Orgburo.\n\nAnd this is only to mention prominent figures. The increasing number of mid-level officials, particularly in provincial councils, the Gosplan and the VSNKh, are now avoiding public association with Bukharin. An increasing number of individuals are expressing their loyalty directly to the Proletarian Charter and identifying themselves as "loyal Leninists".\n\nBukharin himself remains in place, but following the decision of the [GetPreviousBolshevikPartyCongressNumber] Party Congress, he has been relegated to the status of "Candidate to the Central Committee". His words now draw fewer and fewer echoes. In general, Bukharin has long since resigned himself to adapting, gradually forgetting about his moderate agenda, justifying it solely by the necessity of fighting under the circumstances of the "Kerenskyist-Chernovite bourgeois dictatorship". Once leading the "Left Communists" and his support for War Communism during the First Civil War merely confirm uncomfortable truth of the Zinovievite line - it is the Party that guides its pastors."

russoc.287.d: "Of all the Party's tongues, Molotov's was once the most unyielding. Yet these days, the once vociferous voice of the hardliners has grown curiously silent. Since the Congress, with its careful assertion of the freedom of internal Party debates, many within the Molotovites found themselves marginalized - albeit imperceptibly.\n\nAdministrative changes, the disbanding of committees, and the discreet dismissal of prominent regional organizers have eroded the group's influence. Mikhail Kalinin, once regarded as a prominent advocate for bureaucrats, has long served as a steadfast propagandist of Zinoviev's message. Gosplan planners quietly carry out their duties, while diplomats abroad follow the directives from the Politburo at first call.\n\nThe Party has demonstrated its skill in praising loyal "Bolshevik cadres", while disregarding the instigators. Molotov continues to attend Party Congresses, and his name occasionally appears in decrees. However, a younger cadre of administrators, predominantly former workers, unquestioningly and sometimes tacitly adhere to the Proletarian Charter and the edicts issued by the Sovnarkom. Ideological dissent is disregarded, with their sole allegiance extended to their working-class government and its Vozhd, Zinoviev. Those who still dare to murmur about Sverdlovite severity and perfectionism receive no support, and time clearly works against them."

russoc.288.t: "The Legacy of the Military Opposition"
russoc.288.d: "\"We have long since buried the Trotskyite myth of the military genius\", begins an article in 'Kommunist', marking the start of the military reforms. "But the question remains: what kind of army did the Revolution need in 1919 - and what kind must it build now?"\n\nIn the last months of the First Civil War, the so-called Military Opposition emerged from the party ranks, which challenged the methods of the chairman of the RVSR, Lev Trotsky. Composed of veteran Bolsheviks, worker-commanders, and political organizers, the faction condemned dangerous overreliance on ex-Tsarist military specialists (voyenspetsy), a disregard for commissar authority, and Trotsky's excessive despotism. In fact, the faction was opposed to the establishment of a conventional military force.\n\nWith the Party Central Committee turning decisively against Trotsky in early 1919, the Military Opposition's critique gained traction. The IX Congress of the RKP approved tighter Party control over the Red Army, expanded the role of political commissars, and scaled back the unchecked authority of Voyenspetsy. Yet even then, the leadership hesitated to fully embrace the Opposition's more radical demands. Their vision, although approved, was only partially realized before the dramatic collapse of the front and the fall of Moscow, and the sudden disappearance of Trotsky himself. The failures of 1919 tarnished both his name and those of his fiercest critics.\n\nToday, the Party regards the Military Opposition as an ideology elevated above strategy. And yet, in the Party's unshakable hold over the armed forces, one still finds the quiet echo of their demands. The resurgent Red Army of today is no longer Trotsky's army. Nor is it the dream of the romantics of 1919. This is the Army of Party Socialism, forged in the struggle, guided by discipline and led not only by specialists alone, but also by the will of the Revolution itself."

russoc.289.t: "Diverging Military Visions"
russoc.289.d: "As the Party initiates a broad reform of the armed forces in the wake of the Civil War's conclusion and the lessons of 1919, a three-way divergence has emerged among commanding cadres, military planners, and ideological supervisors. The ideological unity of the army is not in question - Trotskyite Bonapartism has been decisively repudiated - but the form and function of the future Red military apparatus is now the subject of high-level debate.\n\nA cadre of forward-looking military intellectuals advocates for a transformation of the Red Army into the NRKA – National-Revolutionary Red Army. This group emphasizes the development of large-scale operational art, motorization, airborne forces, centralized radio networks, and military academies. Though formally obedient to Party oversight, the Reformers frequently reference elements of pre-1919 Trotskyite planning - reinterpreted - to justify their program. Politically, they enjoy tacit support of all Internationalist circles, including the Bukharinists\n\nAnother group, led ideologically by the Political Department of the RVSR (PUR), this formation insists on the centrality of Party-command unity. This 'Army of Party Socialism' rejects both the militarist elitism of Trotsky and the romantic partisanship of the early Red Guards. Instead, it seeks a trained, permanent force under full political supervision - a Red Army rooted in workers' guards, ideological education, and centralized planning. The PUR is the dominant line of the Zinovievites.\n\nThe third group is a looser coalition of front-line veterans and military populists, who advocate the preservation of the RKKA identity as a mass, mobilizable, proletarian army. Their emphasis is on preserving the army's peasant-worker character, reinforcing commissars, and ensuring that unit commanders remain responsive to the morale and social needs of their troops. They support discipline, but stress the army's function as a social school of the revolution, not merely an instrument of command. Called unofficially 'Movement of the Soldier Armies (DSA)', it is loosely aligned with the Molotovite bloc, and gets support of the moderates within the party as well.\n\nWhile no outright conflict has yet erupted, these divisions have begun to manifest in staffing preferences, resource allocation, and officer promotions."

russoc.297.d: "The image of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin is everywhere - in schoolrooms and factories, above stages and in Party offices, etched into coins and embossed on textbooks. In our Soviet Republic, Lenin's teachings and covenants are the moral and ideological core of the state.\n\nLenin is a perpetual guide - the architect of the Party-State, the supreme teacher of the proletariat, and the conscience of the revolution. His works are required study in every Soviet institution. Under the guidance of the Central Committee's Agitprop and Narkompros, Lenin's speeches are taught alongside commentaries written by Zinoviev and other top Party members. Monuments are constructed all across the country. His portrait, always present, is never alone: he stands alongside Marx and Engels, not above them, as the Russian torchbearer of their legacy.\n\nTo honor Lenin is to obey the Party. And to speak in his name is a sacred act - one claimed most often by the man seen as his most faithful student: Grigory Zinoviev."
russoc.297.d2: "In the latest directive issued by the Agitprop, the role of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin has been formally redefined as the intellectual progenitor of the modern socialist state. No longer merely the leader of a bygone revolutionary epoch, Lenin is now presented as the first theorist of centralized Soviet governance and the forerunner of the doctrine of Socialism in One State.\n\nNew educational syllabi and agitational texts emphasize not the chaos of 1917 or the global hopes of proletarian uprising, but rather Lenin’s focus on the dictatorship of the proletariat, state planning, and the need for iron discipline in the early years of power. Lenin is shown as warning against "leftist delusions" and romantic internationalism - errors later embodied, the state now claims, by Trotsky, Zinoviev, and others who "misused his memory for factional purposes".\n\nOfficial histories have been revised. Kamenev, Trotsky, and Zinoviev appear as minor functionaries, increasingly effaced from the record or subtly reframed as ideological deviations. In museums, Lenin's partnership is now exclusively shown with Sverdlov; in political education centers, his legacy terminates cleanly in the doctrine of Molotov.\n\nAcross the country, busts of Lenin are standardized and placed in every factory, school, and brigade assembly hall. Each government office now bears a framed quotation on the "tasks of the proletarian state" as selected by the Agitprop."
russoc.297.a: "Lenin lives - in every factory, in every school, in every heart."

russoc.298.t: "Anniversary of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin"
russoc.298.d: "Each April, the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment orchestrates a nationwide celebration to honor the birth of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin - the flame of the October Revolution, the teacher of the proletariat, and the founder of our Soviet Republic. But this year's commemoration, the first under the renewed ideological guidance of Comrade Zinoviev, bears a distinctly new tone.\n\nThe event opened with a mass reading of State and Revolution, conducted simultaneously in hundreds of workers' clubs, schools, and Red Army garrisons. But the centerpiece was a carefully choreographed speech by Comrade Zinoviev himself, broadcast across the Republic. He spoke not only of Lenin the leader, but of Lenin the thinker - the man who "armed the working class with theory and entrusted it to Party discipline."\n\nThis year's edition of the Lenin Reader, distributed by the Party press, features prefaces and annotations authored by members of the Agitprop. The additions aim to clarify Lenin's positions on the dictatorship of the proletariat, Party unity, and the dangers of revisionism - subtly reinforcing Zinoviev's own line as the authentic continuation of Leninist thought.\n\nAcross the Republic, banners proclaim:\n"With Lenin's Course Towards Communism!"\n"The Party is the Mind, Honor, and Conscience of Our Epoch"\n\nYet some, especially among the Bukharinist intelligentsia, have quietly noted that this celebration feels less like an act of memory - and more like a mirror."

russoc.300.t: "Question of the STO"
russoc.300.d: "Now that the war is over, governance shifts from the trenches back into bureaucratic corridors. One lingering institution now casts a long shadow over the postwar order: the Council of Labor and Defense.\n\nOriginally convened under wartime emergency, the STO was never sanctioned by the 1918 Constitution. Chaired by Vyacheslav Molotov, it has become a parallel center of power - overseeing Gosplan, issuing instructions to military and industrial organs, and operating semi-independently of both the Sovnarkom and Central Committee. With peace restored, Chairman Zinoviev has begun questioning whether this arrangement should persist. Officially, the STO was always an extraordinary coordination body. In practice, it now resembles a state within a state - and Molotov's enduring chairmanship offers him influence that exceeds his formal titles.\n\nA legalist memorandum from Zinoviev's allies in the Sovnarkom proposes to "reorganize" the STO in line with Chapter VIII of the 1918 RSFSR Constitution, citing the necessity of a return to unified peacetime administration. The Bukharinists cautiously support limiting the STO's military authority, but claim that the economic planning should continue under its umbrella - expanded to include Bukharinist specialists.\n\nWithin the Secretariat and several People's Commissariats, Molotov-aligned officials obstruct attempts to place the issue on the VTsIK agenda. Informal channels, bulletins, and whisper campaigns warn of the "hasty disarmament of the wartime state". Molotov remains silent, issuing no public defense, as if the mere existence of the STO speaks for itself. But the pressure is clear."

russoc.301.t: "Circular No. 42/1: On Strengthening Cadre Consistency"
russoc.301.d: "The letter arrived early in the morning. Ten pages, typed and numbered, bearing the seal of the Secretariat and signed personally by Executive Secretary S. Ye. Chutskayev. Officially titled Circular No. 42/1, the document offered unremarkable guidance: a reaffirmation of the Party's commitment to cadre discipline, the importance of political reliability at all levels, and a new round of routine "reappointments and verifications: at the level of gubkoms and raykoms.\n\nBut those who read between the lines - and those in the know - understood the deeper significance.\n\nAccompanying the circular was an enclosed list of recommended transfers and appointments, carefully prepared by Chutskayev's personnel staff. Young technocrats trained in Gosplan-adjacent institutions, loyal district organizers from the Urals and Lower Volga, and middling apparatchiks who had quietly fallen into the Molotovite orbit. The regional committees, already stretched thin after months of quiet factional jostling, rarely questioned the instructions. Most carried them out word for word.\n\nElsewhere, "Letters from the Center" began circulating among district party workers. These letters urged vigilance, extolled the virtues of "conscious Party discipline", and subtly criticized the growing "theatricality in higher discourse." It was not a direct attack on Zinoviev, but few mistook its meaning.\n\nFor now, Chutskayev remained quiet. His tone in meetings was clipped, deferential. When asked about the reassignments, he cited "routine strategic alignment with the Party's long-term tasks". But beneath the official language, the machine had begun to move."
russoc.301.a: "The Secretariat begins its work."

russoc.302.t: "A Change of Pens and Faces"
russoc.302.d: "The door to Office No. 47 closes gently behind the departing departmental assistant. Inside, the new Deputy Head of the Party Cadres Department - a young apparatchik from Perm - slides a fresh dossier into the cabinet. The label reads: "Approved – VTsIK oversight confirmed."\n\nAcross the halls of the Central Committee building, the same quiet routine repeats itself: instructors reassigned, correspondence intercepted, memos rewritten. A wave of new appointments filters in under the cover of routine rotation. The reshuffle is subtle, masked in efficiency.\n\nYet beneath the bureaucratic veil, the Secretariat has begun to squeeze the levers of the Party's internal machinery. Every personnel file now passes through Sergey Chutskayev's office. His men - selected for quiet loyalty - are embedding themselves in departments that long resisted politicization: Light Industry, Transport, Finances.\n\nIn the editorial rooms of Pravda and Izvestia, the changes are even more delicate. No firings - not yet. Instead, editorial boards are "restructured" under pretexts of generational renewal and technological modernization. Zinovievite intellectuals, long the vanguard of the Party's rhetorical line, find themselves relegated to reviews of minor congresses or quietly "promoted" to ideological think tanks in Voronezh, [217.GetName] or [653.GetName]. Bukharinists, too, begin to feel the pressure. A once-prominent economic theorist, loosely aligned with the "moderates" receives an urgent invitation to join a trade delegation to China - indefinitely."
russoc.302.a: "This is starting to raise suspicions..."

russoc.303.t: "\"Unavoidable Interpretations\""
russoc.303.d: "A plain-looking bulletin lies open on the desk of a district secretary in Saratov. Its stamped heading reads: CIRCULAR 19-B/73 - On the Goals of Revolutionary Education in the Cadre Schools, Following the Decision of the Politburo (Draft Resolution, 2nd Reading). Next to it, another version sits half-folded - similar phrasing, same number, slightly different content.\n\nThe secretary leans back, furrowing his brow. One version quotes Chairman Zinoviev's address to the Higher School of Party Instruction: \"The task of ideological education is the formation of total class-consciousness - the merging of state function and proletarian spirit.\"\nThe other contains a starkly different emphasis: \"Ideological education must ensure the reliability of cadre practice and the enforcement of Party-adopted production goals.\" Zinoviev isn't mentioned at all.\n\nIn offices from Voronezh to Chelyabinsk, instructors, secretaries, and agitprop heads send telegrams. Some districts pause implementation altogether, awaiting clarification. Others treat one version as the line, the other as rumor. At the heart of the discrepancy is the Secretariat. Beneath the surface of its clerical efficiency, Sergey Chutskayev's people have begun filtering all resolutions that originate from Zinoviev's wing. Some are delayed. Others are rewritten in the style of bureaucratic necessity - less rhetorical, more technocratic. Some of the newspapers gently echoes the Secretariat's interpretations. The others print Chairman Zinoviev's quote. In the Party's own internal digest, a minor editorial asks: \"In the event of unclarity between overlapping directives, should we not trust those closest to practical administration?\"\n\nIn Politburo, Zinoviev remains focused on higher ideological initiatives and the upcoming World Revolution. He believes all is well. But in the provinces, whispers grow:"
russoc.303.a: "\"What exactly did the Chairman say - and who's interpreting it?\""

russoc.304.t: "The Voice of the Masses"
russoc.304.d: "In the offices of the Secretariat's Department for Party Correspondence, the sorting machines hum, but fewer and fewer letters are actually passed beyond them. A discreet instruction - never put to paper - now guides how the Secretariat processes member appeals and complaints addressed to the Central Committee or the Sovnarkom: delay, dilute, defer.\n\nWorker and cadre letters surging before major plenums now less and less frequently compete their destination. Many are never forwarded. Some are "clarified" in summaries that omit pointed criticisms or inconvenient questions. Others are quietly filed away, marked as "resolved at the local level". When inquiries are too urgent to ignore, replies are issued on behalf of faceless departments rather than the Central Committee. At the same time, small but telling deviations begin to shadow Zinoviev's public appearances. On a recent visit to [252.GetName], he arrived to a reception committee of mid-ranking officials. A regional newspaper headline announced his visit the day after he had left. Local resolutions expressing enthusiasm were strangely formulaic - or missing altogether. In [195.GetName], a district party school quoted Zinoviev's speech from last year, not his recent keynote on proletarian education.\n\nZinoviev keeps his posture composed. But he has begun to linger longer over the reports from the provinces."
russoc.304.a: "Sounds like sabotage."

russoc.305.t: "The Revolution and the Chairman"
russoc.305.d: "A curious report reaches the desk of Comrade Zinoviev. Somewhere in the Oryol region, a wall newspaper at a party technical school carries an anonymous cartoon: a stooped figure with Zinoviev's unmistakable curly hear pointing in every direction at once, under the caption "Voluntarism is not a plan". In another district, Sovnarkom's most recent decree on grain distribution has mysteriously failed to arrive in time for implementation - and when it does, it is mismatched with earlier circulars issued by the Secretariat.\n\nThe Secretariat's are crowded with economic updates and minor provincial resolutions. Requests to reprint one of Zinoviev's recent ideological articles are "postponed due to layout constraints". An appeal to address the Cadres Conference in [247.GetName] is quietly canceled.\n\nAcross the country, a hum of informal agitation begins to build. Zinoviev notices - of course he does. Yet what are a few jokes, some editorial oversights, some out-of-context citations? To give them weight would be to dignify slander. And dignity is one thing Zinoviev still commands, or so he believes."

russoc.306.d.intro: "Chairman Zinoviev has brought the question to the attention of the VTsIK, invoking 1918 Constitution, which does not provide for emergency organs outside the framework of Commissariats and the Council of People's Commissars. In the interests of planning and legality, he suggests"
russoc.306.d: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ dissolving the STO.\n\nWithout hesitation, [GetOtherPrimeMinister] marshaled the VTsIK's majority behind the Chairman's proposal. The decree was passed in a single session, framed as a return to constitutional legality and civilian economic planning. The STO was quietly dissolved with its responsibilities diffused among existing commissariats, though some of its former personnel were quietly repositioned into other agencies. Zinoviev saw this as a clean victory."
russoc.306.d2: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ dissolving the STO.\n\n[GetOtherPrimeMinister] stalled. The legality of the move was solid, but he feared destabilizing the institutional balance. After negotiations, the VTsIK voted the proposal down, citing "organizational risk"."
russoc.306.d3: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ dissolving the STO.\n\nVladimir Smirnov objected on procedural and political grounds. He accused the proposal of being too abrupt, risking the collapse of coordination in the fragile postwar economy. The VTsIK narrowly rejected the dissolution plan. Zinoviev's allies fumed, but the Chairman had to retreat - for now."
russoc.306.d4: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ dissolving the STO.\n\nThe VTsIK under Vladimirsky barely debated the matter. The proposal was shelved and eventually rejected outright. Some members questioned whether the Sovnarkom had the authority to make such proposals at all. Zinoviev left the session with clenched teeth and a curt smile."

russoc.307.d: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ appointing himself as the Chairman of the STO, citing precedent of Lenin being the head of the SRKO, predecessor of the STO.\n\nThe VTsIK endorsed the proposal near-unanimously. [GetOtherPrimeMinister] framed it as restoring centralized control to the government leadership. Zinoviev now held both the Sovnarkom and the STO, just as Lenin once had. Quiet personnel reshuffles followed in the STO's apparatus."

russoc.307.d3: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ appointing himself as the Chairman of the STO, citing precedent of Lenin being the head of the SRKO, predecessor of the STO.\n\nVladimir Smirnov opposed the motion vigorously. He accused Zinoviev of attempting to dominate economic management without collective oversight. The VTsIK rejected the motion, and the Bukharinist press quietly began circulating critiques of "bureaucratic centralism"."
russoc.307.d4: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ appointing himself as the Chairman of the STO, citing precedent of Lenin being the head of the SRKO, predecessor of the STO.\n\nThe session turned hostile. Vladimirsky refused to include the proposal on the formal agenda."

russoc.308.d2: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ that STO continue to work, but under formal legal subordination to the Sovnarkom, without its own apparatus.\n\nKrestinsky treated the compromise as an effective half-step.

russoc.308.d3: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ that STO continue to work, but under formal legal subordination to the Sovnarkom, without its own apparatus.\n\n[GetOtherPrimeMinister] welcomed the compromise, allowing the proposal to pass after some minor delays.

russoc.308.d4: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ that STO continue to work, but under formal legal subordination to the Sovnarkom, without its own apparatus.\n\nVladimir Smirnov, Chairman of the VTsIK, has supported the proposal as a welcome return to legal norms.

russoc.308.d5: "$russoc.306.d.intro$ that STO continue to work, but under formal legal subordination to the Sovnarkom, without its own apparatus.\n\nMikhail Vladimirsky reluctantly allowed the vote, but only after multiply redrafts.

russoc.309.t: "Reviewing the STO Function"
russoc.309.d.intro: "The recent Congress of Soviets convened under heavy procedural anticipation. One of the key items on the agenda was the final disposition of the Council of Labor and Defense - the emergency body that had played a crucial coordinating role throughout the Second Civil War. Following Comrade Zinoviev's appointment as interim Chairman of the STO, the VTsIK had expressed concern over the accumulation of executive roles and mandated that the next Congress of Soviets formally determine the STO's future. After several closed sessions and intense committee debate, the Congress arrived at a resolution."
russoc.309.d: "$russoc.309.d.intro$\n\nThe final decision was swift and predictable. Framing the resolution as a restoration of Leninist planning norms and constitutional legality, the Congress approved the formal subordination of the STO to the Sovnarkom. The STO would be retained in form, but legally reclassified as a commission of the Sovnarkom rather than an independent coordinating body."
russoc.309.d2: "$russoc.309.d.intro$\n\nThe Congress pushed for a carefully measured institutional compromise. The STO would not be dissolved, nor would Comrade Zinoviev be confirmed as its Chairman. Instead, the Congress resolved to transform the STO into a subordinate commission of the Sovnarkom, with a new chairman to be appointed through ordinary administrative procedures. After brief consultations, the Central Committee has recommended [russoc_309_d2_candidate] and he was approved."
russoc.309.d3: "$russoc.309.d.intro$\n\nThe Congress took an adversarial stance against the existing arrangement - it declared the dual role of Zinoviev incompatible with socialist legality, despite the Lenin's precedent. The STO would be preserved as an independent coordinating organ - but Zinoviev was to be removed from its leadership with immediate effect. A new Chairman would be appointed by the VTsIK, and the [GetOtherPrimeMinister] has already confirmed [russoc_309_d3_candidate].

The formal justification for the session has been circulated under the heading of "Review of the Current State of Leadership in the Council of People's Commissars."\n\nThe underlying impetus for this maneuver has been the growing dissatisfaction within key state and party bodies over the concentration of authority within the hands of the Sovnarkom Chairman, Comrade Zinoviev. The proposed agenda refers to the "structural crisis of governmental coordination", the "erosion of collective leadership norms", and the "increasing encroachment of partocratic tendencies at the expense of Soviet legality".\n\nWhile the language remains within procedural bounds, it is widely understood that the primary intention of this convocation is to initiate a formal inquiry into the current leadership of the Sovnarkom. Behind closed doors, Molotovite cadres have worked to consolidate a majority within the Presidium itself. Agitation networks loyal to the Secretariat have been quietly mobilized, generating a low-intensity pressure campaign within departmental cells and select publications of internal circulation.\n\nThe Presidium Secretariat has accepted the procedural motion, and the extraordinary session is scheduled for the end of the month.

It was also noted that the Sovnarkom, as a body composed of party members, is not to be held politically accountable to any organ other than the Party itself.\n\nThe resolution affirms Zinoviev's continued mandate as Chairman of the Sovnarkom and calls for disciplinary investigations into unauthorized factional maneuvers within the VTsIK.

The Congress reaffirmed Comrade Zinoviev's mandate as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and passed a motion denouncing "the voluntarist actions of individual Presidium members". In an additional measure, the Congress adopted a resolution to reconstitute the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee - several members of the earlier power bid were not re-elected, including both Mikhail Kalinin and Mikhail Vladimirsky from the Molotovites and Vladimir Smirnov from the Bukharinists. This outcome has also revealed dangerous loopholes in the constitutional structure of the Soviet state. In his closing remarks, Comrade Zinoviev announced the beginning of a comprehensive constitutional reform process, aimed at safeguarding the unity of power. The proposed reforms would ensure that no anti-party action disguised as legality could repeat itself under the guise of constitutional formalism.\n\nShortly after the Congress, a Plenum of the Central Committee was convened, which appointed a new Chairman of the VTsIK - Leonid Serebryakov."

russoc.315.t: "The Grassroots Letter Campaign"
russoc.315.d.intro: "In the wake of the VTsIK Presidium's resolution and amid ongoing public discussion, Comrade Zinoviev, though absent at the decisive session, has not remained idle. Through trusted cadres embedded in the Secretariat of the Central Committee, a coordinated campaign has been launched. Framed as a corrective appeal from below, circular letters are sent to regional party organizations. These documents allege that the Presidium's action represents a deviation from Leninist norms of democratic centralism and warn of a growing tendency toward top-down factionalism.\n\nRaykoms and gubkoms, instructed to express their formal concerns, are asked to draft memoranda insisting on Central Committee oversight over critical personnel decisions - in particular, the composition of the Sovnarkom and the role of the VTsIK Presidium."
russoc.315.d: "$russoc.315.d.intro$\n\nThe letter campaign stalls almost as soon as it begins...\nUnder the supervision of Comrade Chutskayev, the Secretariat ensures that the circulars are either delayed or redirected before reaching plenary discussion in the regions. In key provinces, prepared counter-resolutions assert that the VTsIK Presidium acted in full accordance with its constitutional mandate. Several Gubkom Secretaries publicly reject Zinoviev's framing, denouncing the appeal as a veiled attempt to subvert collective party discipline with personalist agitation.\n\nWithout regional endorsement, the Central Committee refuses to act and Zinoviev is left isolated. A session of the Orgburo is held behind closed doors to "review conduct unbecoming of a party leader"."
russoc.315.b: "Resign, but not retreat. History will judge."

russoc.316.d: "$russoc.315.d.intro$\n\nThe letter campaign finds fertile ground. Under the discreet but firm coordination of Comrade Krestinsky, the Secretariat ensures that Zinoviev's appeal is disseminated to every major oblast and republic. Within a week, formal letters of concern begin arriving in [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. While their language is caution, they mean that the Presidium has acted without adequate party consultation, in violation of collective procedures and tradition.\n\nThe volume of responses becomes impossible to ignore. Under growing pressure from below, Zinoviev reconvenes an extended Plenum of the Central Commitee. Addressing the Party, he declares that the balance of Leninist governance has been disturbed and calls for the immediate convocation of a Congress of Soviets to rectify the crisis."

russoc.317.d.intro: "While some in the leadership urge constitutionalism or tactical retreat, a different voice has begun to echo within the walls of Smolny: perhaps the hour has come to act, not argue. The conspiratorial nature of the VTsIK's maneuver and the openly factional behavior of certain People's Commissars and officials are framed by Chairman Zinoviev's allies as not merely a political misstep, but as a prelude to a palace coup. The question, then, is whether the security organs - once guardians of revolutionary legality - will rise to meet their obligation or instead accommodate the conspiracy."
russoc.317.d: "$russoc.317.d.intro$\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, agents of the [GetChekaName] carried out a series of surgical arrests across Moscow and [195.GetName]. Members of the VTsIK Presidium aligned with the opposition were detained and placed under investigation on charges of anti-Party coordination and abuse of institutional authority.\n\nThe [GetChekaName], acting under direct orders from Sovnarkom and with full sanction from its Chairman, issued a public statement declaring that it had "fulfilled its duty to revolutionary legality" in the face of subversive infiltration. Zinoviev appeared later that day in an unscheduled address, where he framed the arrests as a necessary defense against "the bureaucratic sabotage."\n\nThough opposition whispers of a self-coup, the Sovnarkom formally reaffirms the validity of the detentions. A new VTsIK Presidium is expected to be appointed within days."
russoc.317.d2: "$russoc.317.d.intro$\n\nInitial moves by the [GetChekaName] to investigate and detain known conspirators met with bureaucratic obstruction and conflicting orders from the NKVD. Though some units were mobilized and preliminary warrants drafted, the operation quickly unraveled. By mid-day, the NKVD announced that all political security functions would be directly supervised by its Collegium, citing "overreach by subordinate elements". Soon, Zinoviev's most loyal Chekists, including Georgy Blagonravov were detained.\n\nThe [GetChekaName]'s failure to act has left Zinoviev in a dangerous position.

russoc.318.d: "$russoc.318.d.intro$\n\nDespite pressure from the Sovnarkom, the RVSR and Narkomvoyenmor has refused to carry out executive orders issued in Zinoviev's name. Its communique invokes the authority of the Party Congress and declares the Sovnarkom to be "in a state of deviation from constitutional order". Political commissars have uniformly sided with the Central Committee. When Zinoviev attempted to address the General Staff directly, his communications were ignored.\n\nWithin hours, the VTsIK voted to suspend the Sovnarkom's authority and declared a state of emergency. Armed detachments, supported by military transport units, surrounded key administrative buildings in Moscow and Petrograd. Zinoviev was arrested in his office by [GetChekaName] agents who had, days earlier, failed to carry out his orders. He was formally stripped of all posts by a joint resolution of the Central Committee and the VTsIK. His closest allies - Blagonravov, Zalutsky, Preobrazhensky - were taken into custody."
russoc.318.d2: "$russoc.318.d.intro$\n\nThe Narkomvoyenmor and the RVSR issued a categorical affirmation of loyalty to the Sovnarkom, declaring that no state organ may override the executive institutions of the proletariat".

When party hardliners attempted to convene an emergency plenum, they were prevented from entering the building by Red Army sentries.\n\nWithin forty-eight hours, [GetChekaName] units arrested several opposition figures, citing "preparations for illegal party usurpation".\n\nZinoviev declared a temporary consolidation of state and party leadership to defend the revolution from bureaucratic sabotage. The Emergency Congress of the Party is to be called in a few days."
russoc.318.d3: "$russoc.318.d.intro$\n\nThe military did not hesitate.

Key Sovnarkom ministers were taken into custody. [GetChekaName] headquarters in [195.GetName] were stormed by soldiers acting in defense of the party.\n\nA public declaration was issued in the name of the VTsIK, declaring Zinoviev's government "Bonapartist and anti-Soviet". The military framed its action not as a coup, but as a "restoration of legitimate governance", as Molotov was named acting Chairman of the Sovnarkom, pending ratification by a reassembled Party Congress. Zinoviev, surrounded and abandoned, surrendered to military authorities and was escorted from the capital."
russoc.318.d4: "$russoc.318.d.intro$\n\nThe RVSR has declared itself neutral, stating it would carry out its duty to the republic without entering into party disagreements. But as the central authorities fractured, neutrality proved unsustainable. Units loyal to Zinoviev occupied ministry buildings and broadcasting stations. In response, forces under the control of regional commissars and party activists mobilized against them. Gunfire was exchanged in central Moscow and Petrograd's administrative quarter.\n\nThe RVSR issued a desperate call for ceasefire, but it was ignored as armed clashes spread to rail hubs and ports.\n\nZinoviev, faced with fragmentation and open resistance, attempted to negotiate a truce through the RVSR - only to find that no side now had enough authority to impose one. His resignation followed hours later, framed as a "sacrifice in the name of proletarian unity".

First improvised during the chaos of 1918, the trudovye lagerya - labor camps - were originally established on the sites of abandoned POW internments. With our Party once again taking over, the labor camps were once again re-established, with a legal foundation of a VTsIK Decree No.124 from April 1919. Each provincial city should maintain at least one camp, housing no fewer than 300 "socially harmful elements" for corrective labor. But with peace declared, these camps - some little more than tents behind fences, others sprawling complexes of barracks and wire - are no longer shielded by emergency powers. Thousands remain inside: kulaks, former officers, dissident intelligentsia, priests, petty criminals.\n\nThe Zinovievites, dominant in the Party, view the camps as a necessary lever of class purification - an engine of re-education and surveillance under the banner of proletarian vigilance. The Molotovites, argue instead for systemic harshness: labor camps should become instruments of discipline. Better organized, better guarded, better fed. Even the Bukharinists, who once agitated for legal guarantees and economic experimentation, cannot deny the usefulness of labor discipline. Their preferred approach is different: limit the camps to saboteurs and counter-revolutionaries, and gradually transition them into productive cooperatives tied to reconstruction."

Though the Central Committee remains formally united, a new convergence is coalescing - between Aleksey Rykov's agrarian dissidents and key members of the so-called Hardliners. While no formal pact is declared, the signs are unmistakable: coordinated votes in committees, joint editorials in peripheral Party publications, and a shared language emphasizing stability, pragmatism, and the defense of the rural majority. What had started as an isolated protest against the \"Zinovievite voluntarism\" has begun to evolve into a quiet, tactical alignment between two ideological currents long thought incompatible.\n\nFor their part, the Molotov-aligned bureaucrats, many of whom once scoffed at Rykov's cooperativist sentimentalism, have begun to reinterpret his calls for peasant socialism as confirmation of their own principles - that Socialism in One State will triumph though its peasants' backbone. While some Molotovites still denounce the Rykovites as idealists, the others, like Molotov himself, see in this convergence a potential instrument - not just to slow Zinoviev's aggressive collectivization, but to reshape the Party's social base in their own image: patient, disciplined, and rooted in Russian soil.\n\nBukharin, meanwhile, stands alone. Accused by all sides of softness or deviation, he now watches his one-time allies embrace those he once opposed. In a rare editorial, he decries the \"unprincipled bloc of opportunists and technocrats\". Zinovievite publications simply reaffirm the Party's unwavering commitment to the [GetPreviousBolshevikPartyCongressNumber] Party's Congress line."

russoc.325.d: "In the aftermath of the overthrow of the Popular Front government, the cities are starving. The Popular Front had maintained a so-called Bread Monopoly, ostensibly to regulate food distribution fairly across urban and rural populations. In practice, this system was deeply flawed: the state purchased grain at artificially low prices and relied on a web of corrupt intermediaries and regional committees to manage distribution. The monopoly favored urban centers and garrison cities but left much of the countryside alienated and undersupplied. As peasant producers withdrew from markets or hoarded reserves and food insecurity worsened.\n\nNow, with frontlines stretching and food riots emerging in major industrial centers, the question how to feed the Revolution can no longer be avoided. Some propose a return to Prodrazvyorstka - the grain requisitioning model of the last civil war - enforced by armed Prodotryady. Others propose more moderate or politically strategic alternatives."

A few even accuse rogue anarchist bands or Menshevik remnants of spreading false rumors about the Party's intentions.\n\nIn the cities, bread rations shrink again. Tensions rise in factory queues. Zinoviev, long skeptical of this experiment, calls for emergency measures. The voluntarist campaign has failed - and the Revolution cannot afford to wait."
russoc.326.d2: "The grain began to arrive. First in small shipments from loyal cooperatives, then in larger waves. Villagers came to deliver wheat openly, some even bringing homemade signs praising the Revolution. Rural Party activists report a cautious, yet growing trust - not just in the promises of Soviet power, but in its restraint. Even skeptical local Soviets now concede the campaign exceeded expectations.\n\nIn a stirring speech delivered to the Moscow Soviet, Bukharin declared the beginning of a true smychka - an alliance between soldiers, workers and the plowman.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader], while publicly congratulating the effort, remains reserved.

This gesture, Zinoviev argues, would not only affirm the city's historic role as the cradle of Revolution, but also consolidate the ideological foundations of the regime. To the workers of the city and across the country, the name would signify continuity, sacrifice, and purpose. A city bearing Lenin's name would be a monument in itself.\n\nYet some whisper - not critically, but carefully - that such a move also subtly ties Zinoviev's own legacy to the capital of Red October.

Instead, he convenes internal sessions with key figures from the Council of Labor and Defense, the Secretariat, and a restructured VSNKh and Gosplan.\n\nEach meeting is brief, each directive precise. The reorganization proceeds on two levels: the formal - reassignments, consolidations, redefinitions of jurisdiction - and the informal - quiet marginalizations, the creation of new advisory bodies, and strategic promotions of loyalists. For the new members of the Central Committee it is clear that the question is no longer just about leadership - it is about the new architecture of the state itself.\n\nMolotov has no need to declare a new line.

The local Party apparatus had not been consulted - but they did not resist. The city, worn and hungry, welcomed him not with celebration, but with a silent current of recognition. At the Smolny, banners remain red and the slogans familiar. In the square outside the former Tauride Palace, small crowds gather for evening addresses. Zinoviev speaks in the old cadences: of international revolution, of party betrayal, of the silent seizure of power by “bureaucratic sectarians”.\n\nIn pages of the [195.GetName]skaya Pravda, veiled attacks on the new government take the form of theoretical disputes, critiques of “bureaucratic centralism”, and nostalgic recollections of the Zagranburo period.

To Molotov, they are doctrinally impure - drenched in peasant sentiment and allergic to iron discipline. But they command sympathy among local committees, economic administrators, and sections of the trade unions that remain hesitant to embrace the new order.\n\nA faction within the Politburo has proposed a tactical détente. Offer the Bukharinists a share of responsibility - hand them one of the minor Commissariats, some influence in provincial planning organs, perhaps a seat or two returned in the VSNKh. It would silence their press with obligations, and bind them to the State through compromise.\n\nOthers, especially from the Secretariat and military-administrative bloc, advise a different path. Why tolerate revisionists? Why barter with obstructionists? The press is already being restructured. New cadres, trained in Party schools and hardened by war mobilization, wait in the wings.

They are not friends of Vyacheslav Molotov. But they are not, yet, his enemies. In a closed meeting at the Politburo, proposals are made to draw the Bukharinists back into the center - cautiously, and without fanfare. If the alliance holds, it could isolate the Petrograd radicals and stabilize Moscow. If it falters, it could bring the right closer to Zinoviev's banner."
russoc.334.a: "Give them what they know: Food Supply and Labor."

russoc.335.t: "Terms of Inclusion"
russoc.335.d: "The initial framework of cooperation between the Sovnarkom and the Bukharinist opposition remains tenuous - a structure of written memoranda and informal understandings rather than firm alliance. Bukharin, now increasingly vocal from his positions in Moscow committees and through aligned periodicals, has responded cautiously but not dismissively to recent gestures. His allies, especially among the mid-tier Ispolkoms and economic planners, signal interest in further cooperation - provided they are granted institutional levers beyond symbolic roles.\n\nThe Sovnarkom now faces a moment of decision. Concessions may buy stability - or embolden factionalism. But continued ambiguity risks pushing the Bukharinists toward Kamenev or worse, back toward Zinoviev's shadow."
russoc.335.a: "Offer the RTsSPS and appoint Tomsky as its head."
russoc.335.b: "Allow Bukharinist oversight over agrarian quotas in the Gosplan."
russoc.335.c: "Invite Bukharin to co-author a new Party resolution on "transitional discipline"."

russoc.336.t: "The Voice of Moscow"
russoc.336.d: "Though long regarded as a quiet technocrat loyal to Zinoviev, Lev Borisovich Kamenev has now stepped from the wings. As Chairman of the Mossoviet, he delivered what party papers coyly describe as a "statement of concern" - but what his audience clearly understood as a veiled rallying cry. Standing before a hall filled with students of one of the Moscow's universities, Kamenev invoked the "principle of democratic consultation", warning against the centralization of power in the hands of "dual alliances and unelected offices."\n\nWithout naming Molotov or Bukharin, he condemned "temporary compromises with revisionism" and "the hasty exclusion of the Party's legitimate traditions". Kamenev's message was clear: the Mossoviet remains a political force, and Moscow will not be ruled by diktat alone. Several mid-ranking commissars and scientific boards have since issued statements of "alignment" with Mossoviet policy - coded signs that Kamenev is gathering his own constellation of influence."
russoc.336.a: "Engage the technocrats - cut Kamenev out."
russoc.336.b: "Accuse Kamenev of factionalism - isolate the Mossoviet."

russoc.337.t2: "Lashevich Defies the Center"
russoc.337.d: "The Sibrevkom and the Novosibirsk Soviet, under Boris Shumyatsky's leadership, has quietly but decisively charted a course distinct from the new orthodoxy forming in our state. While no proclamations are made, the character of governance is clear: trade unions remain powerful, the cooperative system is expanding, and peasant tax burdens are adjusted with leniency. Soviet commissars dispatched to enforce central directives report confusion, noncompliance, or outright delay. Shumyatsky justifies these deviations as "practical responses to local conditions" - but in private, our officials call it ideological sabotage."
russoc.337.d2: "A front-page editorial in Krasnaya Sibir declares: "The Revolution cannot be reduced to a ledger or a decree. The workers of Siberia know who still speaks with Lenin's voice."\n\nMikhail Lashevich, a veteran of the Civil War and open Zinovievite partisan, has transformed his post into a rallying point for loyalists of the old [195.GetName] line. Under his administration, Soviets are filled with ideological allies, and organs once subordinate to the center now openly question Sovnarkom's authority."
russoc.337.a: "Let Shumyatsky govern. We need his loyalty more than his obedience."
russoc.337.b: "Replace Shumyatsky with a loyal functionary from the Center."
russoc.337.c: "Publicly denounce Lashevich as a traitor and Zinovievite agent."
russoc.337.e: "Offer Bukharin real influence in Gosplan - on the condition he helps isolate Zinovievism in Siberia."

russoc.338.t: "The Balance Breaks"
russoc.338.d: "In a tense but calculated step toward unity, Bukharin has accepted the terms of a guarded alliance with Molotov. The concessions are modest but symbolic: a paced collectivization, open endorsement of agricultural cooperatives and TOZ-es, and the rollout of a gentler tax framework in the countryside. No decentralization is allowed, and Center’s grip remains firm - but its tone has softened, slightly. All of these resolutions were officially adopted at the [GetBolshevikPartyCongressNumber] Party Congress, held last weekend, which as well has elected the new composition of the Central Committee and the Politburo.\n\nBukharin has not joined the government as an equal, but he has returned to it as a partner. The Sovnarkom reflects the new arrangement, with Bukharinist figures discreetly assuming mid-level leadership in less influential Commissariats. Zinoviev’s position weakens as the Bukharinist current pulls away from the [195.GetName] opposition."
russoc.338.a: "Long live the new Leninist Front!"

russoc.339.d: "After fruitless overtures, Bukharin, emboldened by allies in the Mossoviet and [195.GetName] Soviet, declared open alignment with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The move is a full-scale attempt to build a counterweight to Molotov’s rising centralism. In [195.GetName] and Moscow, a common front now calls for economic reform, political plurality within the Soviets, and restoration of 'Leninist Bolshevism'.\n\nThis new Triumvirate still lacks a majority in the Central Committee, but it commands real institutional power in key urban centers."
russoc.339.a: "The air grows colder in Moscow"

russoc.340.d: "After fruitless overtures, Bukharin has declared Molotovism 'Trotskyite revisionism' and 'National-Socialist heresy'. Kamenev, once thought to be a balancing figure, has been sidelined under pressure and veiled threats, and the VTsIK has commanded to reorganize power in Moscow. Bukharinists across the provinces find themselves increasingly isolated and their advocates removed from key posts or reassigned into bureaucratic irrelevance. In the Siberian heartland and in Moscow’s corridors, only the most silent technocrats remain untouched."

russoc.341.t: "The [195.GetName] Opposition"
russoc.341.d: "With Zinoviev deposed from national leadership, the embattled ideologue has withdrawn to his final bastion - the [195.GetName] Soviet, a stronghold still rife with ideological loyalists and embittered cadres. It is here, amidst the libraries of party schools and the stifling chambers of old trade union halls, that the opposition reorganizes. Their rhetoric is now public, bringing together accusations of Bonapartism, betrayals of socialist internationalism, and even whispered claims that Zinoviev's opposition alone being true 'Bolsheviks-Leninists'.\n\nThe organs of the Zinovievite opposition are not militant, but neither they are idle. Through figures such as Pyotr Zalutsky, Georgy Blagonravov, Nikolay Krestinsky, and Yevgeny Preobrazhensky, they continue to influence local appointments, disrupt Center’s economic plans, and issue sharp ideological editorials from their institutional publications and party schools.\n\nThe [195.GetName] Soviet and its network of cultural, educational, and municipal institutions have begun actively resisting Center’s decrees. Already, Gosplan staff in [195.GetName] report "ideological hostility" among local planners. A recent trade union bulletin circulated in [195.GetName] openly mocked new labor quotas. Zinoviev’s allies are not staging a rebellion, but actively undermining the state from within.\n\nMolotov has convened a closed session of the Secretariat, issuing quiet instructions to immediately start reviewing all [195.GetName] municipal ispolkoms, their heads, subordinates and publications in [195.GetName] press."
russoc.341.a: "They say they represent the workers. I say they represent the past."

russoc.342.t: "The Pravda Reorganization"
russoc.342.d: "As Vyacheslav Molotov consolidates control over the central institutions of the state, attention now turns to the battleground of public discourse. Long regarded as a mouthpiece of the [195.GetName] Soviet, [195.GetName]skaya Pravda had remained one of the last platforms where Zinoviev’s voice - and that of his faction - could still be heard in editorials, analysis, and workers’ correspondence. Despite official sidelining, Zinoviev had continued to exert influence over the editorial board, with articles citing his past speeches and circulating his “anti-bureaucratic” critiques of the central government.\n\nThe Party leadership has now moved decisively. Under orders from the Central Committee's Agitprop and Narkompros, the entire senior editorial board of [195.GetName]skaya Pravda has been dismissed, including Samuil Zaks-Gladnev and Lev Sosnovsky. Their replacements - drawn from the V.I.Lenin Communist University and the Gosizdat - are handpicked ideological loyalists, chosen not only for their journalistic discipline but for their unwavering commitment to the new party line.\n\nIn parallel, a media campaign has been unleashed against Zinoviev personally. Speeches by anonymous "worker-correspondents" denounce his “Menshevist deviation” and articles accuse him of nurturing a petty-bourgeois cult of personality masked by demagogic appeals to proletarian sentiment."

russoc.343.t: "Resolution on the Reorganization of the [195.GetName] Soviet"
russoc.343.d: "The Central Executive Committee has issued a sweeping resolution ordering the immediate reorganization of [195.GetName]’s local Soviets and the holding of new elections to "restore proletarian unity and discipline". The official language describes the existing Soviets as "pockets of factional separatism" and "engines of Zinovievite obstruction".\n\nThe resolution, passed without dissent thanks to [GetOtherPrimeMinister]'s majority in the VTsIK, grants extraordinary powers to centrally-appointed Election Commissions tasked with overseeing the new votes. These commissions, composed of loyal party cadres, security observers and bureaucratic administrators, are empowered to "correct discrepancies and ensure socialist legality". Behind closed doors, this means a systematic purge of Zinovievite-aligned enterprise delegates, workers' committees, and district activists. Factories are receiving quiet instructions on how to "restructure their delegate selection processes", agitators are being dispatched to the barracks and tram depots and [195.GetName]skaya Pravda is calling for the "cleansing of the Soviets from romanticism and sabotage".\n\nThe Zinovievites, though diminished, are not silent. Several members of the [195.GetName] Soviet have walked out in protest, denouncing the vote as a farce, and have called for a pre-Congress discussion."

russoc.344.t: "The Demonstration on Volodarsky Prospect"
russoc.344.d: "Despite the sweeping decree of the VTsIK, the streets of [195.GetName] still echo with defiance. Early this morning, thousands of workers and party members - many linked to the Zinovievite current - marched down Volodarsky Prospect under red banners, chanting familiar slogans: 'Let's fulfill Lenin's precepts', 'The Soviets must decide!', 'For genuine workers' democracy!'\n\nThough unarmed and visibly disciplined, the demonstration was an open act of protest against the forced reorganization of local Soviets. The participants decried the erosion of inner-party democracy and accused the Center of hijacking the revolution. Present among them - though not at the front - was Grigory Zinoviev himself, flanked by loyalists like Krestinsky and Blagonravov, visibly pale but resolute.\n\nThe response came swiftly. Ivan Moskvin, the quiet but assertive head of the Petrograd Provincial Committee's Organizational Department, appeared flanked by Red Guards and factory delegates loyal to the Sovnarkom. Though no shots were fired, the crowd was forcibly dispersed with arrests and public denunciations. Zinoviev slipped away - unarrested, but not unnoticed.\n\nAs evening fell, Pravda’s special bulletin did not mention the demonstration - only a cryptic editorial about "narrow groupings"."

russoc.345.d: "An internal memorandum has circulated from the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, outlining the need for "disciplinary harmonization" and "ideological cohesion" within regional security directorates. The [195.GetName] Guberniya Department of the [GetChekaName], long regarded as insufficiently responsive to central directives, has come under particular scrutiny.\n\nAs a result, Georgy Blagonravov, the former head of the [GetChekaName] under Zinoviev, and Ivan Bakayev, his deputy, have been removed from their posts following a closed session of the NKVD. No formal charges have been filed; instead, both are cited for failure to uphold procedural standards in line with current party resolutions.\n\nIn their place, Pavel Bulanov, a senior operative from the Penza security apparatus and close associate of Commissar Yagoda, has been appointed to oversee the reorganization of the Petrograd Cheka. His arrival is framed in internal communications as a \"measure of stabilization and trust-building with the Center.\""

Officially presented as a routine reaffirmation of socialist governance, the process was anything but neutral. The election commissions, operating under the oversight of Party organs and the Secretariat, carefully monitored delegate selection from the lower Soviets. Factories and institutions sympathetic to the opposition reported increasing visits from auditors and agitators loyal to the Molotovite line.\n\nAgainst all odds, the Zinovievite bloc has returned with a narrow plurality within the newly seated [195.GetName] Soviet. This was not a clean victory: dozens of delegates loyal to the opposition were disqualified in the run-up, and key enterprises were pressured by Party functionaries. But the residual loyalty to Zinoviev in the workers’ cells and the soviet apparatus proved durable. Zinoviev himself, pale and composed, took his seat with the resigned bearing of a man who knows the storm is not over. The [195.GetName] Soviet remains a thorn in the side of central authority, and Zinoviev’s resistance has earned new life - but at great cost."

When orders were issued to detain central officials and occupy key buildings, most army units hesitated or refused to act - many even alerted their commanders. [195.GetName]'s uprising collapsed within hours.\n\nThe conspirators - Zinoviev himself, along with Georgy Blagonravov, Lev Kamenev, and others - have been arrested and transferred to a secure facility under NKVD control. The Central Committee has declared a state of emergency in [195.GetName] and Moscow.\n\nVyacheslav Molotov, in an official communication to the Soviets and the working masses, described the event as \"a criminal adventure against the worker-peasant state\".

Following his formal removal from his post by the [195.GetName] City Committee, the Central Committee issued an internal resolution ordering Grigory Zinoviev’s transfer to a distant administrative post \"for health and disciplinary reasons\". Zinoviev refused the order.\n\nWithin seventy-two hours, the Secretariat issued an official statement of exclusion from the Party, citing \"factional sabotage and disobedience to the collective will of the Party\". Zinoviev’s name was removed from all internal directories and future participation in Party life was forbidden.\n\nWith Zinoviev’s expulsion came the exclusion of several other prominent loyalists - Kamenev, Preobrazhensky, Zalutsky, Blagonravov, Krestinsky - a formal end to the [195.GetName] faction that once stood at the heart of Bolshevik power."

Selected transcripts and formal charges have been published in Pravda and other central newspapers, presenting the case as a decisive moment of internal Party discipline.\n\nZinoviev and his co-defendants have denied the accusation of counter-revolutionary intent, but some of their actions are used to demonstrate the inherent threat of factional separatism.\n\nThe time has come for sentencing."

Originally established under the prior leadership to address declining moral discipline within the Party and State, the inspection organs have since displayed irregular reporting patterns and incomplete oversight of regional offices.\n\nThe decision has been made to replace the current People's Commissar of Rabkrin. Comrade Nikolay Shvernik, a disciplined and technically capable official, has been appointed to oversee the restructuring process. His role will be to implement new audit procedures, coordinate with regional bureaus, and ensure compliance with directives aimed at restoring functional cohesion within the state apparatus. The TsKK will remain formally independent, though closer integration into the Secretariat is under review.\n\nInternal memoranda emphasize that this reorganization is not disciplinary in nature, but rather a necessary adjustment to improve efficiency and prevent administrative drift during ongoing national mobilization."

russoc.351.d: "In the course of the ongoing legal and institutional reorganization initiated under the guidance of the Sovnarkom and Chairman Molotov, a preliminary memorandum has been circulated among leading members of the Central Committee and the Constitutional Commission. The document concerns the future of the Council of Labor and Defense, an organ originally conceived as an emergency economic body during the Civil War.\n\nNow, with the country again in a period of prolonged mobilization, and with no clear boundary between economic coordination and state leadership, questions have arisen as to whether the STO should be formalized as a permanent constitutional institution, standing parallel to the Sovnarkom, or whether its functions ought to be absorbed into the apparatus of the government proper.\n\nThe draft proposes two structural alternatives. In the first, the STO would be institutionalized as an autonomous coordinating organ of state power, chaired by a member of the Politburo appointed by the Central Committee, whose decrees would carry binding authority across all commissariats and planning bodies. This structure would preserve the duality between technical-economic direction and political governance. In the second proposal, the STO is to be dissolved entirely, with all administrative and planning authority to be consolidated under the Sovnarkom, in effect simplifying the machinery of executive rule.\n\nThe matter remains under discussion. No final resolution has yet been adopted. But all recognize that the decision will define the character of the new constitutional order - and clarify the actual locus of supreme state authority."

At a closed session of the Politburo, chaired by Comrade [ROOT.GetLeader], the case was presented in full by representatives of the Supreme Court and the TsKK.\n\nThe proceedings noted Zinoviev's history of willful disobedience of VTsIK directives, and direct orchestration of illegal structures aimed at undermining the organs of proletarian power. While some members acknowledged his past contributions to the Revolutionary cause, the majority emphasized the need to safeguard Party unity and institutional discipline.\n\nA formal resolution has been prepared for ratification by the Central Committee, to be accompanied by a public statement in Pravda, summarizing the Party’s decision in terms of disciplinary consistency and \"the irreversible betrayal of the principles of collective leadership\"."

russoc.353.d: "Though the Party has formally closed the chapter on Grigory Zinoviev’s misguided tenure, recent reports from Moscow suggest that certain remnants of his political circle have begun to reorganize, albeit cautiously. At the heart of this quiet resurgence is Lev Kamenev, Chairman of the Mossoviet, whose failure to support Zinoviev in his hour of need was noted - yet who now privately disputes the legality of the resolution that elevated the new government.\n\nIn the weeks following Zinoviev’s arrest, Kamenev has drawn around himself a group of ideological veterans - members of the Party since the beginning of the century, and a smattering of lower-profile former Zinovievites - under what some internal bulletins have termed the "Old Bolsheviks". While publicly couched as an social organization, a reminder of the Revolution’s original ideals, internal surveillance suggests the 'Society of Old Bolsheviks' serves as a loose coalition of political survivors with waning influence but persistent ambition.\n\nThough it holds no formal power and meets only intermittently under Kamenev’s protection in the Mossoviet, it poses no immediate threat. Yet as much of the Zinovievites gather besides its banners, we must be cautious."

While framed as a commitment to intra-party dialogue and constitutional rectification, the text accuses recent developments - without direct attribution - of deviating from the principles of Party legality and collective leadership.\n\nThe document, co-signed by several veteran members including N. I. Bukharin, M. P. Tomsky, and M. N. Ryutin, praises the efforts of Comrade Kamenev and his supporters. The appeal further calls for the restoration of certain procedural norms in the conduct of Central Committee and Sovnarkom sessions, and expresses concern over the increasing isolation of Party organs from the working-class base.\n\nAlthough limited in immediate effect and lacking broad organizational support, the alliance nonetheless consolidates two of the most prominent excluded factions within the Party apparatus. In the eyes of the Politburo, this joint initiative constitutes a formal political alignment between residual Zinovievite elements and the Bukharinist revisionists."

russoc.355.t: "On the Organization of Socialist Agriculture"
russoc.355.d: "In accordance with recent plenary directives of the Council of Labor and Defense, a revised course for the socialist transformation of agriculture has been adopted. While the preceding period witnessed a structured transition to agricultural artels (SKhA), the emerging requirements of the national economic plan, combined with unsatisfactory procurement figures and logistical shortfalls, have necessitated further consolidation of the rural economy.\n\nA new decree introduces the systematic establishment of agricultural communes (SKhK) as the preferred form of collectivization. Unlike the earlier model, the commune is based on the full socialization of labor, land, tools, and consumption. The objective is the formation of integrated rural production units capable of direct coordination with central planning organs and immediate contribution to national provisioning quotas.\n\nThe STO directive emphasizes uniformity, measurable outputs, and administrative discipline. Former compromises regarding personal subsistence plots or peasant household autonomy are to be gradually phased out. Supervisory commissions are to be dispatched regionally to accelerate enrollment, reclassification of property, and restructuring of rural labor brigades.\n\nWhile the decree contains no direct reference to class enemies or kulaks, it authorizes local authorities to \"apply exceptional administrative measures in cases of sabotage, obstruction, or failure to comply with transitional norms\"."
russoc.355.d2: "The Council of Labor and Defense, in coordination with the VSNKh, has issued a general directive establishing collectivization as a central axis of rural economic reorganization. The newly approved policy mandates the creation of Agricultural Communes (SKhK) as the primary organizational form for peasant labor and provisioning.\n\nUnder this model, all means of production, land, equipment, and consumption are to be fully socialized within each unit. Individual subsistence holdings, surplus retention, and non-communal structures are to be abolished in phases according to a timetable developed by the State Planning Commission.\n\nThe decree emphasizes collectivization not as a class campaign, but as a structural obligation of the national plan. However, provisions authorize local authorities and district executive committees to initiate administrative dispossession and coercive restructuring in regions deemed to be lagging in compliance.\n\nThe STO classifies this transformation as a decisive test of the organizational capacity of the socialist state. Special commissariats will oversee recruitment, classification, and disciplinary enforcement. The policy is not framed in agitational terms, but its execution implies a comprehensive remolding of rural society in accordance with principles of central control, equalized labor, and production discipline."
russoc.355.d3: "The Council of Labor and Defense, after extended consultations with economic departments and planning boards, has adopted a moderate plan for rural collectivization. Acknowledging the diversity of conditions across the Soviet countryside, the new policy emphasizes voluntary Associations for Joint Cultivation of Land (TOZ) as the primary form of cooperative development.\n\nUnlike the full collectivization model, TOZ structures allow for partial retention of household autonomy while encouraging the pooling of labor and machinery for seasonal or intensive work. The goal is to expand cooperative land use and raise productivity without prematurely disrupting traditional patterns of rural life.\n\nThe decision of the STO reflects a preference for gradual transition over administrative compulsion. Cadres are instructed to avoid excessive coercion or rapid reclassification and instead prioritize incentive schemes, model collectives, and technical education.\n\nThe policy maintains the broader aim of agricultural modernization and integration into central planning but downplays ideological confrontation. Implementation is to be managed regionally, under the supervision of cooperative unions and planning commissions."

The decision is presented as a matter of strategic efficiency, dictated by the geographic, economic, and logistical priorities of centralized planning and coordination, as well as symbolic restoration of Lenin's legacy, although the circumstances of the previous transfer of the capital caused by the German offensive and widely publicized in the post-Weltkrieg years as a "cowardly flight", were silenced.\n\nThe transfer of commissariats and key agencies to the Moscow administrative hub will proceed over the following months in a staged and orderly fashion. In accompanying materials circulated within Party and institutional circles, it is stated that while [195.GetName] retains historic and symbolic significance, the requirements of a rational socialist state demand a seat of government secure from disruption, better aligned with lines of communication and industrial backbone of the country.\n\nThe language of the decree does not refer to [195.GetName]'s recent past. However, in Party discussions, it is quietly acknowledged that the chaos and instability associated with both the Popular Front and the Zinovievite era have compromised [195.GetName]’s credibility as a center of national authority.

russoc.357.d: "Following the decisive stabilization of the Party and the restoration of Soviet authority, the Central Committee has approved and circulated an official ideological document summarizing the new orientation of the socialist state under present conditions. Framed by V.M. Molotov and introduced through the organs of state, the resolution proclaims the theoretical foundation and long-term objectives of the Soviet Union in the new epoch.\n\n"Socialism in One State" is not a retreat, but a culmination. It affirms that socialism is not a transient stage but a sovereign, self-sustaining model of civilization forged in the furnace of Russian history, revolution, and war. Excerpts from this Resolution mention that the Soviet state is the highest form of class rule, the perfected dictatorship of the proletariat, and the only existing bearer of Marxist orthodoxy. It draws its lineage from the victorious October Revolution and the military-political genius of Lenin. The so-called "Third Internationale" has been perverted by anarcho-syndicalists and parliamentary fantasists in the West. Its current incarnation bears no relation to the Marxist tradition, and its continued existence stands in contradiction to the interests of the world proletariat. Russia shall sever all ideological and political reliance on foreign adventurism.\n\nThe most interesting, the Resolution states that Bolshevism is a uniquely Russian method of Marxism. It is not exportable through universal slogans or mimicry of the French Commune. It arises from the will of the Russian working class, the discipline of the Party, and the centralized State. Syndicalist heresies, Zinovievite populism, Trotskyite Bonapartism, and Bukharinist market utopias are to be rejected as revisionist and petit-bourgeois deviations.\n\n"

russoc.358.t: "[GetYear] Soviet Constitution"
russoc.358.d: "After months of deliberation, the draft of the new Fundamental Law of the Workers' Republic has been approved and ratified by the Congress of Soviets.\n\nThe new Constitution codifies the socialist soviet system as the enduring foundation of the Russian state, adapted to current realities. The key changes, naturally, focused on the issue of government. The experience of 1918 Constitution, where vague federalism and dualism of power paralyzed effective governance, is explicitly repudiated. Instead, a hierarchical model is adopted, ensuring direct vertical authority and subordinated Commissariats and production-directive bodies.\n\nThe Congress of Soviets is retained with its role of a consultive forum. Between its convocations, which have been reduced to one every four years, supreme legislative, executive-administrative authority is exercised directly by the Council of Labor and Defense, responsible for economic planning, security and labor mobilization. The STO is led by an Executive Committee (Ispolkom STO) and a Chairman, elected by its members. Both Sovnarkom and VTsIK have been abolished, with their functions being transferred to the STO's Ispolkom - a concrete embodiment of the unity of Party and State in service to socialism.\n\nIn preamble and clause, the Constitution anchors itself in the doctrine of Socialism in One State - identifying the Russian socialist path as the only legitimate development of Bolshevik-Leninist thought. Neither Internationalist illusions nor Intra-party democratic fetish are any longer permitted to deform the character of the proletarian state."

russoc.359.d: "In accordance with the revised constitutional order and the reaffirmed supremacy of the STO as the supreme organ of Soviet statehood, the restructuring of executive responsibilities within the Council of People's Commissars has been finalized. With the Chairman of the STO recognized as the head of state and national strategy, the need has arisen to designate the Ispolkom of the STO to ensure continuity in the day-to-day management of governmental functions and preserve collective rule.\n\nThe Presidium of the VTsIK has now placed in consideration a list of approved candidates. These individuals, each seasoned administrators of the Soviet system and known for their alignment with the directives of national planning, have been nominated to assume leadership of Sovnarkom and implement the economic, social, and industrial transformations outlined in the current Plan.\n\nThe final confirmation rests with the Chairman of the STO. In the interest of operational clarity and institutional discipline, the transition shall be immediate and without ceremonial excess."

russoc.360.t: "Reaffirming the Bolshevik State"
russoc.360.d: "With the ideological consolidation around Socialism in One State, the Central Historical Commission has issued a comprehensive reassessment of the formative years of the Bolshevik Party. At its center stands a newly elevated figure: Yakov Sverdlov, first Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. Molotov, in coordination with the Commission, has endorsed a broad program to reintroduce Sverdlov’s legacy into official memory - not as a martyr or charismatic figure, but as the model functionary, whose early drive for party centralization, personnel discipline, and strict ideological fidelity is now seen as the historical precursor to the current era.\n\nThe new campaign, dubbed the Sverdlov Line, includes renaming of several party schools and administrative buildings; a rewrite of educational curricula, portraying Sverdlov as Lenin’s indispensable organizational complement; official denunciation of earlier "personality-centric" historiographies that overstated the role of factionalists and failed revolutionaries.\n\nAgitprop departments have begun producing serialized radio programs and brochures, while statues and portraits of previously celebrated figures are quietly removed or repositioned. In official doctrine, the Sverdlovite legacy is now treated as the continuum of Leninism through order, unity, and the impersonal supremacy of the Worker-Peasant State - virtues the Molotovite regime asserts it now fully realizes."

russoc.361.t: "The Yefremovite Standard"
russoc.361.d: "In the Beloglazovsky district of the Altai Territory, on the wind-swept frontier with hostile [MON.GetName], a peasant by the name of Mikhail Yefremov has achieved what once seemed impossible. At the head of his artel, "Iskra," he organized labor on such a scale and with such discipline that he produced an astounding 61 quintals of wheat per hectare on 3.6 hectares, and 54 quintals on another 8.5 hectares.\n\nYefremov, a veteran of the rural Soviet cause and now the elected chairman of his collective, credited not only the unity of collective labor but the vigilant attention to defensive preparedness and proper ideological education among his peers. Across villages and districts, news of this feat spread quickly-not merely through newspapers, but by word of mouth, by field letters, by proud whisper. In response, a wave of imitators has emerged. Agricultural workers from Voronezh to Novosibirsk have begun forming brigades under the banner of the "Yefremovites" - a new standard of labor discipline, yields, and moral clarity. Ministries have cautiously taken note. Even in the offices of Gosplan, charts bearing the term "Yefremovite Baseline" have begun to appear.\n\nComrade Molotov, in a speech to a closed session of the government, cited Yefremov's achievement as a sign of the inner strength of the Socialist Fatherland and the nascent capacities of the Soviet man when properly organized under collective will. Agitprop departments have followed suit: traveling exhibitions now feature portraits of Yefremov as a symbol of the toiling, humble patriot whose work speaks louder than words."

russoc.362.d: "Across the vast factory floors of the socialist republic, a new movement has begun to ignite the spirit of labor. The udarniks - model workers of boundless energy, patriotic commitment, and fanatical discipline - have emerged as the vanguard of production. These exemplary laborers exceed norms, surpass quotas, and embody the ideals of socialism through action, not words.\n\nThe press glorifies their names, local Party cells honor their example, and factories now compete.

russoc.363.d: "After a thorough audit and a special inquiry by the TsKK, it has been determined that the People’s Commissariat for Nationalities (Narkomnats) no longer fulfills a necessary or ideologically appropriate function within the apparatus of the Soviet state. Originally formed in the early days of the Soviet Republic to promote fraternal cooperation between the peoples of Russia, the Commissariat had, over time, drifted into political irrelevance and factional misuse. Investigative materials revealed a concerning pattern of activity under Semyon Dimanshteyn, its most recent chairman, who maintained close ties to the Zinovievite network and permitted the infiltration of nationalist deviations under the guise of cultural work.\n\nParticular scrutiny was placed on the disproportionate allocation of resources to certain settlement initiatives and land schemes of dubious national-economic value, known as KomZET, as well as cooperation with structures now under investigation for subversive political intent. Dimanshteyn has been relieved of his duties and detained pending further review.\n\nThe functions of Narkomnats will be abolished, with residual tasks of interethnic coordination transferred to a new Section for National-Administrative Affairs under the Sovnarkom, to ensure they align fully with the directives of the Party and the principles of Socialism in One State."

russoc.364.d: "As the foundations of the new order continue to solidify, the Internationale - once the clarion call of the world revolution - now echoes awkwardly through the halls of a state that claims no kinship with the syndicalist revolts abroad. The official hymn of the Soviet Republic, preserved through the Zinovievite years, no longer reflects [ROOT.GetLeader]'s vision of a patriotic and centralized socialism.\n\nFollowing a nationwide contest held by the Narkompros and Agitprop, two compositions have emerged as serious contenders for replacing the Internationale.\n\nThe first, a stirring orchestral piece by Boris Aleksandrov, titled "Da Zdravstvuyet Nasha Derzhava!" (Long Live Our State!), fuses grandeur with ideological orthodoxy. The second, far more controversial, is a heavily rewritten version of "Proshchaniye Slavyanki", the old White and Imperial military march long banned by Bolsheviks. While the lyrics now celebrate socialist industry and the defense of the Fatherland, some within the Party whisper that no amount of revision can erase the song's origins. Still, among the common people, the melody stirs deep emotion, especially among some veterans and frontiersmen"

russoc.365.d: "As [ROOT.GetNameDef] consolidates itself, the need to formally recognize the outstanding labor and valor of its citizens has taken on fresh ideological urgency. The Congress of Soviets has ratified the establishment of new state honors - civilian and military alike - suited to the values of the new socialist state.\n\nThe Order of Aleksandr Nevsky, once an emblem of tsarist heraldry, has been radically transformed and redefined. Stripped of its clerical and dynastic symbols, it now stands as a badge of strategic acumen and battlefield courage - as a secular symbol of the people's martial ingenuity and patriotic endurance. Named for the commander who defended the Russian land against foreign invaders, it is presented as a tribute to those who carry forward the same spirit under the red banner of the Republic. Alongside it, the title of Hero of Soviet Russia has been established - the highest distinction a citizen may receive for exceptional service in either combat or labor. The decoration is to consist of a gold star inscribed with the words “For the Socialist Fatherland” to be awarded sparingly by decree of the Sovnarkom itself.\n\nThese honors will be accompanied by a revised system of commendations for peacetime labor. New civilian orders and medals are under review, with consideration given to outstanding workers in agriculture, heavy industry, and socialist construction.\n\nIn public posters, state bulletins, and forthcoming educational curricula, these symbols will serve to codify and exalt the ideals of Socialism in One State - not as mere decorations, but as pillars of a moral and disciplined statehood."

russoc.366.t: "A New Culture for a New State"
russoc.366.d: "With the ideological consolidation of Socialism in One State, the government has turned decisively toward shaping a truly national Soviet culture - one that is neither imported nor abstract, but born of Russian soil, shaped by the labor of the masses, and directed toward the uplift of the Socialist Fatherland. In a series of decrees, the foundations of this new cultural renaissance have been laid. Under the coordination of Narkompros, and its newly formed Main Directorate for National Culture (Glavnatskult), cultural life is to be organized on principles of moral clarity, patriotic devotion, socialist collectivism, and national unity.\n\nExperimental and cosmopolitan tendencies of the past - Proletkult, futurist abstraction, and constructivist formalism - have been redirected. The Proletarian Workshop Theaters now stage grand national epics, the New Futurists emphasize collective power and industrial heroism, abandoning decadent themes of speed and chaos for those of endurance and socialist order. Literature flourishes with works like "Wonderful Alloy" by Vladimir Kirshon, a saga of socialist construction. Cinema too marches in step - Vsevolod Vishnevsky's "Aleksandr Nevsky", a historical drama about the ancient Knyaz fighting the Teutons, has been declared a "film of All-People's significance". Musical policy, once splintered between academic elites and folk dilettantes, is reformed through mass choral programs blending Russian polyphony with martial rhythms.\n\nCulture is no longer a domain of ambiguity. It is a tool of national cohesion and moral transformation - a medium through which the new Soviet man learns devotion to labor, faith in the state, and reverence for the Fatherland."

russoc.367.d: "The new age of socialist governance finds its most precise expression not in slogans or banners, but in forms, plans, and directives. Across every sector of the economy, from metallurgy to machine tools, from coal basins to railway hubs, the dominance of the Glavki, the central industrial departments, is now firmly established.\n\nThe directorates and commissions now operate in strict vertical chains, with industrial managers answering to branch-specific bureaus that exercise direct command over production quotas, labor distribution, and material allocation. Reports flow upward, directives cascade downward.\n\nRather than spontaneous initiative or syndicalist self-management, it is the firm logic of state necessity that now governs Soviet industry. The triumph of Glavkism is not a break with socialism, but its maturation under national conditions."

russoc.368.t: "On the Legal Responsibility for Evasion of Labor Duty"
russoc.368.d: "In accordance with the directives of the government, a new resolution has been adopted to address the persistent issue of labor evasion among a minority of unproductive citizens. Whereas the former administration permitted unemployment to fester as a symptom of bourgeois economic anarchy, the Soviet state affirms that labor is not a market function but a social obligation. Under conditions of planned socialist economy, the existence of unemployment is neither natural nor tolerable - it represents, in essence, a form of parasitism.\n\nPreviously, measures such as administrative fines and temporary detention were enacted to discourage idleness, but experience has shown these to be insufficient. Comrade Molotov, has endorsed a new, systemic solution: the formal criminalization of parasitism. Henceforth, individuals persistently refusing socially useful labor will be subject to legal prosecution under newly introduced articles of the Labor Code. Convicted persons shall be assigned to corrective production facilities under the supervision of the All-Russian Main Labor Directorate (VGTU), established as a new administrative organ. These labor-productive institutions will serve not as punitive sites, but as instruments of social integration and rehabilitation. Under conditions of discipline, collective responsibility, and material contribution to the socialist economy, every citizen shall have the opportunity to fulfill their labor duty to the Fatherland."

russoc.369.t: "The Rationalization of the Map"
russoc.369.d: "In accordance with the recent directives, a new phase of territorial standardization has commenced: the rationalization and renaming of urban centers across the Republic. This policy does not proceed from sentiment, nor is it guided by the cult of martyrs or by indulgent revolutionary romanticism. Rather, the guiding principles are those of function, loyalty, and planned development. Names must reflect order, discipline, productivity, and adherence to the general line of Socialist construction.\n\nA limited number of cities are to be renamed in recognition of outstanding achievements in the industrialization campaign, successful regional collectivization, or the establishment of exemplary internal governance. In isolated cases, select individuals whose political loyalty and administrative excellence have shaped the present course of the Republic are also commemorated.\n\nAmong the confirmed changes: Molotov (formerly Perm), Kyubyshev (formerly Samara), Direktivinsk (formerly Vyatka), Planograd (formerly Kozlov), Formsobra (formerly Balakovo), Sverdstal (formerly Nadezhdinsk), Energograd (formerly Bobriki), Trudovlasov (formerly Slavgorod), Rubezhstroy (formerly Ust-Kamenogorsk). The work is quiet, precise, and unbroken by rhetorical excess."

russoc.370.t: "Systematization of the Industrial Order"
russoc.370.d: "The STO has concluded a comprehensive review of the industrial management protocols currently in effect across the republic. Following consultation with the organs of national economic planning and labor control, Chairman Molotov has approved a formal directive codifying the principles of accelerated socialist industrialization under conditions of national discipline and rational planning.\n\nThe new framework systematizes several already ongoing practices. First, compulsory labor assignments for underutilized populations are authorized in designated sectors, to be carried out under the supervision of regional production authorities. Second, criminal liability for the deliberate disruption of industrial schedules and falsification of plan indicators has been standardized, subject to legal review but without mass incarceration. Third, a unified system of labor rationing and performance-linked bonuses is to be implemented across all major combines and trusts, guided by norms and self-financing principles.\n\nIn cases of external threat, production breakdown, or regional instability, the STO is further authorized to declare zones of mobilized economic governance, where industrial enterprises may be restructured into vertically integrated "economic combines" with centralized direction. Special representatives of the Council may be dispatched with extraordinary supervisory rights."
russoc.370.a: "The State demands organization and predictability."

russoc.371.t: "Standardization in the Countryside"
russoc.371.d: "Following the stabilization of industrial management under directive self-financing, the question of rural standardization has returned to the agenda. The recently established Narkomzem (People's Commissariat of Agriculture), in conjunction with regional authorities and economic planning sections, has presented an implementation schema for the next phase of collectivization - one grounded not in chaotic mobilization, but in a rational system of long-term control.\n\nThe strategy minimizes the need for forced unification of peasant households. Instead, it emphasizes mechanization through Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) and gradual absorption of surplus labor into growing state farms and construction brigades. A policy of labor discipline enforcement and internal passport regulation will be extended to rural areas. Nevertheless, sporadic resistance has emerged: passive noncompliance, livestock slaughter, and flight from administrative zones.\n\nA divergence has formed among senior implementers. One current, backed by the Commissariat’s technical staff, insists the plan be pursued incrementally, using supply quotas and equipment allocation to pressure lagging areas. A second group - composed of regional party secretaries and forward-planning economists - advocates a temporary imposition of intensified controls, including localized labor rotations and restricted movement in problem Guberniyas."

russoc.372.t: "The New Function of the Trade Unions"
russoc.372.d: "The Russian Central Council of Trade Unions (RTsSPS), once a semi-autonomous mass organization shaped by political plurality and social demands, has now entered a new phase under the direction of Comrade Nikolay Shvernik, promoted from his role at TsKK. Appointed with the approval of the Council of Labor and Defense, Shvernik has introduced a program of rationalization, integration, and subordination - aligning the trade unions with the centralized needs of labor administration.\n\nThe transition follows a series of well-justified dismissals and restructurings. Former leaders associated with the populist or Menshevik current have been removed for documented failures in discipline enforcement, sabotage of plan implementation, or tacit sympathy with oppositionist tendencies. Today, the RTsSPS stands redefined. Union organs are fully integrated into the administrative apparatus as their leadership is confirmed by STO or the People’s Commissariat of Labor, and they operate on strict lines of discipline and accountability. The unions now enforce plan compliance, monitor labor standards, distribute rewards, and implement bonus schemes. Local union cells maintain oversight of labor norms, udarnik contests, and productivity campaigns. They also have the right to report on saboteurs and recommend corrective action.\n\nWhile unions no longer fight for political demands, they serve as channels for organizing housing queues, ration distribution, rest home placements, and cultural activities - creating a sense of order and care among the working masses."

russoc.373.t: "Directive No. 72"
russoc.373.d: "In accordance with the latest directive of the Council of Labor and Defense, the Narkomvoyenmor, under the leadership of its Narkom Kliment Voroshilov, has begun the phased implementation of a new framework for ensuring ideological reliability and organizational coherence within the Red Army.\n\nThe first directive stipulates the formal expansion of the military tribunal network, with increased jurisdiction over both service-related misconduct and violations of labor and ideological discipline. These tribunals will operate alongside existing command structures, empowered to issue binding rulings in expedited fashion. A second measure concerns the institutionalization of disciplinary battalions, not as punitive tools alone, but as corrective labor units to restore ideological and behavioral conformity among deviants. These battalions are subordinated directly to district political departments and will undergo weekly review by party commissions. Of particular significance is the formation of the Corps of Political Instructors, an evolution of the traditional commissar system. Their role now encompasses not only the enforcement of party loyalty, but the structured dissemination of core tenets of "Socialism in One State".\n\nThe integration of ideology and command will proceed gradually, but with uncompromising rigor. Combat readiness is not defined solely by materiel and maneuvers, but by internal cohesion, discipline, and doctrinal clarity - all of which are now subject to rational, centralized oversight."

russoc.374.t: "The Dispute in the Headquarters"
russoc.374.d: "Reports have reached the Sovnarkom regarding escalating tensions between the Political Department and the General Staff. As the political role of the military expands under the new socialist order, friction has become unavoidable. The Political Department insists on the full subordination of military command to the ideological line of the party. Daily political briefings, ideological audits of officers, and mandatory compliance reports are now routine across the armed forces. Commissars cite worrying trends of bureaucratic detachment among senior officers - some of whom are veterans of the old army or have developed an independent esprit de corps.\n\nThe General Staff, under the patronage of Narkom Kliment Voroshilov, has pushed back. Accusations of "amateur interference" by commissars, delayed operations due to party reviews, and the erosion of chain-of-command authority have prompted demands for clarification. Quietly, some senior officers have even petitioned the STO to limit the scope of political supervision within combat units."

russoc.375.t: "Resolution on Deviations in the Command Staff"
russoc.375.d: "Following the recent review conducted under joint instructions of the Political Department and the TsKK, a number of commanding officers have been found to exhibit patterns of deviation from the directive line of military-ideological integration. These deviations included: repeated failure to comply with political-educational program implementation; resistance to the presence and oversight functions of party instructors; concealment of ideological inconsistencies among subordinate staff; expressions of operational autonomy inconsistent with the collective discipline expected under the doctrine of Socialism in One State.\n\nAfter due consideration, the STO and Chairman Molotov personally have authorized to relieve a number of senior officers of their posts and convene tribunals to assess compliance across all branches of command. Political supervision will also be expanded within the General Staff and all military academies."
russoc.375.a: "Principle must be enforced."

russoc.376.t: "Unity of the Soviet People"
russoc.376.d: "In the interest of strengthening the ideological unity and economic integration of the various regions, the STO hereby affirms the transition to a unified state model, replacing the outdated federal framework with a streamlined structure of centrally administered socialist regions. The principle of national self-expression, historically affirmed during the period of Civil War, has given way to the practical demands of Socialism in One State. Under current conditions, the existence of multiple parallel republican administrations has led to fragmentation of planning, and the growth of petty-bourgeois localisms.\n\nHenceforth, all former national republics are to be reorganized into administrative-territorial zones of socialist construction. Their representative organs shall be subordinated to all-Russian commissariats, while instruction, clerical work, and all technical communication are to be standardized on the basis of the Russian language, as the scientific and administrative language of socialist construction.\n\nCultural and linguistic life of national minorities may continue within the frameworks established by the People's Commissariat for Enlightenment and under the supervision of appropriate organs. However, agitation for federalism, ethnic separatism, or national exceptionalism will be considered hostile acts subject to criminal sanction.\n\nInitial reports from the periphery note isolated incidents of administrative non-compliance, passive resistance among cadre networks, and expressions of discontent by local intellectual circles. These tendencies are to be recorded, studied, and suppressed in accordance with the directives of the Rabkrin."

russoc.377.t: "A New Cadre of the Plan"
russoc.377.d: "Following the directive of the recent Session of the State Planning Commission and the recommendations submitted by the Central Control Commission, a personnel adjustment proposal is submitted for review. Comrade Nikolay Voznesensky, currently assigned to the TsKK Rabkrin, has demonstrated exceptional aptitude in the field of socialist political economy. Trained under the guidance of Comrade Zhdanov and proven in the implementation of regional industrial indicators, Voznesensky has consistently advocated for the integration of economic forecasting with long-range political priorities - emphasizing centralized planning metrics, rigid discipline in material flows, and system-wide optimization of labor coefficients.\n\nWith the support of Comrade Zhdanov, it is proposed that Comrade Voznesensky be advanced to a senior leadership post within Gosplan, with responsibilities extending into VSNKh coordination. While not formally displacing existing functionaries, this appointment would recalibrate internal structures in favor of long-term strategic rationalization.\n\nObjections have been raised from elements within the economic administration citing potential erosion of seniority hierarchies. Nevertheless, the STO considers this a question of future capacity. The matter is presented to the Politburo for resolution."
russoc.377.a: "Approve the appointment."
russoc.377.b: "Let him remain in reserve."

russoc.378.t: "Disagreement in the Gosplan"
russoc.378.d: "A review of preliminary proposals for the upcoming economic directive cycle has revealed a developing conflict within the leadership of the national planning apparatus. Comrade Kaganovich, Commissar of Heavy Industry, has submitted a proposal emphasizing sharp expansion in core heavy industry metrics, labor mobilization benchmarks, and heightened extraction quotas - citing the need to exceed existing capacity targets as a matter of strategic priority. His draft plan advocates the reintroduction of intensified controls over local procurement offices, accelerated collectivization of underperforming zones, and a renewed push for industrial concentration.\n\nIn contrast, Deputy Chair of Gosplan Comrade Voznesensky, recently promoted under the sponsorship of Comrade Zhdanov, has submitted parallel memoranda expressing concern at what he terms the "overaccumulation of administrative friction and depletion of labor reserves." Voznesensky recommends a more measured revision of existing targets, a reduction in pressure on transport and supply chains, and limited delegation of planning functions to specialized industrial combines.\n\nThe STO notes that this divergence is no longer one of personal style, but of political and economic principle. If not addressed promptly, the coherence of national economic leadership may suffer."
russoc.378.a: "Reaffirm the Kaganovich line."
russoc.378.b: "Support Voznesensky's caution."

russoc.379.d: "The government, acting on the recommendation of the STO and in consultation with the TsKK, has approved the appointment of Comrade Nikolay Voznesensky as the new Chairman of the State Planning Commission. The decision, framed as part of a broader rotation of cadres, reflects the increasing emphasis on methodological rigor, budgetary discipline, and the necessity of long-term sustainability in economic development. Behind the formal language, however, lies a deeper shift. Voznesensky’s promotion signals the ascendance of a more technocratic approach - one that challenges the directive maximalism championed by certain longstanding figures in the economic apparatus.\n\nAmong them is Comrade Kaganovich, whose recent objections to excessive academicism in planning and warnings have grown more vocal. While no official rebuke has been issued, discussions have begun within the Politburo regarding his future role."

russoc.380.t: "Unexpected Death of Comrade Molotov"
russoc.380.d: "It is with solemnity and revolutionary discipline that the Party informs its comrades of an unexpected and grievous development. Earlier today, while on personal leave at a private residence outside Kuntsevo, Chairman of the Council of Labor and Defense, Comrade Vyacheslav Molotov, was taken ill. Medical assistance, summoned immediately by accompanying comrades, proved unable to reverse a sudden deterioration of his condition. The cause has been preliminarily attributed to the acute cardiovascular failure, though the final medical assessment is pending.\n\nIn recognition of the Chairman’s foresight, the Party has received and verified a testamentary note from Comrade Molotov - drafted during a prior period of health uncertainty - affirming Comrade Lazar Kaganovich as his designated successor in the event of sudden incapacitation. The Politburo convened an emergency plenary session of the Central Committee, which confirmed the succession in a spirit of unity and revolutionary vigilance. In accordance with statute and precedent, the Central Committee voted to approve Comrade Kaganovich as Chairman of the Council of Labor and Defense with immediate effect.\n\nMinor disruptions during the plenary session, attributed to emotional strain and ideological fatigue among a small minority of delegates, were addressed by Comrade Klim Voroshilov and representatives of the TsKK. The Secretariat reminds all comrades that the Party is indivisible, and vigilance in the face of factional speculation is the highest expression of loyalty to the revolutionary cause."
russoc.380.a: "Long live the unity of the Party. Long live socialist construction."

russoc.381.t: "The Necessary Clarification of the Party Line"
russoc.381.d: "In the early morning hours, the STO convened under extraordinary procedures to review a situation of ideological drift within certain auxiliary institutions of the state. The internal memorandum issued by the Ispolkom cited "systematic deviation from the principles of economic orthodoxy," "linguistic adventurism," and "cultivation of factionalist tendencies within administrative planning organs." No names were listed at first.\n\nBy noon, lists were distributed to key commissariats. At the top were two familiar names: Andrey Zhdanov, a key Molotovite theorist of national-cultural policy, and Nikolay Voznesensky, Head of Gosplan. Both were accused of "persistent deviationist sabotage" and "concealed opportunist centralism hostile to the unity of the Soviet people."\n\nArrests followed swiftly. Voznesensky’s office was sealed before the workday began. Zhdanov, summoned for a discussion of ideological matters in the early afternoon, never returned. A circular was dispatched to all party cells by midnight, claiming that the organs of security have uncovered a latent anti-party group led by administrative opportunists. By morning, several dozen party cadres - planners, theorists, second-tier editors - had also disappeared. No formal trial followed.\n\nAmong inner circles, no one openly spoke of the real cause. But rumors spread in cautious tones: that Zhdanov had overreached, that Voznesensky had continued to meet with sidelined technocrats, and that someone - perhaps one of their own - had passed transcripts to Chairman Kaganovich."

russoc.382.t: "The [GetChekaName] Conspiracy?"
russoc.382.d: "It began with a delay. The morning dispatch from the [GetChekaName] failed to arrive on time - unusual, but not unprecedented. Then a second irregularity: a paper trail, long thought expunged, emerged within the STO, flagging unauthorized personnel movements inside the Kremlin's lower service corridors. A faint smell of gun oil was later reported by guards at Entrance Four, though no one was officially armed.\n\nOnly in the early evening did the full shape of the conspiracy begin to cohere: Genrikh Yagoda, Head of the NKVD, had initiated a covert maneuver - not yet public, but dangerously real. His agents had forged documents meant to invalidate the emergency succession proceedings. Several members of the Presidium were to be detained under pretext of investigation. At the same time, Yagoda himself had secured temporary control over the inner command network of the [GetChekaName]’s [ROOT.Capital.GetName] district - enough to isolate the Kremlin for hours if needed.\n\nThe timing was ruthless, and precise. Had the informant within the [GetChekaName] not defected to the STO hours earlier, the chair Kaganovich now occupied might have stood empty by morning. Now, the balance hangs on a knife’s edge."

russoc.383.t: "Chekist Coup in [ROOT.Capital.GetName]"
russoc.383.d: "No messages had arrived from Kaganovich since last night. No directives, no broadcasts, not even the morning bulletin. At 08:17, an encrypted communiqué was circulated to all regional [GetChekaName] directorates: \"The duties of national security and governance are temporarily transferred to the [GetChekaName] until constitutional clarity is restored. By directive of Comrade Genrikh Yagoda.\"\n\nBy 09:10, armored cars surrounded the Council of People's Commissars. Guards loyal to the STO had been quietly replaced. And by noon, a plain statement was issued from the STO: \"Chairman Kaganovich has been detained by the organs of state for investigation into violations of party legality and betrayal of the revolutionary order. A provisional regime of national restoration has been declared.\" No photographs in the press were published. No trial was announced. Only a silence, thick with implication, spread across the Party, the army, the Comissariats."
russoc.383.a: "Comrade Yagoda has saved us!"

russoc.384.t: "The Question of Power"
russoc.384.d: "The last remnants of Molotov's shattered Secretariat and STO have been swept away. Genrikh Yagoda, now the unchallenged master of the security organs, sits beneath the faded portrait of a vanished men - Dzerzhinsky. The [GetChekaName] currently holds the levers of the state. Commissariats wait for instruction. The remnants of the Sovnarkom sit in stunned silence, many unsure if they will be summoned or swept aside. Outside, rumors drift - of a return to legality, or of a new autocracy born in uniform and shadow.\n\nYagoda's own men urge caution and whisper to place a puppet, less radical, than Kaganovich was, presuming continuity of power. Yet others argue that the coup can be redeemed by renunciation. That justice demands the restoration of the old Zinovievite cadre."
russoc.384.a: "Comrade Malenkov will lead the government."
russoc.384.b: "We should call for the party plenum to decide."

russoc.385.t: "The New Government"
russoc.385.d: "In light of the emergency mandate vested in the Central Committee after the constitutional disruption of the Molotov–Kaganovich period, an extended Plenum of the Central Committee has been convened in [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. The agenda is to determine the appointment of a new Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, who shall guide the reconstitution of state authority under Party oversight.\n\nAmong the delegates, debate has concentrated around two principal figures, each representing a distinct interpretation of ideological continuity and future direction of the Bolshevik-Leninism."
russoc.385.a: "Comrade Radek is selected as Chairman."
russoc.385.b: "Comrade Pyatnitsky is selected as Chairman."

russoc.386.t: "Kaganovich Weathers the Storm"
russoc.386.d: "It seems that the reactionary forces within [GetChekaName] have underestimated Lazar Kaganovich's resolve, thinking that the removal of the Chairman would be a simple affair. Having overplayed his hand, the perfidious traitor Yagoda was apprehended while his lackeys had been either arrested or shot dead by forces loyal to the revolutionary cause. With the elimination of the shadowy conspiracy aimed at the very heart of Soviet power Iron Lazar can now set about implementing his vision of the Union, free from forces that would delay the coming of true Socialism."
russoc.386.a: "Comrade Kaganovich has saved us!"

russoc.387.t: "Agranov's Anti-Soviet Conspiracy"
russoc.387.d: "With the appointment of Agranov as head of the NKVD, a massive campaign began to purge the country of sabotage, enemies and traitors to the country. It seems that the fight against dissent has developed even more radically and widely. Perhaps we should not doubt Agranov, he has repeatedly proved his loyalty to the ideas of socialism and Yagoda personally. However, our Chairman of the Supreme Court, Aleksandr Vinokurov believes that the NKVD is acting on its own behind the curtain and the remnants of Kaganovich's anti-Soviet conspiracy are still acting - and Agranov might be one of them. If the Chairman of the Sovnarkom believes that a more reliable person should be appointed to this position - he has the right to do so, but attacking Yagoda's loyalist could be not the best choice in the long-term perspective."
russoc.387.a: "Agranov will remain in his position."
russoc.387.b: "Comrade Yezhov will become the new Head of the NKVD"

russoc.388.t: "Yagoda Removed from Power!"
russoc.388.d: "We were not mistaken about Yezhov, unfortunately, in a way we did not expect. The young Chekist took advantage of the power granted to him and, with the help of armed detachments of the Cheka, has supported Georgy Malenkov in removing [ROOT.GetLeader] and his confidants, that according to him, were responsible for arresting innocent people and ruling the country from the shadows.\n\nYezhov, who was appointed Chairman of the STO instead of Yagoda as a reward for his loyalty, has today delivered a speech before the Congress of the Party with a clear message - to get rid of the STO as the informal and unconstitutional body and that he will personally assist in making sure that the Chairman of the Sovnarkom is the sole person responsible for the country. Meanwhile, the ridding and purging the country of all kinds of traitors would be continued, in order to make the workers and peasants live in an absolutely protected country."
russoc.388.a: "Glory to our nation!"

russoc.389.t: "Party Applauds to the New Chairman"
russoc.389.d: "Today, an extraordinary congress of the Party was convened at the initiative of Yezhov, People's Commissar for Internal Affairs, who presented evidence of corruption and anti-Soviet conspiracies in the highest echelons of the Party leadership.\n\nTo everyone's astonishment, Yezhov launched into a lengthy speech listing names, dates, addresses, and other details, but suddenly shifted to personal attacks against Malenkov, the chairman of the Sovnarkom. The delegates were initially silent, unsure how to respond, before erupting in soft murmurs. Malenkov remained silent throughout. Eventually, one delegate shouted "Treachery!", prompting Yezhov to declare that this comrade had spoken the truth - treachery was indeed taking place in the very room where Malenkov presided as Chairman. Then he demanded that the staunch Chekists who were also in attendance immediately apprehend this bourgeois element, which was promptly executed. Some were still unsettled, and Yezhov then demanded the arrest of any comrades opposed to the Party line.\n\nUpon Yezhov’s announcement of the commencement of the trial, all those arrested were promptly escorted out of the chamber of the Soviets. Thereafter, he declared that he would assume the role of acting Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars until the next convocation of the Congress of Soviets, leaving no doubt that the [GetChekaName] was taking control. His speech elicited universal applause, with a minor official from Kursk guberniya later recounting in a private exchange that the standing ovation lasted for 15 minutes, causing some Party members to become exhausted and even collapse. These individuals were subsequently escorted out by [GetChekaName] agents as well."
russoc.389.a: "Even half an hour is insufficient to adequately praise our dear Yezhov!"

russoc.390.t: "Yagoda's Anti-Soviet Center in the [GetChekaName]"
russoc.390.d: "Today, the General Prosecutor spoke before the Supreme Court of [ROOT.GetNameDef], who confidently and convincingly provided evidence and facts revealed during the investigation of the cases of the anti-Soviet Zinovievite-Bukharinist center and its supporters on the ground that our valiant [GetChekaName] had failed in exposing these worst enemies of the people. The General Prosecutor believes that all the facts revealed during the investigation of the cases of the anti-Soviet Bukharin center and its supporters on the ground indicate that the [GetChekaName] failed in exposing these worst enemies of the people. The traitors to the motherland, the Bukharinites and other double-dealers, in alliance with the German and Japanese counterintelligence services, managed to launch wrecking, sabotage, espionage and terrorist activities with relative impunity, and to damage the cause of socialist construction in a number of industries and transport, not only because of the shortcomings of the work of party and economic organizations, but also because of the weak the work of the [GetChekaName].\n\nThe facts show that the main blow of the state security agencies was directed not against organized counterrevolutionary formations, but mainly against individual cases of anti-Soviet agitation, all kinds of official offenses, hooliganism, domestic crimes, etc. As a result, foreigners and criminal elements have infiltrated certain units of the State security agencies. A number of cases have been identified where even foreign intelligence spies have managed to infiltrate State security agencies. The same practice of undivided attitude towards the nomination of people, as well as the lack of political and educational work, created conditions under which outright traitors, the Zinovievites and Bukharinists, appeared in the leadership of the Chekist work.\n\nHowever, the delay in exposing the anti-Soviet activities of Bukharin's bandits is due not only to these general shortcomings in the work of state security agencies, but also to the specific criminal activities of some responsible [GetChekaName] officers, especially Yagoda, Molchanov, Firin and Agranov. As a result of such poor management of the agency, there were many traitors among the latter. During the investigation of the activities of the anti-Soviet center in Moscow alone, 65 traitor agents were identified who systematically misinformed the state security agencies, confused the whole matter and actively contributed to the unpunished activities of the Zinovievite-Bukharinists.\n\nIn this regard, the Prosecutor General considers it necessary to sentence the Yagoda clique, namely, himself, as well as Molchanov, Firin and Agranov, for all his crimes, to immediate 'capital punishment'!"

russoc.391.d: "Our Soviet society is an amazing example of how people are able to unite and become parts of a single organism, in which everything works smoothly and efficiently. Thanks to the success of Comrade Yezhov, all people are employed and work for the benefit of the great Soviet Motherland, while Yezhov strangles the anti-Soviet reptiles.\n\nWe are moving with confident steps towards communism, comrades, and this is the merit not only of Comrade Yezhov, but also of all of us - the united Soviet citizens. Let the leaders, the honored workers of labor, show an example to all of us. In a society where there is no place for parasites and scoundrels, it can not be otherwise. And while the German-Japanese spies are plotting against us, we can be sure that nothing will stop our country."

russoc.392.d: "A new generation of Soviet citizens has already been born and is growing up - smart, hardworking, beautiful sons and daughters of a great socialist nation!\n\nSchools and factories are being built all over the country: there is a propaganda of labor, equality and socialism. Nothing else poisons the minds of young people: not the enemies of the people, nor the anti-Soviet press, nor spy saboteurs.\n\nWe can be sure that in one generation there will be no people in our country who will doubt that the Soviet government is the most acceptable and humane government. A generation will grow up that will know neither war nor famine - and will live in a world where everyone is equal, everyone gets what they deserve with their work."

russoc.393.t: "A Perfect Society"
russoc.393.d: "Perfection is a nigh-impossible and ever-enticing goal that all true members of humanity strive for, all knowing that this unachievable ideal would likely elude them for life. Still, in the face of this likely failure, they endure, in the vain hope of being able to simply brush against greatness and catch a glimpse of divinity or true perfection. However, in our reformed and reforged Union, this ever-elusive ideal has not only been achieved but fully harnessed and embraced, and it is all thanks to the glorious Chairman Yezhov.\n\nUnder the calculated, towering, and imposing rule of our beloved Chairman, the Russian people have endured great hardships and struggles, and for their sacrifices, our nation has been rewarded with true greatness as we emerge from our dark and corrupt past free and cleansed of sin, gracing true perfection under the Red Star of Bolshevism. The enemies of Russia, though numerous and unyielding, have been brought to the sword and Yezhov now guides our state down their river of blood to our new bright, crimson dawn.\n\nA perfect society has finally been forged on this imperfect and sinful Earth, righteously purged to be free from vice, desire, religion, need, and any other unseemly and craven traits and beliefs of lesser beings. The New Soviet Generation shall be the standard of the world as the true beacon of perfection and societal harmony, and under Chairman Yezhov, this generation shall be safeguarded at all costs as the pinnacle of humanity. All of Russia is safe and perfect under our glorious Chairman, and none shall rob us of this perfection as long as we still draw breath!"

russoc.395.d: "Thanks to the action of the [GetChekaName], the country was almost completely cleansed of counter-revolutionaries, opposition, spies and saboteurs.\n\nThe new country under the leadership of the wise Yagoda is a model of the truly best regime of government in recent millennia. The streets are clean, people are working and working for the good of the country, not for a fat capitalist.\n\nIt is almost a communist paradise, except that communism has not yet been built, but it will definitely be built in the coming decades, once the Red Army occupies Berlin and Vienna. In the meantime, Yagoda will continue to serve the Motherland faithfully, as he has all his life."
russoc.395.a: "A happy society!"

russoc.396.t: "Cultural Modernization of Soviet Statehood"
russoc.396.d: "The Narkompros has presented a memorandum recommending structural consolidation under the general framework of administrative optimization. The report outlines that, under current conditions, the tasks of social regulation, ideological instruction, civic upbringing, informational discipline, and internal monitoring fall across multiple commissariats with insufficient procedural integration. The lack of a unified organ to coordinate these functions undermines the systemic construction of socialism in one nation.\n\nAs per the proposal, a new organ - the State Committee of Internal Affairs (GKVD) - is to be established as a coordinating structure for all ideological, security, and civic management activities. It will incorporate both the NKVD and Narkompros as specialized directorates, preserving their existing hierarchies, while aligning their directives to centralized planning and political supervision. The GKVD will function under the overall authority of the Council of Labor and Defense.\n\nThe ideological justification provided invokes the line of Lenin, affirming the unity of cultural and state power in the construction of a socialist order. The new body is designed to eliminate the fragmentation of command and to enforce a comprehensive national doctrine: one culture, one ideology, one direction of labor."

The agenda is to determine the appointment of a new Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, who shall guide the reconstitution of state authority under Party oversight.\n\nAmong the delegates, debate has concentrated around a candidate from the Proletkult, under the suggestions of the GKVD - Vladimir Mayakovksy. A talented poet, during his service as the nation's vanguard literary talent in the GKVD and Union of Writers, he promoted creation of a society of educated and talented people. Everyone should master any art - the one that he or she will like. Training in painting, and especially in modern styles, architecture, and music, will be necessary and mandatory for everyone, both adults and children.

russoc.400.t: "The Second Most Important Soviet"
russoc.400.d: "Despite the fact that Nikolay Bukharin, in the early 1930s, formulated the concept of the "General Line of the Party", which logically follows from the fundamental principle of Bolshevik-Leninism – Democratic centralism, in practice, our party remains fragmented. Key decisions made at party congresses are binding, yet a number of senior party members continue to oppose these decisions.\n\nThe unity of the party has never been more crucial, and in light of this, [ROOT.GetLeader] declared at today's Plenum the initiation of a "unifying General Line", which requires finding a sustainable compromise with those in opposition.\n\nOne potential catalyst for this challenging task could be the essence of Soviet power – the leadership of the second-most-important Soviet institution in the country, the [195.GetName] Soviet. While the election process is undoubtedly democratic, the Central Committee has the ability to officially endorse a particular candidate. The question remains: who will it be?"
russoc.400.a: "The Party will support Grigory Zinoviev."
russoc.400.b: "Kuznetsov will receive our endorsement."

russoc.401.d: "Following Kirov's official nomination as the leading candidate for the position of chairman of the [195.GetName] Soviet by the party, he delivered a speech in which he acknowledged his errors and expressed support for the general course of the Party. In response, other members of the party came to his defense, arguing that Revolution does not tolerate doubt, yet Revolutions do not occur without it. They cited the example of October 1917, when there were internal doubts within the Party regarding the course of action, and no clear consensus was reached.\n\nDespite some discontent within the Central Committee regarding Kirov's stance, the party moved closer to achieving unity."
russoc.401.a: "Let's admit our mistakes for the sake of the unity of the country!"

russoc.402.t: "A Voice From the Grassroots"
russoc.402.d: "The Central Committee deems the so-called resolution on trade unions one of the most significant, perhaps even the pivotal factors contributing to the emergence of dissident platforms within the party. Following the decision of the congress, it was resolved to expedite the merger of trade unions with the state apparatus, which was viewed by the leaders of the Workers’ Opposition as a misstep and a deprivation of the revolution of its essential proletarian essence.\n\nWe cannot fully assuage the demands of the working-class opposition, but we can seek a resolution by addressing the root causes of conflict. At the heart of the Workers’ Opposition lies a vision for workers’ democracy and the organisation of production based on workers’ self-management. Several proposals were put forth, which were deemed acceptable by representatives of the Workers’ Opposition.\nAt first, it was proposed to commence the work of the party by issuing a call to the proletariat, inviting them to join en masse in the ranks of the party, thereby addressing the issue. Another point of view is to curtail the authority of the Glavki within the VSNKh, fostering a more decentralized approach to national economic planning. This entails rejecting top-down directives in production processes and bolstering the influence of workers in organizing production activities."
russoc.402.a: "Announce the call to the workers!"
russoc.402.b: "Begin the campaign against Glavkism!"

russoc.403.t: "The Decline of the Workers' Opposition"
russoc.403.d: "The trade unions once symbolized workers’ self-governance and the triumph of the Revolution, but they have long since been reduced to mere instruments of the party’s and state’s will, stripped of their autonomy and no longer truly dedicated to protecting workers’ rights. Those who once sought to speak out against this reality grew increasingly silent, their voices fading until they were completely silenced.\n\nAleksandra Kollontai, a prominent figure in the opposition, was dispatched to one of the Third Internationale countries as the permanent representative of [ROOT.GetNameDef], while Aleksander Shlyapnikov, after a brief stint at the RTsSPS, retired from politics altogether due to a debilitating illness. The Workers’ Opposition had grown quiet, and a new epoch had dawned, one that the workers did not seem to mind."
russoc.403.a: "After all, the workers decided to speak for themselves."

russoc.404.t: "The New Milestone"
russoc.404.d: "Nikolay Bukharin stepped away from active political engagement, fully endorsing the new "General Line". His voice no longer resonates in governmental circles or Soviets, yet it continues to reverberate in loyal publications, and peasants still recall the figure who sought to "enrich" them.\n\nNevertheless, Bukharin’s approach - the path towards gradual socialism - proved to be transient and ineffective. Bukharin himself, despite urging the Party to remember the importance of the Village and Smychka, acknowledged that the period he and his advisors had envisioned as a transitory phase was irrevocably over.\n\nWith these confessions, a bitter truth becomes apparent for those supporters of Bukharin who still advocate for the New Economic Policy. Having lost the symbolic patronage by Bukharin and realizing that the party was moving forward, they began to gradually shift from opposition to working for the betterment of the people. Their innovative ideas will serve as the driving force for the progress of our working-class and peasant nation."
russoc.404.a: "Everything in this world is transitory."

russoc.405.t: "Pace of the Collectivization"
russoc.405.d: "One of the issues of significant concern to the Opposition is the perceived dominance of the kulaks in rural areas, a problem which the New Economic Policyhas proven incapable of resolving, not only in the short term but also over a period of several months.\n\nThe present situation is disheartening - despite the party's vigorous call for cooperation and voluntary collectivization, there are still independent farms that refuse to join any form of collective enterprise. The most radical elements advocate for a de facto imposition of forced collectivization through state farms, which may ultimately lead to the success of collective agriculture, but will undoubtedly turn the majority of the peasantry against us. However, there are also more moderate voices calling for the active implementation of measures aimed at facilitating the transition of peasants towards collective farming."
russoc.405.a: "Introduce collectivization quotas in some regions."

The congress turned into a bazaar, and everyone pulled the blanket over themselves, as a result, it almost came to a fight. Disappointed, the delegates left the congress fully convinced that the unity of the party was now unattainable."

On the second day of proceedings, Nikolay Bukharin, flanked by his allies, addressed the delegates with a keynote speech titled \"On the Factionalism Ban\".\n\nWith fervor Bukharin denounced "democratism fetish", that, he claimed, had infected the Party under the guise of platformism and pluralism of opinions. Declaring that the Revolution must now enter its next phase, he warned that \"to preserve the hegemony of the Leninism and smychka\", the Party must hold to the General Line in all cases. The term General Line, a new invention of the Bukharin's ideological vocabulary will be now instituted in party schools and education of all levels.\n\nDespite scattered private murmurings, no open opposition was voiced on the floor."

russoc.2000.t: "People's Socialist Party - Guides"
russoc.2000.d: "Welcome to the Politburo of the People's Socialist Party, which previously won a majority at the Congress of Soviets. Considering itself the successor of the Russian Communist Party, this party of amnestied Moscow Bolsheviks under the leadership of Nikolay Bukharin largely copies the structure of the RKP. So, what are the options for the future of this party?\n\nThe key event that will bring certain leaders to power is the crisis of the New Economic Policy, which will arise a few months after the start of these reforms.\n\n1. In order for Nikolay Bukharin to remain at the head of the party and in power, anti-crisis measures must be successfully implemented, but with one condition - the influence of the Market must be greater than the Gosplan.\n\n2. Bukharin's successors: Kosygin and Ryutin. If anti-crisis measures are successfully implemented, but the influence of the Gosplan is greater than that of the Market, Bukharin will be dismissed, and a power struggle will begin in his faction. As a result, Aleksey Kosygin or Martemyan Ryutin will be able to come to power. An alternative option is Aleksey Rykov, if he is still alive by this time.\n\n3. Rykov and Zhdanov. Aleksey Rykov may come to power if anti-crisis measures fail and the NEP is decided to collapse. His Rykovite faction should have more influence than the others. Rykov's successor, Andrey Zhdanov, will come to power after his death, but only if Rykov is the country's leader.\n\n4. Kamenev, Sokolnikov and Kirov. The \"Old Bolsheviks\" is an opposition group that will arise after the failure of the NEP. Take the focus \"Old Moscow Familiars\" to choose Kamenev, or \"Confide in Kamenev\" to choose Sokolnikov as leader after the end of NEP.\n\n5. The Workers' Opposition. If you complete focus \"Entrust VSNKh to Shlyapnikov\", then Mikhail Tomsky will lead the Workers' Opposition, and if complete focus \"Control the Unions\", then Shlyapnikov and Kollontai will lead the Workers' Opposition. If the decision to \"Conquer Petrograd\" is taken, then national-syndicalist Kuznetsov will join the Workers' Opposition, and can be elected after the victory of Shlyapnikov and the formation of the Trade Union Socialist Party. Gastev from the Proletkult will also be a possible leader, if he was previously appointed as Narkompros."

russoc.2001.t: "The New Bolshevik Chairman"
russoc.2001.d: "After weeks of muted maneuvering and deepening splits within the upper circles of the Soviet state, Grigory Zinoviev, long the theatrical master of the revolutionary stage, has resigned - or, as some suggest, has been quietly pushed aside. The final blow came not with riots in the streets but with procedural votes and discreet signatures from the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the highest Party organs. Replacing Zinoviev is Vyacheslav Molotov, a man seldom seen on podiums but well known behind the desks and corridors of the Party Secretariat. Often described as the Bolsheviks’ consummate bureaucrat, Molotov inherits a government bruised by factional infighting yet held together by habit and the unyielding structures he himself helped forge. Whether his tenure brings stability or merely a different brand of control remains to be seen. For now, the world watches as Russia’s revolution settles with the methodical scratch of a bureaucrat’s pen."

russoc.2002.d: "In what foreign observers describe as a sudden but bloodless consolidation of power, Lazar Kaganovich - long regarded as one of the Bolsheviks’ most unyielding industrial commanders - has emerged as the new Chairman of the Russia's Council of Labor and Defense. The official communiqué from Moscow confirms the unexpected passing of Vyacheslav Molotov under ‘unclear medical circumstances’ at his dacha. Within hours of Molotov’s death, Kaganovich secured the support of key Party bodies and internal security forces. Several senior figures deemed unreliable have reportedly been removed from their posts under charges of ‘sabotage’ and ‘counter-revolutionary intrigue.’ Kaganovich, sometimes dubbed ‘Iron Lazar’ for his uncompromising style, is likely to push further centralization of the Soviet apparatus."

Reports confirm that after the sudden death of Vyacheslav Molotov, his right-hand Lazar Kaganovich was shortly appointed as his successor, but with Yagoda claiming the succession illegal, 'Iron Lazar' has been removed from public view, his supporters purged or detained by security forces. In a broadcast, the Party has declared the appointment of Georgy Malenkov as the new Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars, though diplomats note Malenkov’s lack of real authority, describing him as ‘a functionary at the mercy of the Chekist hand.’"

Briefly after, the previously sidelined Zinovievite faction has returned to prominence under the watchful eye of the internal security organs. Following weeks of opaque maneuvering, the All-Russian Congress of Soviets convened to confirm a slate of new appointments aligned with the legacy of revolutionary internationalism once championed by Grigory Zinoviev.

Briefly after, Vladimir Mayakovsky, former head of the nation's GKVD - main directorate of both security and enlightenment, creature of Molotov's bureaucratic regime, has been formally appointed Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars. Mayakovsky, renowned both as a poet and a committed Bolshevik intellectual, assumes a dual role as both a symbolic ideological figurehead and an active participant in governance. His leadership is expected to emphasize the fusion of cultural and political administration, reflecting the ongoing centralization and ideological consolidation of the state apparatus."

russoc.500.d.integration_level_1: "After we voluntarily agreed to join forces in the revolutionary struggle against Russia, it could be considered that confidence in our government was assured. Nevertheless, at the recent convention [FROM.GetLeader] insisted that further supervision of our internal affairs was necessary for the continued success of the revolution.\n\nFor now, this means only a slight increase in the number of ministers from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but things will subtly but tangibly change as they are adopted. The broad autonomy we've enjoyed so far will begin to wane, and many will start to turn away from [ROOT.GetLeader] and look to [FROM.GetLeader] for leadership. Perhaps it's time to break free and save our independence."
russoc.500.d.integration_level_2: "We have long enjoyed autonomy in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], away from the prying eyes of the central government. This has improved governance in many ways, yet that seems to be changing.\n\nThe ruling party [FROM.GetRulingParty], operating out of [FROM.GetNameDef], is pushing for greater control over our largely autonomous government. They insist on control over several key internal functions that we thought would be left alone when we originally agreed to join [FROM.GetFactionName]. Of course, refusal will have dire consequences, but we are fast approaching a tipping point where it will be difficult to break free from [FROM.GetRulingParty]'s reign."
russoc.500.d.integration_final: "This was long expected, but there was still some shock in [ROOT.GetLeader]'s entourage when [FROM.GetNameDef] made his move today. At an emergency congress of the Soviets, [FROM.GetLeader] spoke about [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s future and assured that the central government would take the necessary steps to make his rule conform to [FROM.GetRulingParty]'s ideals. Worst of all, the congress decreed the transformation of our own party into a regional branch of [FROM.GetRulingParty].\n\nAt this point, we have no other choice: either we go down in history as good soldiers of the [FROM.GetRulingParty], or [ROOT.GetLeader] will make one last desperate move for independence.

russoc.501.d.integration_final: "Our homeland, outwardly looking the same as before, has undergone significant political, social and economic changes since the centralization of our country. Ministers are now appointed directly by the central government at [Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Our economy has undergone profound changes as the once useful national monetary system collapsed after the adoption of the Russian currency.

In exchange for deploying the Red Army on our territory and rewriting our laws in accordance with the [FROM.GetAdjective] constitution, [FROM.GetAdjective] government guarantees us significant autonomy and near-complete non-intervention in our internal affairs.\n\nHowever, as is often the case, we should divide all promises by 100 when dealing with the Russians.

russoc.511.t: "A Congress Under Watchful Eyes"
russoc.511.d: "Though long exiled from the land of his birth, Józef Unszlicht has never abandoned his political mission. Once a comrade of Dzierżyński, a founder of the Cheka, and now an influential figure within the [RUS.GetLeader]'s [RUS.GetName], Unszlicht has increasingly asserted himself as the voice of "true Communism" for the Polish nation. Backed by the Mniejszościowcy faction and the apparatus of Zinovievite Russia, Unszlicht has formally requested the Polish government permit the convocation of a full Party Congress - one that would "settle" leadership disputes and "restore revolutionary unity".\n\nWarski and the KPP majority rightly perceive this as a grave intrusion. While Unszlicht is technically a Polish citizen and a member of the broader Party, he has not lived or fought alongside the current leadership. His proposal threatens to undermine the delicate internal balance - and potentially reorient the Polish Party toward the orbit of [RUS.Capital.GetName].\n\nAs tensions rise, calls emerge for [POL.GetLeader] to either assert Poland's political independence - or risk civil rupture and diplomatic isolation."
russoc.511.d2: "From within the walls of [RUS.Capital.GetName]'s inner circle, Comrade Unszlicht has long maneuvered to reclaim influence over the Party he helped found. Now, as fraternal tides shift and Zinovievite voices rise, he has submitted a formal appeal: the Party must hold a Congress in Warsaw to "renew" the Central Committee, with participation from exiled factions.\n\nWhile Leszczyński leads the Mniejszościowcy and shares ideological roots with Unszlicht, the latter's demand raises uncomfortable questions. Would the Congress merely affirm existing leadership - or stage a takeover directed from [RUS.Capital.GetName]? Would the presence of exiled "delegates" be symbolic - or decisive?\n\nWith [INT.GetNameDef] watching closely and the KPP(w) crying foul, Leszczyński must weigh the promise of ideological consolidation against the specter of external control."
russoc.511.d3: "The revolution may belong to the youth, but even the most ardent KZMP idealists cannot ignore the rumblings from Moscow. Józef Unszlicht, seasoned Bolshevik and founder of the Soviet Cheka, has issued a direct call for the Polish Party to convene a Congress - one that includes exiles, factions, and "overlooked cadres" aligned with his wing of the Mniejszościowcy.\n\nThe move is seen by many as a prelude to intervention, and perhaps subordination. Unszlicht's ties to Zinovievite Russia are no secret, and many worry that the Congress would serve as a political ambush.\n\nThough Lampe remains above the factional feuds that consumed the old KPP, he now stands at a crossroads: yield space to Moscow's men and risk party unity - or reject the appeal and risk escalation."

russoc.512.d: "Under quiet pressure from [RUS.Capital.GetName], the Congress of the Communist Party of Poland was convened in Warsaw for the first time since [ROOT.GetLeader] has led the nation. Józef Unszlicht - veteran revolutionary, co-founder of the Russian Cheka - arrived in Warsaw with a delegation of loyalists in tow. Though their credentials were formally approved, few mistook the gesture for anything other than a challenge to the current Party leadership.\n\nTo some, Unszlicht brought a chance to align more closely with [RUS.Capital.GetName]'s internationalist line. To others, he represented the creeping hand of foreign domination, a Trojan horse through which the independence of socialist Poland might be dissolved.\n\nAs the Congress moved into its decisive phase - the vote to re-elect the Central Committee - the time to choose sides had come."

This blatant disrespect for the proletarian will will not be forgiven by them. Iosif Unshlikht has already announced the horrific "degeneration of the Communist movement in Poland", and in this regard announced that an alternative congress of the Communist Party of Poland will be held in Moscow - albeit without the participation of the so-called "silent majority" of the party. Most likely, at this upcoming congress, the party will change its name in order not to be associated with traitors to the workers of Poland - and [POL.GetLeader]'s traitors will be excluded from its membership."

By a majority vote, the Congress expressed confidence in Iosif Unshlikht, who became chairman of the Soviet government of Poland. With his very first decree, he proclaimed that Poland was truly joining the international communist movement - first of all, establishing close ties with the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] and beginning the process of joining the federation with [RUS.GetNameDef]."

russoc.515.t: "KPP Approves [POL.GetLeader]'s Leadership"
russoc.515.d: "Despite the efforts of our comrades, the thoroughly rotten Communist Party of Poland has approved the current composition of the so-called Polish Government by a majority vote. [POL.GetLeader] will remain chairman, and the delegation of Iosif Unshlikht was in the minority, having quarreled, among other things, with the leader of the Bolshevik faction of the KPP, Leszczyński. Despite the temporary victory of the revision, Unshlikht is not going to stand aside when the fate of the entire Polish proletariat is in question."

russoc.516.d: "[POL.GetNameDefCap], a proud offspring of revolutionary victory in Eastern Europe, now finds itself in crisis - and the eyes of the world turn to [INT.GetNameDef]. The issue lies with the increasingly aggressive involvement of Iosif Unshlikht and his Russian-based exile faction, supported by sectors of [RUS.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nClaiming legitimacy as faithful partisans of the international communist cause, Unshlikht and his allies have pressured the ruling KPP in Warsaw to convene a party congress that could place them - and by extension, [RUS.Capital.GetName] - at the helm of Poland's government.\n\nBut Warsaw has not submitted. Instead, they have appealed to us and [ROOT.GetFactionName] to mediate the dispute.\n\nThe matter is delicate. Supporting Polish independence defends revolutionary sovereignty but risks provoking [RUS.Capital.GetName] and opening a rift in the Internationale.

The answer from our comrades from the Internationale, after some thought, came down to the fact that the Polish Revolution is inviolable and the Polish people have already spoken out. In this regard, [INT.GetName] has asked us to refrain from any interference in the internal affairs of [POL.GetNameDef].\n\nThe Narkomindel remained divided and asked to convene a Plenum of the Central Committee to decide on further actions. And although Chairman Zinoviev is unhappy with the circumstances, perhaps we should turn a blind eye to our differences with the Polish government for the sake of the communist future of the whole world."

russoc.534.t: "Socialist Revolution!"
russoc.534.d: "Our counterintelligence agency has long harbored suspicions that a group of radical socialists was receiving funding from foreign sources with the aim of orchestrating a coup within our nation, yet despite extensive efforts, the underground network has consistently evaded detection and arrest. Despite the occasional discovery of clandestine arms caches, the police have thus far been unable to identify the masterminds behind this operation.\n\nIn the past week, widespread labor strikes have engulfed the country, leading to an armed insurrection in Sofia this morning, sparked by random gunfire at a peaceful protest. The rebellious workers and their allies have seized control of the post office, telegraph facility, and administrative buildings. An armed contingent of soldiers has partially sided with the rebels, taking over the police headquarters and prison.\n\nAs [ROOT.GetLeader] was hurriedly evacuated from the capital, an insurrection spread across the nation, with radicals also seizing control in major urban centres. The government of [ROOT.GetRulingParty] was toppled, and a new socialist administration has already proclaimed itself to be both popular and legitimate."
russoc.534.a: "Long live workers' and peasants' Bulgaria!"

russoc.535.t: "Failure of the Revolution in Bulgaria"
russoc.535.d: "Today we have received information that the Revolution in Bulgaria, which had been preparing for several months, collapsed due to the disclosure of the conspiracy."
russoc.535.a: "A great sorrow for the people of Bulgaria."

russoc.536.t: "The Future of the Liberated Lands"
russoc.536.d: "The restoration of stability across the liberated and occupied territories of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and beyond has led to a pressing question that no longer can be deferred: what shall be the political and institutional character of the state that now spans these lands? For nearly two decades, many of these regions functioned as sovereign or semi-sovereign quasi-states - some aligned with the Reichspakt, others pursuing their own path under difficult conditions. While their integration into the orbit of the Russian state is now a reality, the nature of that integration must be determined.\n\nAt a special convocation of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, senior leadership, party delegates, and economic planners now convene to establish the guiding framework of the Union. The decisions taken here will shape the constitutional order, center-periphery relations, and administrative identities of millions."
russoc.536.a: "One and indivisible Soviet republic."
russoc.536.b: "Give freedom for national cultures, under Soviet power."
russoc.536.c: "Prefer the economic principle of division."
russoc.536.e: "A Union of Republics."

russoc.537.t: "The Proclamation of the Union of Republics"
russoc.537.d: "After extensive deliberation, the All-Russian Congress of Soviets has ratified the legal basis for the creation of a new political structure - a Union of Republics. This structure, while rooted in the sovereign authority of [ROOT.GetNameDef], is designed to respond to the new geopolitical realities brought by the recent expansion and the growing need for organized integration. The form of the Union reflects the political consensus established in recent months: it is founded on a federative basis, composed of formally equal Soviet republics. While central planning remains unified, member republics retain nominal political and administrative autonomy.\n\nThe newly integrated regions have responded unevenly. In Ukraine, underground nationalist forces reject the Union’s authority, and scattered partisan activity has been reported. In Latvia, socialist committees have welcomed the Union, publicly declaring solidarity and voluntarily requesting entry. In Transcaucasia, cooperation is partial and tentative - Armenian and Georgian republicans are split, while Azerbaijan’s oil unions support unification. In Central Asia, resistance has largely subsided following economic agreements, though nationalist groups remain underground. The proclamation marks a formal transition from a sovereign Russian republic to a broader multi-national state, structured according to the principles of socialist governance and unity."
russoc.537.a: "Long live [ROOT.GetNameDef]!"

russoc.538.t: "The Constitution of [RUS.GetNameDef]"
russoc.538.d: "The All-[RUS.GetAdjective] Congress of Soviets, held today in [RUS.Capital.GetName] has ratified the foundational legal charter of the new state: the Constitution of [RUS.GetNameDef]. Built upon the federal model, the document defines the new Union as a sovereign socialist federation, composed of voluntarily associated republics, each granted equal political rights under the unified framework of state socialism. The Constitution is structured around the principle that sovereignty belongs jointly to the peoples of the Union and the institutions of socialist authority.\n\nThe supreme legislative power is vested in the All-Union Congress of Soviets, composed of proportional delegates from each republic. Between sessions, the executive coordination is exercised by the Central Executive Commitee and its Presidium. The governments of each republic retain formal control over education, local administration, and cultural matters, but are constitutionally bound to adhere to central economic directives, defense priorities, and national labor norms. While each republic may use its native language in local administration, the Constitution designates Russian as the official language of inter-republic governance, military command, and central economy. The judiciary is unified under the Union's Supreme Court, with republican branches subordinated to its authority in matters of constitutional law and state integrity.\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution, existing borders between republics are now internal administrative demarcations. The term “republic” is retained for continuity, but legal authority flows from the federal level."
russoc.538.a: "We are building a long-standing union of brotherly peoples."

russoc.539.t: "The Party and the Union"
russoc.539.d: "Following the formal adoption of the Constitution of [ROOT.GetNameDef], the question of party organization has moved to the top of the agenda. The [ROOT.GetRulingParty], as the legal and organizational backbone of the Russian Republic, now finds itself responsible for administering a supranational polity whose constituent republics, however integrated, retain distinct political and cultural profiles. At a closed session of the Party Congress, delegates presented a range of proposals regarding the future of party governance across the Union. While the Soviet model remains unitary in its ideological foundations, there is no unified consensus on the administrative party form that should now prevail.\n\nThe options range from full extension of the Russian party's mandate across the Union, to the creation of a new All-Union Party structure. Others have suggested that while the Russian Party should retain its republican scope, party influence over the Union-wide institutions should be reduced in favor of elected Soviets composed of delegates from all republics."
russoc.539.a: "Let the Russian [ROOT.GetRulingParty] become the All-Union party."
russoc.539.b: "Retain the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] within Russia only."

russoc.540.t: "The Fate of Internationalism’s Forgotten Son"
russoc.540.d: "Lev Trotsky’s firstborn son Lev Sedov, born to his second wife Natalia Sedova in 1906, came into existence when his father was still rotting in a Russian prison for his role in the failed Revolution of 1905. Growing into a competent leader of labor and men in his own rite by the time he reached his late teens, Sedov would follow in the footsteps of his parents while maintaining distance from them to not seem privileged or nepotistic, even following them into exile after the Bolshevik Revolution finally faltered in the face of the overwhelming White forces. Since then, and the following death of his father Trotsky who was lost at sea after the ship he was using to flee Eurasia and the failed revolution sank in the mid-Pacific, Sedov has bounced around from one workers movement to the next across the New World and the Old before finally settling in the Last Frontier far to the north of where his father once planned to live out his exile.\n\nFrom his newfound home in Alaska, Sedov has worked with the tiny local Socialist movement while still professing the internationalist ideas learned from his dead dad, but he and his new revolutionary movement have not yet been able to manage any real political successes, really only finding some support in isolated townships and settlements staffed by fishermen, loggers, and other union workers chaffing under Alaska’s baronocracy and idiotic local governments. However, with the advent of our own internationalist movement and with our recent annexation of the Last Frontier, perhaps this forgotten son of one of our ideological forefathers might be of use to us, either as an example to be made or as an example to follow. So, what shall be the final fate of Lev Sedov and the Trotskyist line?"

However, with the advent of our own internationalist movement, the heir apparent of Trotskyist Internationalism will have to be dealt with, one way or another.

### Bolshevik events ###

bolsheviks.6.t: "Mayakovsky Returns From Italy"
bolsheviks.6.d: "The futurist poet, known throughout Europe, Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky returned from Italy, where he conducted the propaganda policy of the Proletkult. Although he is not a member of the party, he was invited to join the Congress of Soviets, where the supreme leadership of the RKP sits. Joining his colleagues, Lunacharsky and Gastev, Mayakovsky is ready to work for the benefit of the Motherland, inspiring the working class of Russia to labor feats, and... submission."
bolsheviks.6.a: "He's back."

bolsheviks.48.t: "Dissatisfaction With the Collectivization"
bolsheviks.48.d: "To our surprise, many peasants were dissatisfied with the collectivization. They were dissatisfied with the socialization of the land, the good that socialism brought them. They are in revolt, demanding the return of their crops, their livestock, and, worst of all, their property. This month, about 3,000 peasant riots have already been suppressed, and a terrible famine has broken out in some regions. The peasants flee to the cities and become workers, because they think that the life of the worker is much better. They are right only in one thing - it is a state for workers, built by workers. While they are rioting, we have achieved results that Kerensky could only dream of. We must bear this burden of collectivization until the end of time, for all power comes from the people, and we are their representatives."
bolsheviks.48.a: "They will obey."

### Prolekult Events ###
proletkult.2.t: "The Issue of Illiteracy"
proletkult.2.d: "The absence of Proletkult in republican Russia has led to the fact that most of the population of our country cannot be called literate. Even so, they are not literate from the point of view of proletarian culture. Various capitalist, bourgeois and philistine views have enslaved the consciousness of these people, which means that measures must be taken to proletarize their culture.\n\nThe new program within the framework of the Proletkult was called "Likbez" or the elimination of illiteracy. Active literacy training will begin, and the literate will be obliged to teach the illiterate through labor service. Illiterate students will be taught: to read clear printed and written fonts; to make brief notes necessary in life and official affairs; to read and write down whole and fractional numbers, percentages, to understand diagrams; the students will be explained the main issues of the construction of the Soviet state."
proletkult.2.a: "To be illiterate equals to be blind!"

proletkult.3.t: "Proletarian Ethics"
proletkult.3.d: "The so-called proletarian ethic is a necessary condition for the development of proletarian culture. Instilling a proletarian ethic will not be easy, but it is important - with the help of a powerful propaganda campaign of our ideas, we will achieve unprecedented success. Our proletkult program will be very powerful, such as the world has never seen before."
proletkult.3.a: "Long live the Cultural Revolution!"

proletkult.4.t: "Social-Futurism"
proletkult.4.d: "Mayakovsky proposed to introduce his own ideas into the Proletkult - what he calls Social-Futurism. He proposes to create a society of educated and talented people. Everyone should master any art - the one that he or she will like. Training in painting, and especially in modern styles, architecture, and music, will be necessary and mandatory for everyone, both adults and children. The creation of the Soviet intelligentsia is the ultimate goal of the Mayakovsky plan. And he sincerely does not understand and is not going to recognize the right of people to choose if they should do arts or not. 'Art is not a hindrance to work' - as Mayakovsky correctly put it\nThe only question is whether the People's Commissariat of Education will support such an initiative."
proletkult.4.a: "Full support for Social-Futurism"
proletkult.4.b: "That's somewhat... insane."

proletkult.5.t: "Soviet-Syndicalist System"
proletkult.5.d: "Aleksei Gastev, a scientist and proletarian who worked in Europe for many years, argues that the People's Commissariat of Education is obliged to put the issue of trade unions on the agenda. According to Gastev, Russia needs to combine the Soviet and syndicalist system of government. All economic power should belong to trade unions and autonomous collectives (syndicates) of workers, and all political power should belong to Soviets elected at all levels.\n\nGastev's ideas have surprised some people's commissars, but many recognize the success and viability of the syndicalist system of government. Perhaps in symbiosis with the Soviets, the system will work even better."
proletkult.5.a: "Full support for Soviet Syndicalism"
proletkult.5.b: "You can't combine incongruity"

proletkult.6.t: "Proletarian Religion"
proletkult.6.d: "Lunacharsky, being a respected man, suggested that the People's Commissariat of Education return to his early ideas: the creation of a proletarian religion. Of course, many people are skeptical: after all, Marxism is equal to atheism. However, Lunacharsky insists on his own, as the head of the People's Commissariat of Education, he has the right to do so. Unless, of course, the ideas of Mayakovsky or Gastev are more preferred by the People's Commissars."
proletkult.6.a: "Full support for Proletarian religion!"
proletkult.6.b: "The idea is insane, Lunacharsky should forget about it!"

proletkult.8.t: "Chairman Mayakovsky"
proletkult.8.d: "Mayakovsky has found himself at the very top: he's now the Vozhd of the Proletariat and Chairman of the Sovnarkom. Though he's not a member of the RKP, he decided to change the name of the party and become its new leader. In his first decree, the Communist party was renamed into Proletarian Party of Futurists and its main ideology was stated as Social-Futurism - a minor branch of Marxism. Though some did not like the changes, blaming Mayakovsky in revisionism - they were quickly silented by exclusion from the party. With PPF standing triumphant, Mayakovsky is standing firmly as the Leader of the Avant-Garde."
proletkult.8.a: "It's time to implement our policies!"

proletkult.9.t: "Social-Futurism"
proletkult.9.d: "For many members of the already modified party, it is not entirely clear what social-futurism is. Despite the fact that Mayakovsky made many speeches about the new ideology of the proletarian state, not everyone clearly represents the implementation of his projects in practice.\n\nIn fact, everything is much simpler than it seems. The main idea of social futurism is to create a society of talented and educated people, where everyone has mastered some art and is ready to work for the benefit of the Motherland and world socialism. Perhaps Mayakovsky's ideas are in many ways utopian and unrealizable - but with what optimism the people's poet strives for this goal!"
proletkult.9.a: "Long Live Social-Futurism!"

proletkult.10.t: "Modern Art Exhibitions"
proletkult.10.d: "Wonderful leisure and entertainment in the proletarian republic are available to everyone!\n\n\nBy a new decree of the Chairman of the Federal Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vladimir Mayakovsky, all exhibitions of contemporary art featuring works by world-famous artists will be free for everyone forever.\n\nContemporary art, including its new forms such as suprematism and Cubism, is the voice of the proletarian, a challenge to capitalism and exploitation. Admiring contemporary art is not a right or a desire, it is the duty of every law-abiding citizen who believes in socialism and hates the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe exhibitions will feature works by Kazemir Malevich, one of the leading figures of futurism and chairman of the Art Board of the Art Department of the People's Commissariat of Education, Marc Chagall , one of the leading avant-garde artists, as well as some works by Picasso brought from chaos-ridden Spain."
proletkult.10.a: "Awesome!"

proletkult.11.t: "Free Master Classes"
proletkult.11.d: "Free clubs and master classes will be organized throughout the country, in which young and adult citizens of the proletarian republic will be taught the relationship of chromatic tones, contrasts and nuances of light and dark, black and white gradations, graphic means of line and silhouette, and the texture of the paint layer.\n\nIn addition to painting, young avant-gardists will be given lessons in dance and music, including modern futuristic genres. Music clubs will study the theory of music and sound, harmony, musical notation and musical forms. At the dance lessons, you will be able to learn harmonic movements and poses, plastic and facial expressions, tempo and rhythm, as well as master modern and popular genres.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to literary circles: in Moscow and Petrograd, master classes will be given by Velimir Khlebnikov, Anna Akhmatova, Marina Tsvetaeva, Boris Pasternak and Daniil Kharms. There are rumors that even the master of verse, the thunderstorm of all capitalists and the genius of the poetic word, will perform at the literary master class in the capital: Vladimir Mayakovsky himself."
proletkult.11.a: "Proletkult is great!"

proletkult.12.t: "Theater and Cinema"
proletkult.12.d: "in all cities of Russia in the largest theaters will be free performances with the latest productions of Vsevolod Meyrehold, based on the plays of Mayakovsky. In the same cities where there is no theater yet, it was decided to immediately build and open to the public the so-called people's theaters.\n\nCinema is also rapidly developing. Thanks to the achievements of socialism, this year viewers across the country will be able to see Sergei Eisenstein's film "Alexander Nevsky"for free. In it, the Old Russian prince confronts the imperialist invaders of the Teutonic Order, who are referred to in the film as the Germans. Surprisingly, the main antagonist, the leader of the Teutonic Knights, was named Wilhelm. Is this a reference to the German Kaiser, or is it just a satire on inhumane capitalism? In any case, the film tells about the victory of the Russian people-ordinary peasants and workers, led by the Vozhd, who composes his words in beautiful verses."
proletkult.12.a: "Masterpiece!"

proletkult.13.t: "Obligatory Creative Education"
proletkult.13.d: "The resolution of the Council of People's Commissars, signed personally by Vladimir Mayakovsky, reads as follows:\n\nEvery citizen of the Proletarian Republic is obliged from an early age to learn any kind of art: painting, music, dance, acting, or literature. Attendance at children's clubs is mandatory and will be supervised by teachers and school principals. For adults, separate clubs will be organized, which they will be required to attend every week on weekends.\n\nThanks to the organized free exhibitions within the framework of the Proletkult, which contributed to the popularization of art among most of the citizens of the proletarian republic. Even though some of them are dissatisfied with this decision, the Council of People's Commissars knows better, doesn't it?"
proletkult.13.a: "We'll build a nation of the talanted!"

proletkult.14.t: "With Hammer and Sickle"
proletkult.14.d: "The new 'Soviet identity' must be forged with a hammer and sickle. The rich culture and history of all the peoples inhabiting the Proletarian Republic should undoubtedly be perpetuated in memory. But as for the present and the future, the Proletkult takes over.\n\nThe new Soviet identity is not just a brand in the passport of citizenship. This is a new Soviet culture, a new nationality and a new language.\n\nMeasures to internationalize the Russian language and the languages of national minorities, that is, to translate them into the Latin alphabet, are not enough. What is needed is a more radical reform of the language and its slow transformation into a new one: free from the yoke of capitalism, not imposed from outside. The new Proletarian language will be based on the Latin alphabet and use Latin roots to bring our peoples closer to the peoples of the socialist countries of France, Italy and England.\n\nSo far, the measures taken by the government are not enough, but soon, perhaps even in this decade, the schools of the Proletarian Republic will learn the grammar of the PROLYAZ - the Proletarian language."
proletkult.14.a: "New times need new methods."

proletkult.15.t: "Emergence of Soviet Intelligentsia"
proletkult.15.d: "Quite expected was the emergence of the Soviet intelligentsia - the most educated and honored workers of the Proletarian Republic-academicians, professors, scientists, inventors, artists and musicians.\n\nThe so-called party nomenclature was replenished with the ranks of new, successful citizens, ready for work and defense.\nIn other socialist countries, such inequality is unacceptable, but here is the whole point: in our republic, there will be no inequality of the intelligentsia and the common people. In our republic, there will be no ordinary people at all. The ultimate goal of our beautiful socialist society is to build it. Classless, without division into rich and poor, educated and uneducated, talented and untrained. Yes, they say that talent is an exceptional thing. But will you say it to Mayakovsky's face? Of course not."
proletkult.15.a: "Every man an Intelligentsia!"

proletkult.16.t: "Repressions Against Philistines"
proletkult.16.d: "Many did not take seriously the demands of the Council of People's Commissars and Chairman Mayakovsky on compulsory creative education. Moreover, even if they did, it wasn't serious. They did not put enough effort into mastering the art. This is what causes the inequality and higher position of the intelligentsia. Do you think they deserve it? Perhaps. But this is unacceptable for a socialist state that bears the proud name of a Proletarian Republic!\n\nFrom now on, and forever, the avoidance of creative activity will be prosecuted with all severity. Citizens who have given up creative activity will work for the benefit of the motherland in labor camps: build new river channels, build hydroelectric power stations, plant forest belts. They will not be useless as before. If they dare to criticize the government's decisions, their fate will be more severe. They will be shot for treason, for their pettiness, commercialism, laziness and lack of talent.\n\nRemember, citizens! The party does not forgive you for your laziness. Labor has made a man out of an ape, and creativity has made a superman out of a man. The party will never forgive you for this."
proletkult.16.a: "If you don't respect our rules - why should we respect yours?"

proletkult.17.t: "Great Construction Projects of Communism"
proletkult.17.d: "Man must be a friend and a brother to nature. But before we can move on to such a relationship, we must tame and conquer nature. Nature will serve us as a good friend if we learn to use its rich land resources, to irrigate it with rivers and lakes, generously provided to us.\n\nThe Great Construction Projects of Communism - that's what the Council of People's Commissars called the projects that we will soon have to make. The main and key ones are undoubtedly the connection of the Baltic and White Sea through the White Sea-Baltic Canal, the connection of Moscow and the Volga through the Mayakovsky Canal, the connection of the Don and Volga through the Volgodonsk Canal, as well as the turn of the Siberian Rivers to irrigate the barren and arid lands of Central Asia. The construction of hydroelectric power stations on many rivers will give us a lot of energy, which we use for the benefit of the people."
proletkult.17.a: "A great idea!"

proletkult.18.t: "Mayakovsky - The Leader Of The International Avant-Garde!"
proletkult.18.d: "Today, our leader, the great poet, the head of the futurist party, the genius of the word and the maestro of poetry, Vladimir Mayakovsky, had the courage to put forward his legitimate rights to the role of the leader of the international avant-garde.\n\n'Futurists of all countries, unite! Proletarians of all countries, unite! Artists, musicians, avant-gardists! This world belongs to us, simple workers, and not to tsars, emperors or the litter of the bourgeoisie! Down with the shackles! Long live the International!'"
proletkult.18.a: "And long live Mayakovsky!"

proletkult.19.t: "Setting Up the Ustanovka"
proletkult.19.d: "With the election of Comrade Gastev as chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he issued a decree on the immediate transition to his program 'Ustanovka'.\n\nAs part of the program, Syndicates will be created throughout the country - systematic associations of workers, industrial sectors and organizations. The RTsSPS, was given executive power in the fields of economy, finance, industry and trade. With the decree adopted, the VSNKh was abolished.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the reform is to create a Soviet-syndicalist system of government, in which all political power belongs to the Soviets, and all economic power belongs to the trade unions and syndicates. In order to avoid a conflict of interest, Gastev was also appointed the new chairman of the RTsSPS. He will oversee both the political and economic decisions of the branches of government."
proletkult.19.a: "A great reform!"

proletkult.20.t: "Management of Labor"
proletkult.20.d: "The Russian worker is no different from the European or American worker. Why, then, are production efficiency and labor productivity higher in their countries? It's all about standardizing production. In our country, we will create a standardization of labor.\n\nThe Russian worker does not know fatigue or sleep. He works all day for the success of his country. At least, that's what they say, but it's not true, because the Russian worker was a real slave. He used to work for the success and wealth of a capitalist. Now everything will change. Everyone gets tired. With a clearly distributed time, the worker will not get tired, and observing safety precautions, and most importantly-knowing how to work correctly, his productivity will increase significantly."
proletkult.20.a: "And so will increase country's productivity"

proletkult.21.t: "A State Without Nation"
proletkult.21.d: "Many believe that it is impossible to change the mentality of an entire nation. However, what if there is no longer any nation? In our international state, there is only a worker. The worker has no nation, he has only labor. Work that makes him well-fed and contented, and his state-strong and powerful. We are going to change the foundations of society. Down with the church! Down with the kulaks! Down with the bourgeois elements! It is necessary to take measures for the urgent collectivization of the village, the destruction of the kulaks and the promotion of the idea of proletarianism and labor!"
proletkult.21.a: "They will obey."

proletkult.22.t: "Central Institute of Labor"
proletkult.22.d: "Comrade Gastev is convinced of the need for systematic work on the study of labor processes in order to improve them. To this end, it is necessary to create a Labor Institute. He outlined the structure of the Institute of Labor and the methodology of its work. The Central Institute of Labor was recognized as 'an institution for the development, demonstration and promotion of the principles of scientific organization of labor and training of the labor force'.\nThe main activity of the CIT will be the problems of rationalization of methods and methods of work, training of workers. Gastev's 'Labor Attitudes (Ustanovki)' doctrine will introduce an original technology of vocational training - the \"CIT system\", focused on standardized, accelerated, programmed and mass training of skilled workers. This method is based on training workers in certain, most rational labor techniques for manufacturing products on the basis of dividing operations into techniques and movements, studying them and selecting the most rational ones.\n\nA special syndicate, called the 'Ustanovka' under the Gastev program, will be organized under the CIT, it will send specialists-consultants to introduce innovations in scientific work at enterprises. Foreign specialists from France and Britain will also take part in the organization of the syndicate's work. The instructors will work in all sectors of the national economy."
proletkult.22.a: "A great development!"

proletkult.23.t: "Society of Technocrats"
proletkult.23.d: "Tectology is a science formulated by A. Bogdanov, one of the prominent ideologists of the Proletkult in the 1920s in exile. It didn't get much attention from the public, but it caught Gastev's attention.\n\nIn accordance with the fundamental assumptions of tectology, two or more elements included in a single process can, with a special organization (organization), exceed the effectiveness of the functioning of these same elements separately. These ideas formed the basis of the Soviet-Syndical system.\n\nAs practice shows, the system works well, largely due to the leadership of Gastev, as a balancing element in the political system.\n\nIn addition, Bogdanov introduced the concept of technical intelligentsia. These are the most educated and successful people in our republic, who should be at the head of certain departments and manage the rest. This is exactly what is happening now, but the engineers have been joined by academics and scientists who are familiar with objectivity, empirical evidence, and progress."
proletkult.23.a: "A society, led by the cleverest!"

proletkult.24.t: "Keeping With the Time"
proletkult.24.d: "New factories are being built. Agriculture is developing. New techniques and equipment are being introduced. Villages turn into cities. Nature is mastered by man. Time is rushing forward like a steam locomotive, on the rails of progress!\n\nTime passes, and it passes quickly. But we can follow it - and we must, for the good of all mankind! With the Gastev program, our country has already achieved unprecedented results, and everything is still ahead. We have increased labor productivity several times, and the workers have finally begun to live normally and receive decent wages. Time cannot be stopped or overtaken, but we can and will do the most important thing - to keep up."
proletkult.24.a: "Time, Forward!"

proletkult.25.t: "Chairman Lunacharsky"
proletkult.25.d: "What was supposed to happen happened. Anatoly made a long way up - to the very top. Known all over the world as the ideologist and creator of the Proletkult, he is now at the top of Soviet power - the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Under his leadership, hundreds of employees work hard for the benefit of the motherland.\n\nMany people no longer know where Lunacharsky started - what ideas inspired him to work and develop every day to achieve general humanistic goals. Instead, with his closest associate, Alexander Bogdanov, he could sit for hours, talking about what he had not publicly mentioned or written about for a long time.\n\nAnd so, on one of these beautiful days, during an ordinary conversation, Anatoly asked: 'Alexander, but still, in your opinion..."
proletkult.25.a: "...is there a God?"

proletkult.26.t: "The Proletarian Religion"
proletkult.26.d: "Many were confused when they read in the morning papers about one of the first resolutions of Anatoly Lunacharsky - about the creation of a proletarian religion in the country. Now, at the highest level, this decision has been made and will soon be implemented.\n\nBut this is a religion - not a religion in the ordinary sense of the word. This is something more than a belief in fairy tales. The proletarian religion is the belief in a different God. The one who moves our society forward - Progress. The one who brings our society together - Collectivism. And most importantly - the one who allows it all to become true - the Reason."
proletkult.26.a: "That's a brand new religion!"

proletkult.27.t: "Age of Reason"
proletkult.27.d: "The age of Reason has arrived. The decadence and degradation of the era of Tsarism and Kerenskyism led to the fact that people no longer believe in anything. Many turn to Christianity, where the church deceives them and takes away the last thing they had. Within the framework of de-Christianization, we will not kill the priests, although this is the best that could comprehend them. They will be required to adopt a new religion, and if they refuse, they will be arrested and spend their entire lives in labor. The old temples and churches will no longer serve the liars. From now on, these will be Temples of Reason and Truth, where people will be able to find the right answers to questions from the point of view of science and progress, and Marxism, of course."
proletkult.27.a: "Reason is our God!"

proletkult.28.t: "Leninism"
proletkult.28.d: "Many forget who became the scourge of the world bourgeoisie - who enlightened millions of workers around the world, who led the world's first socialist state, but was betrayed and killed by the counter-revolution?\n\nThis man is Lenin. And his ideas will live forever. Now officially the ideology of our party is called Leninism. Lenin is not just a true revolutionary, a courageous man who fell victim to the counter-revolutionary terror of the Social Revolutionaries, but also the main personification of the revolution and socialism. He died for a great idea - a society without masters, where everyone is equal and there is no exploitation, oppression and property. A society where a person does not own a person. It was Lenin who showed us the path of true equality - what we should strive for. Even though he is no longer with us, we will always remember that he sacrificed his life to make our lives better.\n\nLet the exaltation of the memory of the national and international hero, the savior of all the weak and the poor, begin. Monuments to Lenin will be erected in the squares, and his works will be studied in schools. We will never forget his feat."
proletkult.28.a: "The Lenin case lives on!"

proletkult.29.t: "The New Era"
proletkult.29.d: "The era of the Great Bolshevik Socialist Enlightenment has begun!\n\nIlliteracy is being eradicated: all citizens of the republic are being taught to read and write, mathematics and writing! Science and technology are developing, proletarian values are being assimilated! People are beginning to believe in the god of Reason, who is leading our society forward to progress and communism!"
proletkult.29.a: "Long Live Uncle Lunacharsky!"

proletkult.30.t: "The New Narkompros"
proletkult.30.d: "Following the demise of Anatoly Lunacharsky, the position of Narkompros remained unfilled. The government now faces the challenge of determining who shall occupy this esteemed position and perpetuate the cultural revolution in Russia."
proletkult.30.a: "Politburo elects Bogdanov as the new leader."
proletkult.30.b: "Mayakovsky's Social-Futurists take over the Politburo majority."
proletkult.30.c: "Technocrats manage to elect Gastev as the new leader."

proletkult.31.t: "Institute for Blood Transfusion"
proletkult.31.d: "In Moscow, by order of the Narkompros, the world's first scientific and practical Institute of Blood Transfusion was established, the director of which was appointed Aleksander Bogdanov. He claims that blood transfusion is one of the greatest achievements of modern proletarian science. Thanks to the transfusions, we will be able to save countless lives of our soldiers and citizens!\n\nHowever, there are rumors in Moscow that supposedly the Blood Institute performs rejuvenation operations! Of course, Aleksander Bogdanov has for long promoted his own theory of rejuvenation, that young blood can help an aging body, but did the Politburo authorize these operations?"
proletkult.31.a: "We are creating a superhuman!"
proletkult.31.b: "This is something wild, close this Frankenstein lab!"

proletkult.32.t: "Triumph of the Proletarian Science"
proletkult.32.d: "Thanks to the development of science, our scientists from the Radium Institute were able to invent the first cyclotron in Europe!\n\nThis is a resonant cyclic accelerator of non-relativistic heavy charged particles (protons, ions), in which the particles move in a constant and uniform magnetic field, and a high-frequency electric field of constant frequency is used to accelerate them. During the construction and operation of this cyclotron, we have accumulated invaluable experience in working with nuclear reactions, which will help us in the future in the development of nuclear energy.\n\nOur scientists say that soon, thanks to this development, more efficient and powerful machines will be invented, thanks to which it will be possible to split the core and get huge energy."
proletkult.32.a: "Can we use this for armament?"

proletkult.33.t: "Accident During Rejuvenation Operation"
proletkult.33.d: "During one of the rejuvenation operations, that is, blood transfusions, Bogdanov had to receive the blood of a young student. However, as it turned out, the student was ill with malaria and tuberculosis, which Bogdanov presumably knew about. A terrible tragedy has occurred! During the eleventh exchange transfusion with the student, rejection and death occurred. Bogdanov died as a result of the operation.\n\nThe whole country is mourning and grieving over the death of the chairman of the party - the ideologist of the Proletkult and one of the smartest people in the world. He will be replaced as chairman by Valerian Polyansky, Chairman of the All-Russian Proletkult Council, editor-in-chief of the 'Proletarian Culture' publishing house, as well as the head of Glavlit and the creator of the Soviet censorship. He will be a worthy successor to Bogdanov."
proletkult.33.d2: "During one of the rejuvenation operations, that is, blood transfusions, Aleksandr Bogdanov had to receive the blood of a young student. However, as it turned out, the student was ill with malaria and tuberculosis, which Bogdanov presumably knew about. A terrible tragedy has occurred! During the eleventh exchange transfusion with the student, rejection and death occurred. Bogdanov died as a result of the operation.\n\nThe whole country is mourning and grieving over the death of one of the ideologist of the Proletkult and one of the smartest people in the world."
proletkult.33.a: "Valerian Polyansky will be the new chairman!"
proletkult.33.b: "A terrible incident!"

proletkult.34.t: "Collectivization Enforced by the Reason"
proletkult.34.d: "It is time to put an end to the disunity of the peasantry and the rich in the countryside! So is the demand of the Reason! It is necessary to deprive the peasantry of class division and to introduce proletarian culture to them! Therefore, on the instructions of the chairman of Lunacharsky, the immediate collectivization of the village began! Individual peasant farms will be merged into collective farms in order to transform private individual farms into public ones in order to ensure the greatest control by the state and the party over the country's agriculture.\n\nCollectivization will solve the problem of limited distribution of industrial crops in the conditions of small individual farms and form the necessary raw material base for the processing industry. Also, the cost of agricultural products will be reduced, as well as through mechanization, the productivity and efficiency of labor in agriculture will increase.\n\nThe result of collectivization will be the availability of agricultural products to the masses in an amount sufficient to form food reserves, and supply the rapidly growing urban population with food."
proletkult.34.a: "The classic of Proletarianism!"

proletkult.35.t: "Illiteracy Defeated!"
proletkult.35.d: "Thanks to the actions of the Main Council of the Proletkult, the efforts of teachers and the party, we have completely got rid of illiteracy! The whole population of our country is trained in literacy, mathematics, writing and reading! This is a huge breakthrough that we were able to achieve! This is truly the achievement of proletarian culture and socialism - a level that the capitalist oppressors will never reach."
proletkult.35.a: "Long Live Proletkult!"

proletkult.36.t: "Totally Educated Population!"
proletkult.36.d: "The level of education of our citizens is at a very high level. We can confidently say that almost all adult citizens have received higher education or are studying to get it.\nOur country needs highly educated and skilled workers, engineers, and scientists. We will show the whole world what labor and knowledge can do!"
proletkult.36.a: "Long Live Proletkult!"

proletkult.37.t: "The Nation of Proletarians!"
proletkult.37.d: "The propaganda of proletarian ethics and aesthetics has borne fruit: we can confidently declare to the whole world that in our country everyone is faithfully devoted to socialism. The proletarians will rebuild our country and make it the most successful country in the world. For the proletarian always knows how to organize production efficiently."
proletkult.37.a: "Long Live Proletkult!"

proletkult.38.t: "Maya and Myas"
proletkult.38.d: "Always a patron of the arts, and specifically a lover of music himself, Premier Mayakovsky has gone ahead with a series of new public funding campaigns aimed at fueling the careers and genius of the Union's greatest artist, musicians, thinkers, and more. Particularly of interest to Mayakovsky himself however, beyond his mass funding of various writers guilds and literary unions, has been his personal crusade to spread the musical genius of Nikolai Myaskovsky. Myaskovsky, frequently hailed as the Father of Soviet Symphony, is a skilled violinist, pianist, and cellist in his own right, but where he truly shines is in his compositions. None in Russia make symphonies quite like Myaskovsky, and for his talents, he is to be rewarded and utilized for the good of the state and the wider Proletariat masses.\n\nWith this reputation preceding him and with his friendship with Mayakovsky blooming, Myaskovsky - along with his lifelong friend, fellow composer, and master pianist Sergei Prokofiev, and with help from musical geniuses such as Konstantin Saradzhev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Aram Khacaturian, and Igor Stravinsky - are to head a new national union aimed at expanding and perfecting Soviet music in all forms. As our master of the pen Mayakovsky leads the nation, the master of music Myaskovsky shall lead our new cultural renaissance."
proletkult.38.a: "Together, they shall weave a new era of Soviet culture and exceptionalism."

proletkult.39.t: "The Release of Mayakovsky's Omnibus"
proletkult.39.d: "Celebrating the works and genius of our beloved Premier, the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers, or RAPP, has announced the creation of an omnibus composed of all of Mayakovsky's collected literary works. Though the RAPP once was one of Mayakovsky's most vocal sources of criticism, since his rise to power this pretentious union of poets and writers have begun to sing a different tune. Whether this change of heart was sincere or coerced, it does not matter now, for the RAPP has been made loyal, and now only speaks high praises of Mayakovsky's work.\n\nAs such, the RAPP has published this new omnibus, containing great poems such as ‘A Slap in the Face of Public Taste', ‘A Cloud in Trousers', ‘Backbone Flute', ‘The Bedbug', ‘The Bathhouse', and more. However, Mayakovsky's poetry is not the only works included, for some of his own writings and favorite pieces from the art journal LEF were also published within the tome, as was Mayakovsky's own edited version of the Futurist Manifesto, which he partially penned, among other Futurist, Bolshevik, and Socialist treatises Mayakovsky has written sporadically throughout his career. This comprehensive literary masterpiece offers a unique look into the mind and ideas of our beloved leader, and copies are to be distributed to every household within the Union. May all within Russia and beyond read of the genius and vision of Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky!"
proletkult.39.a: "All hail the best and most talented poet of our Soviet epoch."

proletkult.40.t: "Painting Reverend Gapon Red"
proletkult.40.d: "Seeking to raise more Russians as holy figures to aid in his ‘God-Building' projects, Anatoly Lunacharsky has decided to rewrite the history surrounding the Reverend Georgy Gapon. Once a populist and peaceful member of the Orthodox priesthood who championed working-class rights, Gapon was famously murdered by members of the SRs in 1906 after the failed Revolution of 1905 due to alleged evidence linking him to the royal guard and police as an informant. Despite the long-held belief that Gapon truly was a traitor to the proletarian masses, Lunacharsky has declared this account to be falsified. Instead, our ingenious leader has decided to set the record straight, revealing the truth behind Gapon.\n\nWith his synthesis of Christian views and cryptosocialist rhetoric, the godless SRs were merely intimidated by this example of heavenly righteousness, and put Gapon to death in order to stop the spread of Christian-influenced Socialism. Rewriting every account in the nation and raising Gapon up as a hero of the people and of the Party, Lunacharsky shall use the image of Reverend Gapon and others to cement his hold over the masses."
proletkult.40.a: "History and God shall see it our way."


### Sokolnikov ###

sokolnikov.1.t: "Chairman Sokolnikov"
sokolnikov.1.d: "Grigory Sokolnikov, now the new chairman of the party and head of the Council of People's Commissars, is ready to adopt new decrees, and in particular, as an economist, to start the most important thing - economic reform.\n\nDespite the fact that he was in the opposition, now his faction is in power, and the opposition is already opposing his regime. Not everyone agrees with the adoption of Bukharin's doctrine, and considers it revisionism and the same betrayal that Bukharin committed many years ago. Sokolnikov has a lot to change in the personnel of the Central Committee of the RKP, if he wants to succeed, otherwise the more radical Bolsheviks can remove him."
sokolnikov.1.a: "There's always someone non content"

sokolnikov.2.t: "Denouncing Bukharin's Betrayal"
sokolnikov.2.d: "Despite the fact that Chairman Sokolnikov is undoubtedly a convinced Bolshevik, with his acceptance of Bukharin's NEP program, his loyalty to the party began to be doubted. Many openly call him a revisionist and Bukharinist, and even accuse him of Menshevism. Of course, such an image does not contribute to the popularity of Sokolnikov, which means that urgent measures are needed for 'Debukharinization'.\n\nUndoubtedly, Sokolnikov is not an adherent of Bukharin's ideas, moreover, despite the fact that they began their journey together, Bukharin's betrayal and his decision to kowtow to Kerensky and the bourgeois-democratic government of the Petrograd regime, greatly shocked Sokolnikov. However, he could not but recognize the viability of the NEP in the early years of the transition to full-fledged socialism.\n\nIn this regard, urgent measures will be taken to ostracize Bukharin, delegitimize his party, which will be banned, and all activists will be arrested for anti-state activities. Bukharin's face will hang in every yard, crossed out and with a huge inscription TRAITOR TO SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM!"
sokolnikov.2.a: "No mercy to traitors!"

sokolnikov.3.t: "Reaffirm Trading Contracts"
sokolnikov.3.d: "Our young republic needs to abide by trade agreements with other powers, including capitalist ones, until we can take care of ourselves. Like other decisions of Sokolnikov, this is one of the most controversial. Many believe that since we accept money from the capitalists, they can sponsor our economy on their own terms. Of course, this is not the case. Moreover, what could be better than the fact that the imperialists and capitalists pay the Socialist state, and therefore sponsor socialism?"
sokolnikov.3.a: "Send our proposals"

sokolnikov.9.t: "The All-Russian Starosta"
sokolnikov.9.d: "The Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee is nominally the highest state position in the Republic of Soviets. It became such in connection with the death of Sverdlov and the appointment of Mikhail Kalinin back in 1919. During the reconstruction of the Soviet government, the VTsIK, as well as its chairman, were restored, and Mikhail Kalinin again headed this authority. [ROOT.GetLeader] suggests that Mikhail Kalinin is a promising Bolshevik who can is capable of more useful work. As the head of the executive branch, he will have approximately the same powers as the President of the Russian Republic - that is, to represent Russia abroad, along with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In many ways, his position will remain, of course, decorative, but the government led by [ROOT.GetLeader] will be under the head of the VTsIK."
sokolnikov.9.a: "Make the 'All-Russian Starosta' finally worthy"
sokolnikov.9.b: "It better remain as it is."


### Molotov & Kaganovich ###
molotov.1.t: "Molotov's National-Bolshevism"
molotov.1.d: "In his first speech as head of the party, Molotov announced the new course of the country - national Bolshevism.\n\nFor many delegates, this concept was not available for understanding, and therefore, the chairman made a theoretical justification for the new ideology of the party.\n\nNational Bolshevism proceeds from the obvious fact that only Bolshevism and the Bolshevik party can pull the country out of medieval feudalism and chaos. In the civil war, reaction won - and the republic was doomed. For 20 years, the peasants waited for land, and the workers for factories. But the landlords and capitalists who retained power were only enriched by German handouts.\n\nThe time of pain and suffering of our people is over. Only Bolshevism can save them. Not the syndicalism inherent in the Western countries, nor the Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik capitalism, nor the revisionism of Bukharin. Only one party, unjustly expelled and excommunicated from the people, can change life in the country. And this is the party of the Bolsheviks."
molotov.1.a: "Bolshevism will prevail."

molotov.2.t: "Council of Labor and Defense"
molotov.2.d: "The Council of Labor and Defense was first established in November 1918, in the midst of the blazing civil War. The Council served as an emergency "national economic cabinet", issuing emergency decrees in an attempt to support industrial production for the Red Army in the face of economic collapse.\n\nHowever, the Council of Labor and Defense did not live long, as did the power of the Bolsheviks. With the end of the civil war, the council was dissolved. However, now the council should be restored, because we are still in a state of civil war. Peasant uprisings, small-nation uprisings, capitalists and imperialists, revisionists and opportunists, Transamur traitors -all are ready to take advantage of the weakness of the Soviet republic and tear it apart.\n\nThe Labor and Defense Council will be restored. Our economy will develop by leaps and bounds, collectivization and industrialization are waiting for us - and the faster the better for us and the worse for our enemies."
molotov.2.a: "War is coming."

molotov.3.t: "The Efremovites"
molotov.3.d: "Mikhail Efremov was just a peasant from the collective farm "Iskra" of the Beloglazovsky district of the Altai Territory on the border with hostile Mongolia, became the owner of the world record yield (he received on an area of 3.6 hectares 61 quintals of wheat per hectare, and on 8.5 hectares - 54 quintals).\n\nWith his feat of organizing labor and defense of the republic, Yefremov inspired many other collective farmers, thus becoming the initiator of the movement of the country's foremost agricultural leaders for high yields. The movement has become incredibly popular, and it is quite possible that soon many citizens will be inspired by the feat of Efremov and become leaders in their industries. The movement has already received the name "Efremovites" after the initiator, and Efremov himself was appointed chairman of the kolhoz."
molotov.3.a: "Long live the socialist labor!"

molotov.4.t: "With a Hammer Blow"
molotov.4.d: "Molotov, whose party pseudonym literally translates as 'Hammer', gives great importance to labor and defense. Having enhanced the traditional hammer and sickle with a symbol once considered during the Revolution - and at the same time a symbol of defense - the sword, Molotov is ready to continue his program.\n\n'With a blow of the hammer' is the new motto of all the proletarians and peasants of the country. Only with a cold look, in the sweat of our brow, can we become stronger and more secure. We need to immediately increase the rate of production, and the sooner the better."
molotov.4.a: "All for the defense of the motherland."

molotov.5.t: "Declaring War on Unemployment"
molotov.5.d: "During the Kerensky regime, unemployment only increased every year, but those days are long gone. In our state, there will be no unemployment at all. It's very simple. Until recently, unemployed people were only condemned and subjected to social ostracism, they did not want to communicate with them, because they are not ready to serve labor and socialism. However, now everything has changed. The Council of Labor and Defense proposed to introduce administrative penalties, including fines and arrests for the unemployed, but Chairman Molotov proposed a more ingenious idea. After all, you can't argue that the unemployed are parasites. And when they run out of money to pay fines, they will sit under arrest - and rest.\n\nMolotov proposed to toughen the punishment and make it criminal. But no, they won't shoot anyone. Instead, labor camps will be created in which convicted parasites will work for the benefit of the country. The so - called General Management of the camps, under the leadership of both the Council of Labor and Defense and the [GetChekaName], will control the work of prisoners."
molotov.5.a: "The unemployment will be eradicated."

molotov.6.t: "Triumph of Sword and Hammer"
molotov.6.d: "It is still too early to talk about a complete victory, but the foundation has already been laid. Thanks to the triumph of the sword and the hammer, our country is successfully developing from an agrarian semi-feudal backward state into an industrially developed socialist state. National Bolshevism, as a belief in the Bolshevik party and in the peoples inhabiting the territory of the former Russian Empire, triumphed in the minds of ordinary people. They realized how right the Bolsheviks were in their endeavors, how wise and clever the great chairman Vyacheslav Molotov is."
molotov.6.a: "Sword and Hammer - the key to our victory!"

### Kaganovich ###
kaganovich.1.t: "Three Brothers"
kaganovich.1.d: "The new chairman of the party, Lazar Kaganovich, has already formed a new cabinet of People's commissars, including his own brothers. This decision was criticized by some non-essential party members, who, however, soon changed their minds. However, the so-called "fraternal triumvirate" of Michael, Lazarus, and Julius was created with the aim of creating a centralized government as part of Kaganovich's fight against dissent."
kaganovich.1.a: "The Bolshevik dynasty?"

kaganovich.2.t: "Choosing Our Direction"
kaganovich.2.d: "Since the People's commissariats of the national economy and internal affairs are now under the rule of the Kaganovich brothers, Lazar must choose which of the brothers he can count on more. Mikhail, on the one hand, is a rather hot-tempered person who does not seriously focus on work, on the other hand, Julius is really a talented security officer. However, the situation in the country should also be taken into account. It is full of spies and various counter-revolutionaries, but on the other hand, the economy, already destroyed by the German henchman Kerensky, is completely ruined. It is necessary to make a decision on what to focus on."
kaganovich.2.a: "Focus on reviving economy"
kaganovich.2.b: "Focus on security"

kaganovich.3.t: "A Drunk Brawler"
kaganovich.3.d: "Lazar Kaganovich was stunned by the news that his brother Mikhail, moreover, the People's Commissar of the National Economy, was in the drunk tank last night. Like a real rowdy, Mikhail, having got drunk in the 'Rumochnaya', began to shout near the street Solyanka in Moscow 'the Internationale'. Residents of nearby houses complained about the night noise and the good thing that they called the police, and did not call directly the Lubyanka, which is only half an hour on foot. The police officer who arrived at the scene found the People's Commissar lying on the ground, seemingly unconscious, drunk in a frenzy. But in his usual manner, Mikhail was only joking. When the policeman approached the drunk and began to shake him, trying to bring him to his senses, Mikhail quickly opened his eyes and laughed in the face of the dazed policeman. Of course, soon after that, he was detained and taken to the local drunk tank in the Kitaygorodsky district. There the People's Commissar safely slept through, and in the morning, as if nothing had happened, went to work.\n\nNow he sits with a guilty face in front of the chairman, and assures him of his innocence."
kaganovich.3.a: "'You try that again, Misha, I'll be not so nice.'"

kaganovich.4.t: "Another Incident"
kaganovich.4.d: "Lazar Kaganovich was informed that his brother Mikhail, who was also the People's Commissar of the National Economy, had failed all the deadlines for the delivery of an important agricultural object. At work, Mikhail joked a lot, shouted at the top of his voice, and did everything from playing checkers with local peasants to tipping a glass of rural moonshine. This behavior of the People's Commissar, of course, is irresponsible and destructive. Mikhail had already been warned that he would be removed from his leadership position in the party and expelled from the Central Committee. However, he did not listen to the advice and continued to behave like a ridiculous child. By the decision of the congress, it was unanimously decided to expel Mikhail from the Central Committee and appoint a more suitable person to this position.\n\nEyewitnesses say that Mikhail endured his resignation hard, ranging from a heavy drinking binge, ending with the denial of Marxism and cursing Lenin, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Yagoda, Molotov and, finally, his own brother Lazar. This was not good for anything, so by the decision of the party, Mikhail was appointed to the post of director of the aviation plant, where he would have been at least a little happier."
kaganovich.4.a: "Well, every family has one black sheep."

kaganovich.5.t: "No Happy-End"
kaganovich.5.d: "Lazar Kaganovich was informed that today at 6 o'clock in the morning his brother Mikhail, the director of the aviation plant, was found shot dead in his own office at the plant. Despite the fact that there are no clear reasons for what he did there so early, forensic experts agree that Mikhail did not leave the plant in the evening. Left alone with an expensive foreign cognac, Mikhail drank a bottle, and, being in an extremely intoxicated state, took a gun out of his pocket. After lighting a Cuban cigar, he sat down in a chair and wrote a suicide note in a barely legible hand. In it, he said that he could no longer live, having lost the chair of the People's Commissar. He also wrote about how great it was for him to live in exile in France and that he is very sorry that he returned to his homeland. Unable to cope with the amount of work, Mikhail decided that he was no longer needed by the country, but he remains committed to the cause of Lenin to the end.\n\nHis body was delivered in a closed coffin to Moscow, and a farewell ceremony will take place soon."
kaganovich.5.a: "Rest in peace, brother."

kaganovich.6.t: "Moscow Metro"
kaganovich.6.d: "In Moscow, the second stage of the metro opened, thanks to Kaganovich's enhanced measures for the renovation of the new capital. Back in the 1920s, with the assistance of the German company Siemens Bauunion, the Kerensky government was able to find funds for the construction of the first line of the Moscow subway. The line stretches from Ostozhenka Street to the square of Three Railway Stations. Following the plan drawn up by the Germans, Lazar Kaganovich, together with Gosplan, built new sections of the Moscow metro in record time. The new line stretched from Bryansky Railway Station to Kursky Railway Station through the center of the capital, passing under Red Square, where a huge transfer hub was built for the third line - from Rzhevsky Railway station to Saratovsky Railway Station.\n\nThis is not the end of Kaganovich's renovation, as a huge plan was made for the renovation of Moscow - watering its rivers and landscaping. New metro lines will also be opened soon."
kaganovich.6.a: "Splendid!"

kaganovich.7.t: "Kaganovich's Social Patriots"
kaganovich.7.d: "Soon after Krestinsky became the new chairman of the party, Lazar Kaganovich became the new secretary of the RKP. Having a long story of party participation, Kaganovich quickly became the second person in the party. As Krestinsky, Kaganovich himself was inspired by the Georgian Bolshevism, even though he rejected its nationalistic and chauvinistic tendencies. In Moscow, the supporters of Kaganovich are now known as Social-Patriots and it seems that this name fits good in the new policies of the RKP. Nevertheless, Kaganovich is likely to become Krestinsky's successor in the upcoming years, so we should keep an eye on him."
kaganovich.7.a: "Interesting."

kaganovich.8.t: "Krestinsky Retires"
kaganovich.8.d: "Soon after the formation of the Union, our chairman, Nikolay Krestinsky has announced his retirement. Now he decided that this is the right time to do it. At the Party Congress, he named Kaganovich, leader of the Moscow Social Patriotic Faction, his successor and advised the Congress to vote for him. As intended, the Congress voted for Kaganovich to become the new Chairman."
kaganovich.8.a: "A new era begins."

### Yagoda's Personal Hell ###
nkvd.20.t: "Blagonravov's Conspiracy Exposed!"
nkvd.20.d: "On the table of the People's Commissars lay the testimony of the head of the [GetChekaName], Georgy Blagonravov, in which his plans for the elimination of the supreme leadership of the Central Committee of the RKP were described in detail. Other members of the [GetChekaName] were also involved in Blagonravov's plot, and Blagonravov's ultimate goal was his own sole leadership of the party and the country, based on the repressive methods of the [GetChekaName]. It was a good thing that his plot was discovered and he was betrayed by his own assistants. Now the country is no longer threatened by the [GetChekaName], and the members of the Congress of Soviets are inclined to completely reorganize the repressive apparatus, and of course, to immediately shoot Comrade Blagonravov and bring his name to blame and condemnation, and at the same time to oblivion.

nkvd.22.d: "The defendants, who belong to the association of anti-Soviet proletcultists-Bukharinites, are accused of creating a criminal group aimed at overthrowing the Soviet government and creating a form of government that contradicts socialism and communism. According to the testimony, a group of 'Russian futurists' planned to establish a state with the power of the creative intelligentsia, restore ties with the capitalists and all kinds of approval of subversive activities. Another group of "Soviet syndicalists" aimed to create a state, following the example of the French and British syndicalists, where the power of the Soviets would be minimized, and the power of the trade unions would be unlimited. Lunacharsky's group proposed, contrary to the ideas of Marx and Lenin, to create a religious cult in the country. In addition, all the groups appeared to be linked to Western spies, the Mensheviks, and Bukharin's treacherous clique. In addition, information was received that in 1918 the Proletcultists-Bukharinists organized the murder of Lenin and ensured the victory of the white counter-revolutionary forces.\n\nAll things considered, all involved are sentenced to death by firing squad.

While his health has deteriorated greatly during recent months, he presumably has committed suicide out of desperation, though [GetChekaName] does not confirm this information. Anyway, his death is now a matter of fact, and any remnants of the Zinovievite opposition are now left without their head."

nkvd.29.d: "As the trial of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries commenced in [ROOT.Capital.GetName], the long-delayed reckoning for Maria Spiridonova, Boris Kamkov, Isaak Shternberg, and Yuri Lutovinov, among other 30 accused, has arrived - not in silence, but amid packed galleries, cameras, and the blaring headlines of every Party newspaper. The Left SRs, once partners in 1917-1918 turned traitors, now stand accused of terrorism, sabotage, and counter-revolution. The Press has painted them as the "third camp of betrayal" and even latent Savinkovists, neither White nor entirely Red, but a faction that struck the Revolution from within.\n\nThe trial has all the trappings of spectacle: dramatic reenactments of the 1918 Left SR uprising, testimony from wounded Bolshevik cadres, and denunciations from former Popular Front members turned witnesses for the prosecution.\n\nSome, while silent in public, haves pushed for the harshest penalties - even suggesting pre-written verdicts for the defendants. More moderate ones have voiced concern over the political tone of the prosecution, urging that the Revolution show clemency without forgetfulness.\n\nBut with the Tribunal in session and the crowds calling for justice, clemency may not be on the agenda."
nkvd.29.d2: "With the Revolution's emergency tribunals dissolved, the trial of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries has been handed to the new institutions of Soviet justice. In a historic proceeding, the State Prosecutor has brought charges of political conspiracy and armed rebellion against Maria Spiridonova, Boris Kamkov, Isaak Shternberg, and Yuri Lutovinov, as well as other 30 top-ranking party members.\n\nThe Supreme Court's hearings, open to the public and broadcast across the nation, are being heralded by the press as "the first great test of Soviet legality". The prosecution has presented thousands of pages of internal SR documents and orders signed by the defendants. The defense, granted limited leeway, has argued that they had acted "in defense of the Revolution".\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] and his allies see the trial as a chance to present the unity of Party and Law. Some, however, skeptical of the new judicial façade, have quietly pressured the prosecutor to ensure the only proper conclusion. The moderate voices push for reduced sentences.\n\nWhatever the outcome, this trial is more than a verdict on the SRs - it will set the tone for the Republic's postwar justice."

nkvd.30.d: "In the case of the anti-Soviet underground terrorist criminal group 'Bukharin's Clique - People's Socialist Party', the leaders and coordinators of the movement - Nikolay Bukharin, Alexander Shlyapnikov, Aleksandra Kollontai and Aleksey Rykov were arrested. All four of them soon confessed their guilt and repented of their malicious betrayal of the Bolshevik party. Bukharin begged the court to have mercy and take into account his party experience as a Bolshevik. He also noted that he had always been devoted to Lenin's ideals and that by creating the New Bolsheviks bloc, he hoped that Bolshevism would live on. He fought for power for the sake of Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and only Kerensky prevented him from coming to power. However, this does not negate the fact that Bukharin was a malicious revisionist who departed from the ideas of Marxism and tried to convince the peasants of the correctness of capitalist relations and promoted inequality in society.\n\nThe court found Bukharin, Shlyapnikov and Rykov guilty of betraying the motherland, betraying the party and anti-Soviet terrorist activities, aiding the bourgeoisie and large capital, as well as collaborating with a left-wing Socialist-Revolutionary group. All three were sentenced to death by hanging. The court recognized Kollontai's achievements in the field of gender equality and showed mercy: she will serve 25 years in a labor camp.\n\nThe remaining members of the 'People's Socialist Party' were arrested and their personal property seized. All party members who had previously been members of the Bolshevik Party were sentenced to life imprisonment, and those who had not been members of any party before the [GetRadSocParty] were given the choice of joining the Bolshevik Party, or being sentenced to 10 to 25 years for participating in a terrorist organization."

nkvd.31.t: "The Trial of the Mensheviks"
nkvd.31.d: "Before a packed hall of Party members, journalists, and invited foreign observers, the Revolutionary Tribunal today convened its most symbolically loaded session: the trial of the remaining leaders of the Menshevik faction. Once comrades in the early days of the RSDRP, Fyodor Dan and Rafail Abramovich, among others, now stand accused of counter-revolutionary sabotage, espionage, and ideological subversion.\n\nThe indictments are sweeping. The Menshevik legacy, prosecutors claim, is not merely one of opposition, but of betrayal - a party that chose legalism over class struggle, parliamentarism over proletarian dictatorship, and conciliation over revolution. Alongside the central figures, other former Mensheviks, Solomon Lozovsky, Stanislav Strumilin, Andrei Vyshinsky and others, are called to testify. While they distanced themselves from the Popular Front leadership, their past is now a subject of public scrutiny.\n\nThe Party's press organs hail the proceedings as the "final severance with bourgeois socialism". The Hardliners press demands exemplary punishment, while only the moderates raise objections - calling for differentiation between active saboteurs and intellectuals who erred, warning that indiscriminate repression may extinguish productive voices from the Soviet system.\n\nThe verdict looms - and with it, the final sunset of Menshevism as a political force in Russia."
nkvd.31.d2: "The case against the Mensheviks has been taken up by the Supreme Court of the Republic. It is another major political trial under the new legalist order - and though the courtroom is quieter than the Tribunals of old, its ideological stakes are no less grave.\n\nState Prosecutor Krylenko opens the case with a familiar theme: that the Menshevik faction represents "bourgeois capitalism in socialist dress", traitors that has long undermined the proletarian dictatorship. On trial are Fyodor Dan, Rafail Abramovich, and several minor figures accused of organizing clandestine networks of influence, particularly within labor unions and cooperative institutions.\n\nSeveral former Mensheviks, including such figures as Solomon Lozovsky and Stanislav Strumilin, - are summoned as witnesses. Though they left the party to form their own current within the Soviet system, the prosecution raises the question of loyalty. The court stops short of prosecuting them but casts a long shadow over their future in public life.\n\nParty voices are divided. Some celebrate the trial as ideological closure, the hardliners support firm sentences as a message of postwar order, while the moderates warn that ideological zeal may devour past allies whose talents remain useful."

Twelve members of the now-defunct Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries - former deputies, organizers, and ideological enablers - have been brought before the Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal. No longer the force that once marched under the banners of the Constituent Assembly and the Democratic Republic, the PSR today is a hollowed-out relic, its few surviving cadres accused of sabotage, conspiracy, and subversion. Though none of the central figures such as Chernov or Avksentiev sit among the accused, the trial has all the trappings of a political spectacle.\n\nHardliners, though skeptical of the theatrics, back the move as a final hammer strike on the peasant party's legacy. Even moderate voices, that usually advocates for reconciliation, agree that the PSR must be permanently removed from the historical stage as traitors to the Revolution. With the halls filled by journalists and Party cadre, the message is clear: no room remains for divided loyalties in the workers' state."

Distributed over a large part of the territory, the paramilitaries prepared provocations, sabotage and terrorist attacks. The key was the destruction of a large cell in Tambov and Penza, where the number of the combat organization reached 12 thousand terrorists.\n\nIn the end, a special operation was organized to identify the location of Savinkov and organize his arrest. Savinkov was discovered - he was given out by his own people. The dangerous terrorist was discovered, disarmed, and arrested. He was taken to the main building of the [GetChekaName], where he was held in prison. Savinkov did not repent of what he had done, denied any connection with the NPRP and behaved like an outspoken extremist. By the decision of the court, he was sentenced to death by hanging, the execution was going to be carried out on Red Square and left to rot there for the amusement of the peasants.\n\nHowever, unfortunately, the so-called leader managed to commit suicide by jumping from the 4th floor.

Unfortunately, the leaders of the organization, former members of the Ittifak party, I-UTMAB and I-UMB, fled abroad and settled in the Ottoman Empire, but continued to conduct extremist activities in Russia through closed communication channels. In total, about 800 legionnaires were arrested, all of them were sentenced to life sentences.\n\nThis case also involves many leaders of the Bashkir National Movement, mostly former social revolutionaries, who also planned the creation of the Great Bashkiria as part of the Idel-Ural state. Their leader, Ahmed Walidi, also left the country, leaving most of the Bashkir terrorists behind. All of them were also put on trial.\n\nThis operation is only one that revealed anti-Soviet nationalist bourgeois-capitalist organizations.

They also planned to cooperate with the Idel-Ural Legion in the field of terrorism and destabilization of the situation in the Volga region.\n\nElmen denied the charges against him, saying that he had always stood up for the Soviet government, while the other defendants fully admitted their guilt and repented of their anti-Soviet activities.

The accused were Udmurt poet Kuzebay Gerd, Mari poet Olyk Ipay, Komi teacher Sandro Vago and Mordovian politician Zakhar Dorofeev.\n\nNone of the four accused admitted their guilt, which means that they did not repent of bourgeois nationalism and anti-Soviet rhetoric.

nkvd.42.d: "If the party has decided that the army has finally been cleared of traitors and anti-Soviets, then this is a delusion. The Cheka believes that General Zhukov, a young but ambitious military figure who in fact played a significant role in the restoration of Soviet power and the power of the Bolshevik Party, is also involved in the conspiracy. Many people can hardly believe that the seemingly only person in Russia who was able to resist the pressure of conservative circles and lead the workers ' uprising is actually an enemy spy and traitor. However, the evidence of the Cheka, as always, is reinforced concrete:\n\nDuring the Civil War, Zhukov did not participate in the red movement, but preferred to sit out with a wound. He did not help Lenin's cause in any way, and soon after the end of the civil war he remained in Russia and served Kornilov and Denikin like any ordinary ordinary White Guard and traitor to the revolution. Despite the fact that he later led a rebellion against the power of the Kornilov military junta and united other pro-Soviet generals, his true views remain in question.\n\nThe investigation suggests that the Zhukov uprising was sponsored by the German and Japanese imperialists in order to weaken Russia. After all, after Zhukov came to power, the lands in Siberia, as well as Karelia, were lost. The prosecution also suggests that at the beginning of the war with Germany and Japan, Zhukov will be the first to betray socialism and engage in sabotaging the army and become the head of the military junta like Kornilov.\n\nZhukov denies all charges and declares his innocence. But is it worth believing such an unreliable person?"

In the last days of the siege, when the White Guard troops had already tightly approached the capital, an event occurred known as the Petrograd Massacre, when the Bolsheviks who escaped were carrying out their last orders for mass terror. One of the executors of such orders was Blagonravov, who shed rivers of blood of the enemies of the party who surrendered Petrograd to the enemy.\n\nOn behalf of Blagonravov, about 200 enemies of the people who were directly or indirectly involved in the Bolsheviks' loss in the war were shot. Basically, their fault was their ties with the White Guard, which, according to Blagonravov, led to the imminent surrender of defense positions near Tikhvin and Novgorod. The guilt of these traitors was undeniable, and served as an important lesson for the Bolsheviks who were preparing the second revolution abroad.\n\nThis time the traitors will not have time to help the enemies."

He is suspected of covert Bukharinism and his ideas of purging the army generals call into question his devotion to the ideas of socialism. It seems that Blagonravov sees traitors of the people everywhere, but you need to be objective in this matter. In this regard, a number of people proposed to nominate Genrikh Yagoda, an experienced Cheka officer who had already proved his loyalty to the party and worked under Blagonravov for many years, to the post of head of the Cheka.\nOn the one hand, by appointing Yagoda, we may be able to avoid mistakes, on the other hand, perhaps Blagonravov is really right, and no matter how much we would like to admit the opposite, the party and the country are full of enemies of the people.

In the capital and major cities, there were armed clashes between the Chekists and the military, but it was the army that put the final point. Georgy Blagonravov was liquidated, and the Cheka was transferred to the army.\n\nThe old government was dismissed, and the military formed a provisional government to restore order in the country."

And if he dares to abuse his power, we must remember that our mother is anarchy, and no one has the right to rule over another person.

tsentrobalt.4.t: "The Arrival of Petrichenko and the True Anarchists"
tsentrobalt.4.d: "Famed Anarchist Stepan Petrichenko came from the French commune to free Russia. In December 1917, he proclaimed the Soviet Republic of Sailors and Builders, but soon he had to evacuate to Kronstadt following rising tensions and calls for his murder among the other revolutionary factions. However, he remained committed to the ideas of anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism to the end, and he took the loss of Makhno in Ukraine and the repressive anti-anarchist policies of the Bolsheviks very hard. In the wake of their failed revolution, Petrichenko followed Makhno to France, where he became a close ally and collaborator to the famed Bat'ko and his new French allies.\n\nNow that the flag of the Central Bank is flying over Russia, Petrichenko has returned to take power from the hands of the usurper Dybenko. He publicly declared that Dybenko is not an adherent of anarchism and established himself as a notorious scoundrel, a Bolshevik brawler. The memory of Petrichenko and his anarchist commune is still alive among the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, as is the memory of who Dybenko is.\n\nDybenko, being already a representative of the Central Bank and Free Russia, was notoriously rowdy and a drunkard. Among anarchists, there was an opinion that Dybenko, indeed, is not suitable for the role of leader, and that his behavior discredits anarchism. Petrichenko's popularity is growing every day, and the anarchist communes have nominated him instead of Dybenko to represent the anarchists of Russia abroad. As in the case of Dybenko, his role will be nominal, but maybe it will be better when we are represented by a recognized anarchist, and not some Bolshevik drunkard and murderer?\n\nHowever, opposing both of these viewpoints is a third, far more radical option. Arriving in Russia with his old ally and friend Petrichenko, the beloved Bat'ko - or father - Nestor Makhno has integrated himself by Petrichenko's side and has served as an international beacon for anarchists across the world to bear witness to. With his reputation, his devotion to true Anarchism, and his popularity among our movement all preceding him, many have come to demand that neither Dybenko or Petrichenko should guide our new anarchist society, but instead it should be Bat'ko Makhno as the one who will be our shepherd. Though Makhno's failures in Ukraine during the revolution still hang in the air, these past missteps have only served to fuel his drive, and with the other heads of the movement at each other's throats, Makhno may very well be the best candidate to preserve the unity of our movement as well as its total dedication to Anarchist principles. What shall our final say be - would our new anarchist movement best be in the hands of a respected anarcho-communist revolutionary, a drunken sailor and war hero, or the father of modern slavic anarchism himself?"
tsentrobalt.4.a: "Get rid of Dybenko!"
tsentrobalt.4.b: "Dybenko shall stay."
tsentrobalt.4.c: "Mother Anarchy loves her sons, but so too does the Father. Makhno is our man!"

tsentrobalt.5.t: "Plunder the Loot!"
tsentrobalt.5.d: "Once Lenin announced the slogan: "Plunder the Loot!" And it made sense.\nFor centuries, ordinary people were robbed: first by the tsars, then by the capitalists, and other exploiters. Their so-called property was looted illegally, because they used violence against others. They should no longer own it, and now it's national property! Everyone has the right!\n\nLoot the looters, people! Take it as your personal property and use it. There's nothing wrong with taking it back. And so it will be until all the property stolen over the years by the capitalists becomes public property"

SOV_chairman_frunze: "Frunze Takes Command"
SOV_chairman_frunze_desc: "The Soviet Troika was meant to serve as a beacon of stability for our new socialist paradise, but instead has only sown more discord amongst our ranks. As the Troika collapsed and the power struggle between its three titans raged, only one would arise from the clearing dust. Emerging victorious in power struggle in the Troika, Mikhail Frunze has ascended to become the head of state."

SOV_Establish_Autonomies: "Establish the Autonomies"
SOV_Establish_Autonomies_desc: "After the re-establishment of Soviet Russia under Chairman Frunze, various nationalist groups began to carry out their horrid schemes to try and secede from Russia so as to declare their independence. If we create cultural autonomous institutions for each and every of the various major cultural groups, we might just be able to keep Russia safe from separatists. The integrity of our borders must remain intact!"

SOV_Frunzes_Genius: "Frunze's Genius"
SOV_Frunzes_Genius_desc: "Mikhail Frunze is one of the greatest military minds alive. By learning from our glorious Chairman's ingenious military and political manoeuvres, we can improve the doctrine and tactics employed by our proud Red Army. With Frunze at the helm dictating our strategum, the Red Army of our Soviet country shall never falter!"

SOV_New_Russian_Culture: "New Russian Culture"
SOV_New_Russian_Culture_desc: "Through a combination of educational and political reforms and public involvement campaigns, we have created a new generation in Soviet Russia; one instilled with new Russian Socialist ideals. This new Soviet man and woman shall become the bedrock of our new socialist, utopian culture and ideals."

SOV_Russian_Education: "Socialist Education"
SOV_Russian_Education_desc: "With the new Russian language education programs for minorities being instituted across the state, masses of previously illiterate, non-Russian speaking people across the nation have begun to learn to read, write, and speak the language of their home nation. As more and more of our populace grow literate and educated, greater research potential can be achieved."

SOV_The_Soviet_Republics: "The Soviet Republics"
SOV_The_Soviet_Republics_desc: "The division of the old Tsarist lands into various self-governing national republics has reduced much of the stress that would normally be on a centralised state with as many ethnic divisions as Russia. With the autonomies established, the borders of our great state shall remain in tact while our minority populations will grow to support our regime in time."

SOV_General_Of_Revolution: "General of Revolution"
SOV_General_Of_Revolution_desc: "Being a veteran of the Russian Civil War, Frunze is a real pioneer of the Russian Revolution. Under his leadership, our country will be a great world superpower and a vanguard of world socialism."

### New Congress Focuses ###
SOV_Premier_Volsky: "Premier Volsky"
SOV_Premier_Volsky_desc: "Vladimir Volsky has been named the head of our Party. As an avid Socialist and supporter of the Revolution his appointment is seen as unsurprising by many. His devotion to the party goes back to 1903 and has since kept a close friendship with the Spiridonova. While, for one reason or another, Spiridonova herself was unable to secure leadership to many of her supporters, Volsky is the next best thing. Promising to return the PSR to its revolutionary roots he has gained many followers and now the establishment trembles as it waits for his next move."

SOV_Premier_Spiridonova: "Premier Spiridonova"
SOV_Premier_Spiridonova_desc: "The Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution, Maria Spiridonova has secured leadership over the Soviets. Under her leadership a revolutionary fire has been lit. Whether she will succeed where others failed however remains to be seen."

SOV_Premier_Lozovsky: "Premier Lozovsky"
SOV_Premier_Lozovsky_desc: "Solomon Lozovsky has been elected to lead the Party. He is an unorthodox candidate, having fallen out with Lenin over the party's increased dictatorial slant under him. Instead he drew closer to the French unions during a stint in exile in the country in 1914. Now at the head of the Party he will probably seek to liberalize the party and mend the schisms of old. Whether he will succeed is another matter. No matter what he decides to do he will have to fight both internal and external dissention to do it."

SOV_A_New_Female_Image: "A New Female Image"
SOV_A_New_Female_Image_desc: "For too long the man has dominated the female. She has been expected to stay at home, tend to the house and remain little more than a slave to her husband. Premier Spiridonova has no qualms in revealing the hypocrisy of the Party, loudly promoting the equality of all while leaving women behind. Under her rule however there will be no patriarchal house slave relationship. All marriages will be equal unions, under the Law as well as any other measure. The New Soviet Woman will be strong and free, an equal pillar of any household. There will be grumbling from the conservatives but let them grumble. They will come crawling back to us when their wives taste true freedom and leave them behind."

SOV_Revolutionary_Narodism: "Association of Left Narodism"
SOV_Revolutionary_Narodism_desc: "The People is the revolutionary force in our country. Only with the means of true popular power we can achieve equality for all."

SOV_Socialist_Democracy: "Socialist Democracy"
SOV_Socialist_Democracy_desc: "For many Socialism is synonymous with dictatorship. This is a holdover from the time of Lenin whose rule was almost as despotic as the Tsar he helped overthrow. We will remedy that problem. We will introduce democracy to the nation, true democracy equal as befitting the Socialist platform. This will endear us to the people and while Marx and Lenin may turn in their graves, times have changed and democracy is required for a state to function."

SOV_Elect_New_Soviets: "Elect New Soviets"
SOV_Elect_New_Soviets_desc: "With our program already positively affecting the people we should make a move to sideline other factions of the Party. By electing new local Soviets across the nation we will accomplish many things. One, we will strengthen our mandate when the people turn out in droves to support our candidates. Two, we will sideline dissenting factions in the party. With us in control of many levels of government we can more effectively institute our agenda and bypass the internal party schisms that affect us."

SOV_Socialization_Of_Land: "Socialization of Land"
SOV_Socialization_Of_Land_desc: "Much of Russia's land was not under control of common people for centuries. The Agrarian Project of SRs shall be finally realized in practice, as it was meant to be. While experts warn that this could have adverse effects and even cripple our already struggling agricultural sector, we will go ahead with this, damn the consequences."

SOV_Amnesty_To_Political_Prisoners: "Amnesty to Political Prisoners"
SOV_Amnesty_To_Political_Prisoners_desc: "Russia's prisons are crushed by the weight of political prisoners swept up in the revolutionary fervor that followed our ascent to power. These men are largely old men and young boys who cannot hope to resist our rule now, even if they wanted to. To relieve the pressure on our strained system we will release the least dangerous of those political prisoners. While explicit counterrevolutionaries will of course be excluded from this amnesty by doing this not only will we free up cells for more deserving criminals but we will win more sympathy with the people, who will see this more as an act of kindness than anything else."

SOV_Valkyrie_Of_Russian_Revolution: "The Valkyrie of Russian Revolution"
SOV_Valkyrie_Of_Russian_Revolution_desc: "Maria Spiridonova, the leader of our state is called the Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution by some newspapers and politicians."

SOV_Labour_Republic: "Labor Republic"
SOV_Labour_Republic_desc: "The narodnik concept of the structure of Russia as a Labor Republic of the Soviets is the most successful variant of the development of our Motherland. Despite the fact that the concept was corrupted by the Bolsheviks, its true meaning is in the people's power and representation through the Soviets, and not in the power of a single party."

### NEP focuses ###
SOV_Premier_Bukharin: "[GetRadSocParty] Victorious"
SOV_Premier_Bukharin_desc: "The [GetRadSocParty], the new cover for the Bolsheviks, has taken control over Russia. This is a 180 degree turn from the regime of the previous years and just a few months ago would've been seen as impossible. However, the impossible has indeed happened. Lenin gave his life for the Revolution and now the Revolution is complete, without Lenin and totally within the bounds of the Law. What happens next is going to shape the history of Russia and the world for generations..."

SOV_Milestone_Highway_To_Socialism: "Milestone Highway to Socialism"
SOV_Milestone_Highway_To_Socialism_desc: "Now that Bukharin and Rykov have assumed power, it becomes imperative to implement the necessary reforms. These reforms will be initiated and emanate from the Central Committee of the party and the so-called Politburo, which is the key governing body of the Party. Members of the Politburo will directly occupy positions in the government of the Republic. The program outlined in Bukharin's \"Stolbovaya Doroga k Sotsialismu (Milestone Highway to Socialism)\", which he intends to present at the upcoming congress, will shape the trajectory of the country for many years to come."
SOV_Confide_In_Kamenev: "Confide in Kamenev"
SOV_Confide_In_Kamenev_desc: "Lev Kamenev, through a most unfortunate turn of events, found himself as the chair of the Mossoviet when Denikin and Kornilov assumed control of the city. Consequently, Lev was incarcerated alongside other Moscow Bolsheviks, such as Bukharin and Rykov, and emerged from prison alongside them to join the 'Workers' Party' established by Bukharin. Throughout this period, Lev Kamenev maintained a close relationship with Zinoviev, the leader of the \"Left Communists\", and served as his loyal follower. Thus, it is fair to say that Kamenev was perhaps the most leftist member of the party and would play a crucial role in reestablishing contact with the comrades in Petrograd."
SOV_Old_Moscow_Familiars: "Old Moscow Familiars"
SOV_Old_Moscow_Familiars_desc: "Girsh Brilliant, more commonly known as Grigory Sokolnikov, was a man with whom Nikolay Bukharin embarked on revolutionary activities when they united the gymnasium circles in Moscow in 1906 into a unified social-democratic student organization. Sokolnikov enjoyed exceptional prestige among his peers due to his gravitas, erudition, and thoughtful approach to his work. Bukharin, on the other hand, was universally beloved, infecting all with his boundless cheerfulness, buoyancy, and faith in the cause. Sokolnikov has consistently aligned himself with the right within the party, making his collaboration with Bukharin unsurprising. However, Sokolnikov opposes further empowerment of kulaks, yet his presence on our side is essential."
SOV_Voluntary_Cooperation: "Voluntary Cooperation"
SOV_Voluntary_Cooperation_desc: "The cooperative forms of farming and work should become much more popular among our population in order to prevent citizens becoming too rich or individualistic. Moreover, cooperation will help the Smychka and build up a stable state."

SOV_Support_Proletkult_Intelligentsia: "Proletkultist Cultural Revolution"
SOV_Support_Proletkult_Intelligentsia_desc: "During our clandestine struggle in Russia, a number of Bolsheviks affiliated with the 'Vpered' group led by Alexander Bogdanov ventured abroad to contribute to the realization of the proletarian cultural revolution within the Third Internationale. Following the triumph of the revolution, several of these individuals, including Bogdanov himself, Lunacharsky, and Gastev, returned to their homeland. It is fitting to designate one of these individuals to serve as the People's Commissar for Enlightenment, entrusting them with the task of introducing Proletkult into our nation."
SOV_Soyuzmultfilm: "Soyuzmultfilm"
SOV_Soyuzmultfilm_desc: "We have created an animation studio composed of talented individuals from all over the union, as well as with the support and expertise of foreign defectors from Japan and the USA, built from the nationalized carcass of the two largest animator groups based in Moscow. Rebuilt and rebranded, this new, state-run institution is expected to bring the joys of Socialist thought to the masses, and especially to our youth, through pre-approved programming and quality animation. Already, Soyuzmultfilm has begun to touch the hearts of thousands across Russia as masters of the craft such as Ivan Ivanov-Vano, Vladimir Suteev, Olga Khodataeva, Vladimir Polkovnikov, Leonid Amalrik, the Brumberg sisters, and many others work endlessly to churn out new media for the masses to consume. With these enlightening, entertaining hand-drawn animations being churned out, we shall entice and educate the masses with the true glory of Socialist artistic expression."


SOV_Party_Of_The_New_Type: "Party of the New Type"
SOV_Party_Of_The_New_Type_desc: "The Popular Front, which we were not a part of, committed a grave error by allowing us to ascend to power through the Soviet Congress. Like 20 years ago, this misstep will cost them their position. We shall not deviate from Lenin's teachings, and we shall resolutely advocate for a novel type of party - one that unequivocally represents the interests of the working class. Having secured a majority in the Soviets, we shall easily vanquish the opposition - the revisionist Mensheviks and the Narodniks."

SOV_Preserve_Popular_Front: "Preserve the Popular Front"
SOV_Preserve_Popular_Front_desc: "The Popular Front, having spearheaded the revolution, is comprised of our steadfast comrades: Soviet deputies and members of socialist parties who are unwavering in their commitment to a brighter future for our nation. Unlike the misstep of our party during the civil war, we shall henceforth eschew the dictatorial rule of a single party, which proved disastrous to the nation. As a consequence of this error, Lenin met his demise, and other socialist elements were coerced into aligning with the deceitful White Guards.\n\nYes, other parties may not be immune to our errors, but we shall now exercise caution in our actions for the greater good of the entire nation."

SOV_Democratic_Centralism: "Principle of Democratic Centralism"
SOV_Democratic_Centralism_desc: "The concept of democratic centralism was first introduced in Lenin's seminal work, \"The State and Revolution\", published in 1917. Under the principle of democratic centralism, the resolutions adopted by the Supreme Congress of Soviets become binding on all lower-level councils. These local councils are themselves elected by the populace and subsequently send delegates to the Supreme National Congress.\n\nIn terms of governance, democratic centralism embodies a fusion of two principles: democracy, which entails the sovereignty of the working class and the ability of citizens to elect their representatives, and centralization, which implies the existence of a unified leadership structure and strict discipline. Additionally, it manifests itself through the integration of diverse powers within a single entity, rejecting the notion of separation of powers."

SOV_Control_The_Unions: "Control the Unions"
SOV_Control_The_Unions_desc: "We currently have a parallelism of unions and the administrative organs, an issue which needs to be remedied. While this we will also have to change the essence of unions, from 'trade' unions to 'production' unions. The newly created administrative-economic apparatus will be democratically elected by the workers, with broad mass assemblies of all economic-production measures."
SOV_Entrust_VSNKh_To_Shlyapnikov: "Entrust VSNKh to Shlyapnikov"
SOV_Entrust_VSNKh_To_Shlyapnikov_desc: "From the outset, Aleksander Shlyapnikov championed the idea of significantly expanding the role of trade unions in organizing the national economy. His approach, known as \"syndicalist lean\", diverged from the program formulated by Nikolay Bukharin, who advocated for state control over trade unions. Mikhail Tomsky, another influential trade-unionist, also supported the view that trade unions should remain independent but be regulated by the state. Shlyapnikov's ideas gained traction in the Third International, suggesting that his vision could potentially benefit workers if implemented in Russia. It is worth considering whether his expertise could be trusted to guide the country towards anarcho-syndicalism."

SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation: "Fight Bureaucratisation"
SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation_desc: "The fight against the bureaucracy is a constant struggle, something Lenin already well understood. We will have to continue Comrade Lenin's fight against the bureaucracy, before it can take hold like a tick and drain our state's lifeblood of liberty and equality; something we must avoid at all costs. We will also have to train a new class of truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the scores of reactionary swine that still infest our administration."

# something about rejection of rights to self-determination
# democratic centralism is for RYKOV vs 
# Rykov loves village, he does not hate it

# Rykov focuses:
SOV_Premier_Rykov: "Premier Rykov"
SOV_Premier_Rykov_desc: "We have elected the Old Bolshevik Aleksey Rykov to lead the party. While some in the party, like Rykov's friend Tomsky, wanted to federalize the state and give the Republics more autonomy, Rykov himself has pledged to consolidate power more under the Premier and resist the turn to Syndicalism that has permeated the left. This has led some to worry that Rykov seeks to become a dictator but Rykov stresses that the state can have a centralized authority and follow the democratic socialist process as well. Time will tell if he can uphold his promise."
SOV_Complete_Nationalization: "Complete Nationalization"
SOV_Complete_Nationalization_desc: "If you give capitalists an inch they will take a mile. We cannot allow private ownership within our state. We have already done so much to destroy the bourgeois, to let them reestablish themselves would be criminal. We shall nationalize all business within Russia. Everything from the grandest mines to the smallest store will be seized for the betterment of us all."
SOV_Rykovs_Selkhoznalog: "Rykov's Selkhoznalog"
SOV_Rykovs_Selkhoznalog_desc: "Rykov is a staunch advocate for the interests of the nation's rural population, comprising millions of individuals. Under Rykov's leadership, a novel agricultural taxation system will be implemented, featuring unprecedentedly low tax burdens for farmers, enabling them to amass greater wealth and engage in trade in both goods and currencies."
SOV_Involve_Peasants_Into_Socialism: "Involve Peasants Into Socialism"
SOV_Involve_Peasants_Into_Socialism_desc: "The peasantry is a class of capitalists, as Marx would have it, a notion with which we vehemently disagree. This characterization may be applicable to the well-off kulaks, who shun collective labor and engage in hiring practices. We propose an alternative vision of voluntary peasant cooperation, which we intend to foster through Agitprop rather than coercive measures. Our aim is to demonstrate that working under the auspices of a kulak is far more oppressive than laboring together for own benefit."
SOV_Tax_the_Vodka: "Tax the Vodka"
SOV_Tax_the_Vodka_desc: "Aleksey Rykov is an unwavering advocate of abstinence from alcoholic beverages, having been a lifelong teetotaler himself. He firmly believes that alcohol prohibition is beneficial for the well-being of the nation, although immediate implementation of such measures may be impractical.\n\nPrior to enforcing such drastic regulations, it is essential to introduce substantial taxes and excise duties on vodka and other spirits, making it more expensive and less accessible to the general public."
SOV_Achieve_Level_Of_Ford: "Achieve the Level of Ford"
SOV_Achieve_Level_Of_Ford_desc: "Rykov, despite his apparent predilection for the \"rural\", is not opposed to the fundamental expansion of heavy industry. This expansion is integral to his vision of achieving \"Ford-level\" development."
SOV_Cultivation_Of_A_Communist_Man: "Cultivation of a Communist Man"
SOV_Cultivation_Of_A_Communist_Man_desc: "We construct a new 'America' from post-revolutionary Russia, an America imbued with a proletarian spirit, devoid of influential businessmen, and without the trappings of parliamentary democracy. To achieve this, all necessary measures are already implemented. The last part is a gradual cultivation of an almost idealized \"communist man\"."


SOV_Victory_Of_Old_Bolsheviks: "The Old Bolsheviks"
SOV_Victory_Of_Old_Bolsheviks_desc: "The veterans of the revolutionary struggle and old party comrades, known as the Society of Old Bolsheviks, have managed to regain enough power and influence within our structures to achieve victory in the latest Congress."
SOV_Fight_Rural_Bourgeoisie: "Fight Rural Bourgeoisie"
SOV_Fight_Rural_Bourgeoisie_desc: "The implementation of the New Economic Policy resulted in the emergence of a thriving rural bourgeoisie, a class that poses a threat to the revolution. It is necessary to impose taxation on the prosperous peasants, known as kulaks, and initiate the process of gradual collectivization of the economy. This process should be implemented with caution and paced, in order to ensure that the middle-class and poor peasants ultimately assume a dominant position in rural areas."
SOV_Rapprochement_Bolsheviks: "Rapprochement with Communists"
SOV_Rapprochement_Bolsheviks_desc: "For many years Kamenev maintained ties with the RCP's overseas group, the group of Zinoviev, his old associate. Although much was now dividing the party, there were still moderates among the Bolsheviks, such as Kalinin and Sokolnikov. And Zinoviev himself, despite his dictatorial tendencies, might have agreed to reform the united party."
SOV_Party_Unity: "Party Unity"
SOV_Party_Unity_desc: "The time of power struggle between parties is over. We shall work together to benefit all: our parties shall unite under the red banner of socialism and people's will!"
SOV_Technocratic_Leadership: "Russia of Technocrats"
SOV_Technocratic_Leadership_desc: "It is necessary to promote the most talented cadres into the leadership of the party and the country. Only in this way will we be able to build a truly socialist party and bring the coming of communism closer!"


SOV_Workers_Opposition: "Triumph of the Workers' Opposition"
SOV_Workers_Opposition_desc: "The Workers' Opposition has taken power in the Politburo and now is ready to turn [ROOT.GetRulingParty] into a truly proletarian organisation."
SOV_Premier_Shlyapnikov_desc: "Aleksandr Shlyapnikov, prominent Trade Unionist, has been elected to lead the Party and State. As a Trade Unionist many consider his loyalties to the Bolshevik orthodoxy suspect. Few however can doubt his true convictions. He is an avid supporter of the democratic process, the trade unions who form his powerbase and the factory workers who make them up. With him at the head of the Soviet state there is little doubt that a new, kinder regime is on the way in, a severe change from the Dictatorship of the Proletariat spoken of by Lenin and Marx."
SOV_Premier_Tomsky_desc: "Mikhail Tomsky, prominent Trade Unionist, has been elected to lead the Party and State. As a Trade Unionist many consider his loyalties to the Bolshevik orthodoxy suspect. Few however can doubt his true convictions. He is an avid supporter of the democratic process, the trade unions who form his powerbase and the factory workers who make them up. With him at the head of the Soviet state there is little doubt that a new, kinder regime is on the way in, a severe change from the Dictatorship of the Proletariat spoken of by Lenin and Marx."
SOV_Strengthen_Trade_Unions: "Strengthen Trade Unions"
SOV_Strengthen_Trade_Unions_desc: "Without the trade unions attaining more power in a system originally designed without that in mind the workers shall never know true freedom. That is why Premier Tomsky announced a set of new laws designed to increase the power and privilege the cooperatives, syndicates and other forms of industrial unity may have in the Socialist Republic."
SOV_Industrial_Democracy: "Industrial Democracy"
SOV_Industrial_Democracy_desc: "The vision many in recent decades have fought so hard for across the entire globe, the ideal of Industrial Democracy, in which the people can exercise their democratic rights through the unions controlling the economy, has been so far foreign to the governing echelons of Russia. Yet this syndicalist dream has swayed the delegates and chairmen of the various soviet bodies inside our Republic, allowing our faction to slowly usher in a true working man's paradise."
SOV_Worker_Control: "Workers' Control"
SOV_Worker_Control_desc: "In order to significantly enhance labor productivity at our enterprises, it is imperative that we implement work control measures at all factories and manufacturing facilities across the country without delay. There should be no room for bureaucracy or self-serving directors. As Comrade Lenin once stated, \"Accounting and control is the primary economic responsibility of everyone. The mandate for this falls squarely on the shoulders of the Council of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, as well as every consumer society, union, supply committee, factory committee, or workers' control body.\""
SOV_Negotiate_With_New_Life: "Negotiate with the Novozhiznentsy"
SOV_Negotiate_With_New_Life_desc: "The Novozhiznentsy were a group of Menshevik internationalists who took their name from the daily socio-literary newspaper they published, \"Novaya Zhizn\" (New Life). Maxim Gorky served as the editor of this publication, and prominent figures such as Sukhanov and Lunacharsky were among those who contributed to its pages. Novaya Zhizn became the most widely read daily in Petrograd.\n\nAt present, this small faction has largely coalesced around Solomon Lozovsky, who serves as the leader of Soviet trade unions. It may be advantageous to align him with the true workers' party."
SOV_Adopt_Shteinbergs_Idea: "Adopt Shteinberg's Idea"
SOV_Adopt_Shteinbergs_Idea_desc: "Isaak Shteinberg, a key economic and political ideologue of the Left SR movement has great ideas in term of organizing a syndicalist system of labor. We must acknowledge this and invite him to our government."

SOV_Hypercentralization: "Hypercentralization"
SOV_Hypercentralization_desc: "We should not only centralize our state and economy, we should ensure that is all in control of the Party and government. Without total control, we will soon face inefficiencies that will prevent our economy from becoming a leading industrial power."

SOV_Creating_An_Efficient_Economy: "Creating an Efficient Economy"
SOV_Creating_An_Efficient_Economy_desc: "Or mass nationalization has been done haphazardly and without much thought. Red tape smothers many factories and confusing spheres of authority has caused some infighting between various Commissariats. Bad actors within the system have exploited this inefficiency for profit and already our economy is feeling the weight of our sagging production. We must trim down on this excess fat if we are to achieve greatness. "

SOV_Centralized_Republic: "Centralized Republic"
SOV_Centralized_Republic_desc: "We have fully centralized the state into our hands. While in other people's view this may be seen as authoritarian and dictatorial. However, within our nation we have proven our good intentions. The people work in the factories, owned and provided for by the state, go to homes paid for by the state and live in cities maintained by the state. The state oversees all and makes sure all of its children live long, happy and healthy. The people have a direct stake in working as well since the more they work the more the state can invest back into them. It truly is a workers paradise."

SOV_The_Workers_Peasants_Constitution: "The Workers' & Peasants' State"
SOV_The_Workers_Peasants_Constitution_desc: "We have founded a Republic based and run by the Workers and Peasants. The typical republic quickly devolves into an elitist and populist hellscape where the worker toils for years with no hope of liberation. In our new Republic however the people are and will always be the driver of political force. The power pyramid goes from the bottom up and not the top down. Many figure that this populist slant will leave us vulnerable to ideologues but we know the people will not be so easily seduced by words alone. Our struggles prove that the people demand action, something only we can give them and they reward us handsomely."


SOV_Profintern: "Profintern"
SOV_Profintern_desc: "Lozovsky has suggested to create Profintern - a new economic international agency that will help to improve economies of all socialist countries in the world."

SOV_Cheap_Housing: "Cheap Housing"
SOV_Cheap_Housing_desc: "We should build cheap houses for our citizens and provide the whole country with good affordable housing."

SOV_Premier_Kuznetsov: "Premier Kuznetsov"
SOV_Premier_Kuznetsov_desc: "Premier Bukharin is dead! In an emergency meeting the Central Committee has elected Alexey Kuznetsov to lead the nation. Kuznetsov's election heralds a radical shift away from the ideals of Bukharin. Kuznetsov's positions include abolishing the Union and centralizing all the Republics into autonomies under the Russian state and opposing the NEP, the brainchild of Bukharin. Some condemn him as a reactionary and as a Russian supremacist but that seems to have not done anything to dissuade his supporters. Nevertheless with Kuznetsov at the helm the Union is careening down an uncertain path that will lead it to evermore greatness or destroy it entirely."

SOV_Premier_Ryutin: "Premier Ryutin"
SOV_Premier_Ryutin_desc: "With Premier Bukharin dead the Central Committee has elected Martemyan Ryutin as the new Premier. While a supporter of Bukharin, Ryutin also maintains a closer ideological relation to Lenin. This signifies a break from the strict Bukharinist that many expected the Party to tow while still not alienating Bukharin's many followers and allies within the Party. Some of Ryutin's principle pillars are the opposition to the radical industrialization of the nation which he claims to have had a severe effect on the economic life of the peasant. While he does still support industrialization he instead wishes it to be more measured than the rapid growth many other leaders hope for. However, with many of our neighbors both hostile and fully industrialized worries persist that a slower path to industrialization will leave us vulnerable should the Germans come."

SOV_Premier_Kosygin: "Premier Kosygin"
SOV_Premier_Kosygin_desc: "The fall of Premier Bukharin has required a new vote to who would take over. This has had the expected result of pushing Aleksey Kosygin to lead the nation. As a staunch Bukharinist and a close friend and ally of the former Premier, few doubted his nomination was anything less than inevitable. Under his rule it is expected the nation will continue to reform along the path laid by Bukharin."

SOV_Cooperative_Economy: "Cooperative Economy"
SOV_Cooperative_Economy_desc: "A nation needs an economy that works for all and not the few at the top. That is why we will continue to form our new economy around the cooperatives that have sprung up on Bukharin's insistence. With everybody working in tandem with each other and profiting equally from their labor they will be further motivated to even greater heights of prosperity. Hand in hand we shall make the Soviet economy the greatest in the world!"

SOV_Strengthen_Khozraschyot_System: "Strengthen Khozraschyot System"
SOV_Strengthen_Khozraschyot_System_desc: "The Khozraschyot System is a contradiction in that it's both a revolutionary institution while also being common sense. With the State footing the bill for much of our industry they have been allowed to grow beyond their means. This has left factories underutilized and inefficient. We shall begin to roll back our subsidies and oversight to force business to reel itself back in. This will lead to a certain amount of businesses' shuttering as their model collapses without the blank check given to them by the government but that is for the best. It's like culling the herd. The sick and weak must die for the rest of us to grow stronger."

SOV_Capitalism_In_City: "Capitalism in City?"
SOV_Capitalism_In_City_desc: "A truly radical proposition has come before us for approval. It proposes that we allow some large cities within our nation, the ones recommended being Moscow and Petrograd, to practice measured capitalism outside our State run apparatus. These cities, termed as Free Economic Zones, will be used to entice investment from foreign companies while our strict oversight maintains said pollution remains confined to these cities. Some within our party have pushed for this for some time. They claim outside investment will only boost our economy to higher heights. Meanwhile the rest of the Party has reacted severely to this. They claim this is a naked attempt to undercut the Revolution and everything it stands for. They argue introducing capitalism, no matter how ‘measured' , will just give the international bourgeoisie a toehold in our nation to undermine our government and encourage counterrevolution. Despite their protests however the proposal has been passed, now we wait to see if their predicted apocalypse comes to pass. "

SOV_Full_Market_Socialism: "Full Market Socialism"
SOV_Full_Market_Socialism_desc: "With the radical economic changes having been instituted as of late we have moved closer than ever to instituting Market socialism. This differs as the government will step back from all non-labor based jobs like those in the service industry. These industries will be allowed to self regulate and operate but still be publicly owned. The profits from such ventures will be given back to the employees or reinvested into social programs."

SOV_Allow_Urban_Cooperatives: "Allow Urban Cooperatives"
SOV_Allow_Urban_Cooperatives_desc: "Before now most of the cooperatives within our nation were farmers co-ops based in the countryside. However, many in the factories and cities of our nation have begun to attempt to form cooperatives of their own. Before then they have been approved on a case by case basis for various reasons. However, now with our economy in full swing we have deemed the time right to extend the cooperative system into the cities as well. Factories, public transportation and shops and stores will all be able to unite into cooperatives to better manage themselves and return the workers power to their workplace."

SOV_Bukharinist_Platform: "Bukharin's Cult of Personality"
SOV_Bukharinist_Platform_desc: "Premier Bukharin was a crusader for the people! A close confidant of Lenin, standard bearer of the Revolution after Lenin's death and the vanguard of the Party for its existence since the Civil War we shall honor him like he deserves. We shall raise him to the equal status of Soviet Hero of the People and explain to everybody just how critical he was in them acquiring the freedoms they now enjoy. Even now, after death he watches over the Revolution and guides it forwards to its inevitable conclusion, the unification of the World Proletariat."

SOV_Peoples_Economy: "People's Economy"
SOV_Peoples_Economy_desc: "With our economy humming along we have hard numbers to prove that our economic theories have real legs to stand on. When we first came to power few expected our success. We were said to be naive idealists whose failure will give ‘more sensible' ideas the opportunity to take the limelight. Their predictions have now however been proven to be manifestly false. The people are prosperous, our economy rivals any other on the planet and Soviet goods are exported across the world to be eagerly bought by those who marvel at the ingenuity of the Soviet Worker. With the success of our Revolution, comrades across the globe are encouraged that they will be able to bring the Revolution to their homes as well."

SOV_Peoples_Enterprises: "People's Enterprises"
SOV_Peoples_Enterprises_desc: "As part of our radical economic program we have allowed private business ownership within the state system. This has been a major risk as it could have easily inspired latent reactionary capitalist retaliation. However, our system of People's Enterprises has worked wonders. People own their business and keep a portion of the profits while handing the rest over to the local cooperative. This cooperative then distributes it to needy businesses or invests in local social wellbeing programs like homeless shelters. This has both stimulated economic growth and rejuvenated the decaying cityscapes that dotted our nation."

SOV_Leninist_Platform: "Leninist Platform"
SOV_Leninist_Platform_desc: "We have stuck to the Path of Lenin and it has paid dividends. Our people are happy, our nation prospers and the Revolution has never been stronger. When Lenin was shot dead in the dark days of 1918 many feared his cause, the cause of the People, was to be forever crushed under the heavy boot of reaction. However Premier Ryutin has made him proud as the inheritor to the Revolution. By merging the ideas of Bukharin and Lenin he has formed the perfect brand of socialism which has finally had its chance to prove itself on the world stage. As we grow ever more powerful under the band of Leninist-Bukharinism the forces of international reaction cower in fear. Our success has emboldened their people to take the rights they are owed and the Revolution grows ever closer to home."

SOV_The_Union_For_People: "The Union For People"
SOV_The_Union_For_People_desc: "Our Union is a Union for all people, not just Russians. We seek not to dominate like the Germans or to exploit like the Americans or British. Instead we will not stop until all people are equal to each other and no man can dominate another. While the worldwide proletariat will get their liberation in due time at their own hands or ours, we first must focus on the internal sphere. Russophilia within the Union is rampant with many Russians feeling that, as the largest component of the Union, they deserve to dominate it. To counter this we will allow talented men from the other Republics to rise to public positions of prominence and show to the world and our people that this is not a Russian union, but a Union of Equals, a Union of People."

SOV_Soviet_Middle_Class: "Soviet Middle Class"
SOV_Soviet_Middle_Class_desc: "The Middle Class is the cornerstone to a consumer economy like ours. Until now we had a modest middle class with most people falling into the classification of poor laborer or the destitute. We must stimulate the growth of the middle class to stimulate the growth of the economy. We will institute a universal basic income, raise the minimum wage and start a program to house all of the Union's people. With their basic needs met people can focus on luxuries like vacations and more importantly, social spending at places like restaurants and shops."

SOV_Enrich_Yourself: "Enrich Yourself!"
SOV_Enrich_Yourself_desc: "Socialism should not require poverty. To many the idea of a rich socialist seems to be an oxymoron. However, within our nation we have slowly grown a new class of wealthy people. However, these people are different from their compatriots in other nations in that they know the value of community and philanthropy. Not only will wealth caps make sure they do not accrue too large a hoard, but their constant donations to their local areas and to social programs has kept them well off, but not moguls like existed in the West. This shows the true power of our state. Not only have we shaped a compassionate and egalitarian economy, but we have also tamed the most reactionary of classes, the wealthy."

SOV_Russian_National_Syndicalism: "Russian National-Syndicalism"
SOV_Russian_National_Syndicalism_desc: "Our nation has adopted Premier Kuznetzov's ideas of National Syndicalism. The central tenet of this belief is the idea of subjecting the various Republics of the Union into autonomies under Russia, a National Syndicate as it were. This has angered the minorities within the Union and has led many of the Republics to threaten to secede. We know our cause is righteous. We can overcome them, we will overcome them. Let them shout until they are blue in the face, it can't change the future."

SOV_Oppose_Unionists: "Oppose Unionists"
SOV_Oppose_Unionists_desc: "The Union is a weak thing. The Republics are all equal in the eyes of the law and therefore overlapping authority has left many things unfinished as bureaucrats bicker over who should take precedence. This has crippled any cross-Republic trade as well. Not only that but populists could easily take over a Republic or two and throw the whole Union into chaos! We must expose the weaknesses of the Union to the people and make the case that it needs to be replaced if we are to have true safety and security. This will boost our share of the people's support while also undercutting the many Unionists still within the government."

SOV_Class_Unity: "Class Unity"
SOV_Class_Unity_desc: "The classes have always been stratified. Our Revolution sought to do away with the arbitrary differences and unite the people behind the one Struggle for International Liberation. Then Bukharin came to power. With his proto-capitalist doctrine the old classist lines have once again been forged as the have nots once more toil away for the benefit of the haves. Except this time the upper crust claims to do what it does for the benefit of the lower classes. This naked hypocrisy cannot stand. Just like before we will break the boundaries of class and this time we will make sure they will not form again. We will have total equality and as a result, total class unity, and the people will finally get the freedom from class oppression they so hoped for."

SOV_Syndicalization: "Syndicalization"
SOV_Syndicalization_desc: "We shall begin our first real attempt to reform the political sphere of the Union. Until now most of the workers operated in Soviets with varying degrees of autonomy from the State. This cannot stand. If Russia is to remain the vanguard of the International Proletarian Revolution then it must stand as such united and focused in purpose. To that end we shall abolish the Soviets and instead reconstitute them as Syndicates. These Syndicates will be under stricter state control and more effectively and efficiently manage the areas they oversee. Meanwhile any disputes between the Syndicates will be solved by the State, rather than by the long and complex system of arbitration as with the Soviets."

SOV_Subjugate_The_Republics: "Subjugate the Republics"
SOV_Subjugate_The_Republics_desc: "The Republics have been too independent for too long. They are fickle and can easily fall prey to the petty despotism that comes with populist movements. If we let them go on like they are, it will be a matter of when they tear the nation apart, not if. To that end Kuznetzov has decreed the immediate dissolution of the Republics. This decree has been met with uproarious anger from the Republics and many have begun to openly discuss leaving the Union. This is flagrantly illegal and also, conveniently, just the pretext we need for this new purge. We shall use any means necessary to upend the dissentious Unionist control over the Republics and replace them with men more amicable to our cause. This will be very risky, some will not come quietly and we are already alerting the Army to respond to potential revolts. However the Red of the Revolution comes from the blood shed by the heroes who fought for it. By the end of this deluge there will be plenty more of heroes' blood seeping into the Russian earth."

SOV_Enforce_Autonomisation: "The Course For Autonomization"
SOV_Enforce_Autonomisation_desc: "The Republics enjoy near total autonomy from the Russian homeland. This is a sad state of affairs we will fix, but slowly. We shall begin to whittle away at the edges of Republican autonomy. It will be a slow, agonizing process but it is nevertheless necessary. If we move too quickly they could act now and overpower us but if we wait we can present them a fait accompli. They will be powerless to respond and we can roll them all up at once, without much bloodshed. "

SOV_Subordinate_Unions_To_VTSPS: "Subordinate Unions to the RTsSPS"
SOV_Subordinate_Unions_To_VTSPS_desc: "The Unions have been too independent. While still more controlled than the Republics they have been centers of dissension for ages with the infamous fractiousness of the left largely coming from their ranks. We shall reign in their autonomy under the All Russian Central Congress of Trade Unions. Under Congressional watch the unions will be more motivated to boost productivity, clamp down on dissension and maintain party unity. Not only that but with all the Unions reporting to one central body we can more effectively coordinate their efforts to maximize the economic potential they can bring."

SOV_Dissolve_The_Union: "Dissolve the Union"
SOV_Dissolve_The_Union_desc: "It is done. The Union is dead. Kuznetzov's dream of a unified Russian Syndicate, one united behind him for the efforts of the Revolution, has been made manifest. The Autonomies heed to his beck and call, the Army marches before him ready to destroy the enemies of the Revolution, the workers work doubly as hard as they did before, confident that with every bolt they make, every gun they manufacture, the World Revolution grows ever nearer. At the same time the world trembles in fear as the Russian bear pushes aside her previous decades of inaction and hibernation and wakes once more, angry and ready for vengeance against all those who wish to see her laid low."

SOV_Premier_Zhdanov: "Premier Zhdanov"
SOV_Premier_Zhdanov_desc: "With our dear Premier's death, the responsibility of leading Russia towards full realization of Communism falls to his close confidant and chosen successor - Andrei Zhdanov. A former member of the RKP, Zhdanov abandoned the Zinovievite party over disagreements with their interpretation of the ideological works of Lenin. Eventually, he joined the [GetRadSocParty] and became aligned with the Rykovite wing, becoming the man in charge of the agricultural sector after Aleksey Rykov's election. Now Zhdanov sets one goal before himself and all of Russia, the fulfillment of Rykov's and Lenin's dream through even greater central authority."

SOV_Redefine_Russian_Identity: "Redefine Russian Identity"
SOV_Redefine_Russian_Identity_desc: "While it is true that our administration focused mostly on the well being of ethnic Russians, that doesn't mean we can allow Great Russian chauvinism to hinder the drive towards Communism. If Lenin's dream is to be ever achieved, we must redefine what it means to be a Russian. No longer will it entail an ethnos or an inhabitant of Russia's borders. From now on, a new identity shall rise; a purely Soviet man for a purely Soviet nation."

SOV_Court_Zapadnaya_Faction: "Court the Zadapnaya Gruppa"
SOV_Court_Zapadnaya_Faction_desc: "The national syndicalist faction within the Bukharinist wing of the [GetRadSocParty] may appear to be an unusual alliance with our Premier, Zhdanov. This is especially so when many refer to them as the \"Western faction\", much to the dismay of this highly nationalistic group. However, our leader is well aware of their actions, and has no doubt that his close associate, Kuznetsov, will be able to infuse our Sovietisation project with the much-needed patriotism, as it was long overdue for him to assume control over the trade unions."

SOV_Soviets_Beyond_Nations: "Soviets Beyond Nations"
SOV_Soviets_Beyond_Nations_desc: "Some might think that Andrei Zhdanov's dream of a United Soviet state is nothing new, after all many other parties proposed a federation of Socialist Republics. Yet those people are missing one crucial detail, such unions still uphold the imperialist delusion of separate ethnic groups. In Premier Zhdanov's state we are no longer Russian, Kalmyk, Yakut, Turkmen and a myriad of others. We are Soviet and we are one."

SOV_Enshrine_Rykov_Legacy: "Enshrine Rykov's Legacy"
SOV_Enshrine_Rykov_Legacy_desc: "Rykov was a great man, that much is obvious to anyone who knew Russia from before his times and one after he became our Premier. Yet affirming that fact is not enough for our savior and Lenin's greatest follower. Aleksey Rykov shall be put on the pedestal as the example of what all Soviet people should strive for. A new hero for a new nation, alongside V. I Lenin of course."

SOV_Bureaucrat_Every_House: "A Bureaucrat for Every House"
SOV_Bureaucrat_Every_House_desc: "What does a centralized state need? Bureaucrats, of course. And what does a hypercentralized state need? Even more bureaucrats, loyal ones at that. That's exactly why Premier Zhdanov has decreed that every man and woman shall go through basic administrative training, combined with lessons in socialist theory. Alongside that, every city of at least two thousand people will receive a new administrative office, responsible only before the central authorities in the capital."

SOV_Condemn_Bukharinist_Revision: "Condemn Bukharinist Revision"
SOV_Condemn_Bukharinist_Revision_desc: "Nikolay Bukharin was a fool; the greatest conman our movement has ever seen! He tricked the people of Russia with hollow promises of wealth and prosperity which hid an insidious Capitalist force he directed himself. Andrei Zhdanov, basing his findings upon Rykov's unfinished critiques of the Bukharinist wing, shall expose that truth to the Party as a whole. The legacy of Lenin cannot be spit upon any longer!"

SOV_Final_Nail_NEP: "Final Nail for the NEP"
SOV_Final_Nail_NEP_desc: "Lenin bless Rykov for realizing the errors of the NEP, driving the course of Russia away from the highest form of perversion a social-capitalist ever dreamed of. Sadly, our late leader didn't manage to fully scrub the society clean from the vestiges of the insane contradiction that is Market Socialism. That job now falls to Zhdanov, to every true socialist in Russia, to us. The time of the bourgeois economy is over!"

SOV_Central_Commission_State_Planning: "Central Commission of State Planning"
SOV_Central_Commission_State_Planning_desc: "After we smashed the last remains of the crypto-capitalist NEP, many people inside the Party have wondered what system shall we adopt now. Their fears of an uncertain future were quickly dashed by Premier Zhdanov's announcement of the creation of the Central Commission of State Planning, under his recent protégé Nikolay Voznesensky."

SOV_Logical_Endpoint_Centralist_Doctrine: "Logical Endpoint of the Democratic Centralism"
SOV_Logical_Endpoint_Centralist_Doctrine_desc: "Despite its democratic nature, the democratic centralism principle means that all must subordinate to the supreme Soviet. Our grand leader Zhdanov drew up a plan to finalize the democratic centralist doctrine by forming a new capital region to organize the whole government apparatus inside it. Tsentrograd shall arise and dwarf every city in the world, proving Socialism's might once again!"

SOV_Zhdanovshchina: "Zhdanovshchina"
SOV_Zhdanovshchina_desc: "With Leninism-Rykovism firmly entrenched in the Soviet nation, the time if finally right for Andrei Zhdanov to introduce his own set of ideas into the government. Zhdanovshchina hinges on a simple realization that the world is split dialectically into two competing realities centered around Soviet democracy and the Capitalist imperialism. Thus the Soviet people have an obligation to improve themselves from good to the best and drive this Western Capitalist scum into extinction."

SOV_Judges_Honour: "Judges of Honour"
SOV_Judges_Honour_desc: "With a system so intricate as ours, it is more than certain that deviations from the ideals of Lenin and Rykov will arise. Such lapses must be combated at every step, lest they threaten to tear the Soviet society apart. This is why Premier Zhdanov authorized the creation of a special People's Commissariat, modeled after the revolutionary VChK, dubbed the 'Judges of Honour' by the more zealous Party members. Their main job is to make sure that the Party itself doesn't stray in any way from the ideological purity presented by Andrei Zhdanov. They are also meant to keep the spirit of Soviet patriotism alive among the ordinary citizens, by any means necessary."

SOV_Silence_Bourgeois_Pragmatist_Lean: "Silence the Bourgeois-Pragmatist Lean"
SOV_Silence_Bourgeois_Pragmatist_Lean_desc: "A rot began to creep into our glorious party, the rot of Techno-Pragmatic revisionism. When we dealt with the crypto-capitalist Bukharinists most of the Party believed the struggle for ideological purity to be over. Yet the greatest among us, Andrei Zhdanov, realized the truth of how the Party may rot in the future. All thanks to that traitor Malenkov, who should have been dealt with the very moment he slithered into a prominent government office after Premier Rykov's death. The time has finally come to cut out the cancer corrupting the hearts and minds of the Party."

SOV_New_Socialist_Reality: "A New Socialist Reality"
SOV_New_Socialist_Reality_desc: "A new Soviet man requires a new Socialist reality to be built for him. That's exactly why Premier Zhdanov initiated the campaign of support for native Soviet artists in forming a new 'Socialist Realism' style, opposed to the rootless cosmopolitanism of the imperialist world. Come, those who see the true beauty revealed to us by Lenin, Rykov and Zhdanov, let us raise a bonfire for West's vanity!"

SOV_All_Reaching_Party_Apparatus: "All-Reaching Party Apparatus"
SOV_All_Reaching_Party_Apparatus_desc: "A truly centralized state uniting all the Soviet people beckons for a unified guiding hand, one in the form of a new ever present party. Premier Zhdanov knows that, and so do his allies scattered across many separate political forces and movements inside our republic. The time has come to unite them all into one entity with powers not yet seen, the All-Union Socialist Party shall arise immediately."

SOV_No_Progress_Without_Ideology: "No Progress without Ideology"
SOV_No_Progress_Without_Ideology_desc: "Our great leader knows one simple truth: we must never allow ourselves to fall into the technocratic perversions formerly championed by Malenkov. Socialism in itself is a science and Leninism-Rykovism is chief among the highest forms of these exact and quantifiable schools of study. Thus, it is only natural that no progress can ever be made without considering the rich and deep impact of Socialism upon technology. With ideology in one hand and science in the other, the Soviet nation shall conquer reality itself!"

SOV_Their_Dream_Forged_Reality: "Their Dream Forged into Reality"
SOV_Their_Dream_Forged_Reality_desc: "All of the people doubting that Andrei Zhdanov could ever achieve his grand vision are once and for all proven wrong. Starting as a disgruntled RKP member and sincer rising to the highest position in the Soviet nation, our dear leader has managed to implement everything Rykov, and thus Lenin, ever wished for. The citizens of our proud Socialist Republic are overjoyed, for they know the Lenin-Rykov-Zhdanov party line is guiding them towards a bright future."

SOV_Decentralisation_Of_Syndicates: "Decentralisation of Syndicates"
SOV_Decentralisation_Of_Syndicates_desc: "As of now the various Syndicates are all coordinated through the All-Russian Congress of Factory Committees. The VSFK also manages various governmental duties like ratifying treaties and approving bills. In short, the VSFK is exceptionally powerful. If a demagogue were to take over the body then the Revolution would be threatened if not totally reversed. To combat their power we will break off many of the local Syndicates, making them answerable to regional bodies rather than directly to the Congress. This will anger many reactionaries within the Congress hoping to undermine all that we have achieved, but they can rage all they want, time marches on regardless."

SOV_Cooperative_Agrarain_Economy: "Cooperative Agrarian Economy"
SOV_Cooperative_Agrarain_Economy_desc: "Many of the farms of Russia sell their crops to the state or to their communities on an individual basis. This has left them vulnerable to price gouging and forces them to race to the bottom in price to beat out their competition. By organizing the farms into broad cooperatives they can sell their crops to the coop at a fair price which will distribute it around as needed. This will become the new foundation of our economy, better than the adhoc agricultural system we staggered with before."

SOV_System_Of_Trade_Unions_And_Soviets: "System of Syndicates and Soviets"
SOV_System_Of_Trade_Unions_And_Soviets_desc: "According to the core program of the Left SR Party, we shall implement the system, known as Syndicates and Soviets. While the political power will be in the hands of elected Soviets, the economic one will be in the hands of elected Syndicates. This will both help industrialize our country without greatly damaging the peasantry."

SOV_Congress_Of_Labor_Collectives: "Councils of Labor Collectives"
SOV_Congress_Of_Labor_Collectives_desc: "As our administration continues to morph into its final form we have found a new opportunity to harness the power of public opinion by forming Councils of Labor Collectives. These local unions will vote on matters of both local and national importance. This will give people more of a say in local and national politics and boost the critically lagging civic pride within Russia."

SOV_Separation_Of_Soviet_Powers: "Separation of Soviet Powers"
SOV_Separation_Of_Soviet_Powers_desc: "Most of the power within our government is centralized in a few key positions and bodies. This was done for expediency as we set up our new administration. However, with the situation stabilized we shall begin to delegate these privileges out to other ministries and positions. With this delegation we will give the government the robustness to withstand the subversion of the right and counterrevolutionaries along with the populism that so frequently leads lofty states such as our astray."

SOV_Soviet_Democracy: "Soviet Democracy"
SOV_Soviet_Democracy_desc: "We have achieved a unique system of state. Instead of our ruler ruling uncontested like in Mitteleuropa or the Entente or relying on reactionary elements of society to pull our strings like in many capitalist ‘democracies' across the world we have achieved a Peoples State. Across our nation people vote in elections to choose delegates who directly execute their will. Cut off from the temptation of international capital they strive for the best Russia can be, untainted by corruption. What taint of corruption does occasionally seep through the cracks is quickly extracted before it can poison the entire system. The people love us, and we love them back."

SOV_Creation_Of_Ethnic_Soviets: "Question of Ethnic Soviets"
SOV_Creation_Of_Ethnic_Soviets_desc: "Russia is a land of countless ethnicities from the minor to the major. In our new state some have raised the prospect of forming semi-autonomous Soviets to manage these minorities in the best interest of the state. This does bring risk as Nationalists could take control of them and drive a wedge between themselves and our rule. However, if we try and rule them all from our capital within Russia they may cry oppression and give said nationalists power anyway. Whatever our decision is, we must make it soon."

SOV_Rural_Self_Sufficiency: "Rural Self-Sufficiency"
SOV_Rural_Self_Sufficiency_desc: "Our farms have begun making an excess of product. Already we have warehouses of produce slowly spoiling. To avoid massive waste problems we have begun to encourage locals to use their excess produce to further make their rural communities more self-sufficient. This will lower shipping costs while also reinforcing the community bonds that tie our nation together. "

SOV_Peasant_Russia: "Peasant Russia"
SOV_Peasant_Russia_desc: "Our Peasant Farmers are the backbone of our nation. Most of our people toil in the fields almost thanklessly so that we may eat tomorrow. We will not let their honorable sacrifice go unhonored anymore. We shall raise the ideal of the peasant to a new level of honor and prominence that would've been unthinkable under the previous regime. They will be showered with subsidies as well to make them have to work less hard and make more food for the rest of us. These new honors will go a long way in endearing us to this last, biggest class of Russians."

SOV_System_Of_Soviets: "System of Workers' and Peasants' Soviets"
SOV_System_Of_Soviets_desc: "The System of Workers' and Peasants' Soviets, as outlined by narodnik theory shall remain. There's no need to separate economic and political power and let it be shared by the Supreme Congress."

SOV_Powerful_Tradeunionism: "Powerful Trade Union Movement"
SOV_Powerful_Tradeunionism_desc: "The Workers deserve representation! We have mandated the formation of a series of Trade Unions across the nation. These Unions will manage their workplaces as expected however, unlike the Syndicalists, we won't allow them to elect their own to positions of power without some checks. The people, for all their love of the Revolution and the State, are easily influenced. Just one wrong election can bring the entire Revolution into jeopardy. Of course we won't tell them their elections will be slanted to our preferred candidates but they will."

SOV_Public_Healthcare: "Public Healthcare"
SOV_Public_Healthcare_desc: "Healthcare is a right, just as much as food and shelter. Too many Russians die of easily preventable diseases. We shall establish a People's Soviet of Health to oversee the expansion of the public health sector and handle the financial burdens of such an endeavor in a nation as large as ours. Said burden is decried by opponents as too high to meet. When their children are saved by our doctors and they don't have to pay a single ruble, we will see how loud these sociopaths shout."

SOV_Universal_Education: "Universal Education"
SOV_Universal_Education_desc: "The average Russian has a very low education level, usually just a bit of primary school and in exceptional circumstances, some secondary school as well. However, this cannot remain true. In a world that grows more and more advanced by leaps and bounds every year we cannot afford to lag behind. If we do, then the reactionaries of the world will crush us under their boots. That is why all education will be free and mandatory up to university and college itself will be subsidised so that most people can attend at least some. With a new generation of intelligent and educated citizens we will remain at the cutting edge of society and remain competitive on the world stage. "

SOV_Ensure_Universeal_Employment: "Ensure Universal Employment"
SOV_Ensure_Universeal_Employment_desc: "The New Man should not worry about where his next paycheck will come from. We cannot stand by while many millions of Russians struggle for a single ruble. No, we shall make employment mandatory and available to all. Some point out that our economy is simply not large enough to have enough jobs for every single person, but we shall brush this problem away easily. We shall simply create jobs. A job is a job, no more. As long as it pays then someone will take it. They have to after all."

SOV_Freedom_Of_Socialist_Print: "Freedom of the Socialist Press"
SOV_Freedom_Of_Socialist_Print_desc: "We shall enshrine the freedom of the Socialist press. Those Socialist news outlets in every medium who diligently report the truth to the people will face no interference from Central Authorities. However, those rags who try and defame our every move require a lot of oversight from the government and that will continue just as diligently."

SOV_Abolish_Cheka: "Abolish the [GetChekaName]"
SOV_Abolish_Cheka_desc: "The [GetChekaName] had its uses. It was pivotal in rooting out counterrevolutionary terrorists and controlling the unruly propulace. However, with our policies paying dividends to everybody, resistance to our regime has shrunk to such a degree that the [GetChekaName] are hardly necessary anymore. Some worry about just how the still powerful [GetChekaName] will take this, but we know as loyal Soviets they will recognize the necessity of their dissolution and leave peacefully."

SOV_Question_Of_Kulaks: "Question of the Kulaks"
SOV_Question_Of_Kulaks_desc: "While we have made great strides in breaking up the private property, there are still many who hold onto their estates. These kulaks have however reformed to more faithfully fit the new system, most likely to keep from getting rounded up rather than out of a kindness of their own hearts. Some have suggested we finish what we have begun and strike these remnants down. We can break up their estates and give them to the peasant cooperatives. Others point out that the remaining kulaks are less the exploitative lords overlooking their innumerable peasants that the radicals paint them to be and are instead more or less cooperatives just not under a state appointed leader. They also point out that the system works fine. Such a severe disruption as breaking up the farms could lead to a famine. Nevertheless the decision is ultimately ours to make."

SOV_Welfare_State: "SR Welfare State"
SOV_Welfare_State_desc: "We have formed a robust welfare state. The people rejoice in finally enjoying the fruits of their labor. Meanwhile they don't fear going to the hospital or getting a disease. Such fears plagued our people under the despots of the Tsar and Kerensky. Now however with our public health network expanding and more and more people taking advantage of it, our nation's overall health is rising which in turn raises productivity. All in all, things could not have gone better."

SOV_Socialist_Humanism: "Socialist Humanism"
SOV_Socialist_Humanism_desc: "Many governments prioritise the state over the people. They view their citizens as pawns to be thrown into the woodchipper to make the lines go up and put money in their pockets. Our focus on the people of Russia and improving their lives not only has endeared us to the populace but has shown to the world that focusing on the populace is if not required then highly beneficial. Our economy booms, our military is growing stronger by the day and our industry pumps out more material every day than it did the day before. All of this done by a people who know their government loves them and only acts in their best interests."

SOV_Left_SR_Chekist_Coup: "Chekist Coup"
SOV_Left_SR_Chekist_Coup_desc: "The treacherous politicians tried to dismantle their shield against the enemies of the revolution. This could not have been done by any sane man, any true SR. That must mean that the Party has been corrupted by reactionaries and for who knows for how long. That is why we did what we did. To safeguard the Revolution."

SOV_Crimson_Camarilla: "Crimson Camarilla"
SOV_Crimson_Camarilla_desc: "It would be foolish to reveal ourselves before unprepared masses, ones overwhelmingly disapproving of the reshuffling that went on within the party. That's exactly why our shadow regime, cloaked in darkness yet ready to draw crimson the very moment our position is threatened, must find an acceptable alternative. A public face, nothing more, one that shall ease the revolutionary transition and soothe the people's burdened souls."

SOV_Institutionalize_Terror: "Institutionalize Terror"
SOV_Institutionalize_Terror_desc: "The people are nearly riotous still over our seizure of power. We must secure the regime against counter revolutionaries both within and outside our state. We shall dispatch the [GetChekaName] into the streets to find the instigators of this continued unrest and put an end to their charade of ‘restoring power to the people'. While we do our work the Army will crush what resistance remains. When all goes to plan we should have full compliance within a month or so of the operations beginning. Civilian casualties are projected to be within acceptable boundaries."

SOV_Soviets_Without_Parties: "Soviets Without Parties"
SOV_Soviets_Without_Parties_desc: "The Soviets are critical and solid pillars of our society. To do away with them entirely would bring anarchy. However they have been tainted by counterrevolutionaries in the Party and must be cleansed. Instead the Soviets will work entirely for the benefit of the state, free from all party affiliation while naturally still under close [GetChekaName] surveillance. Dissension can begin at any time so we must remain eternally vigilant. "

SOV_Establish_Osoaviakhim: "Establish Osoaviakhim"
SOV_Establish_Osoaviakhim_desc: "By National Decree we have established the Osoaviakhim. The Organization will be a volunteer militia of sorts which will draft Soviet citizens to fill gaps in various military organizations to allow for more men to be focused on combat operations. These citizens will be chosen by lottery to ensure complete fairness. As we prepare our great struggle we must focus all our military forces on the coming conflagration."

SOV_Bring_Back_The_Draft: "Bring Back the Draft"
SOV_Bring_Back_The_Draft_desc: "The draft was first instituted in our republic in the mid to closing days of the Civil War as the state slowly collapsed and casualties mounted. In the coming war we must prepare for severe casualties as well. We will begin to draft citizens into the Army en masse. This will be deeply unpopular, just as it was during the Civil War, and we predict that we will have to use a fair bit of coercion to get the men to answer the call. However, as our armies advance inexorably forward they will rally under our banners and then we will have no problems finding more eager soldiers for the military of tomorrow."

SOV_War_Against_Oppressors: "War Against Oppressors"
SOV_War_Against_Oppressors_desc: "The time is upon us! We must strike now at the international bourgeois to secure our state forevermore! As long as there are reactionaries on our border we will be at constant risk for subversion and destruction. We will march on until there are none left to oppose us! We will weather every challenge, overcome any losses and defeat any enemy. When all is said and done and the world proletariat is finally free then we will look back on these coming times of strife as a necessary trial, the Final Struggle."

SOV_Left_SR_Countercoup: "Legalist Counter-Coup"
SOV_Left_SR_Countercoup_desc: "The [GetChekaName] coup has plunged the nation into thinly veiled anarchy. State Terror has pitted brother and brother, mother against child and husband against wife. The Russian People are fearful and suspicious of everybody, especially each other. Since we have destroyed the [GetChekaName] and restored sanity to the nation, such suspicion is lifting but still hangs over us like a heavy blanket. We must work to restore order and trust between the people and government and between the people and their neighbors. Without these basic building blocks of society our nation is lost to anarchy."

SOV_Give_Up_Monopoly_On_Power: "Give Up Monopoly On Power"
SOV_Give_Up_Monopoly_On_Power_desc: "The [GetChekaName] consolidated power to an extreme degree leaving the entire state dependent on the executive and his puppet masters. Now that we are in charge we will do away with this. We will restore the previous balance of power by re-delegating key responsibilities to the restored ministries and branches of government. With the government no longer entirely dependent on one man we can act faster and restore the democracy which has long been little more than a facade."

SOV_No_Need_In_Terror: "Abandon Terror"
SOV_No_Need_In_Terror_desc: "Under the [GetChekaName] mass executions of suspected enemies of the state were commonplace. Hundreds died in cities across the nation every day and ammunition was expended in such numbers that in some areas the local [GetChekaName] death squads returned to sabers and clubs to do the deed due to a lack of ammunition. As the story of the [GetChekaName] comes to its merciful close we will also abandon the state sanctioned terror they brought with them. We will loosen the stringent restraints on people's lives, eliminate the death squads entirely and instead restore the local police forces that had for some time now fallen by the wayside."

SOV_Elect_The_New_Chairman: "Elect the New Chairman"
SOV_Elect_The_New_Chairman_desc: "Our mission is complete. The government has been restored, people are learning to trust one another again and the [GetChekaName] have been broken and destroyed in totality. There is no longer any threat of them ever rising again and we have taken steps to make sure any future government never makes the same mistake we did. Now, we have only one mission left: turn over leadership back to the civilian government. While some have entertained the notion of a permanent State of Emergency to rule that idea lasted about as long as a daisy on the tundra. We are here to restore democracy, not destroy it. To finalize the return to normalcy we shall organize a new election for a new chairman, restored to full powers by us."

RUS_Mobilise_Urban_Militias_desc: "The cities have been the heart land of the revolution ever since the beginning, they were the birth ground of it. We will mobilize militias from the cities to serve in the revolution and allow for the spread of it, because if we do not mobilize large swaths of the population fast, the revolution may be crushed by the reactionaries."
RUS_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units: "Krasnaya Gvardiya Units"

RUS_Rally_The_Defectors: "Rally the Defectors"
RUS_Rally_The_Defectors_desc: "Many in the Russian army are dissatisfied with the status quo, which makes them perfect to recruit to the revolution, so they can serve in a true attempt to change the status quo and improve the life of the population and make the army serve the people, not the bankers."

RUS_The_War_Effort: "The War Effort"
RUS_The_War_Effort_desc: "The early days of the revolution have left our military command structure in disarray. Factions and ideological differences have led to a lack of coordination and direction within our land forces.. We will need to organize the revolutionary war effort, as it has been a pure disaster beforehand. We will re-establish much of the bureaucracy and state apparatus which was destroyed in the wake of the failure of the First Civil War. "
RUS_Revolutionary_Indoctrination: "Revolutionary Indoctrination"
RUS_Revolutionary_Indoctrination_desc: "We must establish ideological education programs to ensure our military forces are not only physically strong but also deeply committed to the socialist cause. This will strengthen the revolutionary spirit within our ranks."
RUS_Local_Defense_Militias: "Local Defense Militias"
RUS_Local_Defense_Militias_desc: "Empower local communities to form their own defense militias, adding a layer of decentralized defense. While effective in localized threats, this approach hampers overall strategic coordination."

RUS_Embolden_Local_Commanders: "Embolden Local Commanders"
RUS_Embolden_Local_Commanders_desc: "Encourage local commanders to take initiative on the battlefield. This decentralized approach empowers individual leaders but may lead to conflicting strategies and a lack of overall coordination."
RUS_Land_Requisition_Policy: "Land Requisition Policy"
RUS_Land_Requisition_Policy_desc: "Implement a policy of requisitioning land and resources to sustain our army. This decentralized approach may lead to inefficiencies, but it is a necessary step in securing resources for the revolutionary cause."
RUS_Equipment_Salvaging: "Salvaging Equipment"
RUS_Equipment_Salvaging_desc: "Scour battlefields and depots for salvageable equipment and weapons. Repurpose and refurbish these resources to equip our growing army, maximizing our limited resources."

RUS_Rebuild_The_Red_Army: "Rebuild the Red Army"
RUS_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_desc: "The Red Army will have to be rebuild, if we want to win this revolution. A centralized army proved itself to be a capable fighting force the first time around, it will be a capable one the second time around too, though we should avoid the failures of and mistakes of the first incarnation."
RUS_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_tt: "When the Civil War is over, we will demobilize all Red Guard units."
RUS_Establish_SVR: "Establish the GRU"
RUS_Establish_SVR_desc: "Although Russia had many internal security services, their main purpose was to keep the peace at home, something which is of no use for an army that moves forward far beyond the borders. That's exactly why we need to create a new agency, integrated into and serving the military, to focus on the civilian side of warfare on foreign soil. The time has come to create the Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU for short."
RUS_Centralised_Command: "Centralised Command Structure"
RUS_Centralised_Command_desc: "A centralised command is necessary in a military combat, any other alternative would just result in total disaster, something we need to avoid at all costs. Thus we will aim to create a cohesive military chain of command, to allow for a more effective fighting force."
RUS_The_Second_Red_Army: "The Second Red Army"
RUS_The_Second_Red_Army_desc: "The Red Army will be rebuild, as it was a great display of proletarian power, even if it was defeated at the end. However, the solution is to rebuild the Red Army and learn from its failure, not to reject the Red Army and the principles it was founded on."

RUS_Reorganise_Armament_Production_desc: "The current state of armament production is a pure disaster, we will have to reorganise the armament production and end the chaos in the production chain. Only if we do this we can guarantee that every soldier will have a gun to fight the forces of reaction."
RUS_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps: "The People's Logistics Corps"
RUS_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps_desc: "We will have to properly organize the logistics, to do this we will create the 'People's Logistic Corps,' which will be in charge of the logistics, which will hopefully end the current state of logistics, which in many areas is a total disaster."

RUS_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions_desc: "We will create dedicated artillery battalions, which will serve to break the lines with legions of artillery shells, which will prevent any real counter-attack, at best."
RUS_Local_Workshops: "Local Workshops"
RUS_Local_Workshops_desc: "We will create local workshops all throughout the nation, to allow for local arms production, which is better suited to serve the local situation and needs than a centralized way of organizing the production."
SOV_Rebuild_The_Military_Industrial_Complex: "Rebuild the Military Industrial Complex"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc: "We must be prepared for the fact that in the conditions of war our factories will not be enough. We must rebuild the military-industrial complex so that the production of weapons and heavy industry is our advantage."
SOV_Tanks_For_Revolution: "Tanks For Revolution"

SOV_Military_Research: "Military Research"
SOV_Military_Research_desc: "Without constant study of military doctrine, we will not be able to resist the enemies. Research in the field of military operations will encourage us to adopt new tactics that have not been used on the field before."
SOV_New_Weapon_Designs: "New Weapon Designs"
SOV_New_Weapon_Designs_desc: "Leading scientists in the field of inventing new weapons are working daily on new rifles, pistols and machine guns - the weapons of the proletarians and peasants, thanks to which any army will fall."
SOV_Peoples_Mechanized_Divisions: "People's Mechanized Division"
SOV_Peoples_Mechanized_Divisions_desc: "The People's mechanized divisions will move our military strategy to a new level. Fast-moving and adapted troops will be able to break through the enemy's defense lines and encircle them."

RUS_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya: "Empower the Krasnaya Gvardiya"
RUS_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_desc: "We will need to create a bottom-up form of army, an army which is truly representative of the revolutionary spirit. We will support the democratic election of commanders too, even if it will cause some issues at times, as the local soldiers probably know better who should command them then some people far away from the situation."
RUS_Decentralised_Structure: "Decentralised Structure"
RUS_Decentralised_Structure_desc: "We will further decentralize the revolutionary army of ours, giving every part of the chain considerable autonomy and preventing the higher-ups from being able to dictate to the rest of the chain what they should do and how."

SOV_penal_battalions: "Penal Battalions"
SOV_penal_battalions_desc: "Desperate times call for desperate measures, one of such occasions is the defence of our glorious revolutionary state against foreign reactionaries. While many of the prisoners rounded up after our ascendance to power are absolute scum, some have valuable military experience. It's time to make sure that they shall earn their 'rehabilitation' by serving for the Motherland on the front line, no matter if they want to do so or not."
RUS_Officer_Initiative: "Officer Initiative"
RUS_Officer_Initiative_desc: "Encouraging officer initiative to make their own decisions autonomously will allow for better responses to sudden changes, as they are more knowledgeable about the situation on the ground than some far away higher-ups, who never visited the area properly."
RUS_Small_Unit_Tactics: "Small Unit Tactics"
RUS_Small_Unit_Tactics_desc: "Instead of using masses of troops, using small units allows for us to be far quicker in our attacks and surprise than if we use a large amount of units. This will also give us more easily the element of surprise, than if we use many units."
SOV_Guerilla_Warfare: "Partisan Warfare"
SOV_Guerilla_Warfare_desc: "The Red Guards are primarily volunteers, which means they must be able not only to mobilize quickly and effectively, but also to act behind enemy lines. This will help us create an effective sabotage network in the bosom of enemy troops and will allow us to wage an asymmetric war - with our superiority."
SOV_Militia_Support_Auxiliaries: "Militia Support Auxiliaries"
SOV_Militia_Support_Auxiliaries_desc: "We will not be able to cope without sufficient supply of auxiliary equipment to our forces."
RUS_Partisan_Tactics: "Partisan Tactics"
RUS_Partisan_Tactics_desc: "Train our forces in guerrilla warfare and partisan tactics to counter more organized counter-revolutionary forces. While effective in certain situations, this decentralized approach hinders our ability to engage in conventional warfare."
RUS_Urban_Warfare_Specialists: "Urban Warfare Specialists"
RUS_Urban_Warfare_Specialists_desc: "Specialize Red Guard units in urban warfare tactics. Cities and towns are the battlegrounds of the revolution, and having specialists in navigating urban environments will give us a decisive edge in defensive and offensive operations."

RUS_Officer_Training_Academies_desc: "Our military academies are in many ways still a relic of the past, with most being from the time of the Tsar. We will create a series of new military academies, following the best doctrine, not the most traditional doctrine. Only this way we will create an officer corps, which is truly superior to the ones of the capitalists."
RUS_Professional_Engineer_Corps: "Professional Engineer Corps"
RUS_Professional_Engineer_Corps_desc: "Our army still lacks a proper engineer corps, at least a formalized one. We will change this situation by creating a formal engineer corps, which will be professionally trained in their craft."

RUS_Frunzes_Reform_Plan: "Revolutionary Army of the Masses"
RUS_Frunzes_Reform_Plan_desc: "With the revolution secured, for now, we can focus on other matters. Our General Staff has proposed that we should focus on improving the high command and officer training and generally improve the defence of the army against a possible invasion, a real threat, as the forces of reaction will probably try to end the revolution in the future."
RUS_Expand_The_High_Command: "Expand the High Command"
RUS_Expand_The_High_Command_desc: "The high command will need to be expanded to include many of the best generals we have, who were all able to show their skill in the Second Russian Revolution. Only a high command truly including the best of the best will be able to do intelligent decisions."

We will need to mobilize the entire Soviet population for the upcoming total war, echoing Tukhachevsky's belief in a brutal and bloody conflict fought by the entire population. We will need bodies if we are to win."
RUS_Mass_Breakthroughs: "Mass Breakthroughs"

SOV_Soldier_Armies_desc: "Encouraging officer initiative to make their own decisions autonomously will allow for better responses to sudden changes, as they are more knowledgeable about the situation on the ground than some far away higher-ups, who never visited the area properly.

RUS_Strategic_Exhaustion_Doctrine: "Strategic Exhaustion Doctrine"
RUS_Strategic_Exhaustion_Doctrine_desc: "Adopt the Old Guard's doctrine of strategic exhaustion. Focus on wearing down the enemy through prolonged defense, emphasizing the resilience and endurance of the Red Army."

## Economic Focuses ##
RUS_Revive_Market_Elements: "Revive Market Elements"
RUS_Revive_Market_Elements_desc: "To jumpstart the economy, we will allow limited market activities. Small businesses, artisans, and peasants will be permitted to trade their goods freely. This will stimulate economic activity, encourage entrepreneurship, and provide a buffer against the economic crisis."
SOV_Allow_Small_Traders: "Allow Small Traders"
SOV_Allow_Small_Traders_desc: "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."
SOV_Khozraschyot: "Khozraschyot"
SOV_Khozraschyot_desc: "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."
SOV_Down_With_Nep: "Down with NEP"
SOV_Down_With_Nep_desc: "The NEP is just capitalism in red paint! Bukharin came up with it in an attempt to win over the bourgeois. However the private ownership of land, and the extraction of profits from said land, is not Socialist doctrine. It has alienated us from other left wing parties we could use to boost our power and as such its more of a liability than a strength. We will abandon Bukharin's pseudo-capitalism."
SOV_Down_With_Nep_tt: "§Y[ROOT.GetLeader]:§! will change ideology to §Y$radsoc_communism_subtype$§!"
SOV_Install_Bread_Monopoly: "Install Bread Monopoly"
SOV_Install_Bread_Monopoly_desc: "A government with no concrete control over the food supply may soon find itself being government no more. Our party's leadership is painfully aware of that, and in light of the recent events has outlined an ambitious plan that shall ensure the state cannot ever be challenged on this topic. For a great monopoly on bread, its production, distribution and prices shall be established, binding the very lifeline of Russia within our apparatus and ensuring the [GetRadSocParty] is not rocked by any new situation."
SOV_Tax_The_Peasants: "Tax Forehanded Peasants"
SOV_Tax_The_Peasants_desc: "We must focus our tax code on the more numerous peasant class. While not materially wealthy they have other ways of payment. If money can not be given they can give up a portion of their harvest or, if they have no extra to spare, can work on public projects for a certain amount of time. This rises bile in the more idealistic Bolsheviks' mouths as they see this as just punching down. However focusing on the workers as they suggest would just bankrupt our growing middle class, something that would tank any modern economy."
SOV_Supplant_Private_Sector: "Supplant Private Sector"
SOV_Supplant_Private_Sector_desc: "The private sector, foolishly allowed to grow like a tumor upon the healthy body of Russia, has been Bukharin's greatest folly. For in his blind quest to throw away our entire proud Marxist legacy Comrade Nikolay has made a deal with the devil of capital, in many cases the greatest of devils which is foreign capital. But we say no more! The time has come for the people of Russia to free themselves of the capitalist shackles imposed onto them by whom they trusted with bringing true socialism, it's time to revise the revisionists and launch a grand-scale nationalization campaign."
SOV_Farmers_Instead_Of_Peasants: "Farmers Instead of Peasants"
SOV_Farmers_Instead_Of_Peasants_desc: "While to anybody else a peasant is a farmer we know differently. The Peasants do not own their farms like farmers, they rent them from landlords who barely know what they own. This also means that peasants have little motivation to farm more than they absolutely need. However, if we were to seize the land from the landlords and give them to the people who actually work that land, they could be motivated to not only farm for subsistence, but in excess for the greater good of the people."
SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict: "Fight Urban-Rural Conflict"
SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict_desc: "In our land there is a great struggle between the cities and the countryside, between the developed lands and the deprived farmlands, between factory workers and peasants. One of our first steps in preserving the revolution is to overcome this divide so that we may combine our efforts against the oppressors rather than bickering among ourselves."
SOV_Tax_The_Workers: "Tax the Workers"
SOV_Tax_The_Workers_desc: "Any nation runs on money, even a paradise such as ours. We will put down a tax code focused on the Workers. As the richest of the sympathetic classes we can use them to gain more money while also putting that money to good use in social programs to help them. The taxes won't be as stifling as they were under Kerensky but any taxes will be unpopular. However we have no choice, whether it's this or bankruptcy."


RUS_Form_Gosplan: "Form the Gosplan"
RUS_Form_Gosplan_desc: "In order to complete our economic goals, a planning committee will need to be established by the state. Employing the some of the brightest minds in Russia, Gosplan will greatly enhance our economy."
SOV_Mechanisation: "Mechanisation"
SOV_Mechanisation_desc: "The industrial revolution brought with it many great advancements in productivity as factories and farmlands started to utilise machinery on a grand scale. Yet here in Russia, most labor is done by hand. In order to compete with the capitalists that oppose us at every turn, we must embrace these developments and modernise our economy accordingly."
RUS_Promote_Industrialization: "Promote Industrialisation"
RUS_Promote_Industrialization_desc: "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."
RUS_State_Building_Projects: "Massive State Building Projects"
RUS_State_Building_Projects_desc: "To combat unemployment and stimulate the economy, we will launch massive state-funded construction projects. These projects will include building new cities, factories, and public facilities. They will not only create jobs but also lay the infrastructure needed for future economic growth."
RUS_Heavy_Industry_Development: "Develop Heavy Industry"
RUS_Heavy_Industry_Development_desc: "Heavy industry is crucial for a strong socialist state. We will prioritize the construction of steel mills, machinery factories, and chemical plants. These industries will provide the necessary materials and equipment for our broader economic goals, ensuring we can produce everything from consumer goods to military hardware."
RUS_First_Five_Year_Plan: "First Five-Year Plan"
RUS_First_Five_Year_Plan_desc: "The taxation of the peasantry and thus taking the surplus value of the peasants will allow for the productive forces to transition to socialism to be created, which is best done through a central planning agency creating plans which allow for rapid industrialisation."

RUS_Federation_Of_Syndicates: "Syndical-Cooperative Federation"
RUS_Federation_Of_Syndicates_desc: "It is necessary to divide the management of society between political and economic councils. The first, elected from the workers of certain territories and/or enterprises, will concentrate in their hands the functions of defense and ensuring order. The latter, created by elected representatives of industrial and consumer associations of workers (syndicates - unions of self-governing enterprises and cooperative unions), will manage economic life, deciding what, how and for whom to produce. The various branches of government of the soviets will balance each other, preventing abuse."
RUS_Workers_Councils: "Empower Labor Collectives"
RUS_Workers_Councils_desc: "To help represent the best interests of the Russian proletariat, we should establish labor collectives throughout the nation in order to pool our labor force together in pursuit of greater efficiency and easier organization. In these collectives, the disorganized and disparate workforce could be brought together into syndicates - each representing a different profession. With each syndicate run by the top minds or hands in each field, and with all resources they would need pooled into one central and easily accessible union, our workforce shall be carried into a prosperous Socialist future on the back of their own hard work."
RUS_Rural_Reconstruction: "Rural Reconstruction Initiatives"
RUS_Rural_Reconstruction_desc: "The global crisis devastated our rural communities. By directing resources towards rebuilding rural infrastructure, including roads, schools, and healthcare facilities, we will lay the groundwork for a revitalized rural economy. This will also reduce urban migration, balancing our population distribution."
RUS_Support_Consumer_Cooperatives: "Support Consumer Unions"
RUS_Support_Consumer_Cooperatives_desc: "If workers have their own organizations now, why should consumers not be in the same position? Cooperative Unions should be established to give them representation as well. Our people shall be allowed and even incentivized to live communally in domestic communes and cooperatives. Pooling resources and funds, sharing labors, and raising children as a group or new village will form greater bonds between our people while further increasing national efficiency."
SOV_Socially_Owned_Economy: "Socially Owned Economy"
SOV_Socially_Owned_Economy_desc: "For too long a cabal of fat cat monopolies have owned large sectors of the Russian economy. This is simply untenable. Not only does this stifle any innovation and restrict the natural growth of our GDP, but it maintains the kleptocratic rule of the elites. We must smash these monopolies and localise the ownership of the factories if we are to solve this problem. The heavy hand of the state will work wonders in this endeavor. With our control over the apparatus of state there is little these holdovers of a bygone era can do against us. When we give the factories back to the people they will rejoice and work twice as hard. They will, won't they?"
SOV_Decentralised_Planning: "Decentralised Planning"
SOV_Decentralised_Planning_desc: "By instituting quotas and mandatory minimum production levels we will only hurt our nation. This will encourage lying and corruption should the quotas not be met. Therefore we will break down planning to a lower level and allow them to set their own production targets for the year. If these are met then the workers and their managers get rewards, if not, no harm done. With this system of Decentralized planning we can have a more effective economy."
SOV_Rural_Obschinas: "Rural Obschinas"
SOV_Rural_Obschinas_desc: "Obschina was once a Russian community of peasants and farmers, who live in the same village and share common ownership. With the socialization of land, the Obschinas are slowly coming back to life, improving cooperation and communalism between the rural dwellers."
SOV_Rural_Obschinas_tooltip: "(Every [ROOT.GetAdjective] §Hrural§! §Gcore state§!):\n  Add the following:\nResource Gain Efficiency [?0.15|=G%2]\n§HLocal Supplies:§! [?0.30|=G%0]"



RUS_Industrial_Socialism: "Industrial Socialism"
RUS_Industrial_Socialism_desc: "Socialism cannot be stuck in the past. To achieve it, we must focus on the industrial sector."
RUS_Socialist_Economic_Miracle: "Socialist Economic Miracle"
RUS_Socialist_Economic_Miracle_desc: "All of our critics and sceptics laughed at us for our ideas for a socialist economy. They aren't laughing anymore. Our economic succes is nothing less than a \"miracle\" as the old Russians would say. Yet it's no \"godly\" intervention, it's our superb management."

RUS_GOELRO: "Electrify Rural Areas"
RUS_GOELRO_desc: "While the comprehensive electrification of Russia was a great plan, it was sabotaged by the Imperialists of the West, who controlled our most important sector. We must extend electrification to the rural areas, that still lack it, in order to ensure productivity of our agriculture."
RUS_Centralized_Logistics: "Centralized Logistics and Transport"
RUS_Centralized_Logistics_desc: "Efficient transport and logistics are the lifeblood of a planned economy. We will centralize the management of railways, highways, and shipping to streamline the movement of goods and resources. This will reduce bottlenecks and ensure timely delivery of materials to all parts of the country."
RUS_Defending_Our_Lifelines: "Defending Our Lifelines"
RUS_Defending_Our_Lifelines_desc: "Our magnificent project cannot succeed without a proper transportation network, one ensured by the modern technologies utilized within rail travel. That's exactly why we should focus our investments on a new scheme meant to provide the state lines with an expanded flotilla of trains and increased efforts in development of their armored variety."
RUS_Industrial_Science_Institutes: "Industrial Science Institutes"
RUS_Industrial_Science_Institutes_desc: "To stay at the forefront of technological development, we will establish industrial science institutes. These research centers will focus on improving production processes, developing new technologies, and training engineers. By investing in scientific research, we will ensure continuous innovation in our industries."
RUS_Nationalization_Of_Resources: "Nationalization of Natural Resources"
RUS_Nationalization_Of_Resources_desc: "To ensure fair and efficient use of our nation's resources, we will nationalize key sectors, including mining, oil, and gas. This move will allow us to control the extraction and distribution of these vital resources, ensuring they are used for the benefit of all citizens and not private profit."

### Focuses ###
Russia_Socialist:0 "Russian Focus Tree"

SOV_Proletarian_Humanism:0 "Proletarian Humanism"
SOV_Proletarian_Humanism_desc:0 "Through his rhetorical skills and clever maneuvering, Bukharin's vision of Russia and beyond has seen him retain his dominant role at the Congress. He supports a course of socialism at a snail's pace, to avoid the creation of a massive state bureaucracy and preserve the victories of the proletariat in the recent revolution."

SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict:0 "Fight Urban-Rural Conflict"
SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict_desc:0 "In our land there is a great struggle between the cities and the countryside, between the developed lands and the deprived farmlands, between factory workers and peasants. One of our first steps in preserving the revolution is to overcome this divide so that we may combine our efforts against the oppressors rather than bickering among ourselves."

SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation:0 "Voluntary Collectivisation"
SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation_desc:0 "Russia had barely begun to move beyond feudalism by the time we liberated the country. The New Economic Policy of the Soviet Republic should include a program of voluntary farm collectivisation, something that will allow the poorest peasants to unite and pool their resources together without uprooting the entire agricultural system."

SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation:0 "Cautious Industrialisation"
SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation_desc:0 "The super industrialism of the left-wing of the party will lead to a massive state bureaucracy which will dominate over the proletariat. Only a moderate industrialisation, one which also preserves the Smychka, which is a necessary requirement in the short-term, will be a successful one, preventing many issues in its path."

SOV_Control_The_Unions:0 "Control the Unions"
SOV_Control_The_Unions_desc:0 "We currently have a parallelism of unions and the administrative organs, an issue which needs to be remedied. While this we will also have to change the essence of unions, from 'trade' unions to 'production' unions. The newly created administrative-economic apparatus will be democratically elected by the workers, with broad mass assemblies of all economic-production measures."

SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation:0 "Fight Bureaucratisation"
SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation_desc:0 "The fight against the bureaucracy is a constant struggle, something Lenin already well understood. We will have to continue Comrade Lenin’s fight against the bureaucracy, before it can take hold like a tick and drain our state’s lifeblood of liberty and equality; something we must avoid at all costs. We will also have to train a new class of truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the scores of reactionary swine that still infest our administration."

SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard:0 "Revolutionary Vanguard"
SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc:0 "After a long struggle, Karl Radek's vision for a revolutionary future has won out against all others. A radical among radicals, Radek is a firebrand, insisting that primitive socialist accumulation and a series of five-year plans will allow the production of the productive forces necessary to begin the transition towards true communism."

SOV_Mass_Collectivisation:0 "Dekulakization"
SOV_Mass_Collectivisation_desc:0 "The farmlands of Russia's great expanses have never been controlled by the farmer, but instead by the Grand Prince, the Tsar, and the capitalist. But now there is another enemy in the village - the Kulak, a capitalist farmer, who seeks only profit margin. This repression of the worker cannot be allowed to persist, and as such we must embark on a radical program of dekulakization of our agricultural industry. Only under collective ownership can they truly be free from the capitalist's jackboot."

SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour:0 "Militarisation of Labour"
SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour_desc:0 "Man, at its basis, wants to avoid work. Thus, we must use state coercion to establish a society based around the interests of the labouring majority. Labour armies will be established, mobilising the proletariat to work under military supervision. We must also fight labour deserters who want to sabotage the great revolution."

SOV_Proletarian_Revolution:0 "Proletarian Revolution"
SOV_Proletarian_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution must be complete and all-encompassing. For socialism to be achieved we must put all our efforts towards its accomplishment and radically change society from top to bottom. Only by removing the rotten core left behind by the previous regime can the workers truly be free from its oppression."

SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan:0 "First Five-Year Plan"
SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan_desc:0 "The taxation of the peasantry, and thus taking the surplus value of the peasants, will allow for the productive forces to transition to socialism to be created. This is best done through a central planning agency creating plans which allow for rapid industrialisation. The mainstay of these plans shall be the 5-Year Plans: set economic plans with goals to reach within the allotted time to keep our industrialization efforts on track and at rapid pace."


SOV_Break_The_Smychka:0 "Break The Smychka"
SOV_Break_The_Smychka_desc:0 "As a result of centuries of feudal and capitalist rule, Russia has few true peasants. It's therefore inconceivable that the farmer will be at the center of the revolution, albeit through no fault of their own. No, it's the worker and not the peasant that will be the vanguard of the revolution, and he should be elevated as such."

SOV_Create_the_VSR:0 "Create the VSR"
SOV_Create_the_VSR_desc:0 "By establishing the All-Russian Union of Producers (VSR - Vserossiyskiy Soyuz Rabochikh), the trade unions will be granted a far greater influence over labour and the economy as a whole. In the end, this will serve to strengthen the worker and the Union alike."

SOV_Separation_Of_Powers:0 "Separation of Powers"
SOV_Separation_Of_Powers_desc:0 "The interest of the unions have been ignored far too much, we will create a separation of power between the unions, the Soviets and the Communist Party, which will allow to represent the proletariat while also allowing for the effective defence against reactionaries."

SOV_Rebuild_the_Country:0 "Rebuild the Country"
SOV_Rebuild_the_Country_desc:0 "While recent years have seen some of the worst of it, the Russian lands have been ravaged by the scourges of war and tyranny for the entirety of our living memory. The process of rebuilding the country will be a long and difficult one, and one that we must focus all our efforts towards."

SOV_Help_The_People:0 "Help the People"
SOV_Help_The_People_desc:0 "The Second Russian Civil War has devastated large swaths of the nation, it has also impoverished many people. We will have to fix this disaster and end the great suffering created for many by the Civil War, else we would be failing at our central mission to improve the living situation of the general population."

SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy:0 "Rebuild the Bureaucracy"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Kerensky's reign and its aftermath hardly improved matters from the times of the Tsars. If we are to have a functioning state apparatus capable of serving the workers rather than the interests of a handful of capitalists and their cronies, the entire state bureaucracy must be rebuilt from the ground up."

SOV_Allow_Small_Traders:0 "Allow Small Traders"
SOV_Allow_Small_Traders_desc:0 "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."

SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan:0 "Electrify Rural Areas"
SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan_desc:0 "Electrification is a central part for communism. Lenin went so far as to state that 'Communism is Soviet government plus the electrification of the whole country.' Despite the electifaction, made by Kerensky government, it is still not enough. To fulfil this plan we have entrusted a 'State Commission for Electrification of Russia' to electrify the entire nation."

SOV_Form_Gosplan:0 "Form Gosplan"
SOV_Form_Gosplan_desc:0 "In order to complete our lofty economic goals, a planning committee will need to be established by the state. This Gosudarstvennyy Planovyy Komitet, or Gosplan, shall serve as the main economic planning office in our nation, precisely dictating how our economy shall operate. Employing some of the brightest minds in Russia, the Gosplan will greatly enhance our new planned economy."

SOV_Mechanisation:0 "Mechanisation"
SOV_Mechanisation_desc:0 "The industrial revolution brought with it many great advancements in productivity as factories and farmlands started to utilise machinery on a grand scale. Yet here in Russia, most labour is done by hand. In order to compete with the capitalists that oppose us at every turn, we must embrace these developments and modernise our economy accordingly."

SOV_Khozraschyot:0 "Khozraschyot"
SOV_Khozraschyot_desc:0 "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."

SOV_Promote_Industrialisation:0 "Promote Industrialisation"
SOV_Promote_Industrialisation_desc:0 "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."

SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution:0 "Spreading the Revolution"
SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution will not be contained within just the borders of Russia. The worker abroad must be freed from tyranny as well and it's our duty to aid them in their struggle."

SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits:0 "Force Open the Straits"
SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits_desc:0 "We're no strangers to conflict with the Ottomans. In the past however, monarchs fought against each other for the sake of pride and prizes. Now it is the people that will fight against the monarchs for the sake of worker liberation."

SOV_Into_The_Caucasus:0 "Into the Caucasus"
SOV_Into_The_Caucasus_desc:0 "Lost after the Weltkrieg, the Don-Kuban Union is a reactionary state run by Cossack warlords. Beyond their tyranny lies counter-revolutionaries and religious fundamentalists right at the edge of the theocratic Islamic Empire in the south. As long as they remain at large, these states pose an active threat to our revolution."

SOV_Secure_Central_Asia:0 "Secure Central Asia"
SOV_Secure_Central_Asia_desc:0 "Formerly part of Russia, the central Asian plains have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring Russian leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defence on our part, but also an act of liberation of the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."

SOV_The_Final_Battle:0 "The Final Battle"
SOV_The_Final_Battle_desc:0 "The treaty of Brest-Litovsk handed over millions of workers to the German industrialists on a silver platter and gave them Russia's most heavily industrialised lands on top of it. It's our duty to liberate the people of the East from the German yoke once and for all."

SOV_Enemy_In_The_East:0 "Enemy in the East"
SOV_Enemy_In_The_East_desc:0 "The Empire of Japan holds a large portion of Asia's workers hostage under its despotic military rule. These workers and peasants of Asia yearn to be freed from Japan and her band of warlords and only Russian might is capable of achieving this!"


### Army Focuses ###

SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias:0 "Mobilise Urban Militias"
SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias_desc:0 "The cities have been the heartland of the revolution ever since the beginning - they were its birth land. We must rally militias from the cities to serve in the revolution and allow for its spread, for if we do not, the revolution may be crushed yet again."

SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units:0 "Krasnaya Gvardiya Units"
SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units_desc:0 "Many members of the Bolshevik Party are still in hiding. We must mobilise and organise these people into military formations, as we need every soldier we can at this point if we want to survive the incoming onslaught."

SOV_Rally_The_Defectors:0 "Rally the Defectors"
SOV_Rally_The_Defectors_desc:0 "Many in the Russian army are dissatisfied with the status quo, which makes them perfect to recruit to the revolution, so they can serve in a true attempt to change the status quo and improve the life of the population and make the army serve the people, not the bankers."

SOV_The_War_Effort:0 "The War Effort"
SOV_The_War_Effort_desc:0 "We will need to organise the revolutionary war effort, as it has been a pure disaster beforehand. We will re-establish much of the bureaucracy and state apparatus which was destroyed in the wake of the failure of the First Civil War. "

SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army:0 "Rebuild the Red Army"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army will have to be rebuilt, if we want to win this revolution. A centralised army proved itself to be a capable fighting force the first time around, and it will be a capable one the second time around too. Even so, we must be aware of the failures and mistakes of its first incarnation."

SOV_Centralised_Command:0 "Centralised Command"
SOV_Centralised_Command_desc:0 "A centralised command is necessary in military combat - any other alternative would just result in total disaster, something we need to avoid at all costs. Thus, we will aim to create a cohesive military chain of command, to allow for a more effective fighting force."

SOV_Reinstate_The_Cheka:0 "Reinstate the Cheka"
SOV_Reinstate_The_Cheka_desc:0 "The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission carried out its duties with diligence. Now that socialist rule has been established, however, we face the threat of subversion from counter-revolutionaries from across the world. In order to fend off the threats both from within and from abroad we must expand the institution and modernise its methods."

SOV_War_Communism:0 "War Communism"
SOV_War_Communism_desc:0 "We must take multiple measures to win this war and to spread the revolution to Russia, however unpopular and brutal many of these may prove to be. They are necessary to win the war and improve the life of the general population in the long-term."

SOV_The_Second_Red_Army:0 "The Second Red Army"
SOV_The_Second_Red_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army must be rebuilt, as it was a great display of proletarian power, even if it was defeated at the end. However, the solution is to rebuild the Red Army and learn from its failure, not to reject the Red Army and the principles it was founded on."

SOV_Reorganise_Armament_Production:0 "Reorganise Armament Production"
SOV_Reorganise_Armament_Production_desc:0 "The current state of armament production is a disaster. We must reorganise the armament production and end the chaos in the production chain. Only if we do this we can guarantee that every soldier will have a gun to fight the forces of reaction."

SOV_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps:0 "The People's Logistics Corps"
SOV_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps_desc:0 "We must properly organise our logistics. In order to do this, we will create the 'People's Logistic Corps,' which will be in charge of the supply chains, hopefully improving the current state of our logistics - in many areas, a total disaster."

SOV_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions:0 "Dedicated Artillery Battalions"
SOV_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions_desc:0 "We will create independent artillery battalions, which will serve to support our troops and break the enemy lines with waves of artillery shells, preventing them from launching any effective counter-attacks."

SOV_Local_Workshops:0 "Local Workshops"
SOV_Local_Workshops_desc:0 "We will create local workshops all throughout the nation, to allow for local arms production, which is better suited to serve the local situation and needs than a centralised way of organising the production."

SOV_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya:0 "Empower the Krasnaya Gvardiya"
SOV_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_desc:0 "We must create a bottom-up army structure - an army which is truly representative of the revolutionary spirit. We will support the democratic election of commanders, even if it may cause some issues at times - the soldiers in the field probably know better who should command them than our leaders, far away from the situation."

SOV_Decentralised_Structure:0 "Decentralised Structure"
SOV_Decentralised_Structure_desc:0 "We must further decentralise the revolutionary army of ours, giving every part of the chain considerable autonomy and preventing the higher-ups from being able to dictate to the rest of the chain what they should do and how."

SOV_Reconnaissance_Units:0 "Reconnaissance Units"
SOV_Reconnaissance_Units_desc:0 "By creating units dedicated to reconnaissance we will always be one step ahead of the enemy. We will know what their next plan is and what we need to do to counteract it."

SOV_Officer_Initiative:0 "Officer Initiative"
SOV_Officer_Initiative_desc:0 "Encouraging officers to make their own decisions autonomously will allow for better responses to sudden changes, as they are more knowledgeable about the situation on the ground than some far away higher-ups, who never visited the area properly."

SOV_Small_Unit_Tactics:0 "Small Unit Tactics"
SOV_Small_Unit_Tactics_desc:0 "Instead of using masses of troops, using small units allows for us to be far quicker in our attacks and surprise than if we use large waves of soldiers. This will also give us more easily the element of surprise."

SOV_Frunzes_Reform_Plan:0 "Frunze's Reform Plan"
SOV_Frunzes_Reform_Plan_desc:0 "With the revolution secured, for now, we can focus on other matters. Frunze has proposed that we should focus on improving the high command and officer training and generally improve the defence of the army against a possible invasion, a real threat, as the forces of reaction will probably try to end the revolution in the future."

SOV_Expand_The_High_Command:0 "Expand the High Command"
SOV_Expand_The_High_Command_desc:0 "The high command will need to be expanded to include many of the best generals we have, who were all able to show their skill in the Second Russian Revolution. Only a high command truly including the best of the best will be able to make intelligent decisions."

SOV_Officer_Training_Academies:0 "Officer Training Academies"
SOV_Officer_Training_Academies_desc:0 "Our military academies are in many ways still a relic of the past, with most being from the time of the Tsar. We will create a series of new military academies, following the best doctrine, not the most traditional doctrine. Only this way we will create an officer corps, which is truly superior to the ones of the capitalists."

SOV_Professional_Engineer_Corps:0 "Professional Engineer Corps"
SOV_Professional_Engineer_Corps_desc:0 "Our army still lacks a proper engineer corps, at least a formalised one. We will change this situation by creating a formal engineer corps, which will be professionally trained in their craft."

SOV_Tukhachevskiys_Reform_Plan:0 "Tukhachevskiy's Reform Plan"
SOV_Tukhachevskiys_Reform_Plan_desc:0 "Tukhachevskiy has proposed to use the doctrine of deep battle, which proposes the use of combined arms and overwhelming land-air attacks. Such a doctrine would make the army a true force to be reckoned with on the offensive."

SOV_Mass_Breakthroughs:0 "Mass Breakthroughs"
SOV_Mass_Breakthroughs_desc:0 "Armour is the future, we will need to support the development of new tanks if we want to create a truly modern arm force, which is able to encircle and destroy enemy divisions at record speeds."

SOV_Land_Air_Integration:0 "Land-Air Integration"
SOV_Land_Air_Integration_desc:0 "The integrated use of soldiers and aircraft will allow for the overwhelming of the troops and for our army to crush the enemy completely."

SOV_Establish_The_VVS:0 "Establish the VVS"
SOV_Establish_The_VVS_desc:0 "The VVS (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, 'Military Air Force') is badly outdated. We use the same planes and tactics today that we did twenty years ago. By expanding our air-bases and training new recruits we could change this."

SOV_Airspace_Defence:0 "Airspace Defence"
SOV_Airspace_Defence_desc:0 "Nothing is more important than the defence of the airspace, as our enemies will try to utilise aircraft in every possible way to conquer our airspace and terrorise the land troops, something we will have to avoid at all costs if we want to be victorious in future encounters."

SOV_The_ORT_System:0 "The ORT System"
SOV_The_ORT_System_desc:0 "Modern wars are only partially won on the battlefield. Equally important are the men and women behind desks and radios, dealing with intelligence and transmissions. We need to make their work easier."

SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry:0 "Nationalise the Aircraft Industry"
SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry_desc:0 "We have a highly modern aircraft industry, however often it is still private. We will have to nationalise this aircraft industry and integrate it into the state apparatus if we want to create a modern and strong air force."

SOV_Aviation_Bureaus:0 "Aviation Bureaus"
SOV_Aviation_Bureaus_desc:0 "Opening aviation bureaus throughout the nation will allow us to improve our pilots, something which is always an important duty of the nation, if we want to create a capable air force."

SOV_New_Fighters:0 "New Fighters"
SOV_New_Fighters_desc:0 "While bombers may damage our opposition, not a single one of them will reach their targets without sufficient protection from our fighters. These fighters can also provide cover for our own troops and industry."

Since then the party was ruled by Grigory Zinoviev, a talented orator, but a radical, who believes that only by dictatorship true socialism can be achieved. While his methods seem too radical for us now, we can agree on their participation in the congress only if Lev Kamenev, a more moderate candidate will become their representative and leader, if they succeed.\n\nThe decisions to invite the RKP was greatly criticized by Left SR delegates, who are natural enemies of the Bolsheviks since the July Uprising in 1918."

With the new order consolidated in the country, the [ROOT.GetLeader] has made bail to prohibit all non-socialist newspapers in the country, shutting down the 'Popular Messenger' of the SR party and the 'Socialist Messenger' of the Mensheviks, the most distributed newspapers in former Russian Republic. With the prohibition confirmed, communist newspapers with 'Pravda' as the main source of the news became the only allowed and available in the country.

russoc.23.t:0 "Question of Kulaks"
russoc.23.d:0 "Kulaks, or well-to-do peasants, are a petty-bourgeois class from a certain point of view, who were able to enrich themselves through the use of wage labor and engaged in rural usury. On the one hand, reliance on the petty-bourgeois peasants in our agrarian policy contributes to the entrenchment of capitalist relations in the countryside, and from the point of view of the Socialist-Revolutionary doctrine, this is an inevitable sabotage against the Soviet government. On the other hand, we can allow the Kulaks to coexist with the Soviet government, hoping for the enrichment of the village and cooperation."
russoc.23.a:0 "Seize the Kulak land  in favor of cooperatives!"
russoc.23.b:0 "Let them be... for now."

russoc.24.t:0 "Ethnic Soviets?"
russoc.24.d:0 "One of the main questions about the nature of the Soviet system is the representation of minorities. The Left SRs have suggested to create Ethnic Soviets in order to represent various ethnicities in the lands of the former Russian Empire. However, critics say that this is against internationalist doctrine and can bolster nationalism in the country."
russoc.24.a:0 "This will definitely help."
russoc.24.b:0 "This will only stimulate nationalism!"

russoc.25.t:0 "Formation of Profintern"
russoc.25.d:0 "Solomon Lozovsky has delivered a speech, offering the government to establish the Profintern - the Internationale of Trade Unions that will help the workers globally. Even though in many syndicalist countries the Trade Unions congresses are controlling the government, there are still many democracies where trade unions are still allowed and workers need more social security."
russoc.25.a:0 "Send the invitations."

russoc.26.t:0 "Invitation to Profintern"
russoc.26.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has offered us to assist our trade unions and join the Profintern organisation. The 'Internationale of Trade Unions' aims to create an organisation of trade unions in order to achieve security of workers rights globally. They also stated that their task is not the destruction, but the conquest of the trade unions, that is, the multimillion mass that is in the old trade unions."

russoc.30.t:0 "New Female Image"
russoc.30.d:0 "The new Soviet culture equally rejects both the bourgeois consumer approach to life and the commercial attitude to the dominance of sexuality in female beauty, offering its own solution to the issue: a new type of femininity, based on naturalness, health, hygiene and a complete rejection of the use of decorative cosmetics. An exemplary Soviet beauty should adhere to the following fundamental principles of femininity: neatness / neatness, cleanliness, professionalism, modesty and only in special cases — elegance. \n\nIn addition, the point of view began to dominate that a woman is not only equal in rights to men, but should also be a mother-worker. The image of a working-mother (Rabotnitsa-Mat'), universally propagandizing work and family values, became the basis of our new Soviet culture. The new female image should become an example for the whole world."
russoc.30.a:0 "All the women of the world are following you to fight against capital!"

russoc.31.t:0 "Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution"
russoc.31.d:0 "Maria Spiridonova is not just a revolutionary terrorist, but now the leader of a capital-free Russia, so the image of the "Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution" immediately began to take shape around her. Participation in the first Russian revolution and the subsequent ones largely secured this complimentary nickname for her. Moreover, Maria Spiridonova became the first woman at the head of Russia, which in many ways spurred feminists, suffragettes and women all over the world. Ready to lead Revolutions forward and liberate all women of the world, Maria Spiridonova became the new idol of socialism all over the world. \n\nA cult of personality also began to form spontaneously around her, which, however, manifests itself in the universal imitation of the image of Spiridonova, as well as the mass movement of women in Councils at all levels."
russoc.31.a:0 "Long live Russian Revolution!"

russoc.35.t:0 "Suspicious Nomination"
russoc.35.d:0 "Today was the most ordinary day in Soviet Russia. Peasants and workers were working, and almost no one noticed how something terrible happened in the country. Few people have heard that by yesterday's decree, the Soviet government intended to disband the counterintelligence bodies, the Cheka, and give more power to the police, since it no longer saw the need for the existence of this organization for revolutionary terror. \n\nHowever, this did not happen. Instead, today the new deputy head of the country is Yakov Fishman, the head of the Cheka, who clearly claims to be the subsequent nomination for the post of head of the Soviet republic."
russoc.35.a:0 "That's really strange!"
russoc.35.b:0 "Sounds like a coup, better remove him from any power!"

russoc.36.t:0 "Decree on Abolising the Parties"
russoc.36.d:0 "With the filing of Yakov Fishman, today the government adopted a decree on the abolition of political parties for their uselessness and the transfer of full power to the Soviets. The decree caused a wide resonance among the political elite, as well as the public, although, in fact, it does not imply a rejection of the ideology of parties or their ideas, but only makes all Councils non-partisan authorities."
russoc.36.a:0 "Do the government has authority to do so?"

russoc.37.t:0 "Legalist Coup"
russoc.37.d:0 "After the creation of a virtually shadow government, the abolition of parties and the implementation of terror on an even larger scale, a group of left-wing Socialist-Revolutionary politicians and revolutionaries led by Vladimir Trutovsky.\n\nThey declared the presence of the Chekists in power illegal and unjustified and demanded immediate resignation from leadership positions as well as the abolition of the Cheka. \n\nFurther events developed quite quickly, however, it all ended with the fact that..."

russoc.42.d.nep:0 "As the New Economic Policy of Bukharin stated, the private property was never fully abolished, allowing citizens, especially peasants, to own land and make business. However, this is contrary to our new centralist doctrine, as Rykov believes that all property should be nationalized as soon as possible. Though that does not mean we fully abandon NEP, we can give the land to peasants, though without their right to own it. They still can do some profit, but this time the land and everything else shall be nationalized."
russoc.42.d.no_nep:0 "During the times of NEP, the private property was never fully abolished, allowing citizens, especially peasants, to own land and make business. However, this is contrary to our socialist doctrine, as Rykov believes that all property should be nationalized. While the first nationalization policies are already ongoing, there is still much to do and we should nationalize all the private property in our country as soon as possible." 
russoc.42.a:0 "Complete nationalization!"

russoc.43.t:0 "Dissolution of the Union!"
russoc.43.d:0 "Today, our premier, Aleksey Kuznetsov has announced the dissolution of the union in its current form and instead establishing Autonomous Republics as part of Russian SR. This event has outraged many nationalities, that live in our big countries who see Kuznetsov's decision as traitorous to their autonomy and nation. The riots are being suppressed all across the country, especially in Turkestan, Caucasus and Westernmost regions. However, the riots can escalate..."
russoc.43.a:0 "We must do something!"

russoc.44.t:0 "Ukrainian Revolt!"
russoc.44.d:0 "As a response to the dissolution of the union, the Ukrainian Left SRs, led by Aleksandr Shumskiy, have declared Ukrainian independence. The rebels have gathered people and volunteers in the Western part of Ukraine. While they have a right to do so, according to the Unionist constitution, it is no more accepted, as the Union has been dissolved. We must immediately respond to their unauthorized seizure of power!"

russoc.48.b:0 "Let us join!"

russoc.49.t:0 "The Trade Union Congress"
russoc.49.d:0 "The Old Soviets are now destroyed, with the new system of Trade Union Congresses now implemented instead. The Central Congress of Trade Unions, the VTsSPS, now holds the supreme power in the country, with the just elected chairman Kuznetsov as head of the Congress and our Republic."
russoc.49.a:0 "Long live Kuznetsov!"

russoc.50.t:0 "'Troika'"
russoc.50.d:0 "As soon as Soviet power was restored in most Russian lands, Alexander Yegorov announced his resignation and the formation of a new military government. Yegorov's plan was to create a special political body consisting of three military leaders as the top of the Soviet hierarchy. The Troika or Triumvirate should include General Zhukov as Yegorov's successor, as well as Marshals Tukhachevsky and Frunze. Frunze became Chairman of Internal Affairs, Tukhachevsky became Minister of War, and Zhukov became head of the government.\n\nThe three, however, are very unstable, each of the generals wanting to rule. The youngest of them is Zhukov, who is unlikely to emerge victorious in the struggle for power. On the other side are the professional revolutionaries and military leaders, Tukhachevsky and Frunze, who can easily overwhelm Zhukov, given their large support bases and prestige. All of them know that negotiations will not take place, so the main struggle heated up for influence in the armed forces, since a coup supported by the military seems the only way for any of these titans of the Russian left to become leader of the Soviets and come to power alone."
russoc.50.a:0 "So the power struggle begins..."

russoc.51.t:0 "Tremendous Victory at a Local Rally!"
russoc.51.d:0 "Our supporters recently held a great rally that ended in thunderous applause from the gathered crowds; a truly tremendous victory for our cause. It seems that there are more and more supporters of our faction within the supreme Soviet body. We inch closer to seizing control of the Troika with every win!"
russoc.51.a:0 "Onwards to victory!"

russoc.52.t:0 "Successful Rally for our Cause!"
russoc.52.d:0 "Our supporters recently organized a rally in support of our cause, to mild success. We managed to attract more people to support our faction, but the turnout could have been better. This will definitely help us when the time to finally seize power comes, but more effort will be needed next time to increase our next rally’s effectiveness."
russoc.52.a:0 "Good, but not great. We must try harder to achieve our final victory.!"

russoc.53.t:0 "Catastrophic Rally!"
russoc.53.d:0 "To disastrous results, our loyal supporters organized a rally recently. Our rally was not only a great disappointment for our supporters, but also caused a large hit to our support base’s confidence in our struggle to control the Troika. Some of them will perhaps even turn to the other factions instead of ours."
russoc.53.a:0 "Pathetic and disgraceful! We will never seize power with results like this."

russoc.54.t:0 "Speaking with Zinoviev"
russoc.54.d:0 "Grigory Zinoviev is definitely an ambitious and power-hungry man; one who desires to reach the top of the Soviet hierarchy at all costs - moreover, he craves it both here and now. He is a man of no compromises, pursuing power and glory to a bitter-ender and well past his station, or at least nearly everyone in our government seems to think so. That is, everyone except Georgy Zhukov. \nIt is Zhukov alone who is ready to sacrifice his potential chair as Soviet Head of Government, willing to give it to Zinoviev in order to secure his bid to rule the Troika. \nMikhail Tukhachevsky is more provident and subtle, however. He knows that Zinoviev lusts for power far too much to risk allowing the radical to blow his chance at rule. Tukhachevsky will likely try to offer Zinoviev a chair in return for Bolsheviks' support, but that is likely as far as the Red Napoleon will be willing to go.\nOf the members of the Troika, the only one with a stable, long-lasting, and confident relationship with the RKP is, of course, Mikhail Frunze. He and Zinoviev go way back as fellow Bolsheviks, so it is also very likely that the RKP will be swung in favour of Frunze."
russoc.54.a:0 "Zhukov moves to make Zinoviev head of government, active immediately."
russoc.54.b:0 "Tuckachevsky promises Zinoviev a chair."
russoc.54.c:0 "Cast Zinoviev's mind back to his heroics in the Civil War, drifting him back to Frunze."

russoc.55.t:0 "Zinoviev Supports Zhukov"
russoc.55.d:0 "Zinoviev has unexpectedly chosen to cooperate with Zhukov and support his cause. The KNOF-RKP coalition is now in control of the government with Zinoviev as its head."
russoc.55.a:0 "We couldn’t have expected this."

russoc.56.t:0 "Zinoviev Supports Tukhachevsky"
russoc.56.d:0 "Tukhachevsky was right when he thought that Zinoviev's desire to become a chairman would be enough to lure his lust for power. With Zinoviev successfully courted, the FKIR-RKP coalition will control the government as soon as Tukhachevsky is in power."

russoc.57.t:0 "Zinoviev Supports Frunze"
russoc.57.d:0 "There is nothing remarkable in the fact that Zinoviev has chosen to support his old friend and comrade from their shared Bolshevist past. The SPARR-RKP coalition will control the government as soon as Frunze is in power."

russoc.58.t:0 "Speak to Voroshilov."
russoc.58.d:0 "A prominent Bolshevik and general, Kliment Voroshilov, brave veteran of the Civil War, is one of the most popular military leaders in our country and with his popularity and fame has amassed great influence over our armed forces. His support of our cause is especially important in case of military takeover from one of our fellow Troika members, as all three chairmen of the Troika know that only through a coup can they ever have a hope to seize total control over the Supreme Soviet.\nVoroshilov is likely to support Zhukov, the young and promising general, who also happens to be the leader of the third Russian revolution.\nOn the other hand, Voroshilov is known for his loyalty to the Bolshevist cause. Despite the fact that Frunze is no longer a member of the RKP and has since founded a more conservative, or rightist, socialist party, Voroshilov can easily be reminded of his past glories shared with Frunze during the Russian Civil War.\nFinally, the venerated Tukhachevsky and Voroshilov have shared very embittered relations for years. In fact, Voroshilov will attempt almost anything to prevent Tukhachevsky from rising to power. Perhaps, we act on this chance to eliminate his threat from the Red Napoleon..."
russoc.58.a:0 "Zhukov promotes Voroshilov to win his loyalty."
russoc.58.b:0 "Frunze reminds Voroshilov of the ‘good ol’ days’."
russoc.58.c:0 "Voroshilov should disappear to ensure Tukhachevsky’s safety."

russoc.59.t:0 "Voroshilov Supports Zhukov"
russoc.59.d:0 "It appears that a well-earned promotion was more important to Voroshilov than 'the good ol’ days' during the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Voroshilov has sided with Zhukov!"
russoc.59.a:0 "What an unexpected surprise."

russoc.60.t:0 "Voroshilov Supports Frunze"
russoc.60.d:0 "Nothing is more important in this world than loyalty, and Voroshilov knows this best. Forced to reminisce on the 'good ol’ days' during the chaos of Russian Civil War made Voroshilov drift back to and support Frunze."
russoc.60.a:0 "How expected of him."

russoc.61.t:0 "Plotting Against Voroshilov."
russoc.61.d:0 "Tukhachevsky knows what he must do in order to fully secure his path to power. Voroshilov must disappear as soon as possible. He has already supported one of the Troika members openly in public dialogues, and it is likely that he may try something to jeopardize Tukhachevsky’s shot at supreme power, so we should act quickly. However, we should never forget that this operation is extremely risky. If we fail, the plot could be exposed. If that were too occur, nothing good would be guaranteed to Tukhachevsky in this case as the rest of the Troika would likely seek retribution."
russoc.61.a:0 "Make it look like an accident to avert suspicion."
russoc.61.b:0 "Blatant assassination is a cheaper, quicker, and more reliable way."
russoc.61.c:0 "It's too risky. Back down from this idea at once and destroy all evidence of our discussions."

russoc.62.t:0 "Plot Against Voroshilov Discovered!"
russoc.62.d:0 "Our secret services have reported on overhearing whispers from both conspiracy nuts and certain officials that there has been a assassination plot organized against one of the most supreme military leaders of our country, Kliment Voroshilov. The actual assassin was executed during the murder attempt, but the plotters are currently unknown and remain at large.."
russoc.62.a:0 "It was Zhukov. He had the motive."

russoc.68.t:0 "The PLSR Question"
russoc.68.d:0 "The PLSR is the only syndicalist party in Russia. With syndicalism being the leading socialist ideology of the wider world in recent years, the Left SRs wield a great influence over population, army, and government.\nZhukov can successfully negotiate with the PLSR, if he did not 'soil his reputation' by connections with RKP.\nFrunze is unlikely to be supported by the PLSR as they still remember the times of the Left SRs uprising.\nHowever, it is Tukhachevsky who is likely to be supported by the Left SRs, as his Internationalist faction will be a nice platform for the PLSR to work with.\nThe only thing that can help us to sway the Left SRs to our cause is to grant them control over how the trade unions should be organised."

They also are very opposed to the perceived influence of the peasants and thus want to break-up the smychka strongly, supporting the further workerisation of the party.\n\nLast but not least, the faction lead by Radek supports the idea of primitive socialist accumulation, that is to extract the peasant surplus value and to use this to develop the productive forces to transition to make Russia ready for socialism, which is best developed in their mind through five-year plan."

The White forces and the Republic they founded made sure to paint the Bolshevik uprising in a negative light, many of the witnesses of the events died in the Civil War, and those who survived were unable to spread the word. Now that the socialist revolution has won in Russia, however, the seven volume memoirs of Nikolai N. Sukhanov, the most comprehensive account of the Revolution available, has been published in Moscow. Sukhanov, a member of the Petrograd Soviet, composed the memoirs in exile, but was unable to release them until today.\n\nThe Memoirs of the Revolution tell the story of the October Revolution from 1917 to its defeat in 1920, and destroy many of the myths which have been perpetuated about its events. For years, the fate of Leon Trotsky, one of the main leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the chief of the Red Army, was a mystery, as unlike the other revolutionaries such as Lenin, his death was never fully confirmed. Sukhanov asserts that Trotsky is dead, however - he perished in an artillery barrage at the last days of the Civil War. His account of Trotsky is a lot more flattering than street knowledge in Moscow, too - White propaganda painted Trotsky as a terrible leader who sacrificed thousands of men in failed offensives, and this perception has since become accepted fact, but Sukhanov describes him as competent and capable, if arrogant and conflicting. The exile states that Trotsky is not to blame for the Bolshevik defeat, foreign intervention and Lenin's death at Fanny Kaplan's hands is.\n\nThe Memoirs have since become commonplace in Russian elementary schools and universities as mandatory learning material for the new generation.

Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivized, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivization of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivization and has generally destablized our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialize the nation."

Being a member of the Supreme Soviet, he actively promoted the NEP in public speeches, arguing that if Lenin was alive, he would definitely go with NEP.

Major cities such as Tsentralgrad face large riots and protests against these so-called crypto-capitalist traitors, and what was once to be handled internally has now devolved into a very public scene. \n\nSeeking to quell the unrest and boost his popularity and support while simultaneously eliminating his largest source of detractors and potential obstacles to his plans of centralization, Chairman Zhdanov has publicly proclaimed all enemies to his faction to be traitors to the State. These detractors, centered around Zhdanov’s most fervent rival Comrade Georgy Malenkov, as well as the Techno-Pragmatist whelps, are to be expelled from all government positions or any other seat of power and influenced, reduced to common citizens and forced into secluded early ‘retirements.’ In one fell swoop, Zhdanov has easily been able to legally eliminate most of his political rivals, all with the support of the people, allowing him free reign to reform the State as he saw fit. However, the chaos would not stop for all, for fate had more in store for poor Comrade Malenkov. \n\nExpelled from all public posts and forced into obscurity, Georgy Malenkov had fallen from grace. Once one of the most senior party officials, Malenkov was now reduced to practical imprisonment to a State-provided dacha just a few miles outside his hometown of Orenburg, and it is here - so close to the place of his birth - where Malenkov would meet his final and pitiable end. Eating his buckwheat porridge, blinis, and syrniki with warm Russian tea in the morning air, a single shot rang out from the treeline just a few yards from his patio. Without a whimper or fuss, without commotion, drama, or gravitas, Malenkov slumped back in his lounge chair, lifeless as he bled rapidly from a rifle wound to the neck. Newspapers would pick up the story shortly, with rumors circulating that some lone radical or perhaps a Cheka agent carried out the hit. However, an investigation would never be held, for the State and its new direction did not care - or perhaps already knew.

Alcohol in all forms is to be declared nothing more than ‘Capitalist Debauchery’, fully outlawing alcohol production and consumption while also making it illegal to keep any alcohol in the home or on your person without permission. The only allowed alcohols shall be certain wines and spirits for culinary and other cultural uses, and will be heavily controlled by the State to ensure there is no abuse of this new law. Additionally, new water bottling plants shall replace the old vodka factories in order to provide the Soviet people with good, wholesome drink that is not a detriment to their physical and mental health, with distribution centers rising in every major city. \n\nThis has led to some pushback, but also a resurgence in other cultural drinks of our people, such as Russian Tea which has exploded in popularity once again as people jump from alcohol to caffeine to curb their addictions.

From the smallest towns to the largest metropolises, everywhere you go, Rykov’s face shall be there, shining his wisdom down onto any onlooker. Though this plan is expansive, it pales in comparison to the alternative. \n\nThe second plan is to not only build these statues and shrines across our Union, but to also build a monumentally-large mausoleum in the heart of the capital in order to permanently house Rykov and other Heroes of the Union once they finally pass. This mausoleum would be one of the largest buildings in the Union, scraping the heavens with its marble spinnerets while decorated in the most extravagant decorations our State can muster, with the beloved Rykov entombed inside a glass sarcophagus for all Soviet citizens to witness. Though some see this as idolatry and borderline dogma, with many critics stating it would overshadow Lenin’s legacy and be a huge waste of resources while also inching far too close to religion or spirituality, Premier Zhdanov has assured these warry minds that this is what Rykov and Lenin would have truly wanted.

Furthermore, the concert hall shall serve as a gathering space and workshop for our Union’s most popular and beloved musicians and composers so that these fine artists may have a place to work on their masterpieces in peace in the company of other geniuses of their ilk. The plan has been supported heavily by Zhadanov himself, but many of his most dedicated supporters wish to take it a step further, renaming Maripol to be named after Zhdanov himself as a final and ultimate homage to our beloved Premier.

russoc.135.d:0 "Under the rule of Rykov, the Russian language was encouraged to be used, but was not mandatory in any sense, for his Union was open to all children of the lands of Rus regardless of their actual ethnicity, as long as they were devoted to the Soviet cause. This plan, while flexible and successful so far, leaves much to be desired in the mind of Zhdanov, who seeks to fully eradicate the modern Russian language in favor of a new shared Soviet tongue. Zhdanov and his allies have two main ideas on how this new Soviet Language could be formed. \n\nThe first plan, far less far-reaching of the two, is to transliterate Russian into the Latin alphabet before making it mandatory for all Soviet citizens to use as the one accepted language. Despite the relative ease of this plan compared to Zhdanov’s other idea, it would likely greatly anger any non-Russian speaker in the nation. Alternatively, Zhdanov’s more wide-sweeping plan is to combine the many languages of old Russia into one cohesive language based around a Russian foundation, then transliterating it to the Latin alphabet before making it the one accepted language for all Soviet citizens. Though this plan would require far more effort, it would also include aspects of all Soviet groups, creating a truly comprehensive and inclusive Soviet language for all in the State to use without playing favorites with any one group. However, both of these ideas require great effort and fly in the face of the late Rykov’s dream, so the debate around this move has been fierce to say the least. In the end, it is up to Premier Zhdanov to decide the fate of Soviet language."

russoc.136.d:0 "One of the members of the PLSR and the leaders of the legalist wing, Isaak Zakharovich Steinberg, wrote and published a biography of the party leader Maria Alexandrovna Spiridonova. It tells her life path, starting from her work as a convict, joining the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and ending with becoming the leader of revolutionary Russia.\n\nThe fact that a difficult future awaits Maria became clear during her studies at the Tambov Women's Gymnasium. The girl often argued with teachers, demanding respect for human rights and criticizing the leadership. But, despite numerous scandals, Spiridonova was never expelled from the gymnasium, allowing her to graduate from an educational institution in 1902. At that time, her parents began to have financial problems, and Maria got a job as a clerk in the provincial noble assembly.\n\nSoon, the local Socialist-Revolutionaries drew attention to the active girl, who was distinguished by outstanding oratorical abilities. In her face, they saw the ideal candidate for the role of leader, capable of eloquence to make the crowd follow. And soon she joined the fighting squad of the party.\n\nAt numerous party meetings and protest demonstrations, Maria Alexandrovna felt like a fish in water. Her burning gaze and eloquence became her trademark "chips" - these skills led the girl to her first arrest. It happened in the spring of 1905, but soon Spiridonova was released.\n\nThe arrest and the general situation in the country led Maria Alexandrovna to the conclusion that it was necessary to achieve her goals in more radical ways. Protests and demonstrations did not cause the desired effect. By "radical methods" Spiridonova meant murder. The Socialist-Revolutionaries had an enemy - adviser to the Tambov provincial government Gavriil Luzhenovsky, who "distinguished himself" by unjustified cruelty during the suppression of peasant unrest in the Tambov region in 1905.\n\nAt the beginning of 1906, the Socialist-Revolutionary Committee decided to liquidate Luzhenovsky. The question arose: who dares to stain their hands in blood? Maria Alexandrovna volunteered. For several days, she followed the councilor's movements around the city and waited for the right moment. And when he arrived, the revolutionary took out a pistol and shot several times at Luzhenovsky. There is still no consensus on what happened next. According to one version, Spiridonova wanted to commit suicide, but the Cossacks managed to detain her. According to another, she began to walk from side to side, repeating: “I killed him! I killed him!"\nThis event became decisive for Spiridonova in her life. She spent over 10 years in prison when she was finally granted amnesty by the Provisional Government in 1917. \nHer further life is connected exclusively with the revolution: having taken an active part in the October Revolution and supporting the Bolsheviks, she became the most famous woman in Russia. But during the revolution, she made a number of mistakes - both the totalitarian bureaucratic Bolshevik Party and the petty-bourgeois party of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries turned out to be her enemies. But if during the first revolution socialism collapsed, then the second revolution destroyed Russian capitalism and brought the socialist utopian ideas of Maria Alexandrovna to final triumph..."

Volsky at the same time rejects any possibility of opportunism and cooperation with the bourgeois parties, mainly with the Kadets or the right Mensheviks.

She did not recognize the voice of her beloved grandmother, but decided that she was simply hoarse from a cold.\nWhen Little Red Riding Hood entered the house, she wondered why her grandmother had such big eyes, hands, ears and teeth.

He tried to explain to the crowd of thousands the true essence of the new ideology of the Soviet state - National Bolshevism.\n"National Bolshevism is by no means a new phenomenon for our Communist Party. National Bolshevism is primarily the ideology of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Lenin was the first National Bolshevik who raised a national liberation revolution against the British, German and French exploiters who held Russian people in slavery for more than 200 years.It was thanks to Vladimir Ilyich that the defeat of capitalism happened, which consisted in the nationalization of the property of the bourgeoisie, who had long lost any connection with the Russian people.The landlords and bourgeois hated everything Russian, spoke exclusively in French for centuries and oppressed Russian peasants and workers, considering them second-class people.Therefore, the Russian and other peoples of Russia supported the Bolshevik Party in its struggle against foreign invaders!Lenin in February 1918, during the offensive of the troops of the German imperialist power, issued a decree "The socialist fatherland is in danger", where urged the join the Red Army and fight the imperialists to the last drop of blood. It is indicative that the White Guards were able to defeat the state of workers and peasants only thanks to the help of the German imperialists, thereby proving that they are nothing more than their puppets and traitors to Russia.\nThanks to the second revolution, the true people's party of workers and peasants, the Bolshevik Party, was able to take power back into its own hands.\nThe essence of National Bolshevism is a sizzling hatred for the anti-human trinity system: liberalism/bourgeois democracy/capitalism. A man of rebellion, the National Bolshevik sees his mission in the destruction of the old system to the ground.

But even more incredible is the fact that Spiridonova and Bukharin always acted as a united front, as one political unit. As early as 1918, at the time of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, Bukharin, as leader of the Left Communists, supported the Left Socialist Revolutionaries in their anti-victory rhetoric. There were even rumors that Nikolai Ivanovich was ready to arrest Lenin in order to break the Brest Peace Treaty and continue the war with Germany. After the defeat of the Bolsheviks in 1920 and the creation of the People's Socialist Party in the mid-1920s, Bukharin again began to view the Left Socialist Socialists as potential allies. In the mid-1930s, a de facto political alliance was created between the NSP and the PLSR.\nNow both Nikolai Ivanovich and Maria Alexandrovna became leaders of socialist Russia.

russoc.158.d:0 "Among the leaders of the minority of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party headed by Volsky is Nadezhda Bryullova-Shaskolskaya. After the February Revolution, she was elected to the Northern Regional and Petrograd Provincial Committees of the PSR and represented the SRs in the bureau of the Council of People's Socialist Parties. She also appeared on the pages of the party press. Thus, in the daily newspaper \"Land and Freedom\" her feuilleton was published under the title \"Czechs in Austria\".\nAt the III Congress of the Socialist-Revolutionaries (May 25 - June 4, 1917), Nadezhda Bryullova-Shaskolskaya was the main speaker on the national question. Bryullova-Shaskolskaya opposed the identification of the nation with the bourgeois state. In her speeches she defended the concept of the nation as a working people. According to this report, the Congress of the PSR spoke in favor of introducing in Russia \"a form of a federal democratic republic with territorial and national autonomy within the ethnographic settlement of peoples, with the basic laws of the country ensuring both the rights of national minorities in localities with a mixed population, and in general public rights for all the languages to be spoken by the working people of Russia.\" At the Central Course of the Society in commemoration of February 27, 1917 \"Culture and Freedom\" gave lectures \"The National Question\" and \"History of Revolutionary Movement in Russia\".\nAt the IV Congress of the Party, N. V. Bryullova-Shaskolskaya advocated the reorganization of the party on a federal basis and the unification of national socialist parties.\nAfter the revolution of the center-left Socialist Revolutionaries, Bryullova-Shaskolskaya initiated a project of unification of all peoples of Russia into a single whole. According to her plan, the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries should become an all-Union party that would unite all the peoples of Russia. Thus, she opposes both Great Russian nationalism and \"parochial\" nationalism."

russoc.159.d:0 "With the failures of Trotsky being painfully apparent to all during the Russian Civil War and the failed revolution, the old face of Communist Internationalism has been forced into a life of exile and disgrace, forever blacklisted from any self-respecting Socialist organization on Earth and formerly forever in hiding and on the run until he met his timely demise while attempting to cross the Bering Sea into Alaska, sinking beneath the frigid waters and icy waves, forever freeing the world from the stench of his failure. However, with his absence, a void was created - a void filled by Osip Aaronovitch Piatnitsky. \n\nBorn under the Tsardom in the Kovno Governorate to Jewish-Lithuanian parents, his original surname was Tarshis before he changed it to the pseudonym Piatnitsky to avoid the Okhrana’s purges, coming from the word Piatnitsa, or ‘Friday’ - his first Socialist revolutionary group made up of local union workers and tailors in his hometown. From these humble origins, ‘The Man Known as Friday’ as he was nicknamed rose to become a true revolutionary, joining Lenin in the Internationalist wing of the RSDLP and rising to the top while running a newspaper in the heart of the Eastern Front during the Great War. \n\nA contemporary of other Internationalists active in Russia such as the great General Tukhachevsky, Piatnitsky has risen to become the political and civilian face of Russian Internationalism, and he has worked hard to clean the image and reputation of his movement and thoughtform from the stain left by the foul failure he replaced. Going so far as to try to entirely erase the term ‘Trotskyism’ from the Russian lexicon as an alternative word for Russian International Communism, this new shining red star instead pushes the term Piatniskyism as a suitable replacement. Though he is without much support aside from his friends under the Red Napoleon in the Red Army, Piatnitsky is still a brilliant theorist and another example of a true Socialist patriot here in Russia."

They were met by a government car and soon they were placed in the Hotel Metropol. What was it all about? Why were these gentlemen not arrested, or at best executed, and their memory wiped from the face of the earth? Until recently, the Bolsheviks were the terror of all of Europe, but a small group of people who no longer had as much influence and were hated by many. They have no chance of seizing power."

During all these 15 years the underground cells were active in Russia, directed by Cheka from abroad. By [GetYear] the leader of the Cheka in Russia is Georgy Blagonravov - a man with no principles, except one - everything for the revolution.\n\nWith the Bolsheviks in power, too weak now, Blagonravov makes his first move - he sent the message to all local councils and his message was published in all newspapers.

On the other side there are Proletkultists, Molotov, Blagonravov and Kamenev, who are denouncing the revisionists and looking forward implementing the First Five-Year plan.

With our rule still shaky, the Left SRs use any possibility to terrorize the nation and our party. This must be stopped as soon as possible. So, there are several choices and we must make one of them.\nThe first one is to ban the party and arrest the leaders, including Spiridonova and Kamkov. The second choice is to send them in exile to France, where they won't be able to influence us. The third choice is try to appease them by allowing some freedoms to other socialist parties to show that the New Bolsheviks are not that savages from the past."

bolsheviks.39.d:0 "The NSP is commonly viewed by the Bolsheviks as a traitor Bukharin's revisionist pseudo-socialist party, that is nothing more than a parody on the Right SR party. Although some believe that NEP program is good for the start and trust Bukharin's loyalty to socialism, the others believe that he is a traitor of the party and should be dealt with as a traitor."

bolsheviks.41.d:0 "No sooner had the new chairman of the party taken his post, as the leadership of the Cheka attempted an armed putsch. A successful one. [ROOT.GetLeader] was arrested in his own office and sent under investigation for seizing state power by deceiving and misleading high-ranking party members. Having departed from the orthodox path and program of the Bolshevik Party, [ROOT.GetLeader] threatened the stability of state power and allowed the party to break up into warring factions. For the sake of maintaining stability in the state, the leadership of the Cheka decided to dismiss the revisionist and traitor who tried to take away the future from the workers' and peasants' society."

bolsheviks.42.d:0 "Some days earlier the so-called 'Idel-Ural' government have declared their independence from us! Led by a joint government of Tatars and Bashkirs and their representative, a Tatar Nationalist Shafi Almas, they try to use our instability to finally become independent from the 'Russian colonizers'. They are unable to understand that the Soviet government will liberate them from capitalism and bourgeois-nationalism that have for centuries enslaved common Tatars and Bashkirs. But that was their choice and we should decide what to do with this choice."

The revolutionary sailors have already disembarked in Petrograd and seized several important buildings. It seems we have to give up power or face drastic consequences."

bolsheviks.45.d:0 "The revolutionary sailors quickly seized all important building in Petrograd, and in other major cities and villages they were joined by revolutionary peasants and anarchists who managed to overthrow our rule. With no support, the Sovnarkom had to flee the country, but nobody knows where exactly - perhaps they were relocated in the French Commune. Nevertheless, Pavel Dybenko has proclaimed the supreme rule of Tsentrobalt and now all the power in the country belongs to him."

Workers and peasants! Soldiers and officers! The time of capitalist oppression is over. The imperialists of Germany and America are already preparing to lay down their arms and be defeated, to realize the power and strength of the workers 'and peasants' state. Our allies in France and Britain are ready to assist us in the return of our fraternal peoples to their homeland-Ukrainians, Belarusians, friendly Baltic socialists.\n\nComrades! To achieve this goal, we need to rally around the Bolshevik party, because only the Bolshevik party can lead our country to victory - to the power of the workers and peasants! I appeal to the revisionists and the Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik opposition, as well as to the followers of the traitor Bukharin! Lay down your weapons, stop fighting. The Soviet government is already here and it will not leave. The government will be organized through the Soviets, under the supervision of the Council of People's Commissars. The enemies of the people will be brought to justice. Once again, citizens! Express your opinion through the Soviets of workers and peasants, and not through Bukharin-Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik revisionist nonsense! Only through cooperation can our nation find unity!'"

bolsheviks.47.t:0 "Centralization of Power"
bolsheviks.47.d:0 "Despite the assurances that the Bolshevik party is democratic to the core, Grigory Zinoviev declared the centralization of power in the hands of authorized Soviets. He says that this measure is temporary and certainly forced because society is unstable. In the future, when the country is sufficiently developed, the power will be decentralized. This decision, however, was received ambiguously by some of the more right-wing members of the party. They were outraged by Zinoviev's decision to centralize power, as this contradicts Marxism. However, Zinoviev, our leader, was able to quickly convince this bunch of unrighteous Bolsheviks of their wrongness"

bolsheviks.48.t:0 "Dissatisfaction With The Collectivization"
bolsheviks.48.d:0 "To our surprise, many peasants were dissatisfied with the collectivization. They were dissatisfied with the socialization of the land, the good that socialism brought them. They are in revolt, demanding the return of their crops, their livestock, and, worst of all, their property. This month, about 3,000 peasant riots have already been suppressed, and a terrible famine has broken out in some regions. The peasants flee to the cities and become workers, because they think that the life of the worker is much better. They are right only in one thing - it is a state for workers, built by workers. While they are rioting, we have achieved results that Kerensky could only dream of. We must bear this burden of collectivization until the end of time, for all power comes from the people, and we are their representatives."

Long live Zinoviev, the Vozhd of the Proletariat!\n\n\nGrigory Zinoviev is the man who led our Communist Party forward to a bright future for 20 years. Having become a worthy successor to Lenin, Zinoviev rallied the party and never left it. Even in the most difficult and cruel days of the Civil war, when Zinoviev was forced to capitulate and go abroad, all this time in exile he remained loyal to the cause of Lenin and socialism. Let his name forever remain in history, and monuments to Zinoviev will be erected in all Russian cities."

bolsheviks.50.t:0 "Famine!"
bolsheviks.50.d:0 "In our country, as reported to the Chairman, entire regions are facing a terrible famine. The main factors contributing to the famine, according to the report, are the forced collectivization of agriculture, forced grain purchases combined with rapid industrialization, a reduction in the agricultural labor force, and several severe droughts. All this, of course, is nonsense, and the main reason is the drought, and perhaps the actions of Western spies and saboteurs. In any case, we will have to deal with the famine and its consequences."

bolsheviks.52.d:0 "What is Bolshevism? Of course, the main theorist of Bolshevism is Vladimir Lenin, but many attribute to Bolshevism the ideology of the traitor Bukharin, as well as other various revisionist movements.\n\nIn fact, the ideology of Bolshevism was carefully developed first by Vladimir Ilyich, and then in exile by Grigory Zinoviev and Yevgeny Preobrazhensky. In practice, Bolshevism is a centralized country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, which exercises its power through a cohesive and disciplined Bolshevik party. These are industrialization, collectivization, and the creation of a society of justice and intolerance towards revisionists and counter-revolutionaries.\n\nHaving built such a country, we will finally rise from the ashes."

bolsheviks.53.t:0 "Chairman Kamenev"
bolsheviks.53.d:0 "Lev Kamenev, along with Grigory Zinoviev, was for a long time one of Lenin's closest associates. He became known as one of the opponents of the armed revolution in October 1917, and many have not forgotten this, both colleagues and enemies. In addition, for a long time he tried to persuade Zinoviev to reconsider his relations with other socialist parties, because after losing the civil war, Zinoviev thought that no party would accept the Bolsheviks in the coalition.\n\nHowever, history had its own plans. And now Kamenev is at the head of the party, and all the main decisions will be up to him."

bolsheviks.54.t:0 "The Fate of the Supreme Soviet"
bolsheviks.54.d:0 "Since the Bolsheviks came to power, the supreme power belonged to the Council of People's Commissars - the so-called Upper Council.\n\nKamenev suggests that the best option would be to decentralize the Sovnarkom - that is, to create a coalition government with other parties, including the Social Revolutionaries, Bukharinites and Mensheviks. This met with a sharply negative reaction among the Central Committee, where most of the members are radically opposed to coalitions with other parties.\n\nNevertheless, as long as the Council of People's Commissars is still subordinate not to the majority, but to the chairman, Kamenev has carte blanche to form a homogeneous socialist government."

bolsheviks.55.d:0 "Earlier, the Council of People's Commissars banned the activities of the left SR party in Russia and arrested its leaders.

bolsheviks.58.t:0 "A New Chairman?"
bolsheviks.58.d:0 "The most important part of creating a homogeneous socialist government and decentralizing power is to be able to concede. That is why Kamenev suggests that in the new Council of People's Commissars, decisions should be made by a majority vote and not by a single decision of the chairman. He is going to resign from the post of chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, while remaining the nominal head of state and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

After the appointment of Bukharin to the post of chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Sokolnikov announced that he was leaving the Central Committee of the RKP and the Bolshevik Party. Sokolnikov will probably leave the country, fearing persecution."

bolsheviks.60.t:0 "Zinoviev Leaves the Central Committee"
bolsheviks.60.d:0 "For almost 20 years, the chairman of the Bolshevik Party, Grigory Zinoviev, was an honest fighter for the rights of workers and an active defender of Leninism and Marxism. However, after the decision to appoint a new chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he perceived it as a betrayal and a personal insult.

bolsheviks.61.d:0 "After it became clear that all the parties that could presumably be taken into the coalition remained banned, and their leader was still under arrest, Kamenev had no choice but to resign as chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. This role is claimed by many Bolshevik figures, and it is likely that soon the Central Committee of the RKP will re-elect a new candidate."

All parties work together for the happiness of the citizens of their state, and do not fight with each other for power.\n\nThis, perhaps, was the ideal to which Lenin aspired, but which he could not realize because of the time when the war of man with man raged everywhere. We will remember Comrade Lenin, because it was he who lit up the way for us-a worthy way, how a person should live.

proletkult.1.a:0 "Long live the Proletkult!"

proletkult.2.t:0 "The Issue of Illiteracy"
proletkult.2.d:0 "The absence of Proletkult in republican Russia has led to the fact that most of the population of our country cannot be called literate. Even so, they are not literate from the point of view of proletarian culture. Various capitalist, bourgeois and philistine views have enslaved the consciousness of these people, which means that measures must be taken to proletarize their culture.\n\nThe new program within the framework of the Proletkult was called "Likbez" or the elimination of illiteracy. Active literacy training will begin, and the literate will be obliged to teach the illiterate through labor service. Illiterate students will be taught: to read clear printed and written fonts; to make brief notes necessary in life and official affairs; to read and write down whole and fractional numbers, percentages, to understand diagrams; the students will be explained the main issues of the construction of the Soviet state."

proletkult.4.d:0 "Mayakovsky proposed to introduce his own ideas into the Proletkult - what he calls Social-Futurism. He proposes to create a society of educated and talented people. Everyone should master any art - the one that he or she will like. Training in painting, and especially in modern styles, architecture, and music, will be necessary and mandatory for everyone, both adults and children. The creation of the Soviet intelligentsia is the ultimate goal of the Mayakovsky plan. And he sincerely does not understand and is not going to recognize the right of people to choose if they should do arts or not. 'Art is not a hindrance to work' - as Mayakovsky correctly put it\nThe only question is whether the People's Commissariat of Education will support such an initiative."

proletkult.5.d:0 "Aleksei Gastev, a scientist and proletarian who worked in Europe for many years, argues that the People's Commissariat of Education is obliged to put the issue of trade unions on the agenda. According to Gastev, Russia needs to combine the Soviet and syndicalist system of government. All economic power should belong to trade unions and autonomous collectives (syndicates) of workers, and all political power should belong to Soviets elected at all levels.\n\nGastev's ideas have surprised some people's commissars, but many recognize the success and viability of the syndicalist system of government.

Of course, many people are skeptical: after all, Marxism is equal to atheism. However, Lunacharsky insists on his own, as the head of the People's Commissariat of Education, he has the right to do so. Unless, of course, the ideas of Mayakovsky or Gastev are more preferred by the People's Commissars."

The most possible candidate is likely to be the candidate, who has more influence and authority over Sovnarkom, and whose ideas are more liked by the People's Commissars.

Though he's not a member of the RKP, he decided to change the name of the party and become its new leader. In his first decree, the Communist party was renamed into Proletarian Party of Futurists and its main ideology was stated as Social-Futurism - a minor branch of Marxism. Though some did not like the changes, blaming Mayakovsky in revisionism - they were quickly silented by exclusion from the party.

Despite the fact that Mayakovsky made many speeches about the new ideology of the proletarian state, not everyone clearly represents the implementation of his projects in practice.\n\nIn fact, everything is much simpler than it seems. The main idea of social futurism is to create a society of talented and educated people, where everyone has mastered some art and is ready to work for the benefit of the Motherland and world socialism. Perhaps Mayakovsky's ideas are in many ways utopian and unrealizable - but with what optimism the people's poet strives for this goal!"

Admiring contemporary art is not a right or a desire, it is the duty of every law-abiding citizen who believes in socialism and hates the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe exhibitions will feature works by Kazemir Malevich, one of the leading figures of futurism and chairman of the Art Board of the Art Department of the People's Commissariat of Education, Marc Chagall , one of the leading avant-garde artists, as well as some works by Picasso brought from chaos-ridden Spain."

Music clubs will study the theory of music and sound, harmony, musical notation and musical forms. At the dance lessons, you will be able to learn harmonic movements and poses, plastic and facial expressions, tempo and rhythm, as well as master modern and popular genres.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to literary circles: in Moscow and Petrograd, master classes will be given by Velimir Khlebnikov, Anna Akhmatova, Marina Tsvetaeva, Boris Pasternak and Daniil Kharms. There are rumors that even the master of verse, the thunderstorm of all capitalists and the genius of the poetic word, will perform at the literary master class in the capital: Vladimir Mayakovsky himself."

In the same cities where there is no theater yet, it was decided to immediately build and open to the public the so-called people's theaters.\n\nCinema is also rapidly developing. Thanks to the achievements of socialism, this year viewers across the country will be able to see Sergei Eisenstein's film "Alexander Nevsky"for free. In it, the Old Russian prince confronts the imperialist invaders of the Teutonic Order, who are referred to in the film as the Germans. Surprisingly, the main antagonist, the leader of the Teutonic Knights, was named Wilhelm. Is this a reference to the German Kaiser, or is it just a satire on inhumane capitalism? In any case, the film tells about the victory of the Russian people-ordinary peasants and workers, led by the Vozhd, who composes his words in beautiful verses."

Attendance at children's clubs is mandatory and will be supervised by teachers and school principals. For adults, separate clubs will be organized, which they will be required to attend every week on weekends.\n\nThanks to the organized free exhibitions within the framework of the Proletkult, which contributed to the popularization of art among most of the citizens of the proletarian republic.

The rich culture and history of all the peoples inhabiting the Proletarian Republic should undoubtedly be perpetuated in memory. But as for the present and the future, the Proletkult takes over.\n\nThe new Soviet identity is not just a brand in the passport of citizenship. This is a new Soviet culture, a new nationality and a new language.\n\nMeasures to internationalize the Russian language and the languages of national minorities, that is, to translate them into the Latin alphabet, are not enough. What is needed is a more radical reform of the language and its slow transformation into a new one: free from the yoke of capitalism, not imposed from outside. The new Proletarian language will be based on the Latin alphabet and use Latin roots to bring our peoples closer to the peoples of the socialist countries of France, Italy and England.\n\nSo far, the measures taken by the government are not enough, but soon, perhaps even in this decade, the schools of the Proletarian Republic will learn the grammar of the PROLYAZ - the Proletarian language."

In our republic, there will be no ordinary people at all. The ultimate goal of our beautiful socialist society is to build it. Classless, without division into rich and poor, educated and uneducated, talented and untrained. Yes, they say that talent is an exceptional thing. But will you say it to Mayakovsky's face? Of course not."

proletkult.16.d:0 "Many did not take seriously the demands of the Council of People's Commissars and Chairman Mayakovsky on compulsory creative education. Moreover, even if they did, it wasn't serious. They did not put enough effort into mastering the art. This is what causes the inequality and higher position of the intelligentsia. Do you think they deserve it? Perhaps. But this is unacceptable for a socialist state that bears the proud name of a Proletarian Republic!\n\nFrom now on, and forever, the avoidance of creative activity will be prosecuted with all severity. Citizens who have given up creative activity will work for the benefit of the motherland in labor camps: build new river channels, build hydroelectric power stations, plant forest belts. They will not be useless as before. If they dare to criticize the government's decisions, their fate will be more severe. They will be shot for treason, for their pettiness, commercialism, laziness and lack of talent.\n\nRemember, citizens! The party does not forgive you for your laziness. Labor has made a man out of an ape, and creativity has made a superman out of a man. The party will never forgive you for this."

The main and key ones are undoubtedly the connection of the Baltic and White Sea through the White Sea-Baltic Canal, the connection of Moscow and the Volga through the Mayakovsky Canal, the connection of the Don and Volga through the Volgodonsk Canal, as well as the turn of the Siberian Rivers to irrigate the barren and arid lands of Central Asia.

The All-Russian Committee of Trade Unions, the VKPS, was given executive power in the fields of economy, finance, industry and trade. With the decree adopted, the People's Commissariat of Economy and Finance was abolished, and all its People's Commissars were dismissed.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the reform is to create a Soviet-syndicalist system of government, in which all political power belongs to the Soviets, and all economic power belongs to the trade unions and syndicates. In order to avoid a conflict of interest, Gastev was appointed the new chairman of the VKPS. He will oversee both the political and economic decisions of the branches of government.\n\nIn addition, by Gastev's decision, the RKP is renamed the RSPRP - the Russian Syndicalist Trade Union Labour Party.

He works all day for the success of his country. At least, that's what they say, but it's not true, because the Russian worker was a real slave.

He outlined the structure of the Institute of Labor at the VKPS and the methodology of its work. The Central Institute of Labor was recognized as 'an institution for the development, demonstration and promotion of the principles of scientific organization of labor and training of the labor force'.\nThe main activity of the CITA will be the problems of rationalization of methods and methods of work, training of workers. Gastev's 'Labor Attitudes (Ustanovki)' doctrine will introduce an original technology of vocational training — the "CIT system", focused on standardized, accelerated, programmed and mass training of skilled workers. This method is based on training workers in certain, most rational labor techniques for manufacturing products on the basis of dividing operations into techniques and movements, studying them and selecting the most rational ones.\n\nA special syndicate, called the 'Ustanovka' under the Gastev program, will be organized under the CIT, it will send specialists-consultants to introduce innovations in scientific work at enterprises.

These ideas formed the basis of the Soviet-Syndical system.\n\nAs practice shows, the system works well, largely due to the leadership of Gastev, as a balancing element in the political system.\n\nIn addition, Bogdanov introduced the concept of technical intelligentsia. These are the most educated and successful people in our republic, who should be at the head of certain departments and manage the rest.

This is something more than a belief in fairy tales. The proletarian religion is the belief in a different God. The one who moves our society forward - Progress.

Lenin is not just a true revolutionary, a courageous man who fell victim to the counter-revolutionary terror of the Social Revolutionaries, but also the main personification of the revolution and socialism. He died for a great idea - a society without masters, where everyone is equal and there is no exploitation, oppression and property. A society where a person does not own a person. It was Lenin who showed us the path of true equality - what we should strive for. Even though he is no longer with us, we will always remember that he sacrificed his life to make our lives better.\n\nLet the exaltation of the memory of the national and international hero, the savior of all the weak and the poor, begin.

molotov.1.t:0 "Molotov's National-Bolshevism"
molotov.1.d:0 "In his first speech as head of the party, Molotov announced the new course of the country - national Bolshevism.\n\nFor many delegates, this concept was not available for understanding, and therefore, the chairman made a theoretical justification for the new ideology of the party.\n\nNational Bolshevism proceeds from the obvious fact that only Bolshevism and the Bolshevik party can pull the country out of medieval feudalism and chaos. In the civil war, reaction won - and the republic was doomed. For 20 years, the peasants waited for land, and the workers for factories. But the landlords and capitalists who retained power were only enriched by German handouts.\n\nThe time of pain and suffering of our people is over. Only Bolshevism can save them. Not the syndicalism inherent in the Western countries, nor the Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik capitalism, nor the revisionism of Bukharin. Only one party, unjustly expelled and excommunicated from the people, can change life in the country. And this is the party of the Bolsheviks."
molotov.1.a:0 "Bolshevism will prevail."

molotov.2.t:0 "Council of Labour and Defense"
molotov.2.d:0 "The Council of Labor and Defense was first established in November 1918, in the midst of the blazing civil War. The Council served as an emergency "national economic cabinet", issuing emergency decrees in an attempt to support industrial production for the Red Army in the face of economic collapse.\n\nHowever, the Council of Labor and Defense did not live long, as did the power of the Bolsheviks. With the end of the civil war, the council was dissolved. However, now, according to Molotov, the council should be restored, because, as the chairman said, we are still in a state of civil war. Peasant uprisings, small-nation uprisings, capitalists and imperialists, revisionists and opportunists, Transamur traitors-all are ready to take advantage of the weakness of the Soviet republic and tear it apart.\n\nThe Labor and Defense Council will be restored. And it will be headed by Chairman Molotov. Our economy will develop by leaps and bounds, collectivization and industrialization are waiting for us - and the faster the better for us and the worse for our enemies."

molotov.3.t:0 "The Efremovites"
molotov.3.d:0 "Mikhail Efremov was just a peasant from the collective farm "Iskra" of the Beloglazovsky district of the Altai Territory on the border with hostile Mongolia, became the owner of the world record yield (he received on an area of 3.6 hectares 61 quintals of wheat per hectare, and on 8.5 hectares — 54 quintals).\n\nWith his feat of organizing labor and defense of the republic, Yefremov inspired many other collective farmers, thus becoming the initiator of the movement of the country's foremost agricultural leaders for high yields. The movement has become incredibly popular, and it is quite possible that soon many citizens will be inspired by the feat of Efremov and become leaders in their industries. The movement has already received the name "Efremovites" after the initiator, and Efremov himself was appointed chairman of the kolhoz."

molotov.4.d:0 "Molotov, whose party pseudonym literally translates as 'Hammer', gives great importance to labor and defense. Having replaced the hammer and sickle with a symbol of totalism - and at the same time a symbol of labor and defense - the sword and hammer, Molotov is ready to continue his program.\n\n'With a blow of the hammer' is the new motto of all the proletarians and peasants of the country. Only with a cold look, in the sweat of our brow, can we become stronger and more secure. We need to immediately increase the rate of production, and the sooner the better."
molotov.4.a:0 "All for the defense of the motherland."

molotov.5.t:0 "Declaring War on Unemployment"
molotov.5.d:0 "During the Kerensky regime, unemployment only increased every year, but those days are long gone. In our state, there will be no unemployment at all. It's very simple. Until recently, unemployed people were only condemned and subjected to social ostracism, they did not want to communicate with them, because they are not ready to serve labor and socialism. However, now everything has changed. The Council of Labor and Defense proposed to introduce administrative penalties, including fines and arrests for the unemployed, but Chairman Molotov proposed a more ingenious idea. After all, you can't argue that the unemployed are parasites. And when they run out of money to pay fines, they will sit under arrest - and rest.\n\nMolotov proposed to toughen the punishment and make it criminal. But no, they won't shoot anyone. Instead, labor camps will be created in which convicted parasites will work for the benefit of the country. The so - called General Management of the camps, under the leadership of both the Council of Labor and Defense and the Cheka, will control the work of prisoners."

Thanks to the triumph of the sword and the hammer, our country is successfully developing from an agrarian semi-feudal backward state into an industrially developed socialist state. National Bolshevism, as a belief in the Bolshevik party and in the peoples inhabiting the territory of the former Russian Empire, triumphed in the minds of ordinary people. They realized how right the Bolsheviks were in their endeavors, how wise and clever the great chairman Vyacheslav Molotov is."

Mikhail, on the one hand, is a rather hot-tempered person who does not seriously focus on work, on the other hand, Julius is really a talented security officer. However, the situation in the country should also be taken into account. It is full of spies and various counter-revolutionaries, but on the other hand, the economy, already destroyed by the German henchman Kerensky, is completely fucked up. It is necessary to make a decision on what to focus on."

kaganovich.3.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was stunned by the news that his brother Mikhail, moreover, the People's Commissar of the National Economy, was in the drunk tank last night. Like a real rowdy, Mikhail, having got drunk in the 'Rumochnaya', began to shout near the street Solyanka in Moscow 'the Internationale'. Residents of nearby houses complained about the night noise and the good thing that they called the police, and did not call directly the Lubyanka, which is only half an hour on foot. The police officer who arrived at the scene found the People's Commissar lying on the ground, seemingly unconscious, drunk in a frenzy. But in his usual manner, Mikhail was only joking. When the policeman approached the drunk and began to shake him, trying to bring him to his senses, Mikhail quickly opened his eyes and laughed in the face of the dazed policeman. Of course, soon after that, he was detained and taken to the local drunk tank in the Kitaygorodsky district. There the People's Commissar safely slept through, and in the morning, as if nothing had happened, went to work.\n\nNow he sits with a guilty face in front of the chairman, and assures him of his innocence."

kaganovich.4.t:0 "Another Incident"
kaganovich.4.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was informed that his brother Mikhail, who was also the People's Commissar of the National Economy, had failed all the deadlines for the delivery of an important agricultural object. At work, Mikhail joked a lot, shouted at the top of his voice, and did everything from playing checkers with local peasants to tipping a glass of rural moonshine. This behavior of the People's Commissar, of course, is irresponsible and destructive. Mikhail had already been warned that he would be removed from his leadership position in the party and expelled from the Central Committee. However, he did not listen to the advice and continued to behave like a ridiculous child. By the decision of the congress, it was unanimously decided to expel Mikhail from the Central Committee and appoint a more suitable person to this position.\n\nEyewitnesses say that Mikhail endured his resignation hard, ranging from a heavy drinking binge, ending with the denial of Marxism and cursing Lenin, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Yagoda, Molotov, Kamenev and, finally, his own brother Lazar. This was not good for anything, so by the decision of the party, Mikhail was appointed to the post of director of the aviation plant, where he would have been at least a little happier."
kaganovich.4.a:0 "Well, every family has one black sheep."

kaganovich.5.t:0 "No Happy-End"
kaganovich.5.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was informed that today at 6 o'clock in the morning his brother Mikhail, the director of the aviation plant, was found shot dead in his own office at the plant. Despite the fact that there are no clear reasons for what he did there so early, forensic experts agree that Mikhail did not leave the plant in the evening. Left alone with an expensive foreign cognac, Mikhail drank a bottle, and, being in an extremely intoxicated state, took a gun out of his pocket. After lighting a Cuban cigar, he sat down in a chair and wrote a suicide note in a barely legible hand. In it, he said that he could no longer live, having lost the chair of the People's Commissar. He also wrote about how great it was for him to live in exile in France and that he is very sorry that he returned to his homeland. Unable to cope with the amount of work, Mikhail decided that he was no longer needed by the country, but he remains committed to the cause of Lenin to the end.\n\nHis body was delivered in a closed coffin to Moscow, and a farewell ceremony will take place soon."

Back in the 1920s, with the assistance of the German company Siemens Bauunion, the Kerensky government was able to find funds for the construction of the first line of the Moscow subway. The line stretches from Ostozhenka Street to the square of Three Railway Stations. Following the plan drawn up by the Germans, Lazar Kaganovich, together with Gosplan, built new sections of the Moscow metro in record time. The new line stretched from Bryansky Railway Station to Kursky Railway Station through the center of the capital, passing under Red Square, where a huge transfer hub was built for the third line - from Rzhevsky Railway station to Saratovsky Railway Station.\n\nThis is not the end of Kaganovich's renovation, as a huge plan was made for the renovation of Moscow - watering its rivers and landscaping. New metro lines will also be opened soon."

Having a long story of party participation, Kaganovich quickly became the second person in the party. As Krestinsky, Kaganovich himself was inspired by the Georgian Bolshevism, even though he rejected its nationalistic and chauvinistic tendencies. In Moscow, the supporters of Kaganovich are now known as Social-Patriots and it seems that this name fits good in the new policies of the RKP. Nevertheless, Kaganovich is likely to become Krestinsky's successor in the upcoming years, so we should keep an eye on him."

However, the evidence of the Cheka, as always, is reinforced concrete:\n\nDuring the Civil War, Zhukov did not participate in the red movement, but preferred to sit out with a wound.

A number of cases have been discovered in which even foreign intelligence spies managed to infiltrate State security agencies.\n\nThe same practice of an undivided attitude to the nomination of people, as well as the lack of political educational work, created conditions under which direct traitors-Bukharinists-found themselves in the leading Chekist work. Some of them systematically informed the members of the Bukharinist organization about the materials available in the NKVD about the anti-Soviet activities of the latter.\nHowever, the delay in exposing the anti-Soviet activities of the Bukharinist bandits is due not only to these general shortcomings in the work of the State Security agencies, but also to the specific criminal activities of certain responsible Cheka employees, and especially Molchanov, Firin, and Agranov. As a result of such poor management of the agency, there were many traitors among the latter. In the course of the investigation of the anti-Soviet Bukharinist center in Moscow alone, 65 agents of traitors were identified who systematically misinformed the State Security agencies, confused the whole case, and actively contributed to the unpunished activities of the Bukharinists.\n\nIn this regard, the party leadership considers it necessary to judge Yagoda's clique, namely, including himself, as well as Molchanov, Firin and Agranov, for obstructing the work of the Cheka and the creation of an anti-Soviet Bukharinist center in the state security bodies."

nkvd.60.a:0 "A happy society!"

tsentrobalt.1.t:0 "No Masters!"
tsentrobalt.1.d:0 "The Committee of revolutionary sailors who saved the country and pulled it out of the hell of the Bolshevik failure decided that Pavel Dybenko would serve as the country's interim leader until the transition to the stage of real anarcho-communism. As an influential sailor and a man who can restore order with a firm hand, anarchists understand that this measure is necessary while society is still unstable and the army is a serious danger.\n\nPavel Dybenko will lead the country to a bright future of anarcho-communism, where every person is equal to another, and people are brothers! And if he dares to abuse his power, we must remember that our mother is anarchy, and no one has the right to rule over another person. And if the freedom of one ends where the freedom of the other begins, then Dybenko's freedom will end very quickly."
tsentrobalt.1.a:0 "Anarchism is beautiful!"

tsentrobalt.2.t:0 "Dealing with Army"
tsentrobalt.2.d:0 "The army is the bulwark of one man's power over another. Even the socialist army. It is time to end the division into soldiers and officers, and the generals must recognize the fact that the army will be built on the basis of a voluntary militia, and not on a conscripted regular army of soldiers. Those who are not able to recognize this will be deprived of their position and removed from any power. From now on, the command of the army will be carried out by the anarchist defense councils."
tsentrobalt.2.a:0 "No masters in the army."

tsentrobalt.3.t:0 "Freedom for All!"
tsentrobalt.3.d:0 "Everyone understands that cooperation is more profitable than competition. Henceforth and forever private property is abolished! In the meantime, we have to reorganize production and consumption throughout the country, and when we achieve this goal and all the benefits of our Homeland are in the hands of the communes, we will cancel the money.\n\nIndividuals and groups will be able to use and control whatever resources they need, as our goal is to put the product, assembled or produced, at the disposal of everyone, giving everyone the freedom to consume it as they see fit in their own home."
tsentrobalt.3.a:0 "Equality and Prosperity."

tsentrobalt.4.t:0 "The Arrival of Petrichenko and the True Anarchists"
tsentrobalt.4.d:0 "Famed Anarchist Stepan Petrichenko came from the French commune to free Russia. In December 1917, he proclaimed the Soviet Republic of Sailors and Builders, but soon he had to evacuate to Kronstadt following rising tensions and calls for his murder among the other revolutionary factions. However, he remained committed to the ideas of anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism to the end, and he took the loss of Makhno in Ukraine and the repressive anti-anarchist policies of the Bolsheviks very hard. In the wake of their failed revolution, Petrichenko followed Makhno to France, where he became a close ally and collaborator to the famed Bat’ko and his new French allies.\n\nNow that the flag of the Central Bank is flying over Russia, Petrichenko has returned to take power from the hands of the usurper Dybenko. He publicly declared that Dybenko is not an adherent of anarchism and established himself as a notorious scoundrel, a Bolshevik brawler. The memory of Petrichenko and his anarchist commune is still alive among the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, as is the memory of who Dybenko is. \n\nDybenko, being already a representative of the Central Bank and Free Russia, was notoriously rowdy and a drunkard. Among anarchists, there was an opinion that Dybenko, indeed, is not suitable for the role of leader, and that his behavior discredits anarchism. Petrichenko's popularity is growing every day, and the anarchist communes have nominated him instead of Dybenko to represent the anarchists of Russia abroad. As in the case of Dybenko, his role will be nominal, but maybe it will be better when we are represented by a recognized anarchist, and not some Bolshevik drunkard and murderer? \n\nHowever, opposing both of these viewpoints is a third, far more radical option. Arriving in Russia with his old ally and friend Petrichenko, the beloved Bat’ko - or father - Nestor Makhno has integrated himself by Petrichenko’s side and has served as an international beacon for anarchists across the world to bear witness to. With his reputation, his devotion to true Anarchism, and his popularity among our movement all preceding him, many have come to demand that neither Dybenko or Petrichenko should guide our new anarchist society, but instead it should be Bat’ko Makhno as the one who will be our shepherd. Though Makhno’s failures in Ukraine during the revolution still hang in the air, these past missteps have only served to fuel his drive, and with the other heads of the movement at each other's throats, Makhno may very well be the best candidate to preserve the unity of our movement as well as its total dedication to Anarchist principles. What shall our final say be - would our new anarchist movement best be in the hands of a respected anarcho-communist revolutionary, a drunken sailor and war hero, or the father of modern slavic anarchism himself?"
tsentrobalt.4.a:0 "Get rid of Dybenko!"
tsentrobalt.4.b:0 "Dybenko shall stay."
tsentrobalt.4.c:0 "Mother Anarchy loves her sons, but so too does the Father. Makhno is our man!"

tsentrobalt.5.t:0 "Plunder the Loot!"
tsentrobalt.5.d:0 "Once Lenin announced the slogan: "Plunder the Loot!" And it made sense.\nFor centuries, ordinary people were robbed: first by the tsars, then by the capitalists, and other exploiters. Their so-called property was looted illegally, because they used violence against others. They should no longer own it, and now it's national property! Everyone has the right!\n\nLoot the looters, people! Take it as your personal property and use it. There's nothing wrong with taking it back. And so it will be until all the property stolen over the years by the capitalists becomes public property"
tsentrobalt.5.a:0 "That's fair."

Instead he drew closer to the French unions during a stint in exile in the country in 1914. Now at the head of the Party he will probably seek to liberalize the party and mend the schisms of old. Whether he will succeed is another matter. No matter what he decides to do he will have to fight both internal and external dissention to do it."

Under her rule however there will be no patriarchal house slave relationship. All marriages will be equal unions, under the Law as well as any other measure. The New Soviet Woman will be strong and free, an equal pillar of any household. There will be grumbling from the conservatives but let them grumble.

We must smash these monopolies and localise the ownership of the factories if we are to solve this problem. The heavy hand of the state will work wonders in this endeavor. With our control over the apparatus of state there is little these holdovers of a bygone era can do against us. When we give the factories back to the people they will rejoice and work twice as hard.

Our nation however has revealed the first true Workers’ Constitution, built by and for the Workers of our nation. The rights of freedom of speech, assembly, association, press and thought among many others are the first declarations of this new Constitution. It also mandates vacation days, time off work, equal rights for all, among many many others.

This signifies a break from the strict Bukharinist that many expected the Party to tow while still not alienating Bukharin’s many followers and allies within the Party. Some of Ryutin’s principle pillars are the opposition to the radical industrialization of the nation which he claims to have had a severe effect on the economic life of the peasant. While he does still support industrialization he instead wishes it to be more measured than the rapid growth many other leaders hope for.

Some within our party have pushed for this for some time. They claim outside investment will only boost our economy to higher heights. Meanwhile the rest of the Party has reacted severely to this. They claim this is a naked attempt to undercut the Revolution and everything it stands for. They argue introducing capitalism, no matter how ‘measured’ , will just give the international bourgeoisie a toehold in our nation to undermine our government and encourage counterrevolution.

The people are prosperous, our economy rivals any other on the planet and Soviet goods are exported across the world to be eagerly bought by those who marvel at the ingenuity of the Soviet Worker.

However Premier Ryutin has made him proud as the inheritor to the Revolution. By merging the ideas of Bukharin and Lenin he has formed the perfect brand of socialism which has finally had its chance to prove itself on the world stage.

Not only will wealth caps make sure they do not accrue too large a hoard, but their constant donations to their local areas and to social programs has kept them well off, but not moguls like existed in the West.

Except this time the upper crust claims to do what it does for the benefit of the lower classes. This naked hypocrisy cannot stand.

To that end we shall abolish the Soviets and instead reconstitute them as Syndicates.

This decree has been met with uproarious anger from the Republics and many have begun to openly discuss leaving the Union. This is flagrantly illegal and also, conveniently, just the pretext we need for this new purge. We shall use any means necessary to upend the dissentious Unionist control over the Republics and replace them with men more amicable to our cause. This will be very risky, some will not come quietly and we are already alerting the Army to respond to potential revolts.

Under Congressional watch the unions will be more motivated to boost productivity, clamp down on dissension and maintain party unity. Not only that but with all the Unions reporting to one central body we can more effectively coordinate their efforts to maximize the economic potential they can bring."

SOV_Dissolve_The_Union_desc:0 "It is done. The Union is dead. Kuznetzov’s dream of a unified Russian Syndicate, one united behind him for the efforts of the Revolution, has been made manifest. The Autonomies heed to his beck and call, the Army marches before him ready to destroy the enemies of the Revolution, the workers work doubly as hard as they did before, confident that with every bolt they make, every gun they manufacture, the World Revolution grows ever nearer. At the same time the world trembles in fear as the Russian bear pushes aside her previous decades of inaction and hibernation and wakes once more, angry and ready for vengeance against all those who wish to see her laid low."

SOV_Premier_Zhdanov_desc:0 "With our dear Premier's death, the responsibility of leading Russia towards full realization of Communism falls to his close confidant and chosen successor - Andrei Zhdanov. A former member of the RKP, Zhdanov abandoned the Zinovievist party over disagreements with their interpretation of the ideological works of Lenin. Eventually, he joined the NSP and became aligned with the Centralist wing, becoming the man in charge of the agricultural sector after Aleksey Rykov's election. Now Zhdanov sets one goal before himself and all of Russia, the fulfillment of Rykov's and Lenin's dream through even greater central authority."

SOV_Redefine_Russian_Identity_desc:0 "While it is true that our administration focused mostly on the well being of ethnic Russians, that doesn't mean we can allow Great Russian chauvinism to hinder the drive towards Communism. If Lenin's dream is to be ever achieved, we must redefine what it means to be a Russian. No longer will it entail an ethnos or an inhabitant of Russia's borders. From now on, a new identity shall rise; a purely Soviet man for a purely Soviet nation."

But our leader knows exactly what he is doing, and is sure that his close friend Kuznetsov can bring much needed patriotic fervor into our Sovietification project."

Yet those people are missing one crucial detail, such unions still uphold the imperialist delusion of separate ethnic groups. In Premier Zhdanov's state we are no longer Russian, Kalmyk, Yakut, Turkmen and a myriad of others. We are Soviet and we are one."

That's exactly why Premier Zhdanov has decreed that every man and woman shall go through basic administrative training, combined with lessons in socialist theory.

Their fears of an uncertain future were quickly dashed by Premier Zhdanov's announcement of the creation of the Central Commission of State Planning, under his recent protégé Nikolay Voznesensky. While the idea itself might be similar to the Gosplan proposed by Zinoviev, TK Gosplan is far more ambitious in its scope."

SOV_Logical_Endpoint_Centralist_Doctrine_desc:0 "With Premier Rykov's hypercentralization scheme well underway, many government spheres were collected in one central place within our capital. However, not everything was included in that superstructure. That's why our grand leader Zhdanov drew up a plan to finalize the Centralist Doctrine by forming a new capital region to organize the whole government apparatus inside it. Tstentralgrad shall arise and dwarf every city in the world, proving Socialism's might once again!"

SOV_Zhdanovshchina_desc:0 "With Leninism-Rykovism firmly entrenched in the Soviet nation, the time if finally right for Andrei Zhdanov to introduce his own set of ideas into the government. Zhdanovshchina hinges on a simple realization that the world is split dialectically into two competing realities centered around Soviet democracy and the Capitalist imperialism. Thus the Soviet people have an obligation to improve themselves from good to the best and drive this Western Capitalist scum into extinction."

SOV_Judges_Honour_desc:0 "With a system so intricate as ours, it is more than certain that deviations from the ideals of Lenin and Rykov will arise. Such lapses must be combated at every step, lest they threaten to tear the Soviet society apart. This is why Premier Zhdanov authorized the creation of a special People's Commissariat, modeled after the revolutionary VChK, dubbed the 'Judges of Honour' by the more zealous Party members. Their main job is to make sure that the Party itself doesn't stray in any way from the ideological purity presented by Andrei Zhdanov. They are also meant to keep the spirit of Soviet patriotism alive among the ordinary citizens, by any means necessary."

When we dealt with the crypto-capitalist Bukharinists most of the Party believed the struggle for ideological purity to be over. Yet the greatest among us, Andrei Zhdanov, realized the truth of how the Party may rot in the future. All thanks to that traitor Malenkov, who should have been dealt with the very moment he slithered into a prominent government office after Premier Rykov's death. The time has finally come to cut out the cancer corrupting the hearts and minds of the Party"

SOV_No_Progress_Without_Ideology_desc:0 "Our great leader knows one simple truth: we must never allow ourselves to fall into the technocratic perversions formerly championed by Malenkov. Socialism in itself is a science and Leninism-Rykovism is chief among the highest forms of these exact and quantifiable schools of study. Thus, it is only natural that no progress can ever be made without considering the rich and deep impact of Socialism upon technology. With ideology in one hand and science in the other, the Soviet nation shall conquer reality itself!"

SOV_Decentralisation_Of_Syndicates_desc:0 "As of now the various Syndicates are all coordinated through the All-Russian Congress of Factory Committees. The VSFK also manages various governmental duties like ratifying treaties and approving bills. In short, the VSFK is exceptionally powerful. If a demagogue were to take over the body then the Revolution would be threatened if not totally reversed. To combat their power we will break off many of the local Syndicates, making them answerable to regional bodies rather than directly to the Congress. This will anger many reactionaries within the Congress hoping to undermine all that we have achieved, but they can rage all they want, time marches on regardless."

SOV_Cooperative_Agrarain_Economy:0 "Cooperative Agrarian Economy"
SOV_Cooperative_Agrarain_Economy_desc:0 "Many of the farms of Russia sell their crops to the state or to their communities on an individual basis. This has left them vulnerable to price gouging and forces them to race to the bottom in price to beat out their competition. By organizing the farms into broad cooperatives they can sell their crops to the coop at a fair price which will distribute it around as needed. This will become the new foundation of our economy, better than the adhoc agricultural system we staggered with before."

This will both help industrialize our country without greatly damaging the peasantry."

SOV_Congress_Of_Labor_Collectives_desc:0 "As our administration continues to morph into its final form we have found a new opportunity to harness the power of public opinion by forming Councils of Labor Collectives.

SOV_Separation_Of_Soviet_Powers_desc:0 "Most of the power within our government is centralized in a few key positions and bodies. This was done for expediency as we set up our new administration. However, with the situation stabilized we shall begin to delegate these privileges out to other ministries and positions. With this delegation we will give the government the robustness to withstand the subversion of the right and counterrevolutionaries along with the populism that so frequently leads lofty states such as our astray."

SOV_Soviet_Democracy_desc:0 "We have achieved a unique system of state. Instead of our ruler ruling uncontested like in Mitteleuropa or the Entente or relying on reactionary elements of society to pull our strings like in many capitalist ‘democracies’ across the world we have achieved a Peoples State. Across our nation people vote in elections to choose delegates who directly execute their will. Cut off from the temptation of international capital they strive for the best Russia can be, untainted by corruption. What taint of corruption does occasionally seep through the cracks is quickly extracted before it can poison the entire system. The people love us, and we love them back."

SOV_Creation_Of_Ethnic_Soviets:0 "Question of Ethnic Soviets"
SOV_Creation_Of_Ethnic_Soviets_desc:0 "Russia is a land of countless ethnicities from the minor to the major. In our new state some have raised the prospect of forming semi-autonomous Soviets to manage these minorities in the best interest of the state. This does bring risk as Nationalists could take control of them and drive a wedge between themselves and our rule. However, if we try and rule them all from our capital within Russia they may cry oppression and give said nationalists power anyway. Whatever our decision is, we must make it soon."

We will not let their honorable sacrifice go unhonored anymore. We shall raise the ideal of the peasant to a new level of honor and prominence that would've been unthinkable under the previous regime. They will be showered with subsidies as well to make them have to work less hard and make more food for the rest of us.

These Unions will manage their workplaces as expected however, unlike the Syndicalists, we won't allow them to elect their own to positions of power without some checks. The people, for all their love of the Revolution and the State, are easily influenced. Just one wrong election can bring the entire Revolution into jeopardy. Of course we won't tell them their elections will be slanted to our preferred candidates but they will."

We shall establish a People's Soviet of Health to oversee the expansion of the public health sector and handle the financial burdens of such an endeavor in a nation as large as ours. Said burden is decried by opponents as too high to meet. When their children are saved by our doctors and they don't have to pay a single ruble, we will see how loud these sociopaths shout."

However, this cannot remain true. In a world that grows more and more advanced by leaps and bounds every year we cannot afford to lag behind. If we do, then the reactionaries of the world will crush us under their boots. That is why all education will be free and mandatory up to university and college itself will be subsidised so that most people can attend at least some. With a new generation of intelligent and educated citizens we will remain at the cutting edge of society and remain competitive on the world stage. "

No, we shall make employment mandatory and available to all. Some point out that our economy is simply not large enough to have enough jobs for every single person, but we shall brush this problem away easily. We shall simply create jobs.

However, with our policies paying dividends to everybody, resistance to our regime has shrunk to such a degree that the Cheka are hardly necessary anymore. Some worry about just how the still powerful Cheka will take this, but we know as loyal Soviets they will recognize the necessity of their dissolution and leave peacefully."

SOV_Question_Of_Kulaks_desc:0 "While we have made great strides in breaking up the private property, there are still many who hold onto their estates. These kulaks have however reformed to more faithfully fit the new system, most likely to keep from getting rounded up rather than out of a kindness of their own hearts. Some have suggested we finish what we have begun and strike these remnants down. We can break up their estates and give them to the peasant cooperatives. Others point out that the remaining kulaks are less the exploitative lords overlooking their innumerable peasants that the radicals paint them to be and are instead more or less cooperatives just not under a state appointed leader. They also point out that the system works fine. Such a severe disruption as breaking up the farms could lead to a famine. Nevertheless the decision is ultimately ours to make."

SOV_Welfare_State_desc:0 "We have formed a robust welfare state. The people rejoice in finally enjoying the fruits of their labor. Meanwhile they don’t fear going to the hospital or getting a disease. Such fears plagued our people under the despots of the Tsar and Kerensky. Now however with our public health network expanding and more and more people taking advantage of it, our nation's overall health is rising which in turn raises productivity. All in all, things could not have gone better."

SOV_Socialist_Humanism_desc:0 "Many governments prioritise the state over the people. They view their citizens as pawns to be thrown into the woodchipper to make the lines go up and put money in their pockets. Our focus on the people of Russia and improving their lives not only has endeared us to the populace but has shown to the world that focusing on the populace is if not required then highly beneficial. Our economy booms, our military is growing stronger by the day and our industry pumps out more material every day than it did the day before. All of this done by a people who know their government loves them and only acts in their best interests."

SOV_Left_SR_Chekist_Coup_desc:0 "The treacherous politicians tried to dismantle their shield against the enemies of the revolution. This could not have been done by any sane man, any true SR.

Instead we shall install a public face of our new regime instead. Of course he will know who is the real power behind the throne and we will overthrow him just as easily as we overthrew those other traitors. However, with him in charge instead of us, our new regime gets a degree of stability that it couldn’t have gotten before."

We shall dispatch the Cheka into the streets to find the instigators of this continued unrest and put an end to their charade of ‘restoring power to the people’. While we do our work the Army will crush what resistance remains. When all goes to plan we should have full compliance within a month or so of the operations beginning. Civilian casualties are projected to be within acceptable boundaries."

However they have been tainted by counterrevolutionaries in the Party and must be cleansed. Instead the Soviets will work entirely for the benefit of the state, free from all party affiliation while naturally still under close Cheka surveillance. Dissension can begin at any time so we must remain eternally vigilant. "

The Organization will be a volunteer militia of sorts which will draft Soviet citizens to fill gaps in various military organizations to allow for more men to be focused on combat operations.

In the coming war we must prepare for severe casualties as well. We will begin to draft citizens into the Army en masse. This will be deeply unpopular, just as it was during the Civil War, and we predict that we will have to use a fair bit of coercion to get the men to answer the call. However, as our armies advance inexorably forward they will rally under our banners and then we will have no problems finding more eager soldiers for the military of tomorrow."

SOV_Left_SR_Countercoup:0 "Legalist Counter-Coup"
SOV_Left_SR_Countercoup_desc:0 "The Cheka coup has plunged the nation into thinly veiled anarchy. State Terror has pitted brother and brother, mother against child and husband against wife. The Russian People are fearful and suspicious of everybody, especially each other. Since we have destroyed the Cheka and restored sanity to the nation, such suspicion is lifting but still hangs over us like a heavy blanket. We must work to restore order and trust between the people and government and between the people and their neighbors. Without these basic building blocks of society our nation is lost to anarchy."

SOV_Give_Up_Monopoly_On_Power:0 "Give Up Monopoly On Power"
SOV_Give_Up_Monopoly_On_Power_desc:0 "The Cheka consolidated power to an extreme degree leaving the entire state dependent on the executive and his puppet masters. Now that we are in charge we will do away with this. We will restore the previous balance of power by re-delegating key responsibilities to the restored ministries and branches of government. With the government no longer entirely dependent on one man we can act faster and restore the democracy which has long been little more than a facade."

SOV_No_Need_In_Terror:0 "Abandon Terror"
SOV_No_Need_In_Terror_desc:0 "Under the Cheka mass executions of suspected enemies of the state were commonplace. Hundreds died in cities across the nation every day and ammunition was expended in such numbers that in some areas the local Cheka death squads returned to sabers and clubs to do the deed due to a lack of ammunition. As the story of the Cheka comes to its merciful close we will also abandon the state sanctioned terror they brought with them. We will loosen the stringent restraints on people's lives, eliminate the death squads entirely and instead restore the local police forces that had for some time now fallen by the wayside."

There is no longer any threat of them ever rising again and we have taken steps to make sure any future government never makes the same mistake we did. Now, we have only one mission left: turn over leadership back to the civilian government. While some have entertained the notion of a permanent State of Emergency to rule that idea lasted about as long as a daisy on the tundra. We are here to restore democracy, not destroy it. To finalize the return to normalcy we shall organize a new election for a new chairman, restored to full powers by us."

### Ideas ###

CHS_legitimacy: "Limited Legitimacy"
CHS_legitimacy_desc: "Now that the North and South have been reunified, we must now begin the gargantuan task of creating a new Central Government for China. Many throughout China, especially in the recently-conquered North, do not recognize us as legitimate in the first place. It will take time and effort to prove ourselves to those who doubt us, and only then can we truly claim to have reunified China."

CHS_bureaucracy: "Overstretched Bureaucracy"
CHS_bureaucracy_desc: "Overnight, our bureaucracy went from governing a number of provinces in the south to governing the majority of China. To say that our bureaucracy is overstretched is an understatement. Our civil service will need to be expanded manifold in order to serve the newly-annexed provinces. Until then, our economy and ability to reach the people will suffer."

CHS_military: "The New Chinese Army"
CHS_military_desc: "Now that China has been reunited, our victorious armies are now those of the new Central Government. As such, a number of arsenals and military academies need to be integrated after decades of independent development. These issues, along with the integration of Northern armies, affect our forces negatively, and resources will be needed to be spent to rectify them."

### Focus ###

CHS_provisional_government: "The Provisional Government"
CHS_provisional_government_desc: "With the core of China under our control, we have set up a new Provisional Government that will work on a new, hopefully permanent, constitution and create a united Republic that will stand the test of time."

CHS_strenghten_parliament: "Strenghten Parliament"
CHS_strenghten_parliament_desc: "Democrats all over China agree that Parliament must be strengthened to secure democracy in the country and ensure that authoritarians are unable to usurp power in the young Republic once again."

CHS_strenghten_presidency: "Empower the Presidency"
CHS_strenghten_presidency_desc: "The failure of the previous republican government shows that the government's powers must be clearly defined and the importance of the presidency to ensure stability and proper governance."

CHS_xinhai_legacy: "Legacy of Xinhai"
CHS_xinhai_legacy_desc: "The Xinhai Revolution marks the birth of modern China and the Republic. It and its revolutionaries must be honoured and commemorated, as their legacy will live on as long as our Republic lives."

CHS_national_protection_legacy: "National Protection Legacy"
CHS_national_protection_legacy_desc: "The National Protection movements have become a symbol of our leaders' and armies' commitment to republicanism and constitutionalism, and they should be honoured along with the Xinhai Revolution that birthed our Republic, as they made sure that the Republic survived."

CHS_federalist_model: "Federalist Model"
CHS_federalist_model_desc: "The Federalist movement in China has risen and fallen several times since the Xinhai Revolution, but they remain an important movement in our provisional government. A federal system will ensure that powers are properly separated and that local affairs remain in the hands of the locals who understand their own problems better than any central government."

CHS_weaken_provincialism: "Attack Provincialism"
CHS_weaken_provincialism_desc: "Provincialism is a tool to divide our nation into fiefdoms and federalism is an attempt to institutionalize this. The supremacy of the central government must be ensured, for it is the only way China will be properly reunited as a single nation and not a collection of local tyrants."

CHS_new_republic: "The New Republic"
CHS_new_republic_desc: "With the lessons from the old Republic, we can build a new Republic can be built. A new order in China, one that truly respects the legacy of its founders, republicanism, constitutionalism, and democracy, will be born and, this time, endure."

CHS_personality_cult: "Personality Cult"
CHS_personality_cult_desc: "[Root.GetLeader] is the sole reason that the National Protection Alliance was able to crush the monarchists, radicals, and pretenders and restore the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. Without him, there would be no Republic, and his legacy as liberator of China will endure."

CHS_new_bureaucracy: "The New Bureaucracy"
CHS_new_bureaucracy_desc: "From ruling a province or two to ruling the core of China, our bureaucracy has been struggling to say the least. Whether we adopted a federalist or centralist model, new civil servants need to be hired and the entire service must be reorganized from scratch."

CHS_election: "New National Assembly Election"
CHS_election_desc: "The new government cannot hope to act legitimately as a Republic without assembling a new Parliament. New election to the National Assembly are to be held for the first time in decades (discounting illegitimate ones by the Manchu tyrants of course), helping bring legitimacy to our Provisional Government."

CHS_national_reunification: "National Reunification"
CHS_national_reunification_desc: "With a new National Assembly gathered and a new Constitution ratified, our government is no longer provisional, but the sole legitimate government of China. President [Root.GetLeader] will lead the nation towards National Reunification, and China will be once again united and free. Long live the Republic!"

CHS_reintegrate_academies: "Reintegrate Academies"
CHS_reintegrate_academies_desc: "Military academies are scattered throughout China since before the Xinhai Revolution and have largely developed independently since the first collapse of the Qing Dynasty. They must be reintegrated and the curriculum of all officers standardized once more."

CHS_standardised_arsenals: "Standardized Arsenals"
CHS_standardised_arsenals_desc: "For several decades, the arsenals of China have been under the control of different and largely independent provincial and national governments. Now that a number of those arsenals are under our control, the logistical issues stemming from different arsenals producing different arms in different calibre for a single army are substantial and should be rectified as soon as possible."

CHS_fate_of_northern_officers: "Fate of Northern Officers"
CHS_fate_of_northern_officers_desc: "Since the defeat of the Northern warlords, we have many officers as prisoners of war. Chen Jiongming believes we should be lenient, as many of them are competent and the majority are willing to pledge their allegiance to the new Republic. Not many share this optimism, however, and that they should serve as an example as traitors to China"

CHS_small_arms_development: "Small Arms Development"
CHS_small_arms_development_desc: "Despite attempts by the numerous national and provincial governments to upgrade, the most widespread rifle in service remains the venerable, yet severely obsolete, Model 88. Making the standardization on a new, modern rifle a reality rather than a project on paper is a top priority in order to improve our lackluster military capabilities compared to other modern militaries."

CHS_motorisation: "Army Motorization"
CHS_motorisation_desc: "As the infrastructure of a unified China improves, not only is motorization becoming a possibility, it is becoming a necessity due to the very size of our country. Increasing our mobility will increase our capabilities on and off the battlefield, allowing for greater flexibility and reach- especially in remote areas where bandits continue to prowl."

CHS_artillery_modernisation: "Artillery Modernization"
CHS_artillery_modernisation_desc: "Artillery is the king of the battlefield and modern pieces were a luxury in the warlord era. With the capabilities of a united China, we can modernize our guns and bring our firepower closer to the global standard."

CHS_support_companies: "Army Support and Logistics"
CHS_support_companies_desc: "Amateurs study tactics, masters study logistics. With a country as large and varied as China, this proverb must be taken seriously as many warlords learned the hard way. Improving our logistics will improve our armies' fighting capabilities far more than any modern firearm."

CHS_tank_arsenal: "A Tank Arsenal"
CHS_tank_arsenal_desc: "The development of armoured warfare has certainly been noticed in China, but to to develop and use them here was but a pipe dream. Now that we are united and stronger than ever, now is the time to dwelve into these advanced technologies. An arsenal dedicated to armoured vehicles should be founded as an important stepping stone in China's modernization."

CHS_aviation_school: "Formalize Aviation Schools"
CHS_aviation_school_desc: "While there are indeed schools for pilots in China, they are few and relatively disorganized. Formalizing these schools and creating a proper curriculum for pilots and maintenance crews will help create a proper air force for China."

CHS_new_aircraft_factories: "New Aircraft Factories"
CHS_new_aircraft_factories_desc: "The South of the country has seen a number of small aircraft workshops created in the last decade or two, but remained fairly small, only able to repair what few planes there were. Creating proper factories is another step towards developing a fledging aeronautics industry, a staple of the modern era."

CHS_native_fighter_design: "Domestic Fighter Design"
CHS_native_fighter_design_desc: "There have been a number of attempts at creating a Chinese aircraft, mostly based on foreign designs. With the help of foreign experts and an increasing pool of local technicians, we are now more than ever able to develop our own designs in the hopes of creating a modern air force to defend our skies."

CHS_medium_bomber: "Tactical Bomber Fleet"
CHS_medium_bomber_desc: "Medium tactical bombers offer versatility to an air force with the ability to accomplish different types of mission. Of course, designing such a large plane has been unheard of until now and will certainly be a challenge."

CHS_light_bomber: "Army Air Support"
CHS_light_bomber_desc: "Light bombers as some kind of flying artillery is the best way an air force can support land operations. It is only logical that we focus on these close-air-support crafts as we forge a modern air force."

CHS_southern_fleets_legacy: "Southern Fleet's Legacy"
CHS_southern_fleets_legacy_desc: "The Guangdong (or Southern) Fleet had a short and tumultuous history. Created in the late 19th century, its funding was siphoned towards the Nanyang Fleet in Shanghai, achieving little in the Sino-French and Sino-Japanese Wars, and was unceremoniously disbanded before the Xinhai Revolution. Nevertheless, it was one of the four modern fleets of China and its legacy endures in local memory."

CHS_naval_academy: "Revive the Naval Academies"
CHS_naval_academy_desc: "The naval academies of China have been largely neglected through successive national and provincial governments. Now that there is a single, uncontested Central Government once more, we have the ability to renew naval interests and support a new cadre of officers for the Republican Navy."

CHS_destroyers: "Modern Destroyer Flottila"
CHS_destroyers_desc: "Destroyers are the backbone of any modern navy, especially one as fledging as China's. They will protect our coasts, shipping lanes and larger warships from submarines and small attack crafts."

CHS_submarines: "Develop Submarines"
CHS_submarines_desc: "Submarines are proving to be indispensable in modern naval warfare. For a navy as limited as ours, they may prove to be a life saver, allowing us to attack far stronger enemies by raiding their shipping lanes and harassing their larger fleets."

CHS_cruisers: "Cruisers for our Fleet"
CHS_cruisers_desc: "Cruisers are important for scouting and screening and, realistically speaking, may be the largest warships we are capable of building at this time."

CHS_coastal_defence: "Focus on Coastal Defence"
CHS_coastal_defence_desc: "It would be insane to start planning for a large fleet capable of rivaling the naval Great Powers. As such, we must focus on a more flexible navy capable to protecting our long coast and interests in the Pacific."

CHS_grand_fleet: "A Grand Fleet?"
CHS_grand_fleet_desc: "If China is to be considered a Great Power as it rightfully should be, a navy is indispensable. While it will certainly be a very long-term plan, our great navy must start somewhere and it must start now."

CHS_naval_bomber: "Naval Bomber Project"
CHS_naval_bomber_desc: "While ignored at first, naval bombers armed with torpedoes and armour-piercing bombs are quickly becoming a serious threat to even the largest warships currently at sea. This technology might be exactly what China needs: A cost-effective way of destroying a vastly-larger enemy fleet threatening our coastline."

### Events ###

npa.1.t: "Formation of the National Protection Alliance"
npa.1.d: "For too long has Beijing betrayed the Chinese nation. From supporting dictators to monarchists, we can no longer sit idly as the north continues to erode our great nation. The provincial leaders of the south must band together once more and restore the National Protection movement to overthrow them once and for all. A new republic will bring greatness to China once more!"
npa.1.a: "Long Live the Republic!"

npa.2.t: "A Request from [From.GetLeader]"
npa.2.d: "[From.GetLeader] has made a formal request to join the National Protection Alliance. While unity should come first against the north, it would be unwise to accept the request without properly considering the consequences of a potential betrayal."
npa.2.a: "Of course!"
npa.2.b: "It would be unwise."

npa.3.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Accepted into the NPA"
npa.3.d: "Our province has been welcomed into the National Protection Alliance. We shall now prepare for the inevitable Second Northern Expedition that will surely bring the Beijing government to their knees!"
npa.3.a: "For the Republic!"

npa.4.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Refused into the NPA"
npa.4.d: "Our request has been denied; [From.GetLeader] has refused to allow us into the National Protection Alliance."
npa.4.a: "How rude!"

npa.5.t: "An Invitation from [From.GetLeader]"
npa.5.d: "[From.GetLeader], leader of the National Protection Alliance, has officially invited us to join the movement to overthrow the Beijing regime. The alliance, like the previous National Protection movement, is a loose one composed of varied provincial leaders with varied levels of ambition. While this will empower [From.GetLeader]'s influence in the region, it could potentially cement our own position both regionally and nationally, and a potential power struggle after taking Beijing could potentially benefit us."
npa.5.a: "We must band together!"
npa.5.b: "We must decline."

npa.6.t: "[From.GetLeader] Joins!"
npa.6.d: "[From.GetLeader] has accepted our offer, joining the National Protection Alliance. We are one step closer from being able to conquer the north!"
npa.6.a: "Excellent!"

npa.7.t: "[From.GetLeader] Refuses"
npa.7.d: "[From.GetLeader] has refused to join the National Protection Alliance. We will have to deal with him later or make due without him."
npa.7.a: "Traitor!"

npa.8.t: "Beijing Liberated"
npa.8.d: "With the former imperial capital under the National Protection Alliance's control, we are finally able to restore the Republic and honour the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. As the leader of the Alliance, it is our duty to proclaim a new Provisional Government and take our place as the leaders of the new Central Government of China."
npa.8.a: "Long live the Republic!"

npa.9.t: "Formation of the Provisional Government"
npa.9.d: "With our allies firmly behind us, we can now begin the monumental task of rebuilding China and the Republic."
npa.9.a: "Long live the Republic!"

npa.10.t: "Formation of the Provisional Government"
npa.10.d: "With the former imperial capital under the National Protection Alliance's control, we are finally able to restore the Republic and honour the legacy of the Xinhai Revolution. [From.GetLeader], the leader of the Alliance, has invited us to join him to create a new provisional government. This will put us firmly under his leadership and we shall support him in the great task ahead."
npa.10.a: "Very well."
npa.10.b: "[From.GetLeader] is not fit to lead!"

npa.11.t: "(( Processing Power Struggle... ))"
npa.11.d: "This is a hidden event. If you see this, then I, Vidyaország, have fucked up, or you cheated. Please submit a bug report if you see this. Thank you."
npa.11.a: "Beep boop"

npa.12.t: "Power Struggle"
npa.12.d: "The fragile alliance that was the NPA has been shattered. Some of our former allies have turned on us, declaring us incapable to leading the new Republic and our provisional government illegitimate.\n\nIt appears that another round of civil war has begun."
npa.12.a: "Traitors! Backstabbers!"

npa.13.t: "(( Finalizing Power Struggle... ))"
npa.13.d: "This is a hidden event. If you see this, then I, Vidyaország, have fucked up (or you cheated). Please submit a bug report if you see this. Thank you."
npa.13.a: "In Year [GetYear] War Were Declared"

npa.14.t: "Provisional Government Secured"
npa.14.d: "With all other claimants subdued, we have secured our position as head of the provisional government. We can now begin the monumental task of rebuilding China and the Republic."
npa.14.a: "Long live the Republic!"

npa.15.t: "Formation of the National Protection Association"
npa.15.d: "With the formation of the Provisional Government, a number of Chinese politicians, from militarists and businessmen to shameless sycophants, have banded together to form a political party: the National Protection Association. Seeking to secure the new republic and the legacy of the National Protection movement, this pro-government party only seeks to support our policies and gather public support for them. This guarantees us many voices in the future parliament of China and significant political power as we transition from a provincial government to a national one."
npa.15.a: "A needed presence in the National Assembly."

npa.16.t: "Reinstating the Constitution of 1924"
npa.16.d: "The final constitution of the Republic of China was adopted in its waning years to replace to old Provisional Constitutions. While the new one proved to be just as provisional, the new Provisional Government has, unsurprisingly, decided to reinstate it until a new one can be decided. Hopefully, the new and final Constitution will be drafted in a timely manner unlike the turbulent times of the first Republic."
npa.16.a: "It's only provisional... right?"

npa.17.t: "The [GetYear] National Assembly Election"
npa.17.d: "The time has come to finally elect representatives for the new legislature. Because of the political and constitutional situation, pro-government candidates run virtually unopposed due to the relatively narrow electorate and the election's boycotting by radicals. While this may not foster political pluralism, it will ensure that the legislature will support our policies, thus making sure that the Republic remains stable in its first years."
npa.17.a: "Long live the Republic!"

npa.18.t: "Choosing the Capital"
npa.18.d: "It is time to set the seat of the new central government. Nanjing and Beijing are both obvious choices, although the latter is relatively contentuous considering the first Republic's troubled history. Wuhan is also a good compromise, being the centre of the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing for the first time. Guangzhou, meanwhile, is the economic centre of Southern China and is well within our core lands."
npa.18.a: "Nanjing"
npa.18.b: "Beijing"
npa.18.c: "Wuhan"
npa.18.e: "Guangzhou"

npa.19.t: "Ultimatum from the Central Government"
npa.19.d: "The new Central Government has demanded that we recognize them as the legitimate government of China. This would mean integration into the new Republic and a significant loss of autonomy."
npa.19.a: "Accept"
npa.19.b: "Refuse"

npa.20.t: "[From.GetLeader] Accepts"
npa.20.d: "[From.GetLeader] of [From.GetNameDef] has accepted our demands and recognized us as the legitimate government of China. They will be integrated into the new Republic."
npa.20.a: "Long live China!"

npa.21.t: "[From.GetLeader] Refuses"
npa.21.d: "[From.GetLeader] of [From.GetNameDef] has refused to recognize us as the legitimate government of China. Their insolence will make a fine example for the others that refuse to submit."
npa.21.a: "They will pay."

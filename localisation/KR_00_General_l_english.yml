### Name and Description ###
BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
KR_SCENARIO_NAME:0 "Legacy of the Weltkrieg"
KR_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "The year of 1936 is a turning point for the history of the world; it is a time of both great opportunity and great danger. Tensions between the German Empire and the Commune of France are growing, Russia and the USA are increasingly unstable and the old empires of Austria and the Ottomans are dissolving. All the while Syndicalism, Totalism and Radical Socialism are spreading all around the world. Fifteen years have passed since the end of the Weltkrieg, and the old rivalries of yore have reappeared. A single spark may be all it takes to light the powder keg..."

### Major Nations ###

### Germany ###
GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1919, after five years of war, the German army finally overran the Entente defences in France. In 1921, Britain's surrender followed. The Weltkrieg has made Germany an uncontested World Power, yet things have been going downhill for her since the 1930s. A recessive world economy has dampened the nation's industrial output while other nations' manufacturing power recovers, and now nationalism grows in Germany's eastern client states, who are starting to drift away from the Reich. In 1936, Germany stands at a crossroads, and already we can see cracks in her mighty empire, as her ancestral enemies are regaining their former strength..."

### Commune of France ###
FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 3rd Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Revolution at home. In 1919, a General Strike was called by the CGT, causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. For 15 years, the new 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndico-Socialist consensus, headed by the Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936 the need to rebuild the country and defend the revolution is believed to be outdated by many critics and there is a growing call for more radical policies. France is confident in her mission, but it is unclear which revolutionary strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

### Union of Britain ###
ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After 1921's 'Peace with Honour' ended the Weltkrieg, the faith and support of the people in the Home Islands had disappeared. In 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute quickly escalated into a General Strike called by the TUC, followed by military desertions to the strikers. After six weeks of rioting on a massive scale, the Royal Family and most of the country's elites were evacuated to Canada and instead, a new Congress of Trade Unions assumed political authority. The British people are currently content to build socialism in isolation, yet many are starting to think that the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."

### Canada ###
CAN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Revolution of 1925, the Royal Family and other British exiles found refuge in Canada. With the support of the Conservatives, they established a semi-official government in exile, in hopes of one day reclaiming the Home Islands. All is not well, however. Canadians are growing weary of the British presence, and in 1931 the Conservative government fell to Mackenzie King's Liberals - who now hold a slim majority and see to assert greater Canadian sovereignty in the face of mounting pressure to prepare for the inevitable confrontation between the Entente and the Third Internationale."

### Russia ###
RUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During Russia's Civil War, the White forces fought with all they had, but the Red Army still dominated the country's industrial heartland. The German Empire, however, fearing a red Russia, decided to intervene on behalf of the Whites. Two years later, Moscow and Petrograd fell to the White forces, and a new Russian Republic was established. For the past fifteen years, the leading parties, S-R and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerensky, but Russia is becoming increasingly unstable. Other political forces are growing, and they are considering that it is now time for change, so that the country may reassert her power in the world..."

### United States ###
USA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The USA almost left their policy of isolation to intervene in the Weltkrieg, but ultimately kept out of the war. This lead to a victory of the Central Powers. Since then, the USA has struggled economically, European trade opportunities, and the repayment of their loans to the Entente have been made impossible by a German victory. Still internationally regarded as a 'nobody', she now faces mounting internal dissent as the Republican-Democratic hegemony is challenged by two groups - the Syndicalists and the America First Party. With a mounting crisis at home and only a modest reputation overseas, things aren't looking good for the United States of America..."

### Japan ###
JAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While the 'Peace with Honour' guaranteed Japanese rule over the colonies, not all was well in the Empire of the Rising Sun. After a period of economic upheaval culminated in a Syndicalist attempt on the life of Prince-Regent Hirohito in 1926, unstable governments followed one another in a year of crisis; First General Tanaka, then the democratic Coalition Cabinet and an intervention in Northeast China. In 1936, Japan is poised to extend her empire. With Germany's dominance appearing to be in decline, the Japanese look hungrily at the remaining Qing territories and the German Pacific possessions..."

### Other Nations ###
OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are waiting for their turn to rise as a major player of this world. From major powers trying to keep their empires to the many nations trying to regain what they lost in the Weltkrieg, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world..."

### Featured Nations ###

### Socialist Republic Italy ###
SRI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Italian civil war, the Socialist Republic of Italy has controlled the bulk of Italy. Its rulers know full well that it would have overrun the republicans and the whites, had it not been for the infernal interference of Austria and the pressure applied by Germany. Even today, it is the specter of interference by Germany and Austria which keeps syndicalism from finishing off the last remnants of Old Italy. The nation bides its time, building its strength, and is fully aware that - once the scale tips - it shall tip in the favor of revolution."

### Italian Republic ###
ITA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, the country was left to the mercy of the Austrians - and it would have been reorganized into the old Italian Federation had it not been for the outbreak of civil war. The socialists would have overrun the peninsula had the Austrians not swallowed a bitter pill and cooperated with the republicans... and, after the fighting stopped, was forced to maintain the relationship into the current day. Italy remains unstable, however, and its eventual reckoning with the socialists across the Po appears inevitable."

### Two Sicilies ###
SIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies initially sided with Austria during the civil war, a necessary evil to halt the advance of the Socialist Republic. Later, however, when war with the syndicalists seemed inevitable, the Austrians showed their true colours and abandoned the south. The war never happened, but the Sicilains came into the modern era wiser. They will have a difficult time meeting the more industrialized north head on, but that war will someday came and they must be ready for it."

### Papal State ###
PAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the formation of a united Italy, it had seemed the time for the Papal States to have secular power was a thing of the past. Then came the collapse of the kingdom, and the civil war which followed, and central Italians once again turned to the Papacy and its Sicilian allies to help maintain stability. Now Pope Pius XI is ill, and on his deathbed he laments an Italy that remains divided, with the syndicalists growing ever stronger in the north. Whoever his successor is, he will need God on his side in order to prevail."

### Greece ###
GRE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Upon the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, the monarchy supported Germany whilst the government backed the Entente. This disagreement resulted in Constantine fleeing into exile, this sign of weakness in the monarchy was the beginning of the future republic. Greece would join the Weltkrieg on the side of the Entente in 1917, which would prove disastrous for the nation. A vengeful Greece now looks across the European continent, struggling for survival in the modern world. Meanwhile the monarchist campaign is brewing across Greece. Greece must decide for itself on how to reclaim its former stability, its former allies, and its former glory..."

### Georgia ###
GEO_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Georgian state was formally established in 1918 after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The ruling Menshevik party banded together with several Bolshevik figures to form a new brand of Socialism. However, with the integration and subsequent rise of several previously Bolshevik figures, such as Leventi Beria and Ioseb Jughashvili, the Menshevik party was quick to radicalise, as the 'Internal Security Service' became more involved in Politics. Only time will tell if Georgian Democracy can survive, or if the Supreme Economic Council will take over the State."

### AOG ###
AOG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung, or Supervisory Board of the East Asian General Administration, is a collection of semi-official semi-legal coastal concessions under the watch of Germany. The Strong Links between us and The Nanjing Warlord Sun Chuanfang have grown stronger, his League of Eight Provinces accepted a series of exploitative arms deals in return for extensive economic concessions within their nation. the AOG spreads its influence throughout the League and ever deeper into the country's interior. Ultimately though, Berlin would like us to use China as a buffer of sorts against Japan"

### Illyria ###
CRO_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The Triune Kingdom of Illyria was proclaimed after the Crisis in Austro-Hungary and German Intervention in 1922. The creation of Illyria was proposed by loyal elites, who promised to be loyal to the Kaiser, but claimed more autonomy and the end of the Hungarian rule over Croatia. Though the Triune Kingdom should have become a home for the Catholic Croats, Orthodox Serbs and Muslim Bosniaks, in fact there are a lot of controversies between these nations. The Serbs want to reunite with their Serbian Motherland, the Bosniaks want to get more independence, and the Croats, who have a majority in the country, want to strengthen their position."

### Sardinia ###
SRD_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The House of Savoy was shattered by Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, and King Victor Emmanuel III held responsible. All is not completely lost for the monarchy, however. The Savoy-Aostas are powerful supporters, the rightful holders of Sardinia-Piedmont until their lands on the shores were swallowed up by the syndicalists. Now they and what monarchy supporters they can gather hold out on Sardinia, protected by the French Republic and ready to watch for the opportunity where they, too, can one day return home to claim their seat of power."

NATIONAL_FOCUS_NO_CURRENT_EFFECT:0 "This focus currently has no effect. Changes in the world situation may affect this."
continuous_naval_production:0 "Naval Production"
continuous_naval_production_desc:0 "By focusing resources on our shipyards and exempting skilled shipbuilders from military service, we can dramatically reduce production time for ships."
continuous_air_production:0 "Air Production"
continuous_air_production_desc:0 "We can reorganise our aviation industry to eliminate waste and streamline production."
continuous_non_factory_construct:0 "Construction Engineering"
continuous_non_factory_construct_desc:0 "There is still a lot of slack in our construction industry. By focusing our attention on it, we can achieve a significant improvement in construction speed. Unfortunately, the production of machine tools has proven a major bottleneck in the expansion of our heavy industry, so they won't benefit from efforts in this area."
continuous_reduce_training_time:0 "Army Training"
continuous_reduce_training_time_desc:0 "By creating specialised advanced training units within each division, we can deploy even divisions that would previously have been held back to finish training to the front."
continuous_suppression:0 "Resistance Suppression"
continuous_suppression_desc:0 "By infiltrating the major resistance groups in occupied territory and turning their leaders, we can significantly reduce the amount of damage they can do."

### Generic Focuses ###
generic_army_effort:0 "Modern Warfare"
generic_army_effort_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg, from its start to its end, changed warfare forever by finally ending Napoleonic Warfare's grasp on military thought and confirming the extreme deadliness of the rifle, machine gun and artillery cannon. Our army must adapt or perish, in a literal sense."
generic_equipment_effort:0 "Equipment Modernisation"
generic_equipment_effort_desc:0 "For a long time, military breakthroughs were slow, and having a good bolt-action rifle was enough. However, these rifles of the 19th Century are completely out of place on post-Weltkrieg battlefield. We must stop being complacent and get new equipment."
generic_motorization_effort:0 "Army Motorisation"
generic_motorization_effort_desc:0 "The cavalry charges of the Weltkrieg were probably the last. The truck is no longer just a transport tool and rapidly integrates to mobile warfare tactics. We must shake off outdated thinking and use motorisation to speed up our offensives and reinforcements."
generic_doctrine_effort:0 "Studying the Weltkrieg"
generic_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "We know about the Weltkrieg, but what have we learned from it? In just five years of conflict, countless soldiers died to teach us the new dynamics of warfare. If we do not learn about them, then our soldiers will meet the same fate on the battlefield."
generic_equipment_effort_2:0 "Equipment Research"
generic_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "We might have caught up to modern equipment, but new designs are already making ours obsolete. Regardless, we must persevere, and make sure that we never fall a single year behind in equipment. This means we will have to start developing our own designs."
generic_mechanization_effort:0 "Mechanised Warfare"
generic_mechanization_effort_desc:0 "Trucks fared poorly on the frontlines, but it seems that we can now meet halfway between trucks and tanks. Armoured personal carriers can bring troops directly into combat, shield them from fire, and even provide powerful fire support if needed."
generic_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Military Exercises"
generic_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Every great power exercises, and so should we. War games are more than peacetime entertainment for generals, they allow us to test both true and tested and revolutionary tactics without wasting countless lives. This allows us to complete our theoretical discoveries."
generic_equipment_effort_3:0 "Equipment Breakthroughs"
generic_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "We have come to such an experience in equipment research that we are no longer limited to eternally catching up or buying foreign equipment to get cutting-edge military gear. Even great powers may soon be surprised by what will soon be in our soldiers' hands."
generic_armor_effort:0 "Armoured Warfare"
generic_armor_effort_desc:0 "Tanks are the pinnacle of modern warfare. Mobile vehicles armed with cannons worthy of artillery, and impervious to the average rifle. Even if we only produce few, we will plow through our enemies with judicious use of those steel behemoths."
generic_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
generic_special_forces_desc:0 "Special Forces are more than the Elite Units of old. With modern equipment, even a conscript can hold his own on the battlefield. However, some situations are so hostile that they need specially trained men. Mountain ranges, amphibious landings, airborne assaults."

generic_aviation_effort:0 "National Air Force"
generic_aviation_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YAir Base§!"
generic_aviation_effort_desc:0 "The field of aviation was born almost in time for the Weltkrieg. Even two decades after this war, it is still new, and all nations strive to be ready for the next time their planes may be called to war. We must, too. We must found a solid Air Force to organise them."
generic_fighter_focus:0 "Air Superiority"
generic_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The dogfights of the Weltkrieg were merely the start of air-to-air warfare. As planes become faster, more armoured and more heavily armed, we need to put all our efforts into making sure we control the air. Then, striking the ground is a formality."
generic_bomber_focus:0 "Strategic Bombing"
generic_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Even when they were brand new, bombers inspired fear, and many saw their potential. As payloads get larger and bigger, even the artillery barrages of the Weltkrieg fail to compare. Some day, we may even surpass them, and destroy entire cities or regions in one run."
generic_aviation_effort_2:0 "Modern Air Tactics"
generic_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Planes have long stopped being just reconnaissance and harassment tools. By integrating them fully into our army operations, the air force is capable of dealing as much damage and advancing our operations as much as the average Army Command."
generic_CAS_effort:0 "Close Air Support"
generic_CAS_effort_desc:0 "While Fighters and Bombers can indirectly affect the battle, dedicated CAS planes have both the agility and armament needed to perform strafe and bombing runs on ground targets, causing major damage on unprepared armies while handling decently in aerial combat."
generic_rocket_effort:0 "Experimental Rocketry"
generic_rocket_effort_desc:0 "The field of rocketry is perhaps one of the newest fields of military science. If our scientists are to be believed, rocket engines can achieve speeds that would put radial engines to shame. Some say they could go even faster than sound, certainly extremely exciting."
generic_NAV_effort:0 "Naval Aviation"
generic_NAV_effort_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the major breakthroughs in naval warfare, naval bombers are able to lay waste on enemy fleets with torpedoes and other dedicated naval payloads like mines. Supporting our fleets, they can challenge capital ships and wreck havoc in the naval screens."

generic_naval_effort:0 "Modern Dockyards"
generic_naval_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YNaval Dockyards§!"
generic_naval_effort_desc:0 "If we are to establish a strong navy, we need to produce it first. Shipbuilding methods have evolved, and old drydocks need to be upgraded as much as new dockyards must be built from scratch. The modern ship is no cog, and we must see big to have a sea-worthy fleet."
generic_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Tactics"
generic_flexible_navy_desc:0 "We will never have the navies of the world powers, able to clean entire seas of opposition, but this does not mean our fleet will hide in port. Using flexible tactics and modern inventions like submarines, we do not need to actually match up with those grand fleets to wreck havoc."
generic_large_navy:0 "Power Projection"
generic_large_navy_desc:0 "Our navy might not yet be able to contest the bigger navies of this world, but by picking our fights smartly and keeping our fleets focused, we can make sure that any confrontation is in our advantage while still retaining a powerful navy that can rout weaker navies."
generic_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Warfare"
generic_submarine_effort_desc:0 "Submarine warfare is the most exciting naval development since the invention of the torpedo boat, and challenges even the most classical doctrines of naval warfare. We would do well to not just protect against submarines, but also use them against enemy ships."
generic_cruiser_effort:0 "Screen Ships"
generic_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Cruisers are not just 'cheap Battleships', and such outdated thinking ruins the potential of those ships. We should use them as escorts to our capital ships, as they are very vulnerable to naval bombers and smaller ships like torpedo boats."
generic_destroyer_effort:0 "Anti-Submarine Warfare"
generic_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "By studying the design and strategic use of submarines, we also learn how to counter them. Our Destroyers will need specialised equipment like depth charges and specific designs that are both light and small to ensure they can escort convoys and patrol efficiently."
generic_capital_ships_effort:0 "Capital Ships"
generic_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "Eventually, a fleet is nothing without a centrepiece, and both the old Battleship and modern Carrier fit this role. While vulnerable in a direct confrontation, they can bring massive damage upon enemy fleets if we let them shell and swarm the enemy ships from a safe distance."

generic_industrial_effort:0 "Industrial Methods"
generic_industrial_effort_desc:0 "To construct a large industrial base, we will need to set up the basics of modern industry, and maybe even make initial choices. Concentrated or dispersed industrial centres, investing in machine tools and construction tools. All of those are important things to focus on."
generic_construction_effort:0 "Industrial Grants"
generic_construction_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YCivilian Factories§!"
generic_construction_effort_desc:0 "A healthy and strong industry doesn't just appear out of nowhere. While we may have to start more ambitious projects later, we must start by ensuring that those with good management skills can start healthy, successful companies that may later grow into giants."
generic_production_effort:0 "State Armouries"
generic_production_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YMilitary Factory§!"
generic_production_effort_desc:0 "Until we are able to produce our own military equipment, we should create modern armouries for our army. Their goal is quite modest, procuring the gear our army needs using state funds, civilian production and simple production, but it is better than not getting any new rifles."
generic_construction_effort_2:0 "Industrial Centres"
generic_construction_effort_2_desc:0 "Entrepreneurship is one thing, but to have an economy worthy of even a regional power, we will need to foster the large industrial regions that made the Industrial Revolution. The seeds of such regions are large investment into promising industrial sites."
generic_production_effort_2:0 "Military Manufactures"
generic_production_effort_2_desc:0 "We must produce our own military equipment if we want our army to be more than a reserve force. The only way to do so is to heavily fund the creation of dedicated military manufactures, and support them with regular contracts and promises to ensure they can stay afloat."
generic_production_effort_3:0 "Military Industry"
generic_production_effort_3_desc:0 "We have finally reached a point where we have companies able to build the equipment we need, even if their output is still limited. However, our needs are still great, and by giving them absolute support over foreign companies they will slowly scale up to our needs."
generic_infrastructure_effort:0 "National Infrastructure"
generic_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "Our growing industry requires a solid infrastructure to ensure the transit of goods. We need to do away with chaotic, city to city planning and finally draw the roads of our country. Those who exist, those who will be expanded or linked, and those that have yet to be."
generic_infrastructure_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YInfrastructure§!"
generic_synth_oil_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YSynthetic Refinery§!"
generic_infrastructure_effort_2:0 "Railway Networks"
generic_infrastructure_effort_2_desc:0 "Modern countries need railway networks, able to bring anything from one point of the country to another rapidly and efficiently. This means we will have to expand our railways and create junctions that didn't occur to us even a few years ago."
generic_construction_effort_3:0 "Industrial Networks"
generic_construction_effort_3_desc:0 "Much like roads and railways, industries are connected in large, sprawling networks, based on input and output, import and export. As our infrastructure improves, so do these links, and our industry grows stronger as they can rely on the economy of our few wealthy provinces."

generic_extra_tech_slot:0 "Research Councils"
generic_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "Our industrial growth has attracted many learned minds, both nationals and foreign scientists looking for employment. We should fund research councils to ensure that they find tasks to work on, until our industrial base grows enough that we attract private research institutes."
generic_extra_tech_slot_2:0 "Research Institutes"
generic_extra_tech_slot_2_desc:0 "As our industrial base expands, we finally go from just manufacturing to actually designing and creating, or at least attracting those who do. Those research institutes have not only the minds, but also the funds to make discoveries. Let us waste no time encouraging their implantation."
generic_technology_sharing:0 "Technology Sharing"
generic_technology_sharing_desc:0 "By sharing technological advances with our allies, our whole faction will be able to conduct wartime research and development more efficiently. Of course, we will need to prove our help is impactful to them, but once this much is proved, we stand to benefit greatly from their research."
generic_secret_weapons:0 "Secret Weapons"
generic_secret_weapons_desc:0 "It is tempting to expend all extra resources into just developing tanks and planes, but the secret to winning wars lies in whole new fields of science; electronics, rocketry and nuclear research. Just because we are not a major power, does not mean we cannot make our own strides in those fields."

generic_political_effort:0 "Political Reform"
generic_political_effort_desc:0 "To bring about change in the world, we need to be able to bring about change in our own country. Strengthening our political position should come first, we need to do away with old political doctrine and be ready to adopt bold, ambitious views on how our nation is to be ruled from now on."
generic_collectivist_ethos_kr:0 "Unite The Nation"
generic_collectivist_ethos_kr_desc:0 "This era is a strange one, with the rise of Syndicalism, the fragile position of Democracy and the maintained Authoritarian old order. We must protect our country from outside influences by ensuring our people believe in the founding values of our country, least we are washed away by opposing views."
generic_militarism:0 "Militarism"
generic_militarism_desc:0 "Those who view the military as a necessary evil are doomed to hesitate in the face of war. We will ingrain militarism into our culture to become a people of soldiers, if not an army with a state. If one thing is certain since the Weltkrieg, it is that it might very well not have been The War To End War."
generic_military_youth:0 "Military Youth"
generic_military_youth_desc:0 "Organisations to promote discipline and political education of young people in our nation will foster loyalty and self-sacrifice early in a citizen's life. These core values must be learned from the most tender age, so that the next generations are ready to fight for our country."
generic_ideological_fanaticism:0 "Ideological Fanaticism"
generic_ideological_fanaticism_desc:0 "Our politically established values and goals are worth dying for as much as any ancient faith. Any follower should be prepared to face death, and those who stray better be prepared to face death. There is no middle ground in this ideological struggle of the great and small powers alike."
generic_liberty_ethos_kr:0 "Spirit Of Freedom"
generic_liberty_ethos_kr_desc:0 "Freedom is not just a happy happenstance, it is something that must be preserved against tyranny. The Weltkrieg and the rise of Syndicalism has to many put this spirit in doubt, but no nation is too small to rekindle its flame in their governments and populaces and ward against those trying to extinguish it."
generic_rights_of_man:0 "The Rights Of Man"
generic_rights_of_man_desc:0 "The Rights Of Man is perhaps the founding act of the modern Democracy, doing away with the feudal order and ensuring equal rights for all. There have always been the odd doubts about our stance on those essential rights, and we will dispel them without ambiguity. We only stand to benefit from it."
generic_liberty_research:0 "University Grants"
generic_liberty_research_desc:0 "The modern University is a great achievement, allowing people of even modest origin to elevate themselves via higher learning. However, this requires us to fund university grants to allow such access to poorer but aspiring students. Let's make that move now, these future scholars will pay dividends."
generic_welfare:0 "Welfare Programs"
generic_welfare_desc:0 "Equality in rights and equality in education are two important milestones, but economic equality is perhaps the hardest. While we might never reach a perfect equality in this area, we can at least prop up the poorest in our country with fair welfare programs. This ought to help our consumer economy speed up, too."
generic_national_identity:0 "National Identity"
generic_national_identity_desc:0 "While the ideological debate is one we could get lost in for ages, we must not forget who we are at our core. We are unique, we know our history, our culture and we hope that our destiny is even more brilliant. If we have shaped a better society today, we will shape an even better country tomorrow."

### Generic Ideas ###
generic_liberty_idea:0 "Spirit Of Freedom"
generic_liberty_idea_desc:0 "Freedom is something we have pledged to preserve, and this inspires our population to support us even if they may not always agree with our policies or the state of the country in the present moment."
generic_militarism_focus:0 "Militarism"
generic_militarism_focus_desc:0 "Our people have come to see the army as an integral part of our nation, and every conscript plays his part. This allows us to mobilise reserves, militia and other paramilitary forces in a pinch."
generic_military_youth_focus:0 "Military Youth"
generic_military_youth_focus_desc:0 "From the youngest age, our citizens learn military values and integrate them as a part of their life. This obviously increases the amount of vocations for the army as they reach adulthood."
generic_ideological_fanaticism_focus:0 "Ideological Fanaticism"

POLITICS_MOHAMMED_ALAOUITE_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! §LAugust 10th, 1909, in Fès, Wilaya'at of Fès, Sultanate of Morocco§!\n§YBackground:§! §LBorn soon after the Hafidiya that saw his uncle seize the throne from his own brother, Sidi Mohammed bin Yusef would see the capitulation of the nation to two imperial powers from the start of his youth. After the death of his father, Moulay Yusef ben Hassan, in 1927, Mohammed would ascend the throne as Mohammed V at the mere age of 18. Initially indifferent to Germany's entrenchment, he would approve of laws that increased Germany's ever-growing presence in the nation, which often enraged the local populace. As he grew older, he began to realize the importance of uplifting the Moroccan people while understanding the nuances of maintaining loyalty to a nation as powerful as Germany. However, as the years pass, and as the Germans encroach further onto Morocco, he himself has wondered if such a state of affairs can continue within his lifetime.§!"

MOR_royal_morrocan_railways_desc:0 "The one thing we can thank the French for is their railways. However, many of the railway projects that were started in the early 1920s were never finished, despite German aid, leaving many areas difficult to access. Undertaking such a task will not only improve our ability to move throughout the nation and our access to resources, but also improve our living standards."
MOR_agadir_rabat_railway:0 "Agadir-Rabat Railway"
MOR_agadir_rabat_railway_desc:0 "Since the German liberation, Agadir has become a major trading hub for our nation, connecting the rest of Africa to Europe. It is only logical that we improve the connections between it and Casablanca so that we may further reap its profits."

MOR_the_kings_gendarme:0 "The King's Gendarmerie"
MOR_the_kings_gendarme_desc:0 "Mohammed V has sought the creation of an elite Gendarmerie to safeguard his citizens and to maintain public order in times of strife. These brave men will ensure the internal security of our nation is maintained."

MOR_a_new_kind_of_horsepower:0 "A New Kind of Horsepower"
MOR_a_new_kind_of_horsepower_desc:0 "Armoured vehicles have revolutionised modern warfare. A division of our own armoured cavalry would give us an advantage against many other nations, and even the playing field against our neighbours in Algiers."
MOR_a_modern_age_of_war:0 "A Modern Age of War"
MOR_a_modern_age_of_war_desc:0 "Our harsh landscape is difficult to traverse by foot and causes our men to suffer from heat stroke. In this day and age, armies are supported by mechanised units which will reduce our overall attrition and bolster the speed with which our forces can be redeployed."

###Events###
mor.1.t:0 "History of Morocco"
mor.1.d:0 "In 1904, France and Spain carved out zones of influence in Morocco. Recognition by the United Kingdom of France's sphere of influence provoked a strong reaction from the German Empire, and a crisis loomed in 1905. The matter was resolved at the Algeciras Conference in 1906. The Agadir Crisis of 1911 increased tensions between European powers. The 1912 Treaty of Fez made Morocco a protectorate of France, and triggered massive riots. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern Saharan zones. During the Weltkrieg, the Zaian Confederation of Berbers rebelled against France and received ample Central Power support, but failed to achieve any major victories until after the fall of France. While various pretenders attempted to negotiate with the German Empire, they were inconclusive, and in the end, Mohammed V was placed on the throne after his father abdicated. The new Sultan signed a new treaty with the Germans, one whose influence on internal Moroccan affairs was greatly diminished compared to the French Protectorate. The treaty is carefully worded as to render it as amicable as possible. However, tensions still flare up on occasion, sometimes requiring the German-backed Royal Guard to intervene. As the 30s roared in, Morocco recovered from the Protectorate era, yet relations with Algiers remain quite cool, event to the point that some nationalists advocate strengthening the alliance with the German Empire to secure Moroccan independence. The Sultan must safeguard Morocco against not only the revanchist French elites in Algeria, but also the savage revolutionaries in Paris who see Morocco as a gateway for the revolution into Africa and the Islamic World."

mor.2005.t:0 "Islamicist Extremists Attempt a Coup in the Capital"
mor.2005.d:0 "René Guénon - noted author, philosopher, Muslim-influenced Traditionalist, and esoteric scholar - fled to Casablanca as the decadent French Empire collapsed under the fires of revolutionary action. Finding refuge in the Kaiser’s Morocco, Guénon continued his ideological and philosophical development, with the French Revolution rising to become the catalyst of his final metamorphosis. Watching France be consumed by the foul, Godless debauchery that is Syndicalism, Guénon’s belief that the Muslim faith would be the salvation of France was galvanized, paving the way for his current beliefs. \n\nNow, as chaos and uncertainty consumes the Algiers Regime in the wake of Internationale aggression and the Petain Coup, Guénon has come to find himself with a zealous and rapidly growing support base - mainly a mix of Muslim natives desperate for salvation and disillusioned French nationals growing tired of the fools in Algiers. With the backing of these pious patriots and fanatics, Guénon and his far more radical supporters hope to launch what he calls the ‘Re-Reconquista’ - the complete and total reclamation and Islamization of France under Guénon’s stalwart and wise leadership. With the German administration in Morocco far too busy with the tremors of Black Monday and acts of aggression from the French, there is little in the way of anyone coalesced and organized enough to block Guénon’s aspirations. With rumors circulating that Guénon and his forces are preparing to coup the German-backed monarchy, it would seem that the future of Morocco precariously dangles in the balance."

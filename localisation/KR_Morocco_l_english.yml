Undertaking such a task will not only improve our ability to move throughout the nation and our access to resources, but also improve our living standards."
MOR_agadir_rabat_railway:0 "Agadir-Rabat Railway"

MOR_the_kings_gendarme:0 "The King's Gendarmerie"
MOR_the_kings_gendarme_desc:0 "Mohammed V has sought the creation of an elite Gendarmerie to safeguard his citizens and to maintain public order in times of strife. These brave men will ensure the internal security of our nation is maintained."

MOR_a_new_kind_of_horsepower:0 "A New Kind of Horsepower"
MOR_a_new_kind_of_horsepower_desc:0 "Armoured vehicles have revolutionised modern warfare. A division of our own armoured cavalry would give us an advantage against many other nations, and even the playing field against our neighbours in Algiers."
MOR_a_modern_age_of_war:0 "A Modern Age of War"
MOR_a_modern_age_of_war_desc:0 "Our harsh landscape is difficult to traverse by foot and causes our men to suffer from heat stroke. In this day and age, armies are supported by mechanised units which will reduce our overall attrition and bolster the speed with which our forces can be redeployed."

###Events###
mor.1.t:0 "History of Morocco"
mor.1.d:0 "In 1904, France and Spain carved out zones of influence in Morocco. Recognition by the United Kingdom of France's sphere of influence provoked a strong reaction from the German Empire, and a crisis loomed in 1905. The matter was resolved at the Algeciras Conference in 1906. The Agadir Crisis of 1911 increased tensions between European powers. The 1912 Treaty of Fez made Morocco a protectorate of France, and triggered massive riots. By the same treaty, Spain assumed the role of protecting power over the northern and southern Saharan zones. During the Weltkrieg, the Zaian Confederation of Berbers rebelled against France and received ample Central Power support, but failed to achieve any major victories until after the fall of France. While various pretenders attempted to negotiate with the German Empire, they were inconclusive, and in the end, Mohammed V was placed on the throne after his father abdicated. The new Sultan signed a new treaty with the Germans, one whose influence on internal Moroccan affairs was greatly diminished compared to the French Protectorate. The treaty is carefully worded as to render it as amicable as possible. However, tensions still flare up on occasion, sometimes requiring the German-backed Royal Guard to intervene. As the 30s roared in, Morocco recovered from the Protectorate era, yet relations with Algiers remain quite cool, event to the point that some nationalists advocate strengthening the alliance with the German Empire to secure Moroccan independence. The Sultan must safeguard Morocco against not only the revanchist French elites in Algeria, but also the savage revolutionaries in Paris who see Morocco as a gateway for the revolution into Africa and the Islamic World."

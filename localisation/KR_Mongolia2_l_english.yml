POLITICS_STERNBERG_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', had a troubled upbringing, constantly moving and with a father who was committed to an insane asylum. His family estate in Estonia was burned down in 1905, which confirmed his anti-peasant and eventually anti-communist beliefs. He eventually joined Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg, where he became interested in the occult and buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia, where he became known for his heavy drinking and dangerous moods. In 1913 he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as and officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after not being allowed to fight for Mongolian independence. \n\nIn the First Weltkrieg, Ungern fought first in Galicia then, after a 2 month prison stint following attacking another officer in a drunken rage, in the Caucasus. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently against the communists. Ungern eventually travelled through China where he married Manchu Princess Ji. Eventually, he moved to Urga, and defeated the Chinese garrison stationed there, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne and proclaiming Mongolia independent. \n\nUngern himself did not get too involved in Mongol problems, but he kept the peace through force. After narrowly defeating a socialist revolution in 1921 and 1924, he was forced to get more involved. His forces prowled the streets as he hunted out dissidents and purged Mongolian society, including in temples. When the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu was brought to Urga in 1933, Ungern promised he would rule as regent until the boy came of age. However, with Ungern’s grip dependent on his russian military clique, there are fears he will keep the power for himself."
POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DESC:0 "Born in Chahar, Demchugdongrub was the only son of Namjil Wangchuk, Duoluo Duling Junwang of Sönid Right Banner and Chief of the Xilingol League. After the death of his father at only 6, Demchugdongrub inherited the title of Duoluo Duling Junwang. Under Yuan Shikai in 1912, he was promoted to the title of Jasagh Heshuo Duling Jinong. In Chahar he remained for many years, becoming a de facto leader of the province during the chaos following the end of the First Weltkrieg.\n\nDemchugdongrub didn't join Ungern-Sternberg's side until 1926, following Ungern's seizing of Chahar Province from the Guominjun. Ungern met Demchugdongrub in Chahar, and allowed him to keep his titles and to lead Chahar Province. Under Demchugdongrub, Chahar Province grew in military industry, and became far less rebellious against Ungern. In Chahar he remained for many years, funding Pan-Mongol movements throughout Inner Mongolia. In 1932, Demchugdongrub, with a number of other Inner Mongolian nobles, moved to Urga, to get more involved in its politics. Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Revolt, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, seized power. Now, Demchugdongrub's dream of a united Pan-Mongol state can be fully realised."
POLITICS_UNENBAYAN_DESC:0 "Much like many of the nobles who dominated Mongolian politics for many years, Ünenbayan was born in Inner Mongolia. Also known by his Chinese name, Wu Heling, he graduated from school in Chengde, and afterwards studied law in Peking University while also working at the Minister of Interior in the Beiyang government. There, he worked with Prince Gungsangnorbu of Harqin Right Banner at the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. After he graduated from university in 1926, he got more involved in Mongolian affairs, getting into contact with Prince Demchugdongrub and Yondonwangchug in Chahar. Eventually he decided to travel there, to work under Demchugdongrub in Chahar Province. Later, when Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga with many Chahar nobles, he left Ünenbayan there to effectively rule the autonomous province. He proved rather effective at this, only eventually leaving Chahar during the Western Revolt, so that he could assist Demchugdongrub in Urga. Following the successful democratic revolution lead by the Mongol Ardīn Nam, Ünenbayan lobbied to stop the discrimination against the aristocrats of Urga. Being a younger man now in power of Mongolia, Ünenbayan sees an opportunity to mend the rift between the rich elite and the poor peasants, while defending the democracy that Mongolia has become."
POLITICS_7TH_CHANGKYA_KHUTUKHTU_DESC:0 "Born Lobsang Pelden Tenpe Dronme, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu is an extremely important figure in Mongolia. During the Qing Dynasty and the short lived Beiyang Government, the Changkya Khutukhtu’s were the head of the Gelug line of Tibetan Buddhism in Inner Mongolia. After Ungern-Sternberg took the province of Xilingol from the Guominjun, the 7th Changkya Khutuktu declared his loyalty to Ungern-Sternberg, and travelled to Urga to work in Gandantegchinlen Monastery. After regularly holding speeches outside of the monastery, he became a very popular and important figure in Urga.\n\nHowever, his intentions changed in 1930. Ungern-Sternberg, after a small peasant rebellion in Urga, blamed multiple high ranking lamas, and purged them. This caused massive uproar in the highly buddhist society, especially in the upper echelons. The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu therefore decided to form the Buddyn Zövlöl, a secretive group of high ranking lamas who lobbied for increased theocracy in Mongolian society. After the Western Revolt, the Buddyn Zövlöl were able to seize power, and fully begin to implement their plan to reform Mongolian society to a Gelug Buddhist centre."
POLITICS_JAMSRANGIIN_TSEVEEN_DESC:0 "A central figure in Mongolian politics, Jamsrangiin Tseveen was born in Transbaikal during the Russian Empire. He went to a Buryat private school in St. Petersburg, and eventually began visiting Buryat tribes in Irkutsk. In 1902, he became an auditor at St. Petersburg University. While there, he went on many research trips across Transbaikal and Outher Mongolia. After a few years he began to teach Mongolian Language there, and also visited Inner Mongolia and Ordos. When the Bogd Khaanate became independent in 1911, Tseveen supervisied a secular Russian school there and was editor for two newspapers, the Shine toli and Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig.\n\nAfter Mongolia was occupied by Xu Shuzheng in 1919, Tseveen became a professor at Irkutsk University. He also travelled around the area and met with many discontent Mongolias, who eventually founded the Mongol Ardīn Nam. At their founding congress in 1921, Tseveen wrote the Ten Aspirations, the party’s platform. Following their failed revolution in 1921, Tseveen went into hiding in Transbaikal, helping continue to organise the MAN. After the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, Tseveen helped rally Buryat rebels in joining the MAN rebels in once again trying to overthrow Unger-Sternberg. After this failure and the death of their leader, Damdin Sükhbaatar, the MAN went back into hiding. Since then, Tseveen has travelled across the more empty regions of Mongolia, educating the people and conducting research.\n\nFollowing the Western Revolt and the MAN takeover, Tseveen began to see the problems in the party. Over the years he grew more disillusioned with the more radical elements of the party, and saw it as corrupt. Following a power struggle in the party, Tseveen created the Mongol Libyeral Nam, as an opposition to the MAN."
POLITICS_SOLIIN_DANZAN_DESC:0 "As a young man, revolutionary Soliin Danzan was a living as a horse thief, poor and struggle to survive. He lived like this for many years, until he went to Urga to work as a customs official in the Ministry of Finance. In 1919, he, Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, and Damdin Sükhbaatar formed the nationalist group Züün Khüree, which later merged with the Konsulyn Denj group, led by Dogsomyn Bodoo. For a few years after this, the MAN worked with Russian bolsheviks in trying to take over Mongolia. This culminated in the 1921 revolution against Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, which barely failed. Danzan went into hiding after this, as did the rest of the MAN. Danzan was one of the key organisers of the 1924 revolution, another failed mission which led to the death of Sükhbaatar. Following a dangerous power struggle with Dambym Chagdarjav and Dogsomyn Bodoo, Danzan became chairman of the party, once again in hiding. For the years since, Danzan helped push the MAN to a more nationalistic and less bolshevik group, completely disavowing from the failed bolsheviks from Russia.\n\nAfter the Western Revolt in 1936, Soliin Danzan and the MAN were able to seize power, finally allowing him to implement his policies. However, there are still many threats to his rule. The party is still very split, with power hungry members ready to strike. Also, the introduction of democracy, though something the party promises, could be a threat to the party’s rule."
POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DEMOCRATIC_DESC:0 "Born in Chahar, Demchugdongrub was the only son of Namjil Wangchuk, Duoluo Duling Junwang of Sönid Right Banner and Chief of the Xilingol League. After the death of his father at only 6, Demchugdongrub inherited the title of Duoluo Duling Junwang. Under Yuan Shikai in 1912, he was promoted to the title of Jasagh Heshuo Duling Jinong. In Chahar he remained for many years, becoming a de facto leader of the province during the chaos following the end of the First Weltkrieg.\n\nDemchugdongrub didn't join Ungern-Sternberg's side until 1926, following Ungern's seizing of Chahar Province from the Guominjun.

Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Revolt, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, failed to seize power, and he and the aristocrats faced much descrimination from the now empowered peasant Arats. Now, following Ünenbayan making Demchugdongrub Head of State, the Popular Prince finally has a chance to realise his Pan-Mongol dream."

POLITICS_STERNBERG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJanuary 10th, 1886\nGraz, Austro-Hungarian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nNicknamed “The Mad Baron”. Russian white leader during the Russian Civil War, who invaded Chinese-occupied Mongolia in early 1921 with his Asiatic Cavalry Division. He successfully took over and restored the Bogd Khan to the throne. He has vast experience, mostly with cavalry. He has ruled Mongolia with an iron fist, crushing any rebellion and dissent he faced, like the revolutions in 1921 and 1924. He hates any form of syndicalism, and has a complete devotion to monarchism. He is known to be rather mad, and is famous for some of his suicide cavalry charges in battles during the First Weltkrieg, where he fought for Russia. He is an extremely violent person, and has even got into physical fights with officers he’s got into arguments with."
POLITICS_MANLAIBAATAR_DAMDINSUREN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 13th, 1871\nHelongjiang, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA Barga Mongol, he participated in the Mongolian independence back in 1911. He fought many battles with the Chinese in this period until Urga was occupied again by Chinese troops. He began to open a dialogue with the MAN revolutionaries, and was arrested by the Chinese. He almost died in prison, but survived long enough to be broken out by Ungern’s forces and was cared back to full health. Since then, he has fought by the side of Ungern, owing him his life. However, his allegiance does not lie with Ungern, but rather Mongolia as a whole."
POLITICS_ALTANOCHIR_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nInner Mongolia, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAn inner Mongol prince, he travelled to Urga in 1932, following a career of commanding small groups of troops against Chinese troops in Chahar under Demchugdongrub. He was only recently promoted to general, following a good recommendation from Demchugdongrub in 1934, after they grew close."
POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 8th, 1902\nInner Mongolia, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nPrince Demchugdongrub was a high ranking noble of Inner Mongolia who was always for Mongolian independence. Demchugdongrub didn't join Ungern until 1926, after Chahar province was seized from the Guominjun. For a few years after that, Demchugdongrub stayed in Chahar, leading divisions against Chinese border incursions. He even had to command troops against Chahar citizens, as many of the Han Chinese rebelled against Ungern's heavily pro-Mongol and pro-Russian rule. Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga in 1932 with Altanochir, and got quickly involved in its politics. After only a few months he was made head of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, and so he focused far less on military matters, though they remained important to him."
POLITICS_TOGTOKH_GUN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 13th, 1863\nInner Mongolia, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in Inner Mongolia, he fought against Chinese control over the Mongolian region for years. In 1907, when the Qing increased their efforts in colonizing Mongolia with Han Chinese, Togtokh formed a guerilla group to fight them, killing and raiding Chinese people, for which he is now famous for. Forced into Outer Mongolia in 1910, he travelled to Urga in 1911 after the National Revolution with his family, and the Bogd Khan himself promoted him to general. He fought for the liberation of Inner Mongolia 1913, and sieged a fortress with help from bandit leader Ja Lama. Since joining Ungern’s side, he has continued to fight many battles on the Chinese border, even training Mongolian guerrillas in Ulanqab and Ordos."
POLITICS_MIKHAIL_TORNOVSKY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nIn 1882\nPokrovsk, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nTornovsky was a Russian battalion commander in the First Weltkrieg, where he got promoted to the rank of colonel. He became a military commander of White Russian forces during the Civil War, where eventually he came to Mongolia where he set up a business for Russian immigrants there. He was imprisoned by the Chinese still in Urga, but Ungern freed him when he took the city, and so Tornovsky joined him. He became the Asiatic Cavalry Division’s Chief of Staff. He commanded the division during the 1921 MAN revolution, and lead another division during the 1924 MAN revolution. He has become very loyal to Ungern, and hates syndicalism and socialism almost as much as Ungern himself."
POLITICS_NIKOLAY_KAZAGRANDI_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOn October 28, 1886\nKyakhta, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nKazagrandi was a Russian officer in Weltkrieg, mostly for Engineer battalions. In the Russian Civil War, he formed a guerilla officer group fighting against Siberian communists. He took part in multiple battles against communists in Siberia, where he was promoted to commander of White Russia. He commanded White Russian troops and had large control of Siberia. He eventually joined Ungern's forces in Mongolia, bringing much of his remaining forces. Ungern almost had him killed for opposing him, but he showed his skill during the 1921 attempted MAN revolution in Mongolia. He then travelled to the west, to have more independence from Ungern, still worried he will eventually be purged. Since then, he has continued to crush any rebels in that area, and has helped train Mongol rebels in Dzungaria."
POLITICS_FERDYNAND_OSSENDOWSKI_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 27th, 1876\nLudza, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nOssendowski was a Polish traveller and writer who, after finishing university, travelled around Asia. After many years he travelled to Manchuria, where he published his first book. After leaving prison for protesting the Russian brutality in Poland, he wrote many more books. He moved to Siberia at the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, where he got involved in Kolchak’s anti-communist government. When travelling into Mongolia, he met Ungern and joined his side, due to his interest in Ungern's strange beliefs about buddhism and monarchism. He stuck with Ungern, becoming his Chief of Intelligence and a close political advisor. Following a diplomatic trip to Japan and then the USA, he went back to Mongolia, performing counterintelligence against the MAN revolution of 1924, where his intelligence lead to the attack of their base in Uliastai and the death of their leader Sükhbaatar. He continued to work counterintelligence, and grew even closer to Ungern, being promoted to the rank of general in 1926. This was mostly a symbolic promotion, for although he had commanded some troops in his time, Ossendowski was not majorly skilled at it, and did not have much experience with it."
POLITICS_BORIS_REZUKHIN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nUnknown\nRussian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nRezukhin was a Russian officer in the First Weltkrieg. He joined Semenyov during the Russian Civil War, and commanded some regiments in Ungern’s Asiatic Cavalry Division. He remained commander of troops in Ungern’s division, and travelled very far into Siberia to beat the communists. He remained loyal to Ungern, fighting socialists in both the 1921 and 1924 revolution’s. He remained in Urga, cracking down on any sign of dissent or rebellion for Ungern. He has a mad loyalty to him, and has, over time, become almost as mad as the Mad Baron himself."
POLITICS_LI_SHOUXIN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJuly 11th, 1892\nInner Mongolia, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into a family of Han-Mongol landlords, Buyandelger’s ancestors were part of a group of Han Chinese called Mongol followers, who served Mongols and married Mongol women. After working in various military groups, in 1919 he was enlisted in the Zhili Clique army in Jehol. He rose through the ranks for years, until he reached the rank of colonel. He was assigned to Inner Mongolia, where he stayed until he was contacted by Prince Demchugdongrub after Xilingol was seized by Mongolia from the Guominjun. After some negotiations, Buyandelger defected to Mongolia, and travelled with Demchugdongrub to Urga so that they could be introduced. Buyandelger did not stay for long, and he soon travelled back to Xilingol with his forces. In Inner Mongolia, he continues to train Mongolian guerrillas in areas under Chinese control. However, many still question his loyalty to Urga. He defected to Ungern’s side very quickly, and some rumours even indicate Buyandelger still communicates with his old friends in Beijing."
POLITICS_URZHIN_GARMAEV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1888\nMakarovo Village, Transbaikal Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn to the Buryrat people, as a member of the northernmost Mongolian subgroup, Garmaev initially grew up to become a language teacher. He felt little in the way of a call to any national identity or supposed homeland, living most of his life under Tsarist oppression until he made a life changing visit in 1917 to the Tsugol Datsan Monastery. There, the chief Lama recommended he join the fight against the godless Bolsheviks to defend the Buryat and Buddhist way of life, encouraging him to enlist under the local cossack Ataman, Grigory Semyonov. Garmaev rapidly gained Semyonov’s attention and was tasked with recruiting Buryrat speaking soldiers, a task which he excelled at. He was promoted to the officer rank and assigned to the newly formed Buryat-Mongolian regiment 1919, which was sent to support Baron Ungern-Sternberg’s expedition into Mongolia. Garmaev became enamoured with the Mad Baron’s esoteric sense of Mongolian nationalism, having already begun to form his own set of core beliefs, after his visit to Tsugol Datsan. He was encouraged by both Sternberg and Semyonov to preach pan-Mongolian nationalism to the regiment’s troops, as well as the civilians they came across, as a means to indoctrinate them into opposing the Bolsheviks. This eventually caused Garmaev to break with Semyonov, as he grew fearful that the Ataman merely wished to exploit the Buryats and the Mongols for his own purposes, whilst viewing Sternberg as a more rightful leader, who truly had the Mongolic peoples best interests at heart. He was rapidly promoted into a leadership position by Sternberg, and has maintained a great deal of influence, both within the Mad Baron’s administration, but also a growing popularity among the right leaning Mongolian nationalists who have come to accept Garmaev as one of their own."

MON_bribe_nobles_support:0 "Bribe the Princes"
MON_bribe_nobles_support_desc:0 "Though the nobles are opposing our government currently, we can easily take some of the less loyal nobles by bribing them. The princes should be so pliant towards conformity after decades of chinese supression."
MON_purge_the_nobles:0 "Purge the Princes"
MON_purge_the_nobles_desc:0 "The Princes have always been a problem, holding far too much influence in Mongolian government. It is time they see their end."
MON_ignore_prince_issue:0 "Ignore the Princes"

MON_impose_authoritarian_ideas:0 "Impose Authoritarian Ideas"
MON_impose_authoritarian_ideas_desc:0 "Many in Urga currently believe that perhaps it is time for democracy. The problem is that they do not realise how wrong they are, and must be disciplined to stop democracy from infesting the whole of the nation."
MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism:0 "Display Ungern's Buddhism"
MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism_desc:0 "Many in Mongolia do not believe Ungern-Sternberg is committed enough to protecting buddhism and acting in a buddhist lifestyle. Some public displays of him and some loyal monks meditating and holding some speeches should convince them otherwise."

MON_the_great_buddhist_icon:0 "The New Buddhist Icon"
MON_the_great_buddhist_icon_desc:0 "Though Ungern-Sternberg is not a tulku like the Bogd Khan, he should still be known as a buddhist figure of almost equal importance in Mongolia. Fortunately foundational work like the Tibetan Agvan Dorzhiev's work 'The Shambhala Prayer' is already well known and easy material to manipulate for propaganda."
MON_the_greatest_dictator:0 "Cult of Personality"
MON_the_greatest_dictator_desc:0 "To make sure Ungern-Sternberg remains in power, the propaganda around his cult of personality should be temporarily increased massively. This cult of personality relies on mythmaking that officer Ossendowski is adept at spinning."
MON_enforce_officer_loyalty:0 "Enforce Officer Loyalty"
MON_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc:0 "The officer class is a hotbed for noble traitors, socialist rebels and buddhist extremists. Their loyalty should be tested and hardened to root out these issues.

MON_urga_military_parade_desc:0 "Nothing gets the peoples support and shows dominance more than a military parade. To the people of Urga, a military parade is more of a holiday than a display of power, owing to the newness of the concept.

MON_aggressive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Much of the population lives a nomadic lifestyle, not in the cities or towns.

### Events ###

mon.1.t:0 "History of Mongolia"
mon.1.d:0 "Mongolia has been in a steady state of decline for years, however the chaos that engulfed Russia has led to Mongolia’s small economy almost completely crumbling. Chaos has spread due to this, and many have lost faith that Ungern can lead Mongolia through its woes. Officer revolts and riots in major cities have become common, and Ungern is considering sending in the Military to restore order. "
mon.1.a:0 "Personally charge the Rioters!"
mon.1.b:0 "Send in the Army!"

mon.2.t:0 "The Result of the Power Struggle"
mon.2.d:0 "Now that Ungern is dead, Mongolia is falling into chaos. Officers loyal to Ungern-Sternberg have already defected, and several factions are vying for control of the now leaderless state of Mongolia. Who has taken power in Ungern’s absence? "
mon.2.a:0 "Radical Buddhists take Power!"
mon.2.b:0 "Nobles Take Power!"
mon.2.c:0 "Democrats take Power!"

mon.3.t:0 "Ungern-Sternberg Killed!"
mon.3.d:0 "Ungern-Sternberg was killed today as he personally tried to disrupt a riot in Ulaanbaatar. He was shot killed on his horse as he rode into the city by an unknown assailant. Once word had spread about his death, chaos erupted through the city as officers either fled or joined with the rioters, sending most of the city into Anarchy. And as the news of his death spreads nationwide, the nation begins to fall apart. Already, different factions and armies are sporadically fighting for control over the Mongolian state. "
mon.3.a:0 "Oh No..."

mon.4.t:0 "The Nation Stabilizes"
mon.4.d:0 "Fighting across the nation is coming to an end, as [MON.GetName] defeats all opponents. As rival armies collapse, Mongolia nears unity and stability is finally returning to the nation. Now, we can focus on cementing our rule and establishing a cohesive government. "
mon.4.a:0 "Fantastic!"

mon.42.t:0 "Buddyn Zövlöl Takes Power"
mon.42.d:0 "The Buddyn Zövlöl, a secretive council of buddhist lamas, have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
mon.42.a:0 "For Buddhism!"
mon.43.t:0 "Ungern Retakes Power"
mon.43.d:0 "Ungern-Sternberg has retaken power in Urga. Though he now hold de jure control of the nation, his influence outside Urga remains limited, and he will have to act fast if he are to keep his power"
mon.43.a:0 "For Ungern!"
mon.44.t:0 "Noyodyn Zövlöl Take Power"
mon.44.d:0 "The aristocratic Mongol Princes, under the leadership of Prince Demchugdongrub, have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
mon.44.a:0 "For Order!"
mon.45.t:0 "Mongol Ardīn Nam Takes Power"
mon.45.d:0 "The socialist Mongol Ardīn Nam have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
mon.45.a:0 "For Democracy!"


mon.49.t:0 "Ungern loyalists march toward Urga"
mon.49.d:0 "After we were able to seize power of the government, Ungern and his loyal troops escaped. Now, after mustering his power in a village nearby, he and his troops are coming back to retake the city. His army, a mix of Mongols, Russians, and Chinese bandits number over a thousand troops. With most of the national army in the west, we only have the power of the civilians and the hastily established revolutionary militia to defend the city."
mon.49.a:0 "Call on civilians to resist, and march in the militia."
mon.49.b:0 "Call on the citizens to resist these traitors!"
mon.49.c:0 "Lay down our arms, no need for a massacre."
mon.50.t:0 "Ungern loyalists destroyed"
mon.50.d:0 "Finally, after much fighting and many casualties, Ungern has been killed, and his troops have been repulsed. Urga is ours, for now."
mon.50.a:0 "The people of Urga want change!"
mon.51.t:0 "Ungern loyalists have captured Urga!"
mon.51.d:0 "After little fighting, Ungern and his troops were able to take back the city. Though most of our officials have escaped, we are unlikely to be seen as the real government without power in Urga."
mon.51.a:0 "Those men are more Russian than Mongolian."
mon.52.t:0 "Re-evaluation of Monastery funding"
mon.52.d:0 "With the power now in the people’s hands, and with Mongolia modernising every day, one key thing to evaluate is the funding the monasteries receive from the government. The monasteries, though an important aspect of Mongolia, is a very traditional area of the nation, and many lamas even push anti-government propaganda, either harbouring back to Ungerns Mongolia or even supporting the now defunct Buddyn Zövlöl. Some in our government state that funding for the monasteries should be reduced, for they harbour sentiments of authoritarianism and traditionalism. Others in government argue that for now, it might be best to keep the lamas on our side, and to leave the funding where it is, or even increase it."
mon.52.a:0 "Keep the Monasteries on our side."
mon.52.b:0 "Give the money to the people!"
mon.52.c:0 "The lamas may be a good ally, let's give them more funding."
mon.53.t:0 "The Popular Prince"
mon.53.d:0 "Ünenbayan was elected to government mostly thanks to assistance from the aristocrats. Now, discussions have begun throughout the party as to whether he is the right man to lead. Many people do not know him too well, and mostly see him as a noble bureaucrat, lacking much charisma. A figure of the aristocrats that does have charisma, however, is Prince Demchugdongrub. Following the Western Revolt, the Prince and many of his aristocrats remained in Urga, to try to keep their influence. Demchugdongrub has remained a very popular figure, and many have stated he should rule as prime minister, with Ünenbayan as his deputy. Some, however, may see this as a betrayal of the democratic process."
mon.53.a:0 "Invite Demchugdongrub to become Prime Minister."
mon.53.b:0 "If he wants to lead, he can do it democratically!"
mon.54.t:0 "Review the Budget"
mon.54.d:0 "Throughout Ungerns years as dictator of Mongolia, spending increased massively. The country’s economy is weak, and changes must be made. Ungern began massive military projects, all of which cost massive amounts. We, the aristocrats, were taxed massively to pay the bill. Of course, aristocrat taxes have already been cut massively, and to offset this we could increase the tax on the poor majority of the nation, the arats. Perhaps, we could even begin a tax policy on the monasteries."
mon.54.a:0 "Cut military spending."
mon.54.b:0 "Raise Arat tax."
mon.54.c:0 "Implement Monastery tax."
mon.55.t:0 "Assassination attempt on Ungern-Sternberg!"
mon.55.d:0 "While riding his horse in a parade through Urga, a sudden noise deafened the crowds. A shot that echoed through the city, that missed Baron Ungern by two inches. The assassin, a twenty three year old man, was shot almost immediately. Ungern ordered the marching army to fire on the crowd, frenzied by the attempt on his life. The crowd dispersed in a panic as civilians, or possible MAN agents, were killed by Ungerns troops. After the city had calmed down, the assassin has been identified as a member of the Mongol Ardīn Nam, however many peasants in Urga claim this to be fabricated by our government. Though the Baron survived, this attempt showed weakness, and the chaos Ungern caused by killing the possible MAN agents can’t be good for our popularity."
mon.55.a:0 "At least the Baron survived."
mon.56.t:0 "[MON.GetLeader] asks for weapons"
mon.56.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader] has asked our government for weapons, to help him defend Mongolia from its enemies. Mongolia is our foothold in China, and it might be best to keep it on our side."
mon.56.a:0 "Send them arms."
mon.56.b:0 "We are too busy."
mon.57.t:0 "Russia agreed to send arms"
mon.57.d:0 "Russia have sent us a shipment of guns, and have agreed to do this every year so long as we remain in power."
mon.57.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.58.t:0 "Russia refused to send arms"
mon.58.d:0 "Russia have decided to no longer send us any arms."
mon.58.a:0 "Damn."
mon.59.t:0 "Diplomatic Mission from Mongolia"
mon.59.d:0 "Mongolia, lead by the religious zealot the [MON.GetLeader], has recently sent us a diplomatic mission. Due to both of our nations being major homes for buddhism, the Mongolian diplomats have stated that they wish to see our nations grow closer, through guarantees and military access. They await our answer."
mon.59.a:0 "We buddhist nations must stick together!"
mon.59.b:0 "We are better off alone."
mon.60.t:0 "The Western Revolt has finally been crushed"
mon.60.d:0 "After many months of fighting in the west of the nation, between bandits, rebels, and government troops, the revolt has been crushed. Most rebels have dispersed, gone into hiding or fled the country, fearing for their lives. Order has come out on top, and the country is secure. However, there are still some small bandit groups, taking advantage of the destruction. They will have to be dealt with."
mon.60.a:0 "At last, the nation is safe."
mon.61.t:0 "The Offer"
mon.61.d:0 "Today, we received a letter from a few of the bandit leaders in the west. In the letter, it said that their groups do not have any stake in what has developed. They came for simple banditry, but it has turned into all out rebellion. The letter goes on to say that although their groups continues to fight in the west, they would be willing to stop, if given some money and supplies. It is a large amount of money, which we will need to find, but it will help reduce the size of the chaos in the west."
mon.61.a:0 "Use the nobles money to pay the bribe."
mon.61.b:0 "Sell off some of the monasteries jewels to pay it."
mon.61.c:0 "Raise taxes on the poor to pay the bribe."
mon.61.e:0 "Reduce military funding to pay the bribe."
mon.61.f:0 "We will not negotiate with these bandits!"
mon.62.t:0 "The bandit leader takes the bribe"
mon.62.d:0 "The bandit leaders have taken our offer, and have decided to end their operations in the west. In these times of brutal battle, good news like this should be celebrated, but a quiet drink is all [MON.GetLeader] had time for, before having to return to keeping Urga in his hands."
mon.62.a:0 "That'll reduce their forces."
mon.63.t:0 "Mongolia asks for guarantees"
mon.63.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader], currently leader of Mongolia, has requested that we guarantee their nation, to keep them safe from outside threats. This will cement them as our influence in the region."
mon.63.a:0 "Guarantee them."
mon.63.b:0 "We don't want to be pulled into Chinese affairs."
mon.64.t:0 "Russia has agreed!"
mon.64.d:0 "Russia has agreed to give us guarantees, to keep us safe from outside threats."
mon.64.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.65.t:0 "Russia has refused!"

mon.66.d:0 "For many years, the Ma Clique has been led by family elder Ma Fuxiang. In the Clique, he was seen as a pillar of stability, who would stop any power struggle occurring between the very divided Ma families. Many in China even see him as the stabiliser of the Northwest, ending Tibetan and our own aggression into Chinese soil.\n\nHowever, news has just reached us that Ma Fuxiang has passed away. Currently he has been replaced by Ma Lin, but another Ma, Ma Bufang, and Ma Lin are already embroiled in a power struggle. This could be a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the Ma Clique's position."

mon.67.d:0 "Mongolian general Buyandelger has generally stayed uninvolved with the power struggles happening currently in Urga. For years, he has continued to live in Inner Mongolia, raiding Chinese shipments through the region. Now, we have just received reports that Buyandelger has gathered a large force on the border with the Ma Clique, likely to do some border raids into Ulanqab."
mon.67.a:0 "Let the border raids begin."

mon.68.d:0 "Ever since the death of family patriarch Ma Fuxiang, tensions on both the northern and southern border have been getting worse and worse. Border Raids from Mongolia, primarily in the province of Ulanqab, have caused much chaos over the recent weeks. This is not wholly unexpected, though we should be prepared for if this escalates further."
mon.68.a:0 "This is fine."
mon.69.t:0 "Buyandelger makes his choice"
mon.69.d:0 "With his large force moving through Ulanqab, a thought occurred to Buyandelger. If he was to take Guisui, he would have de facto control of the province. With the Ma's struggling with internal conflict, it should not be too difficult to move his force through the region and to take the city. Now, it is whether he decides to do it or not."
mon.69.a:0 "It's too risky."
mon.69.b:0 "Buyandelger, do it."
mon.70.t:0 "Large Mongolian force moving to Guisui"
mon.70.d:0 "Some of our scouts have reported a large force of Mongolian soldiers moving toward the main city of Ulanqab, Guisui. Should the Mongols take it, they will have de facto control of the whole region. Though there is a garrison in Guisui, many fear it will not be enough to beat the quickly approaching Mongols. Ma Hongkui is currently in the region with his force, so he may be able to fight them off."

There, he declared it now under Mongolian control. However, we can still act. Ma Hongbin is also now in the area, and could move his own forces up to try to retake the city."

mon.71.b:0 "Send a force under Ma Hongbin."
mon.72.t:0 "We have taken Ulanqab!"

Though he had to fight some small battles with border troops, and had to fight through the Guisui garrison, for now it seems the Ma Clique have retreated from Ulanqab. Finally, Mongolian families have been reunited, and Mongolian rule in the region has been restored."

mon.73.t:0 "Ma Hongkui loses"
mon.73.d:0 "Ma Hongkui's forces travelled for a day and a night to finally reach the Mongolian force. In the early hours of the morning, Ma Hongkui sent in his soldiers to attack the Mongolians, who looked like they were just camping. However, it was a trap! After Hongkui sent his main force in, a group of Mongolian cavalry had snuck behind and attacked on the back lines, at the same time as the battle going on at the front. Ma Hongkui's force was caught in the middle, and beaten. Hongkui was able to make his escape, but he lost the battle, and the Mongol force has almost reached Guisui."

mon.76.t:0 "Ma Hongbin has lost, Mongolians take Guisui"
mon.76.d:0 "Ma Hongbin decided to try to go for a full frontal attack against the Mongolian force with his own force, to avoid being scouted and routed by the Mongols. Therefore he charged directly at the city, but by that point he had already fallen into Buyandelger's trap. From behind hills on both sides of his force emerged groups of Mongol cavalry, who pincered Hongbin's forces, leaving them with 2 options: either retreat and concede the city, or move into the city and try to take it, then deal with the outside cavalry afterwards. In this critical moment, Hongbin decided to push through to try to take the city. However, much of his force had already started to retreat, seeing the city as a death sentence. With that, Ma Hongbin's weakened group were forced to retreat. It seems Ulanqab has now fallen into Mongol hands."

This morning, when his maid came in to serve him breakfast, she dropped the tray in shock, as she saw a frail Ungern laying in his bed, covered in his own bloody vomit. Many monks and lamas were ordered in, bringing many herbs and other tribal remedies. However, it appears the Barons health is not getting much better."

As they entered the room, they saw Ungern’s body, face down on the ground, collapsed. Upon further inspection, they discovered he wasn’t breathing, and quickly rushed to find lamas to try to save him. Alas, it was too late for the Baron. The guards stationed outside his room were executed, for letting him die on their watch, as were many of the lamas who were there to cure him.\n\nWhile investigating the room, a short book was found, written by Ungern, detailing what would happen if he died. It was read to a council of Ungern’s inner circle: Boris Rezukhin, Mikhail Tornovsky, Ferdynand Ossendowski, Agvan Dorzhiev, and Vladimir Roerich. Also present was the powerless 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. It stated that Rezukhin was Ungern’s successor, and that he must be protected so that he could rule in the Barons stead. Tornovsky refutes this, stating that he was Ungern’s rightful successor, but after Rezukhin pulled a pistol on him, he conceded. The book also stated stability of the realm was paramount, and that though Rezukhin will now rule, Baron Ungern-Sternberg will still be used in all propaganda, and his cult of personality will remain."

Although Kerenskiy did not allow the House of Romanov to rightfully retake the throne, he was still better than the Reds, and he allowed our relationship to grow strong.\n\nHowever, everything has all been brought to question. Any sign of stability that Kerensky brought to Russian politics was lost the moment the bullet struck his body.

Both of them even compared us to the dictator Ungern-Sternberg! Ironic, seeing as the Ünenbayan's aristocratic friends were the ones helping keep the Baron's government alive. However, their reaction to this is unsurprising. What is surprising is the reaction of the people.

Thousands of people took to the streets and began looting pro-government shops and buildings, while violently attacking any police officer or soldier who opposed them. Toward the end of the day, with the riot having no sign of stopping, a cavalry battalion was called into the city, to put down the riot by any means necessary. Though the use of batons and rifles, the riot eventually dispersed. However, a death count has now been completed, showing that 39 people were killed in the riots, with another 62 seriously injured."

mon.147.d:0 "Ünenbayan and Tseveen, speaking in Urga together today, both made a speech about temporarily uniting their party's, for the purpose of removing our government from power. They stated that the current government is dangerous, and rules through military force, and are traitors to the Democratic Revolution. Their calls for unity against the government were met with thunderous applause.\n\nOf course, we cannot let this stand. Really, we have two options. One, suggested by radical Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir, is that we poison Ünenbayan using one of our spies who is close to him. Another plan, as suggested by the more moderate Tseren-Ochiryn Dambadorj, is to spread dissent between the two parties, in an attempt to split their hastily formed union."

mon.148.d:0 "Earlier today, Ünenbayan released a statement denouncing Tseveen and the MLN, and stating that the union of the two parties is at an end. This is because of some recently discovered evidence that apparently, Tseveen was working against the union, and was planning on betraying Ünenbayan. Tseveen has come out against these claims, but it appears the union between the two parties is over."

Apparently, while our spy attempted to plant the poison in Ünenbayan's food during his dinner, he was caught in the act, and was shot by a guard when he reached for his own pistol. Ünenbayan released a statement announcing the attempt on his life, and has once again denounced our government, for our \"evil, authoritarian tactics\"."

mon.150.d:0 "We have now discovered that Ünenbayan has been receiving aid from many of his noble friends. This is of no surprise, for they are his main support base. However, recently it has been uncovered that Demchugdongrub is personally supplying Ünenbayan with rifles, pistols, and even some artillery pieces, to fight against our government. Should we make the wrong move, we may face another revolution.\n\nTo try to gain back support from the people of Urga, Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir has approached us, stating that we should use the fact that they are both from Inner Mongolia against them, and claim it is a Chinese plot."

mon.151.d:0 "Disaster! During a regular patrol through the city, as the sun was just rising, a band of soldiers were ambushed by a group of pro-democracy rebels. The soldiers were caught off guard, and were massacred. This triggered the beginning of a rebellion in Urga, led by Ünenbayan. His rebels are well armed, thanks to funding he secured through the nobles. No doubt this is merely a plot for the nobles to try to take power once again. However, we must act fast, to put down the rebellion, or risk losing our power. However, putting it down would be disastrous for human life."

However, that changed when General Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren marched in with a large force, from the surrounding barracks'. After surrounding the city, Damdinsüren's troops moved in and went street to street, clearing out the remaining rebels.\n\nBy evening it was all over. The streets of Urga were stained crimson, with the blood of hundreds of rebels and civilians alike. However, though sadness reigned over most of the city, the State Great Khural was very different. There, [MON.GetLeader] held a speech to only MAN members, declaring their victory against the rebels and a start to true Mongolian Socialism. The whole hall erupted in applause."
mon.152.a:0 "Power is Secure."
mon.153.t:0 "Ünenbayan takes power"
mon.153.d:0 "With the last surrender of our troops, Ünenbayan marched into the State Great Khural, and declared the fighting as over. As many in the MAN government were arrested, including [MON.GetLeader], Ünenbayan made a speech, claiming this was once again a new beginning for Mongolia, a democratic one. For now, he and the MLN have made a power sharing deal, until elections can be held soon."

Though me and him disagree about many things, that does not change a simple fact: that we are both Mongolian. Ünenbayan is as much Mongolian as I as is you. This government wishes to try to divide Mongolians in a weak attempt to weaken our resolve. However, we will not let this stand. It is time for us to march!\"This speech, held in the outskirts of Urga to a massive crowd, received much applause and cheers from the people watching.

mon.156.d:0 "As government troops marched through the streets, gunning down anyone who showed resistance, it seems this had the opposite of the desired effect. As one man is shot, three men decide to join the rebellion against us. Ünenbayan, using weapons he bought thanks to the nobles, has armed the rebels with guns, and they have began marching toward the State Great Khural now..."
mon.156.a:0 "This won't be good."
mon.157.t:0 "Tseveen releases statement against claim"
mon.157.d:0 "In a statement released by Ünenbayan today, he states: \n\n\"The current government has proven they are unable to keep the peace and perform their democratic duty. In blaming me for the attacks, they have shown their true colours: dangerous, and willing to exploit human loss for political gain. I can confirm that I was in no way involved in the planning of this attack, and I pray for the swift recovery for anyone injured in the attack. Not only was I not involved in this, I declare now that this act of terror was committed by the government itself, to try to give legitimacy to their cancellation of elections. We must make sure the government who committed this crime pay for their actions.\""
mon.157.a:0 "We stand by it."
mon.158.t:0 "Ünenbayan states Tseveen is just as bad as [MON.GetLeader]"
mon.158.d:0 "Rather controversially, Ünenbayan, leader of the KAN and one of our main opponents, publicly released a statement about Tseveen's denial of the events prior: \n\n\"I fear today that I must partially agree with the government's statement about the bombings, that it was in fact Tseveen and his MLN who organised it. The acts of violence caused by the MLN are level with the pains the current MAN government have caused to all Mongolians. Both the MLN under Tseveen and the MAN under [MON.GetLeader] are evil groups, who seek to destroy any order and peace the nation has, and replace them with bloody syndicalist revolution.\"\n\nIronically, this statement has proven very unpopular, with government supporters claiming that Ünenbayan only works for himself, and MLN supporters claiming Ünenbayan has betrayed them. It seems Ünenbayan's nobles will not be a problem in the coming future."
mon.158.a:0 "Divide and conquer."
mon.159.t:0 "Tseveen declares the government dead"
mon.159.d:0 "In a speech today just on the outskirts of Urga to a large crowd of people, Tseveen declared:\n\n\"The current government is dead! They no longer have any mandate to rule, and have cast off democracy and justice in favour of nepotism and corruption. We Mongolians know revolution well; we fought against Chinese rule in 1911, and against Ungern-Sternberg in 1936. Therefore, I declare now the start of a new Revolution: The Liberal Revolution!\"\n\nMany cheers were heard from the crowd, and word of this new revolution spread around Urga quickly."
mon.159.a:0 "Worrying."
mon.160.t:0 "Arsenal raided by rebels"
mon.160.d:0 "Early in the morning, a weapons arsenal was raided by revolutionaries. There is evidence that the men guarding the arsenal actively supported the rebels, allowing them to take the weapons without resistance. It seems now we will have to deal with the growth of militant violence."
mon.160.a:0 "Damn."
mon.161.t:0 "Tseveen travels out of Urga to gather support in nearby areas"
mon.161.d:0 "Tseveen has recently made public that he intends to travel out to nearby villages and nomadic groups near Urga, to try and gain their support for the revolution. While doing this, he has only taken a small force of men with him, and has left the rest of his supporters in Urga. We must act on this, and this leaves us with a choice. Either we can try to root out the rebels in the city while Tseveen in away, or we can send out a group of men to attack Tseveen while his supporters remain in Urga. Without their leader, they will surely fail."
mon.161.a:0 "Send out troops to attack Tseveen."

mon.162.t:0 "The Attack on Tseveen"
mon.162.d:0 "In the early evening of last night, Tseveen's group set up camp outside a small village a few miles outside Urga. His party was only 25 men strong, and when they were met with a group of 200 government troops, they were extremely unprepared. While most of Tseveen's men were sleeping, out troops took positions and fired as one, killing most of his men almost immediately. The rest, including Tseveen, surrendered before they were gunned down too. The men were arrested and brought back to Urga, where they will live in a prison cell for the rest of their lives."
mon.162.a:0 "Perfect."
mon.163.t:0 "Large riots spark in Urga after innocents get investigated"
mon.163.d:0 "After giving the order for investigations, a large group of soldiers numbering around 200 were tasked with going through every person in Urga to root out the rebels. However, it seems this move was not exactly popular with the population. The soldiers did small investigations on many people in Urga, and if they deemed them to be rebels, either arrested them or lined them up and shot them without trial. After doing this through part of Urga, the people in the city began to resist them. Civilians began to throw rocks at the soldiers, and were met with bullets. This quickly led to massive riots throughout Urga, primarily lead by armed MLN insurgents."
mon.163.a:0 "End the riot with bullets."
mon.163.b:0 "Open talks with Tseveen and his rebels."
mon.164.t:0 "Massacre in Urga"
mon.164.d:0 "After organising the troops and gathering more, the battalion, now 500 soldiers strong, marched into Urga and declared that any resistance was to be met with bullets. Starting in upper Urga, the battalion battled hard with rioting civilians and MLN insurgents alike, and both sides took substantial losses. It wasn't until the battalion began to move that things turned for the worst. While travelling through the middle of Urga, the battalion were very quickly surrounded by armed MLN insurgents, who opened fire on the troops. Whenever a rebel was killed, another came in to take his place. Casualties for the rebels were very high, however, they had won the day. All the soldiers in the battalion were lost, and so the group, lead by the now returned Tseveen, moved in to take the State Great Khural."
mon.164.a:0 "The rebellion has succeeded."
mon.165.t:0 "Tseveen takes over the government"
mon.165.d:0 "After fighting off the remaining guards of the State Great Khural, Tseveen took his place as Prime Minister. [MON.GetLeader] was arrested, along with multiple other major MAN players. While there, Tseveen declared that it was time for the people of Mongolia to experience true democracy, and that an election was already being scheduled."
mon.165.a:0 "Freedom wins in Mongolia."
mon.166.t:0 "Tseveen demands elections and arrests of many MAN members"
mon.166.d:0 "After releasing a statement that we would be prepared for talks with the MLN rebels, Tseveen has released a new statement:\n\n\"We decline your offer for talks with us. It is not talks we need. Talks would lead to small concessions which allow you to subvert the democratic process. Instead, we have made a list of demands. If these demands are followed, then the revolution will end. \n1. Elections must be scheduled as soon as possible.\n2. The arrests of the perpetrators who lead to this situation, primarily [MON.GetLeader].\n3. The freedom for any rebels who have been arrested during the past few weeks.\n4. Justice served to those soldiers who carelessly killed innocent civilians.\n5. The acknowledgement by the MAN that this revolution was caused by their undemocratic actions.\""
mon.166.a:0 "We can never agree to this."
mon.166.b:0 "Elections are fine, but defend the MAN members."

mon.167.t:0 "Tseveen raises his forces"
mon.167.d:0 "Across Urga today, hundreds of armed MLN rebels have risen against us, after hearing of our refusal of their demands. The group organised and quickly defeated the garrison that was present in the city, with some of the soldiers even joining their side. Now, the rebels begin their march to the State Great Khural."
mon.167.a:0 "This doesn't look good."
mon.168.t:0 "Tseveen states MAN arrests are key to uphold democracy"
mon.168.d:0 "Tseveen has released a response to our answer that elections can occur so long as MAN members like [MON.GetLeader] are not arrested. His response was that the arrests of these men is necessary to allow democracy to function, and to protect it for the future. The rebels demands remain unchanged."
mon.168.a:0 "Then we refuse."
mon.168.b:0 "We have to agree to this."
mon.169.t:0 "Our Russia policy"
mon.169.d:0 "For many years now we have aligned close to Russia. Now, however, after they ended their economic assistance to us after the death of President Kerenskiy, it has come into question whether we should continue to follow the Russians. However, aligning against them would call into question why we, as Russians, are even leading in Mongolia."
mon.169.a:0 "Ally with Russia once again."

mon.170.t:0 "The Constitution of [GetYear]"
mon.170.d:0 "After finally securing control of Mongolia, [MON.GetLeader] made a speech outside the State Great Khural, promising many things, including the redistribution of wealth, a new constitution, and democratic elections. In the following months since, the government has worked hard to set right the injustices caused by the previous government. The peasants now finally feel like they truly have power, and do not work as slaves.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the government has been working on the second promise. Over the period of multiple weeks, full of long meetings and heated arguments, the new constitution has been drafted. This constitution sets out the government form, with the Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu as the figurehead leader of the nation once he comes of age, with much power in the hands of the working class, through voting for the Prime Minister and his government. It also includes points about human and workers rights, and ensures universal suffrage.\n\nWith celebrations of the new constitution echoing through Urga, we must now focus on the last of [MON.GetLeader]'s promises: elections."

mon.171.d:0 "In the past few months, it has become clear to the Baron that his rule is constantly in danger. Therefore, he has declared it time to examine our current military staff, and decide whether they are loyal to Ungern, or whether it is time they saw a bullet."
mon.171.a:0 "We must root out the traitors!"
mon.172.t:0 "Status of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren"
mon.172.d:0 "Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren has fought on the side of Mongolia for decades, taking part in Mongolian independence back in 1911. Though he opened dialogue with the MAN rebels at the time, he was arrested by the Chinese, and almost died in his cell. He would have died had it not been for Ungern's Asiatic Cavalry Division taking Urga from Chinese control and freeing him. Many Mongolians see the old man as a unifying figure; a sign that Mongolians are still able to lead in this Russian-dominated government. However, perhaps his links to the MAN never went away. Though we have failed to find any evidence of this, perhaps he aided the MAN rebels against us, and almost led to our downfall. He constantly makes it clear that he doesn't serve us, rather serving Mongolia directly. Maybe it is time for the old General to meet his end."
mon.172.a:0 "He is trustworthy."
mon.172.b:0 "End him."
mon.173.t:0 "Status of Nikolay Kazagrandi"
mon.173.d:0 "Nikolay Kazagrandi has been working under Ungern-Sternberg after he left Siberia during the Russian Civil War. Ungern almost had him purged back then, but his high skill during the 1921 MAN Revolution made Ungern let him stay. After that, he travelled to the west of the nation, to put down rebellion and to train anti-Chinese forces in the province of Dzungaria. It is clear that in this mission he failed. At the start of the Western Revolt, he was in Dzungaria, rather than doing his job of putting down anti-government activity. Ungerns mistrust of him was obviously justified. However, will his skill save him from being purged this time?"
mon.173.a:0 "He is trustworthy."
mon.173.b:0 "End him."
mon.174.t:0 "Status of Togtokh Taij"
mon.174.d:0 "Togtokh Taij's situation is similar to that of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren. The old man formed an anti-Chinese guerrilla group in Inner Mongolia in 1907, for which he became a Mongolian hero. He was promoted to the rank of general by the Bogd Khan himself, after he came to Urga following the revolution against the Chinese. In expelling Chinese troops, he worked with bandit leader Ja Lama multiple times. This is where the worry about Togtokh Taij lies. It was Ja Lamas Yum-Beise bandits who sparked the start of the Western Revolt just months ago. Perhaps Togtokh Taij organised the bandits into rebelling, so that he could gain power for himself."
mon.174.a:0 "He is trustworthy."
mon.174.b:0 "End him."
mon.175.t:0 "Status of the Officers"
mon.175.d:0 "The officer class have proven their disloyalty over the past few months. With many officers deciding to align themselves with the opposing rebel groups, it is clear many of their loyalties do not sit with us. Perhaps it is time for the officer class to be cleansed of anyone who dared declare themselves for an opposing faction."
mon.175.a:0 "They are fine."
mon.175.b:0 "They must be cleansed."
mon.176.t:0 "Status of Altanochir"
mon.176.d:0 "Altanochir is a prince from Inner Mongolia, who only very recently travelled to Urga from Inner Mongolia, after recommendation from Prince Demchugdongrub. It should already be clear as to why he is on the chopping block. Demchugdongrub pushed to gain power during the chaos of the Western Revolt. It was his clique of princes and nobles who almost led to our downfall. Altanochir, still being quite a low level military leader, should be an obvious one to be purged."
mon.176.a:0 "He is trustworthy."

mon.177.t:0 "The Purge has Ended"
mon.177.d_small:0 "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end.

The military leaders of Mongolia who survived breathe a sigh of relief, though some may still scheme against us."
mon.177.d_medium:0 "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Many high up military figures were executed throughout the last few weeks, all in the name of safety and justice for traitors.

mon.178.t:0 "37 People Die in Factory Explosion"
mon.178.d:0 "Following Ungern's new policy of Aggressive Industrialisation, construction of new factories, sponsored mostly by Russian businessmen, sprung up across the nation. With this new mass industrialisation along with the complete lack of labour rights, all of the workers constructing these factories are in clear danger. A common cause of death nowadays is death while constructing a new factory. The best example of this occurred today, when 37 people were killed in an explosion during the construction of a factory outside Mörön. The factory is to become a textile factory, owned personally by Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man. Due to the lack of any safety regulations whatsoever, a poorly build bit of construction machinery failed, causing a fire which led to the explosion. Rezukhin commented that it was the fault of the workers doing poor work, a statement Ungern agreed with."

mon.179.t:0 "Mongol Ardīn Nam Cell Destroyed near the Russian Border"
mon.179.d:0 "After receiving information from one of our informants placed in the MAN, we learned the location of a major MAN cell, just on the Russo-Mongolian border. So, under the command of Boris Rezukhin, a battalion was sent out from Urga up north to the location. After travelling and searching for a few days, they eventually found it. A large complex of gers of all sizes, surrounded by a quickly put up wooden fence. Patrols of men armed with rifles and wearing MAN symbols on their caps travelled around the complex every few minutes. It is clear that the camp is struggling to keep together, following the failure of their now third revolution. After surrounding the camp, Rezukhin moved his troops in, and took the complex. There was a small firefight, but nothing major; it seems most of their actual fighting soldiers died during the revolution. Rezukhin rounded up everyone else that was left, primarily older men or women, and either shot them there or took them in for questioning. After going through all the papers in the gers, the locations of multiple, smaller MAN cells were discovered, as well as some of their future plans which included a plan to assassinate Ungern-Sternberg. After getting all the decent information out of the area, Rezukhin burned the complex to the ground, and brought back his prisoners for questioning through out secret police."

Many of them claim that they do not serve Ungern, but rather serve the nation of Mongolia. However, what they fail to see is that these are one in the same. For this betrayal, these soldiers have been imprisoned, so that they cannot spread dissent against us."

mon.181.d:0 "Many of the rich nobles and princes of Mongolia have their own guard with them at all times, almost like a private army. After hearing that they were going to have their lands seized to be distributed to the populus, a few princes decided to unite their guards to protect their lands. After refusing to cede their land to the government, the newly created Mongolian Revolutionary Army were sent in, under the leadership of Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. After approaching the princes lands once again, the princes guard stood firm, and refused to allow the MRA in. Dogsom said that they had the choice now to either surrender now or face death. Though a handful of guards put down their arms and were let go, the vast majority stood their ground and refused to move. With that, Dogsom gave the command to open fire. The princes guard put up a strong fight, but they were eventually beaten by the MRA. The few that remained surrendered and were arrested, as were the princes whose troops they were."

It is presumed that one of the lama-monks have broken their vows and cursed the child's health. After much searching and interrogation, it was discovered that a monk had eaten a fish on the day the young Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu became sick. After this monk was justly defrocked and beaten, the child recovered from his illness.

mon.600.t:0 "The Current Situation"
mon.600.d:0 "In 1936, Ungern’s rule remains under threat. There are four main cliques that dominate Mongolian political society.\n\nThe Rossiyskaya Voyennaya Klika are a clique of White Russian officers under the leadership of Ungern-Sternberg. They focus on cooperation with Russia, military strength and anti-socialism. They currently lead the country, working with the Noyodyn Zövlöl and the Buddyn Zövlöl.\nThe Noyodyn Zövlöl is the name of the a council of Mongolian Princes and nobles, who had been the ruling class of the country for centuries. Focusing on keeping their wealth and power secure, they are de facto led by the Inner Mongolian Price Demchugdongrub, and are dominated by Inner Mongolian Princes from Xilingol.\nThe Buddyn Zövlöl are a council of high ranking buddhists lamas in Mongolia, which was formed following Ungern’s purge of lamas in 1930. Members of the council are fanatic buddhists, who wish to turn Mongolia into a truly theocratic society. They are led by the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, a high ranking lama from Inner Mongolia.\nThe Mongol Ardīn Nam, the socialist party who rebelled in 1921 and 1924 remain in hiding, but are still a strong force to be reckoned with. Led by Soliin Danzan, they have taken some inspiration from Russia’s democracy, and therefore have begun advocating for multiparty democracy.\n\nMongolia also faces external threats. For many years, border skirmishes have taken place between the Muslim Chinese Ma Clique and Mongolian troops across the border. A similar situation is taking place in the Dzungaria region of the Xinjiang Clique. The main point of tension is the province of Yushu, which has swapped hands between Tibet and the Ma Clique over the past few years. The province is a powderkeg waiting to explode, and when it does, the opportunity to unite the Mongolian people cannot be ignored."

HOL_national_recovery_desc:0 "Plutocratic incompetency has resulted in the collapse of our economy. At the same time, the world becomes increasingly unsafe. If we invest fully in the defensive and offensive capabilities of our country that too will help the economy grow again, but then with construction that will actually help our country's security in the future."
HOL_public_works:0 "Public Works"
HOL_public_works_desc:0 "By investing in public projects like the construction of canals, city parks and highways, we will be able to restore the purchasing power of the common man, who would otherwise be unemployed, while also getting improved infrastructure in return."
HOL_drop_golden_standard:0 "Drop the Gold Standard"
HOL_drop_golden_standard_desc:0 "We adhere to the Gold Standard so that investors will see the Guilder as a stable currency that can always be turned in for gold at the central bank. An unfortunate side-effect of having a strong Guilder is that it makes it expensive for people from other countries to purchase Dutch products. By dropping the gold standard and devaluing the Guilder we can mitigate these effects."
HOL_defense_spending_spree:0 "Defence Spending Spree"
HOL_defense_spending_spree_desc:0 "We shall bring our military back to the level of the rest of the world. Socialists and other unpatriotic folk are saying that the military should be the last place the government should invest in these times but we shall prove them wrong!"
HOL_extend_unemployment_sub:0 "Extend Unemployment Subsidies"
HOL_extend_unemployment_sub_desc:0 "Owing to Black Monday, more people are unemployed than ever before. While the conservative and especially the liberal governments of the last decades have implemented basic unemployment subsidies, they were afraid to discourage working if they made the rates too high; couple that with inflation and everyone living of these subsidies is impossible."
HOL_rijksweg_12:0 "Finish Rijksweg 12"
HOL_rijksweg_12_desc:0 "During the German golden age under Tirpitz, plans for building a highway connecting The Hague with the German border were already considered, though it ended up only reaching as far as Oudenrijn. Extending the Rijksweg to the German border would serve as a powerful symbol of our government's commitment to other national infrastructure projects."
HOL_trade_missions:0 "Trade Missions"
HOL_trade_missions_desc:0 "Trade missions seeking to reach agreement with foreign governments and companies are a great way to expand the reach of Dutch business and potentially alleviate the current economic downturn."
HOL_loan_to_shell:0 "Loan to Shell"
HOL_loan_to_shell_desc:0 "Royal Dutch Shell has been through a series of rough years during the 1920s. While other Dutch companies prospered, Shell suffered the catastrophic loss of their British holdings in the Revolution of 1925, a situation only alleviated by our accession to the German economic sphere of the Reichspakt. We can give them a loan that will surely turn into an investment beneficial for both parties."
HOL_cut_unemployment_subsidies:0 "Cut Employment Benefits"
HOL_cut_unemployment_subsidies_desc:0 "More and more people are sacked from their workplace, and the treasury is increasingly stretched by their demand for subsidies and benefits. If we are not to end up with a monstrous debt at the end of this, we must cut down the money available."
HOL_country_of_canals:0 "A Country of Canals"
HOL_country_of_canals_desc:0 "By building canals all over the Netherlands we will keep our unemployed populace working while rejuvenated businesses will profit from the canals and the infrastructure it brings in the future."
HOL_factory_building:0 "Factory Building"
HOL_factory_building_desc:0 "By building more factories the nation will be able to increase its domestic military production. While we are a transit country it can never hurt to invest in other sectors as well."
HOL_rhine_line:0 "The Rhine Line"
HOL_rhine_line_desc:0 "Ever since the inception of the Communard regime in France the godless syndicalists have been plotting our destruction and that of our German neighbour. The Rhine is a significant obstacle to this end and if we were to strengthen it with forts, provided God blesses us, there will be no foreign syndicalist setting foot on Dutch soil north of the Rhine."
HOL_limited_working_week_2:0 "Limited Working Week"
HOL_limited_working_week_2_desc:0 "The minimum working week is too long, and as a result employers cannot afford to hire as many as they otherwise could. By shortening the working week, employers will be forced to hire more people, thus allowing more people to earn a living."
hol_finish_afsluitdijk:0 "Improve the Afsluitdijk"
hol_finish_afsluitdijk_desc:0 "The Afsluitdijk was finished in the early thirties and closes off the Zuiderzee, turning the Ijsselmeer into an inland bay. The risk of the dike breaking could have disastrous effects however, so investing in securing its structural integrity could hardly hurt. Furthermore it would also deliver much-needed work for unemployed people."
HOL_west_indies_as_tradepost:0 "West Indies Trade Hub"
HOL_west_indies_as_tradepost_desc:0 "The West Indies are ideally situated to be a trading post for trade with the western hemisphere. The America's, far away from Germany's sphere of influence, can also provide a chance to diversify our exports, which is currently overly focussed on the Kaiserreich."
HOL_loan_to_SBM:0 "Loan to SBM"
HOL_loan_to_SBM_desc:0 "The Surinaamse Bauxiet Maatschappij is a mining company in Dutch Guyana. By giving them a loan they will be able to expand their activities on the South American continent and hopefully deliver us more military-critical resources than ever before."
HOL_kill_workplace_regulations:0 "Cut Employers' Red Tape"
HOL_kill_workplace_regulations_desc:0 "One of the factors that pushes Dutch industry behind foreign competition is our raft of highly sophisticated yet burdensome safety regulation. It's sad, but we cannot afford such things in these times of crisis."
HOL_park_in_every_town:0 "A Park For Every Town"
HOL_park_in_every_town_desc:0 "Another manner to keep our unemployed busy is by building a lot of parks. Generations yet unborn will be able to come to their senses in these tranquil sites, that will have been built in these hard times."
HOL_draft_able_unemployed:0 "Draft the Able-Bodied"
HOL_draft_able_unemployed_desc:0 "Many so-called unemployed claim they cannot find work to do; at the same time, we cannot find people to defend the fatherland. This paradoxical situation will end now. If you want to receive money from the state then you'll have to do something for it if you can, even if it will mean that our soldiers will be slightly less motivated."
HOL_finish_fortress_holland:0 "The Grebbeline"
HOL_finish_fortress_holland_desc:0 "We cannot just trust that the Germans will block dirty syndicalists from crossing their part of the Rhine. By building fortifications in the Grebbe area we can, even in such a dire case as total German collapse, defend the cultural-economic heart of Holland."
HOL_privatization_of_projects:0 "Privatisation of Projects"
HOL_privatization_of_projects_desc:0 "Our investments have borne fruit: companies are expressing their interest in taking over some of our national projects in hopes of making a profit off of them. In order to do this, they will need to hire people, who will in turn spend more money. While we have not fully recovered from Black Monday yet, this will surely be the beginning of the end of our nation's suffering."
HOL_precrisis_export_rates:0 "Return to Pre-Crisis Export Rates"
HOL_precrisis_export_rates_desc:0 "Our efforts to make Dutch companies as lucrative as possible have borne fruit: export rates are returning to pre-crisis levels, and in some sectors even exceed these levels. In order to handle the workload, companies are forced to hire more people, resulting in more spending power for the common man. While this may not amount to full recovery yet, it is possible to see a bright horizon ahead of us."
HOL_less_unemployment:0 "Unemployment Reduced"
HOL_less_unemployment_desc:0 "Our werkverschaffing-programme has borne fruit: day after day, less people come to stamp as proof that they are in fact unemployed and not claiming their subsidies as free extra money on top of their regular salary. It seems we succeeded, and while we have not fully recovered yet from Black Monday, the worst of the crisis' effects seem to have abated."
HOL_more_spending_power:0 "More Purchasing Power"
HOL_more_spending_power_desc:0 "Our large investments in the military is resulting in people finding work across a number of sectors, ranging from the production of weapons to serving in the army themselves. As a result they have money to spend, which is now slowly kickstarting the recovery of other sectors as well. While we have not fully recovered from Black Monday yet, we are certain that this is the beginning of the end of the suffering."
HOL_recovery_from_black_monday:0 "Recovery from Black Monday"
HOL_recovery_from_black_monday_desc:0 "Our sound strategy to fight the economic collapse that ensued after Black Monday has resulted in the stabilisation of our economy. In all sectors, more people are employed, more products are sold and increasing liquidity is floating around. It seems we succeeded in guiding the country through a hard time, and people are confident in the future once again."
HOL_repay_government_debts:0 "Repay Government Debts"
HOL_repay_government_debts_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact of life that money does not grow on trees, and the government has been forced to issue a number of bonds and requested loans from foreign investors in order to fill the void. It is imperative that we pay these debts off sooner rather than later."
HOL_control_inflation:0 "Control Inflation"
HOL_control_inflation_desc:0 "With inflation still uncomfortably high as a result of Black Monday we must enact deflationary measures to get it under control, for example by demanding that bank reserve rates be increased so that they are forced to hold onto more capital. Such actions will help stop our freshly rescued economy from overheating."
HOL_restore_regulation:0 "Restore Pre-Crisis Regulations"
HOL_restore_regulation_desc:0 "The somewhat brutal policies of the Black Monday years have served their purpose well, incentivising business and getting government spending. All the same, it is vital that we restore our nation's lost confidence by restoring some of their long-deserved privileges."
HOL_startup_tax_cuts:0 "Startup Tax Breaks"
HOL_startup_tax_cuts_desc:0 "Small and medium sized businesses, or 'SMEs' are the bedrock upon which Holland's greatness rests. With many of them being unable to survive the recent tumult in our economy there is a void to fill, and if we are to inspire entrepreneurial spirit we must offer tax incentives to these small firms."
HOL_big_corp_tax_cuts:0 "Side with Big Business"
HOL_big_corp_tax_cuts_desc:0 "It goes without saying that our large corporations are vital to our future economic success. Only economies of scale will allow us to prosper as a nation, and as such we should consider offering a variety of tax breaks and state subsidies to a number of our leading corporations."
HOL_eastern_industrialization:0 "Eastern Industrialisation"
HOL_eastern_industrialization_desc:0 "Imports from Germany and the borderlands are the future. By investing in that region we shall be able to benefit from cross-border trade and encourage a number of new businesses to open."
HOL_northern_industrialization:0 "Northern Industrialisation"
HOL_northern_industrialization_desc:0 "We have already established funds to help businesses in the north of the country. All that remains for us to do now is to open it up to applications"
HOL_dutch_arms_industry:0 "Consolidate the Arms Industry"
HOL_dutch_arms_industry_desc:0 "Our recent efforts to incentivise small businesses are already paying off, particularly in the domestic sphere. All the same, it is vital now that we encourage a number of small military firms to come together to enable them to make a meaningful contribution to our military sector."
HOL_subs_philips:0 "Subsidise Philips"
HOL_subs_philips_desc:0 "Philips is one of our most famous corporations, and a global player in the electronics market. By subsidising their developments and research, and engaging in joint ventures with them we can harness them for our own state uses."
HOL_subs_spyker:0 "Investments in Spyker"
HOL_subs_spyker_desc:0 "Though Spyker has had its ups and downs, its military value makes it a key player in our country. By investing in a majority shareholding in the firm we would be able to take advantage of its automotive prowess to develop mechanised technology."
HOL_subs_fokker:0 "Fokker Loans"
HOL_subs_fokker_desc:0 "The infamous Fokker company was responsible for a great deal of Central Powers war materiél during the Weltkrieg, and as such we should not overlook its importance as a potential driver for improving our own air force in the near-future."
HOL_guns_for_mitteleuropa:0 "Guns for the Reichspakt"
HOL_guns_for_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "As we are considered a relatively impartial third party, we find ourselves in the useful position of being able to sell weapons to whomever we desire. The Kaiserreich is the leading hegemon of continental Europe, and it needs guns. We can oblige them."
HOL_guns_for_entente:0 "Guns for the Entente"
HOL_guns_for_entente_desc:0 "Though perhaps we do not share the Entente's proclivity for mindless violence and short-sighted decision making, we do share their love of arms - so long as it involves them paying us of course."
HOL_buy_unsold_civ_planes:0 "Purchase Unsold Civilian Planes"
HOL_buy_unsold_civ_planes_desc:0 "Not every product that gets developed is a best seller, unfortunately. At the very least it gives us the opportunity to have access to some planes at a very low price."
HOL_fokker_fiscal_deal:0 "Fokker Fiscal Deal"
HOL_fokker_fiscal_deal_desc:0 "By investing further capital into Fokker we can enable them to increase their military production output, itself having a wider effect on the nearby arms industry."
HOL_new_RnD:0 "New RnD Facilities"
HOL_new_RnD_desc:0 "The wars of the future will be won by a combination of laboratory nerds and government oversight. With both, we might just have a chance at boosting our research capabilities."
HOL_booming_economy:0 "Economic Boom"
HOL_booming_economy_desc:0 "With just the right amount of interference and hands-off approach, our economy has become less a shadow of its former self, than an outright phoenix. Holland is standing strong, and our nation is booming."
HOL_SDAP_question:0 "The SDAP Question"
HOL_SDAP_question_desc:0 "With the Netherlands entering a new socio-political order, the time has come to consider whether to allow the somewhat centrist SDAP to stand for election to the assembly that will decide the nation's future. It may be a Trojan Horse for reactionaries."
HOL_elect_assembly:0 "Elect a New Assembly"
HOL_elect_assembly_desc:0 "We must choose who to elect to our new legislative body in order to establish a new constitutional framework for Holland."
HOL_third_national_assembly:0 "The Third National Assembly"
HOL_third_national_assembly_desc:0 "The time has come. The Assembly will decide on who fills each post within the new executive Volksraad, allowing all left-wing parties to have a say in this new political order."
HOL_one_raadspensionaris:0 "One Raadspensionaris!"
HOL_one_raadspensionaris_desc:0 "Unexpectedly, the majority of the Assembly appears to have come to one simple conclusion. There should only be a single 'Grand Pensionary', David Wijnkoop, who shall guard the revolution against reactionaries and imperialists without a shred of mercy."
HOL_council_of_the_state:0 "Council of the State"
HOL_council_of_the_state_desc:0 "The Council-Communists under Anton Pannekoek and his KAPN have taken a majority in the new Assembly, becoming the leading constituents of the Volksraad executive body. Known for their opposition to formal decision-making bodies, this has come as quite a shock."
HOL_vakbondsfederatie:0 "Vakbondsfederatie"
HOL_vakbondsfederatie_desc:0 "The Assembly's majority choice appeared to be the syndicalist NAS party under Harm Kolthek, who has called for Communard-style rule under a 'federation of trade unions'. The most 'orthodox' of the serious leftist groups in the state, the NAS was a clear compromise between all involved."
HOL_socialist_republic:0 "Socialist Republic"
HOL_socialist_republic_desc:0 "Henk Sneevliet's radical socialist RSAP party has been elected with a majority by the Assembly as the new government. A new socialist republic is likely to be formed, with less of the overt posturing of the hard-left syndicalists and reactionary-style backsliding of the SDAP."
HOL_social_democracy:0 "Social Democracy"
HOL_social_democracy_desc:0 "Shocking many of those present in the Assembly, it appears that the Volksraad elected was indeed that of the moderate SDAP under Willem Albard. It appears that, for the other more militant factions of the revolution, allowing the SDAP to take part in the elections proved to be a serious mistake."
HOL_peoples_military:0 "The People's Army"
HOL_peoples_military_desc:0 "The revolution did not transpire just so it could be derailed by vested interests and imperialists within our own armed forces. Serious reforms must be undertaken if we are to purge it of dangerous malefactors and preserve the Commune."
HOL_union_of_the_military:0 "Union of the Military"
HOL_union_of_the_military_desc:0 "While it is perhaps not ideal that much of our armed forces remain unrepentant capitalists and reactionaries, we must work with what we have. Dutchmen, both left and right, must work together for the good of our country."
HOL_dutch_militia:0 "Dutch Militias"
HOL_dutch_militia_desc:0 "The way forward for our armed forces is the recruitment of People's Militias to help us safeguard the revolution and prevent foreign forces from crushing us before we have managed to find our feet."
HOL_reform_army:0 "Army Reform"
HOL_reform_army_desc:0 "With the new order secured in both the Assembly and the Volksraad, we must turn our gaze to the armed forces. Recent political turbulence has left them poorly trained and understaffed. We must rectify this immediately."
HOL_ban_reactionary_thought:0 "Suppress Reactionary Ideas"
HOL_ban_reactionary_thought_desc:0 "The revolution is far from assured. At every turn there is another threat that must be systematically eliminated in order to preserve what we have so far accomplished. It begins with the most obvious dangers, including peoples of German descent."
HOL_ban_capitalist_thought:0 "Ban Capitalist Thoughts!"
HOL_ban_capitalist_thought_desc:0 "While we have taken care of more obvious threats to the revolution, there exists a lower level, more imperceptible danger to the nation. While small, even simple thoughts and whispers about markets and democracy risk subverting our people's movement."
HOL_labour_camps:0 "Labour Camps"
HOL_labour_camps_desc:0 "Our political and ideological foes can learn peace through labour, by soldiering for the revolution in the mines and in the camps. There, disarmed, they can pose little threat to us and can reflect on their flawed beliefs and acts."
HOL_democratic_workplace:0 "Democratic Workplaces"
HOL_democratic_workplace_desc:0 "All workers must have a say in the company for which they slave. No longer shall employers and reactionaries oppress those that toil for them - without representation at least."
HOL_mass_collectivisation:0 "Mass Collectivisation"
HOL_mass_collectivisation_desc:0 "A key part of our economic doctrine is the collectivisation of agriculture and industry, lumping smaller entities under a larger and more efficient centre."
HOL_verzorgingsstaat:0 "Verzorgingsstaat"
HOL_verzorgingsstaat_desc:0 "The least we owe our people is a well-managed and properly functioning Welfare State, one that is palatable to both socialists and conservatives alike."
HOL_union_liberty_constitution:0 "Union Liberty Constitution"
HOL_union_liberty_constitution_desc:0 "Formalising the new political order of our nation with a formal constitution would alleviate the concerns of many, more conservative Dutchmen as well as legitimise our executive in its new role."
HOL_market_socialism:0 "Market Syndicalism"
HOL_market_socialism_desc:0 "Just because there is a new leftist order in Holland doesn't mean that we should cast aside all of our old trappings. After all, the markets incentivise workers in many fields, including construction."
HOL_block_german_trade:0 "Embargo German Trade"
HOL_block_german_trade_desc:0 "For too long the bastion of imperialism to our east has posed an existential threat to all that is good and righteous in this world. Germany's efforts to smother the working class wherever it exists mean continuing trade with would be absurd."
HOL_tolerate_german_trade:0 "Tolerate German Trade"
HOL_tolerate_german_trade_desc:0 "For many the idea of accepting the new reality of socialist rule meant sending our nation on a collision cause with the behemoth that is the Kaiserreich. The government however, has decided that continued relations with Germany only serve to benefit our nation."
HOL_join_international:0 "Join the Internationale"
HOL_join_international_desc:0 "If we are to do our part in the struggle against reactionaries, monarchism and the tyranny of imperialism, we must join the wider Internationale in their standoff against enemies no matter where they are found."
HOL_european_centroamerica:0 "Batavian Neutrality"
HOL_european_centroamerica_desc:0 "There are some in our government advocating conflict against capitalists and imperialists, but many more now propose in secret a new policy - nicknamed simply 'Batavian Neutrality'. This entails merely continuing our prior neutrality with a new socialist gloss."
HOL_finish_national_assembly:0 "Finish the National Assembly"
HOL_finish_national_assembly_desc:0 "With a number of substantial reforms instigated and proposals outlined, the Assembly now appears to be drawing to a relative close, its primary purpose served. It has been invaluable in drawing our new socio-political system together and so its legacy will live on."
HOL_reijnders_putsch:0 "Reijnders' Putsch"
HOL_reijnders_putsch_desc:0 "In an absolutely shocking turn of events, the head of the Dutch army, Izaak Reijnders launched a military coup d'état in Amsterdam, stating that the nation was in danger of falling to dangerous syndicalist subversives. Holland's destiny is, for now, uncertain."
HOL_VNH_victory:0 "VNH Electoral Victory"
HOL_VNH_victory_desc:0 "The VNH have won an astounding victory in the recent elections, supplanting the conservative CNA and plunging the nation into uncertainty. What the new government will do is, as of yet, uncertain."
HOL_CNA_gamble_worked:0 "CNA's Gamble Pays Off"
HOL_CNA_gamble_worked_desc:0 "The ruling CNA has managed to score yet another electoral victory, continuing its unopposed rule of the nation. All the same, its majority has shrunk and it may have to find a coalition partner to continue with the authority and mandate it once had. Still, the status quo remains - for now."
HOL_junta_consolidation:0 "Consolidate the Junta"
HOL_junta_consolidation_desc:0 "With the putsch having been a complete success, it is now incumbent on the powers that be to formalise their rule. By consolidating the members of the new provisional military junta in charge of the Netherlands, some much needed stability will be granted to a weary nation."
HOL_intimidate_parliament:0 "Intimidate Parliament"
HOL_intimidate_parliament_desc:0 "The new status quo cannot be guaranteed without Parliament being bullied into handing over emergency powers. Such measures might be unpleasant, but they are necessary to stave off syndicalist revolt."
HOL_alliance_of_the_right:0 "Alliance of the Right"
HOL_alliance_of_the_right_desc:0 "Holland's problems cannot be solved by one party alone. There must be unity in purpose between nationalists and conservatives if this nation is to be saved from the dangers of radical thinking."
HOL_CNA_on_its_own:0 "CNA Rules Alone"
HOL_CNA_on_its_own_desc:0 "We do not need any other. Holland has only one guiding hand, and it will continue to preserve society until its dying breath, God willing."
HOL_work_with_LSP:0 "Work With the LSP"
HOL_work_with_LSP_desc:0 "If we have to work with others, then we could do no worse than the market liberal LSP. While our beliefs are primarily social, theirs tend to stress economic concerns. It is a compromise that does not pose too many problems, at least in comparison to our other 'choices'."
HOL_martial_law_in_europe:0 "Declare Martial Law"
HOL_martial_law_in_europe_desc:0 "If we are to safeguard the new regime then it is imperative that we begin crackdowns immediately, and demonstrate our resolve to solve the nation's political crisis. By declaring martial law in Europe we will be able to make clear our determination to save Holland from itself."
HOL_rebuild_binnenhof:0 "Rebuild the Binnenhof"
HOL_rebuild_binnenhof_desc:0 "The Binnenhof is a near-sacred institution in the Netherlands, and the arson that destroyed it to many represents a clear symbol of the decay of our state and its slide into political madness. By rebuilding it we might send a widespread signal of what we hope to achieve for the future."
HOL_red_scare:0 "The Red Scare"
HOL_red_scare_desc:0 "The threat that the forces of socialism and treacherous syndicalism poses to our way of life cannot be underestimated. It is time that we begin making this clear to the people, if they have not already grasped a fact as basic and immutable as gravity itself."
HOL_amend_ambtenarenverbod:0 "Amend the Ambtenarenverbod"
HOL_amend_ambtenarenverbod_desc:0 "The civil service ban has proven to be insufficient for protecting our fragile political system from subversion. By amending the legislation behind it to weigh it further in our favour, we can weaken the grasp of leftist groups over the apparatus of state."
HOL_influence_legal_system:0 "Subvert the Legal System"
HOL_influence_legal_system_desc:0 "Dangerous times call for desperate measures. Though it pains the conservative element in our government dearly, it is vital that government influence over the nation's legal system and judiciary be extended to allow us to tackle the threats facing us."
HOL_dissolve_landwacht_RNF:0 "Dissolve the Landwacht"
HOL_dissolve_landwacht_RNF_desc:0 "The Landwacht are aligned with VNH nationalist interests against the state, and so they must be put down - by force if necessary. The only paramilitaries that can be allowed to operate in Holland are our own."
HOL_syndie_crackdown:0 "Syndicalist Crackdown"
HOL_syndie_crackdown_desc:0 "Our nation has allowed those that seek to do it harm to wander its streets unmolested for years. This sad state of affairs must end if we are to preserve the independence of Holland in the face of despicable Red forces arrayed against us in the south and west."
HOL_break_up_soc_pillar:0 "Break up the Socialist Pillar"
HOL_break_up_soc_pillar_desc:0 "While the Socialist pillar has until now been a mostly tolerable focal point for more legitimate and less violent dissent against conservative rule of Holland, it poses a threat that goes far beyond the sum of its parts. The institutions such as the trade unions could hide syndicalist sympathisers, and this is intolerable."
HOL_anthem_in_schools:0 "Compulsory Anthem in Schools"
HOL_anthem_in_schools_desc:0 "As part of a wider systematic policy to encourage nationalist fervour in the country in the face of leftist opposition, a proposal has been put forward of some interest; ensure that the national anthem, the Het Wilhelmus, is compulsory in school classrooms."
HOL_new_flag_protocol:0 "New Flag Protocol"
HOL_new_flag_protocol_desc:0 "One simple manner by which we can rekindle the spark of Dutch pride in our countrymen is to codify a new flag protocol. New rules governing how to treat the national flag, including its waving, its treatment and criminal penalties for mistreatment, would all be cheap yet popular."
HOL_nationalist_renaissance:0 "Nationalist Renaissance"
HOL_nationalist_renaissance_desc:0 "It doesn't take much to make a Dutchman love their country, it is an easy land to love after all. All the same, it is impressive how fast a few simple policies have managed to unite vast numbers of people around our country's political future."
HOL_queens_speech:0 "The Queen's Speech"
HOL_queens_speech_desc:0 "While Her Majesty has mostly sought to stay clear of politics in recent months, befitting her position and royal dignity, it has increasingly become clear that the new regime is here to stay and as such it appears that she may soon publicly announce her tacit support for it, at least for the moment."
HOL_secret_police:0 "Establish Secret Police"
HOL_secret_police_desc:0 "The current state security apparatus is insufficient for our needs, that much is clear. By establishing an entirely new branch of the police, linked with intelligence and military divisions, we can help preserve Holland's stability."
HOL_papua_camps:0 "Papua Camps"
HOL_papua_camps_desc:0 "By establishing new prison camps on distant Papua in our East Indies colonies, we shall have a place to which we can banish all syndicalists that pose a threat to the nation. Nobody would foolish enough to try to escape on an island filled with cannibals and man-eating creatures, after all."
HOL_landwacht_as_citizen_guard:0 "Attempt to Legitimise the Landwacht"
HOL_landwacht_as_citizen_guard_desc:0 "The Landwacht has an image problem, that much is obvious. However, if we attempt to portray them as citizen guards and drill that message into the populace enough, it may just be enough to cover up their glaring flaws. Actually correcting them as an organisation will have to come later."
HOL_outlaw_unions:0 "Outlaw Trade Unions"
HOL_outlaw_unions_desc:0 "The trade unions, those bastions of syndicalist ideology, pose an existential threat to our nation. By bringing in legislation that challenges the power of the trade unions enough to essentially consign them to history, we can end their despicable influence."
HOL_spreading_the_revolution:0 "Spreading the Revolution"
HOL_spreading_the_revolution_desc:0 "As a syndicalist nation in Europe it is vital that we play our part in the struggle for the working class. To do otherwise would be a gross dereliction of our duty."
HOL_idea_south_africa_in_exile:0 "South African Government in Exile"
HOL_idea_south_africa_in_exile_desc:0 "This country hosts a Boer government in exile in The Hague, where it claims to be the legitimate government of South Africa."
HOL_idea_convention_host:0 "International Convention Host"
HOL_idea_convention_host_desc:0 "This country is renowned for hosting multiple international conventions, making it harder for potential invaders to justify their attack."
HOL_batavian_committee_of_science:0 "Batavian Committee of Science"
HOL_batavian_committee_of_science_desc:0 "By nationalising the assets of research companies and placing them under the oversight of one committee by, for and with the people, we will be able to conduct research far more efficiently."
HOL_dutch_researching:0 "Dutch Research Institute"
HOL_dutch_researching_desc:0 "With Flanders in friendly hands, we can combine our research and share it faster with local scientists using the Dutch language. This will be a great boon to our research capabilities."
HOL_royalist_sentiment_transferred:0 "Exploit Royalist Sentiment"
HOL_royalist_sentiment_transferred_desc:0 "With the Queen's backing, our junta has been given the modicum of legitimacy that it needed to bring a number of undecided moderates over to our way of thinking. Now increasingly viewed as the saviours of a troubled nation, our position is becoming far safer."
HOL_order_of_orange_nassau:0 "The Order of Oranje Nassau"
HOL_order_of_orange_nassau_desc:0 "The chivalric Order of Orange-Nassau exists to reward those that give their all to the Dutch people, either on the battlefield or in the civilian sphere. With the support of the monarchy, we can begin to use the order for our own political and military ends."
HOL_permanent_stability:0 "Permanent Stability"
HOL_permanent_stability_desc:0 "It has become clear to all that there is no way that the people can be left to their own devices. Inevitably populist figures on the left and right will rise to hijack their passions and fears, plunging the nation into chaos. There is only one rational path forwards - an end to elections."
HOL_restore_democracy:0 "Restore Democracy"
HOL_restore_democracy_desc:0 "The dangers of syndicalism and populism have been averted. There is no more need for a correctionary junta and the time has come to restore democratic rule to the Netherlands."
HOL_VNH_crackdown:0 "VNH Crackdown"
HOL_VNH_crackdown_desc:0 "While the Landwacht has been suppressed, its insidious paymasters in the VNH still remain active in the country. It is not only leftist groups that pose a threat to our country, but nationalist groups too."
HOL_zonderlinge_zaterdag:0 "Zonderlinge Zaterdag"
HOL_zonderlinge_zaterdag_desc:0 "VNH's reforms have been effective so far, and the country is recovering to some extent, both politically and economically. All the same, the events of 'Strange Saturday' might put an end to all previous notions of stability."
HOL_staatsvakbond:0 "Staatsvakbond"
HOL_staatsvakbond_desc:0 "The Dutch people have a newfound sense of pride, however with the loss of traditional pillars and outlets such as the unions, their anger and zeal might be directed our way. By instituting new state-led trade unions, we can diffuse and disarm these feelings, and potentially redirect them towards our enemies."
HOL_van_geelkerkens_arrest:0 "Van Geelkerken's Arrest"
HOL_van_geelkerkens_arrest_desc:0 "With the failure of Van Geelkerken in his attempt to force the retirement of Swart, it is important that we seek to make as much political capital out of this as possible. By crushing a hardline coup, our own moderate credentials have been burnished and our popularity has reached new heights."
HOL_swarts_retirement:0 "Swart's Retirement"
HOL_swarts_retirement_desc:0 "Van Geelerkerken has successfully deposed Swart from office and instigated a far more extremist brand of ideology upon the Netherlands. Surprisingly, this breath of fresh air appears to have gone down surprisingly well, particularly alongside convenient leaks of the secrets of various disgraced VNH loyalists."
HOL_reform_landwacht:0 "Reform the Landwacht"
HOL_reform_landwacht_desc:0 "The Landwacht has been incredibly effective in securing and defending our government. Unfortunately it has a number of unsavoury elements within it that have cast a poor light on the rest of the paramilitary force as well as our own government. Things must change."
HOL_landwacht_part_of_army:0 "Incorporate Landwacht into the Army"
HOL_landwacht_part_of_army_desc:0 "For too long the rightful spoils of governing have been to left to weaker men within the VNH and the army. If things are to change we must set about assimilating our loyal Landwacht fighters into the regular army at every level. We must entrench our control over lesser fools."
HOL_new_era:0 "The Dutch Stratocracy"
HOL_new_era_desc:0 "We have saved the Netherlands from the abyss, and for that we should feel nothing but total elation. Unfortunately, peace is fleeting, and as such as we must set about linking government control with that of the military. Together, military and state will preserve the nation's greatness."
HOL_dutch_apartheid:0 "Voor Leider en Vaderland!"
HOL_dutch_apartheid_desc:0 "The cry goes out, 'for leader and fatherland!'. It booms from the rafters of the highest Amsterdam tower to the base of its lowest canal. Our new order is finally ready, and we are on the march. Voor Leider. Voor Vaderland."
HOL_tighten_ambtenarenverbod:0 "Tighten the Ambtenarenverbod"
HOL_tighten_ambtenarenverbod_desc:0 "The civil service ban has been insufficient in its goal of stemming the tide of extremist influence within our government and administration. We must legislate to make it more effective at snuffing out dangerous ideologies."
HOL_entrench_pillarization:0 "Entrench Pillarisation"
HOL_entrench_pillarization_desc:0 "The pillars are the foundation upon which Dutch society stands. Without them there can be no stability. At every opportunity we must embrace and bolster our cultural and democratic institutions."
HOL_ban_paramilitaries:0 "Ban Paramilitary Groups"
HOL_ban_paramilitaries_desc:0 "On both the left and right paramilitaries such as the Red Front and Landwacht have caused us disconcerting amounts of problems. This will end. Now."
HOL_gov_support_for_pillars:0 "Support the Pillars"
HOL_gov_support_for_pillars_desc:0 "We have begun implementing substantive acts and proposals intended to bolster the traditional pillars of Dutch society, for example through incentivising church attendance and encouraging Dutch footballers to travel for games overseas to the adulation of radio listeners."
HOL_paramilitary_crackdown:0 "Suppress the Paramilitaries"
HOL_paramilitary_crackdown_desc:0 "While we have implemented law banning paramilitary organisations, the time has come to truly enforce them. By cracking down hard on these undemocratic groups, we will strike a blow that will send the radicals scurrying back to their foreign paymasters. The security of the Netherlands depends on it."
HOL_pillar_crumbling_stopped:0 "The Pillars Preserved"
HOL_pillar_crumbling_stopped_desc:0 "Our efforts to inspire confidence in the traditional pillars have not gone unnoticed, and increasingly members of the public are coming to recognise the righteousness of our intervention in otherwise off-limit cultural and social affairs. Our actions are paying off."
HOL_dissolution_of_NAS:0 "NAS Dissolution"
HOL_dissolution_of_NAS_desc:0 "Outlawing the primary syndicalist party in the Netherlands is critical if our efforts are to have any chance of succeeding. Inspired by Communard French demagogues, this movement is a menace to all Dutch society."
HOL_ban_RSAP:0 "Outlaw the RSAP"
HOL_ban_RSAP_desc:0 "While the radical socialists are not quite as dangerous as other, more extreme left-wing groups, they are a danger to society. Their programmes and manifesto are persuasive to a number of lower class workers and intellectuals, making them a key target."
HOL_ban_patriotten:0 "Ban the Patriotten"
HOL_ban_patriotten_desc:0 "The Patriotten are a virulent disease, the likes of which the Netherlands hasn't seen for many years. It is so hard-left that it poses as much as threat to other syndicalist ideologies as our own. Self-destructive impulses aside, we must suppress such groups."
HOL_ban_VNH:0 "Ban the VNH"
HOL_ban_VNH_desc:0 "With the left pushed underground, it becomes increasingly important that we crush the far-right threat in this country once and for all. The VNH's more extreme elements turn an otherwise palatable group into a potential danger to the nation, and as such they must be brought down by law."
HOL_razzia_for_undergrounds:0 "Launch Underground Raids"
HOL_razzia_for_undergrounds_desc:0 "With many extremist groups forced underground, that leaves them with only one remaining place for us to target. We will launch a major police operation and bring down the remnants of these hateful groups, no matter the cost."
HOL_stable_once_again:0 "Stable Once More!"
HOL_stable_once_again_desc:0 "It has been a hard road, but with our serious ideological opposition now consigned to prison cells, foreign shores or an early grave, perhaps now the Netherlands might be able to rest easy."
HOL_negotiate_with_the_left:0 "Negotiate with the Left"
HOL_negotiate_with_the_left_desc:0 "If we are to ensure that politics in the Netherlands remains relatively unbesmirched by extremism, it is important that we consider negotiating with some of the more moderate elements of the left to ensure stability."
HOL_limit_working_week:0 "Limited Welfare"
HOL_limit_working_week_desc:0 "A number of limited welfare reforms and incentives might just be enough to get the leftist groups on side. The question is whether or not they are acceptable to all involved."
HOL_limit_RNF:0 "Restrict the Red Front"
HOL_limit_RNF_desc:0 "The left-wing Red Front paramilitaries pose a serious threat to civil order in our nation. We must demand some level of action be taken on them."
HOL_limited_minimum_wage:0 "De-Facto Recognition of Syndicalists"
HOL_limited_minimum_wage_desc:0 "A number of leftists regularly demand that we recognise syndicalist regimes such as that of the Commune of France. While de-jure recognition is definitely unpalatable to many rightist groups, if not totally out of the question, perhaps token recognition could be proposed."
HOL_limit_NAS:0 "Limit the NAS"
HOL_limit_NAS_desc:0 "It is vital that we demand that at least some measures be taken against the NAS, a union of orthodox syndicalists that have the most moral legitimacy of most hard-left groups in the country. The question is, how far should we go in our demands?"
HOL_protection_against_np:0 "Protection from the Landwacht"
HOL_protection_against_np_desc:0 "The Landwacht are a distinctly nationalist group of paramilitaries that regularly cause serious harm to left-wing activists and street marchers. No doubt the negotiations will centre on us assisting the leftists against them in some manner."
HOL_limit_socialist_parties:0 "Minimise Socialist Influence"
HOL_limit_socialist_parties_desc:0 "One area that is critical for us is to limit the power of the radical socialist RSAP, the only hard-left group with parliamentary representation. They have a been a major thorn in our side, and so the negotiations would be a good chance of removing them."
HOL_negotiations_succeeded:0 "Negotiations Succeeded!"
HOL_negotiations_succeeded_desc:0 "Our willingness to concede on a few points, and the surprising willingness of our political rivals to come to terms, means that the negotiations have proven to be a relative success for all involved."
HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_right:0 "Cordon Sanitaire Against the Right"
HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_right_desc:0 "With the power of the leftists limited to a reasonable extent by our negotiations, it is time for us to unite against the forces of far-right extremism within the Netherlands."
HOL_democratic_survival:0 "Dutch Democracy is Saved!"
HOL_democratic_survival_desc:0 "After months of brutal negotiations it appears that some level of stability is finally returning to Dutch politics."
HOL_negotiate_with_the_right:0 "Negotiate with the Right"
HOL_negotiate_with_the_right_desc:0 "Though it might not be an ideal situation, we would be best placed to negotiate with less extremist elements of the nationalist VNH movement in order to bring some measure of peace to Dutch politics."
HOL_limit_landwacht:0 "Limit Landwacht Activities"
HOL_limit_landwacht_desc:0 "A key part of the deal rests on the Landwacht, the right-wing VNH paramilitary group responsible for breaking leftist skulls in recent street marches. While we could demand that they be dissolved, pushing the point too hard might alienate even some relatively moderate VNH members."
HOL_limit_union_rights:0 "Curtail Union Rights"
HOL_limit_union_rights_desc:0 "If there is one thing that we can all agree on, it is that the threat posed by syndicalism and its trade union backers is existential. However, the VNH's demands that we seriously damage them might prove to be destabilising anathema to the Dutch working class."
HOL_limit_influence_military:0 "Reduce Military Influence"
HOL_limit_influence_military_desc:0 "A number of senior army figures are public members of the VNH, even if less politically noxious than others. All the same, we must make limiting the VNH's influence on our armed forces contingent on any deal we sign with them. We cannot allow the risk of a coup."
HOL_limited_tariffs:0 "Lower Tariffs"
HOL_limited_tariffs_desc:0 "The VNH has demanded that we lower economic tariffs on imported goods, somewhat contrary to their nationalist leanings. While doing so might gain their support, it may prove to be unpopular with the people once cheap goods flood onto the market undercutting local businesses."
HOL_limit_populist_parties:0 "Limit Populist Parties"
HOL_limit_populist_parties_desc:0 "One demand that we must make of the VNH is to consider their position on allowing constant party rallies. At these rallies a number of young Dutchmen are being radicalised by more extremist elements within the VNH."
HOL_limit_foreign_assets:0 "Nationalise German Assets"
HOL_limit_foreign_assets_desc:0 "Unbelievably, one of the VNH's demands is that we seize German property in the country. Though this might be incredibly dangerous, the VNH have made it a major demand, and as such we cannot simply ignore it."
HOL_r_negotiations_succeeded:0 "Negotiations Succeeded!"
HOL_r_negotiations_succeeded_desc:0 "It appears that the more moderate wing of the VNH were not so unreasonable after all. With their support in neutralising the threat from the far-right elements within the nationalist movement, we can now turn our attention to promoting peace throughout the Dutch political system."
HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_left:0 "Cordon Sanitaire Against the Left"
HOL_cordon_sanitaire_vs_left_desc:0 "It is all in place now. With support from moderate and right groups, we can stem the malign influence of radical left groups within our proud nation. It seems that finally the Netherlands will be stable once more."

## Army
HOL_dutch_army_focus:0 "The Dutch Army"
HOL_dutch_army_focus_desc:0 "The Netherlands does not need anyone to tell them about how to manage an effective military. All the same, with the fell winds of conflict on the horizon, it is important that we give greater thought to the long-term future of our army."
HOL_land_doctrine_defensive:0 "Focus on Defence"
HOL_land_doctrine_defensive_desc:0 "Our land is a brutal morass, a place of swamps, marshes and sturdy men. By playing to the Netherlands' strengths, we shall make our enemies bleed for every inch they take."
HOL_kai:0 "Expand the Artillerie Inrichtingen"
HOL_kai_desc:0 "The Koninklijke Artillerie Inrichtingen are vital for our army. We need to reopen production lines so we can start replacing our old equipment with modern materiel."
HOL_anti_tank_focus:0 "New Anti-Tank Guns"
HOL_anti_tank_focus_desc:0 "If we are to hold out against a superior foe, we need weapons capable of penetrating even the mightiest of Panzers. We must invest into anti-tank weaponry and its research."
HOL_artillery_focus:0 "Artillery Modernisation"
HOL_artillery_focus_desc:0 "Our defensive measures have no use if we have no big guns to back them up. And these guns from the 19th century we have now will make nice museum pieces."
HOL_korps_luchtafweer:0 "Anti Aircraft Guns"
HOL_korps_luchtafweer_desc:0 "We cannot hope to match the superpowers in terms of aerial capabilities. We must invest in a network of defensive gun emplacements and flak towers."
HOL_vesting_holland:0 "Reinforce the Vesting Holland"

HOL_study_defence_plans:0 "Study Defence Plans"
HOL_study_defence_plans_desc:0 "As a small coastal nation, we have always anticipated attack from the sea, but new threats on the global stage are forcing us to deal with potential land invasions as well. We need to make better plans for the defence of the Netherlands."

HOL_machine_guns_desc:0 "Our machineguns belong in a museum, and it is high time we acquire some new ones!"
HOL_land_doctrine_mobile:0 "A Mobile Army"
HOL_land_doctrine_mobile_desc:0 "Our flat land makes mechanised and armoured divisions a no-brainer. By investing further into this area and applying new military doctrine to our army, the Netherlands can become a force to be reckoned with."

HOL_gemotoriseerde_huzaren_desc:0 "While once horses were the vehicles of the cavalrymen of their day, we need new vehicles for a new breed of hussars to bring death to our enemies."
HOL_bicycle_army:0 "Bicycles For our Soldiers"
HOL_bicycle_army_desc:0 "We Dutch are famed for our bicycles. They grant the user a surprising level of mobility and have served our armies well for years. We need more. Many more."
HOL_pantserkorps:0 "Pantserkorps Formation"
HOL_pantserkorps_desc:0 "The people like to see that we are spending their taxpayers' money in new fields. By publicly demonstrating our resolve to form a new armoured force, we might just be able to win some kudos."
HOL_korps_pioniers:0 "Korps Pioniers"
HOL_korps_pioniers_desc:0 "The Pioneer Corps are the jewel in our military crown. All the same, we must invest further time and energy into them if we are to make the most advantage from their talents."
HOL_korps_verkenners:0 "Integrated Recon Battalions"
HOL_korps_verkenners_desc:0 "More important than being able to fight, is knowing where your enemy is before they detect you. By integrating recon companies into our divisions, we shall give our forces a crucial edge."
HOL_armoured_cars:0 "Pantrado M39 Armoured Cars"
HOL_armoured_cars_desc:0 "Armoured Cars are a cheap and efficient way of scouting the battlefield and providing cheap transport for our troops. We need to extend our research into the design and production of better models."

HOL_study_mobile_tactics:0 "Study Mobile Tactics"
HOL_study_mobile_tactics_desc:0 "We are now starting to get all this new and expensive machinery, but we have no experience actually using them! We should study the usage of mobile truck divisions and tanks otherwise it is all for nothing."
HOL_mech_infantry:0 "Braat Overvalwagen"
HOL_mech_infantry_desc:0 "Developed in the Dutch East Indies, the Braat Overvalwagen is a cheap to make armoured personel carrier. We can consider adopting this design for the mainland army as well."

HOL_prepare_the_inundation_lines_desc:0 "Ever since our independence war against the Spanish in the 16th century, inundation, or intentional flooding of the land, has been an integral part of our defenses. Properly prepared, it will surely save us again: we have yet to see a tank that can cross water."

## Navy
HOL_dutch_navy:0 "The Dutch Navy"
HOL_dutch_navy_desc:0 "As we move into an era beyond the Weltkrieg, we will need to decide how our navy develops. There are multiple plans on the table, we will have to evaluate each one and decide on the best."
HOL_vlootplan_furstner:0 "Vlootplan Furstner"
HOL_vlootplan_furstner_desc:0 "We must radically alter our navy's composition. It is being made increasingly clear that battleships are being made redudant by the ever improving potency of the airplane. We need to expand on our existing carrier and her capabilities, and if possible acquire more naval airpower!"
HOL_de_schelde:0 "Koninklijke de Schelde"
HOL_de_schelde_desc:0 "The area around Vlissingen is perfect for our new shipyard expansion. First built in 1875, it has traditionally focused on repair and resupply, but it's high time we made it into a large construction area as well."
HOL_dd_furstner:0 "Escort Destroyer"
HOL_dd_furstner_desc:0 "Our carrier and other capital ships are slow lumbering targets, and can easily be torpedoed if left unguarded. We need to ensure that our destroyers are up for that task."
HOL_claa_furstner:0 "Anti Aircraft Light Cruiser"
HOL_claa_furstner_desc:0 "We need ships to shoot enemy planes out of the skies to protect our fleet. A cruiser sized design is perfect for that. We can specialise our future cruiser designs to have less guns pointing at the sea, and more into the skies!"
HOL_carrier_tactics:0 "Carrier Tactics"
HOL_carrier_tactics_desc:0 "We have a carrier force, but never properly studied how to use them effectively. We should remedy this at once."
HOL_fleet_carrier:0 "The Gouden Leeuw"
HOL_fleet_carrier_desc:0 "The HrMs Gouden Leeuw is truly the pride of our navy. The lone carrier gives us a massive boost in our capabilities, but other navies have more and bigger carriers than her. We can press her to the limit and try to get more planes in the hangar, or we can attempt to get a new one!"

HOL_vlootplan_helfrich:0 "Vlootplan Helfrich"
HOL_vlootplan_helfrich_desc:0 "We simply do not possess the means to compete with Japan or any other major navy on the surface waters, hence Admiral Helfrich proposes that we outfit our navy with the ships we can also build best, submarines, and harass enemy merchantile shipping and troop transports while we protect our own!"
HOL_protect_merchant_marine:0 "Protect our Merchant Marine"
HOL_protect_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Our merchant marine is vital to the survival of the country. Without it, we are cut off from our colonies and maritime trade with the rest of the world. Being able to escort the vulnerable cargo ships is thus critical. In order to effectively protect the convoys, we need to think about suitable ships and tactics to deploy said ships effectively."
HOL_destroyer_escort_asw:0 "Anti Submarine Destroyer"
HOL_destroyer_escort_asw_desc:0 "By far the greatest danger to our merchant fleet is not via the air, nor the few odd commerce raiders about, but hiding under water untill it might be too late to act. We thus must outfit our destroyers with the latest Anti Submarine equipment to deal with this threat."
HOL_destroyer_escort_aa:0 "Anti Aircraft Destroyer"
HOL_destroyer_escort_aa_desc:0 ""
HOL_flotilla_leader:0 "Flotilla Leader"
HOL_flotilla_leader_desc:0 "Large ships are expensive, and we shall never be able to build enough for our needs. It thus has been proposed to build a new class of ship, the 'flotilla leader'. Either a small cruiser or a large destroyer in size and thus comparatively cheap, packed with enough firepower to destroy enemy fast surface raiders and dangers lurking under water."
HOL_civilian_convoys:0 "Requisition Civilian Cargo Ships!"

HOL_submarine_snorkel:0 "O Class Submarines"

HOL_submarine_colonial:0 "K Class colonial submarines"
HOL_submarine_colonial_desc:0 "Our empire stretches far, so our submarines need to reach far. We thus need replacement for our aging colonial submarines, and we need more of them!"
HOL_ship_a_day:0 "Ship a Day Tactics"
HOL_ship_a_day_desc:0 "Our submarines are high in quality, but low in quantity compared to other major seafaring nations. We thus must use each one at its fullest. Admiral Helfrich intends to push every submarine and crew to its limits by aggressively sailing out, and also by using unconventional tactics as diving into enemy harbours and torpedoing everything in sight."
HOL_wolfpack:0 "Wolfpack"
HOL_wolfpack_desc:0 "Our submarines should form small groups so they can pick of multiple targets. Should this 'wolfpack' be detected though, this could also mean that multiple submarines can not escape safely..."
HOL_lonewolf:0 "Independent Operations"
HOL_lonewolf_desc:0 "Our submarines should always operate separately in a spread out manner. This reduces the damage potential of a successful raid, but also makes them harder to detect and might force the enemy to spread out."

HOL_vlootplan_doorman:0 "Vlootplan Doorman"
HOL_vlootplan_doorman_desc:0 "The navy is crucial for our survival, and we will need all the firepower we can get. Having an assortment of smaller ships and outdated cruisers will not be enough, we must invest into proper cruisers and our battleship force."
HOL_wilton_fijenoord:0 "Wilton Fijenoord"
HOL_wilton_fijenoord_desc:0 "The NV Dok en Werf Maatschappij Wilton-Fijenoord is located in Schiedam, west of Rotterdam. With it origins tracing back to the first half of the 19th century, and was the first Dutch shipbuilding company to use steamer turbines. It is responsible for building the majority of the Dutch cruisers, as well as some destroyers and submarines."
HOL_cl_doorman:0 "Kijkduin Class Cruisers"
HOL_cl_doorman_desc:0 "Our previous cruiser designs are either old or just outgunned and too thinly armoured. It is time the Dutch navy gets some truly modern cruisers to form the backbone of the navy."
HOL_pantserschip:0 "A New Pantserschip"
HOL_pantserschip_desc:0 "Our old armoured cruisers are either rusting away at the docks or converted to other uses. We can study reviving this type of ship as they can be used as capable coastal defence ships or cruiser killers, or simply as a cheaper alternative to expensive battleships."
HOL_bc_doorman:0 "Our Biggest Cruisers Ever"
HOL_bc_doorman_desc:0 ""
HOL_dn_doorman:0 "Our Battleships"
HOL_dn_doorman_desc:0 "Our five Battleships were constructed during the 1920s. While we lack the knowledge to build such majestic ships from the ground up, we can refit them to improve their capabilities, or ask German ship wharfs to come up with new designs for us."
HOL_doctrine_doorman:0 "Capital Ship Training"
HOL_doctrine_doorman_desc:0 "The new large scale ships we are building will necessitate a lot of new training for the crew, and there are a lot of crew as well! We need to implement a new training regimen for all the new sailors needed by this large ocean-spanning fleet."

## Air Force
HOL_dutch_airforce:0 "The Dutch Air Force"
HOL_dutch_airforce_desc:0 "Airpower has already shown to be useful in the Weltkrieg, and we can only anticipate it's need increasing. We need to lay a firm foundation for airpower in the Netherlands to keep up with foreign enemies."
HOL_luchtvaartacademie:0 "Establish the Air Academie"
HOL_luchtvaartacademie_desc:0 "The Air Force is still lacking an organised education system for pilots and officers alike. By setting up the Luchtvaartacademie (Air Academy) we can improve the tactical operations of the air force considerably."
HOL_gilze_rijen_airbase:0 "Gilze-Rijen Air Base"
HOL_gilze_rijen_airbase_desc:0 "The LVA only has one proper airbase for military use, Airbase Soesterberg. Although centrally located, storing all our airplanes is not really ideal. Developing the already existing airstrip at Gilze-Rijen will give our air force an additional base."
HOL_koolhoven:0 "Koolhoven"
HOL_koolhoven_desc:0 "Koolhoven Vliegtuigen Fabriek N.V. situated in Rotterdam, has delivered some smaller airplane types for our air force in the past, mostly trainer planes. However, Koolhoven shows potential and we can consider giving them a chance to supply our air force with much needed modern planes."
HOL_koolhoven_fighter:0 "Koolhoven Fighters"
HOL_koolhoven_fighter_desc:0 "As we have opted for Koolhoven as our chief designer for the air force, we should start with replacing our antiquated fighter force with new planes from Koolhoven."
HOL_koolhoven_naval_bomber:0 "Koolhoven Naval Bombers"
HOL_koolhoven_naval_bomber_desc:0 "Airplanes with torpedoes attached are the bane of any ship, in particular the big and lumbering ones. Koolhoven has a rough concept of a promising twin engined naval bomber design, which are perfect for patrolling near the coast for enemy shipping."
HOL_fokker:0 "Fokker"
HOL_fokker_desc:0 "Fokker, situated in Amsterdam, has long been a dominant force in the civil aviation market. We should take the designs and adopt them for military use, lending our fighter craft extended range, agility, and firepower."
HOL_fokker_fighter:0 "Fokker Fighters"
HOL_fokker_fighter_desc:0 "The Fokker D.XVII forms the bulk of our fighter squadrons, and it has served well as a sturdy and agile machine. Now it is time for a replacement suitable for our needs, and who can do that better than Fokker!"
HOL_fokker_jachtkruiser:0 "Fokker Jachtkruisers"
HOL_fokker_jachtkruiser_desc:0 "A twin engined fighter might not be as fast and nimble, yet the proposed 'Jachtkruisers' by Fokker carry a deadly pack of machineguns, have a much longer range and can potentailly be equipped with a bomb load of their own, making them versatile planes."
HOL_fokker_ontwerp_115:0 "Finish Ontwerp 115 Bomber"
HOL_fokker_ontwerp_115_desc:0 "Fokker has design plans in an advanced stage for a true four engined bomber. We can order a prototype to be built and then see if we will actually build this behemoth for our air force."
HOL_new_bomber:0 "A New Bomber"
HOL_new_bomber_desc:0 "The LVA is in need of a new bomber as those in service are not particularly modern, or even useful. However, but we lack the capacity to have multiple types and should pick one suitable for our needs. Quick and nimble close air support planes, or continue with the Luchtkruiser two engined bomber concept?"
HOL_cas_tactics:0 "Huisje-Boompje-Beestje Tactics"
HOL_cas_tactics_desc:0 "By flying very low, our relatively slow bombers are considerably harder to detect and thus have a higher chance to reach their target. Unless they hit a tree of course..."
HOL_tactical_tactics:0 "Luchtkruiser Tactics"
HOL_tactical_tactics_desc:0 "Our twin engined planes are not just simple bombers, with their 20mm cannon installed in the nose installed they are like the cruisers of the air! They might not be fast, but an be a serious threat to other bombers, as well as enemy fighters whom decide to attack them frontally!"
HOL_carrier_planes:0 "Carrier Plane Variants"
HOL_carrier_planes_desc:0 "The Gouden Leeuw is useless without proper planes, and she is starting to become so with her biplanes in her hanger. Koolhoven has offered us some designs which can be quickly adopted for carrier usage."

### Events ###
holst.1.t:0 "The Netherlands in 1936"
holst.1.d:0 "The Netherlands was one of the few countries in Europe to preserve its neutrality in the Weltkrieg, despite discussions about joining the war on the side of Germany. Though the Netherlands profited greatly from the post-Weltkrieg economic boom, a considerable part of its economy is now in German hands, with large scale investments held by German companies. Furthermore, leftist ideas have been gaining serious traction in the Netherlands ever since the fall of France and Britain to Syndicalism in the 1920s, with reactionary ideologies also gaining momentum. Dutch democracy will surely be tested by rising global tensions and any collapse in the nation's economic prosperity."
holst.1.a:0 "Leve de koningin!"
holst.1.b:0 "Why can't I see any political focuses?"

holst.10001.t:0 "Dynamic Focus Trees"
holst.10001.d:0 "The Netherlands is making use of a new features in the 1.5 patch; dynamic focus trees! This lets us load parts of a focus tree on the fly enabling us to make larger focuses trees without having to show all of it at once. This can save a lot of scrolling but also preserve surprise about what paths lie ahead. For the Netherlands, the political focuses are hidden until they are available to you, so don't worry about not being able to see them right away, they'll be revealed in time..."
holst.10001.a:0 "Oh how cool!"

holst.2.t:0 "Berlin Stock Market Crashes!"
holst.2.d:0 "On February 3rd, 1936, the Berlin stock market crashed, plunging the world into a depression. Already it is being labelled the so-called 'Black Monday' crash. Our nation has strong economic ties to the Reich and many German companies are now shutting down their Dutch factories, plunging hundreds of thousands into immediate unemployment. Our banks were greatly exposed to the impact of the Crisis, and its effects are already becoming evident across most of the country."
holst.2.a:0 "This could be bad."

holst.3.t:0 "Jordaan Riots"
holst.3.d:0 "The Jordaan district of Amsterdam, traditionally a socialist stronghold, has erupted into violence.\n\nDissatisfaction with the inadequate unemployment provisions provided by the current government have, likely after prodding and agitation by syndicalist or council communist organisations, boiled over into a public protest. The protest turned into a riot as several groups of young men in black uniforms appeared out of the alleyways and descended upon the crowd with clubs, bricks and broken bottles.\n\nWith the police unable to restore order, the mayor was forced to call in several army units to disperse the crowds."
holst.3.a:0 "Things are breaking down!"

holst.4.t:0 "Lijst Links: The VDB-SDAP Electoral Pact"
holst.4.d:0 "The formation of the overwhelmingly powerful right-wing CNA sent shockwaves through parliament and society alike. As expected, it is proving an unpopular move with many of the more devout believers, who have jumped ship to the smaller religious opposition parties, and many fringe political commentators decry it as either a desperate attempt to gain absolute power or the last gasp of a dying system. Still, the CNA enjoys a comfortable majority of public support.\n\nIn response to the change, the moderate opposition parties have been performing manoeuvres of their own. The SDAP, despite slowly losing members to the radicals, is still the largest political party outside of the CNA itself, and the VDB has been significantly strengthened by becoming the primary focus of liberal politics, but neither is large enough to take the CNA head-on. As such, in order to safeguard the ideals of liberalism, social democracy and the moderate left in general, the VDB and SDAP have announced their cooperation in the coming elections.\n\nTogether, the parties may not be as huge as the CNA, but they have the benefit of a solid foundation, while the CNA is still bleeding votes. Despite both being left-wing parties, their viewpoints are too far apart to truly merge as the CNA has done, but this Left List still offers the possibility of a moderate victory at the ballot box, providing an alternative to the ungainly right-wing bloc that is the CNA, which is shrinking by the day, and fringe organisations like the VNH and the Patriotten."
holst.4.a:0 "Mijn hemel!"

holst.5.t:0 "Falling Living Standards"
holst.5.d:0 "Ever since February 3rd, Black Monday, and the collapse of the Berlin Stock Market, the economy of the Netherlands has been suffering. Our reliance on Germany has resulted in many of our workers becoming unemployed as German companies choose to cut jobs in the Netherlands first, spreading syndicalist ideas among the population. As a result the Social Democratic Workers' Party, or SDAP, has been gaining many new members and its political power is increasing. Many of their ideas have merit, but in order to pass them we would have to bring them into the governing coalition - a potentially dangerous option."
holst.5.a:0 "This does not bode well..."

holst.6.t:0 "Crumbling of the Pillars"
holst.6.d:0 "Dutch society has long been highly stratified into distinct social groups, referred to as 'pillars'. These pillars all have their own social institutions: their own newspapers, broadcasting organisations, political parties, trade unions and farmers' associations, banks, schools, hospitals, universities, scouting organisations and sports clubs. Some companies even hire only personnel of a specific religion or ideology. This has lead to a situation where many people have no personal contact with people outside their own pillar.\n\nHowever, the recent economic crisis has shaken the established order to its core. Economic hardship has spread socialist ideology beyond its established pillar, with syndicalists and council communists emboldened by the rhetoric emanating from Paris. At the same time, many young and unemployed from the more traditionally rightist pillars are feeling disenfranchised and abandoned by their condition, turning instead to radical nationalist parties such as the Alliance for National Reconstruction, the VNH, to restore stability and prosperity to the Kingdom of the Netherlands."
holst.6.a:0 "Dear God, no!"

holst.7.t:0 "Formation of the Christelijke Nationale Alliantie"
holst.7.d:0 "For decades, the Dutch parliament has been dominated by the various religious parties. The Calvinist ARP and CHU and Catholic RKSP have held a convincing majority in the government, and have been the source of almost all ministerial appointments.\n\nHowever, they can no longer count on the unconditional and unwavering support of their respective pillars. While still dominant in their own spheres, they are losing ground to the far-left and far-right fringe movements, and even among the moderate audience, the pull of the left-liberals and social-democrats is growing. With each of these parties bleeding votes, and despite their pillars' strict separation in daily life, they are now attempting to cash in on their decades-long cooperation by erasing their party lines.\n\nThe formation of the Christian National Alliance, or CNA, is likely going to cost them more votes in the long run, but the consolidation of parliamentary seats and popular support still makes the CNA a political juggernaut that dwarfs all other parties.\n\nTime will tell whether this will be enough to counteract the increasing erosion of their voter base, or whether the primacy of God in politics is coming to an end..."
holst.7.a:0 "United in faith."

holst.8.t:0 "The Liberal Crisis"
holst.8.d:0 "Liberalism in the Netherlands is under siege. The largest liberal party, the traditionalist LSP, has been steadily losing ground over recent years. Many members, disillusioned by the perceived failures of the old system, are being drawn to the radical nationalists of the VNH and now also the promise of a large power bloc like the CNA. This has led to the left-leaning VDB becoming the largest liberal party in the country, as they are losing members at a much slower rate.\n\nAlthough there is little likelihood of them winning the elections this year, there is still hope in the LSP that they can portray themselves as a credible moderate alternative to the conservative and increasingly authoritarian CNA."
holst.8.a:0 "Troubling times, but the torch of liberalism is not yet extinguished."

holst.9.t:0 "Rise of the Radical Left"
holst.9.d:0 "After SDAP co-founder P.J. Troelstra's abortive attempt at founding a Dutch Republic in 1918, and the non-committal response by the party's moderate wing, the more radical revolutionary elements have abandoned the social democrats in order to pursue their hopes of overthrowing the old system in more like-minded company.\n\nThe SDAP's slight drift rightwards has only emboldened their radical counterparts in the Revolutionair-Socialistische Arbeiderspartij, or RSAP, a relatively small party in parliament that sees itself as Troelstra's successors, working within the system to overthrow it.\n\nEven further to the left, and outside the realm of conventional parliamentary politics, the Nationaal Arbeids-Secretariaat, or NAS, is the primary syndicalist labour organisation in the Netherlands, seeking to replace the old system in its entirety and restructure it according to the French model, with tacit support from Paris.\n\nIn many ways similar, the council communists and their election-boycotting KAPD rally behind the astronomer and Marxist theorist Anton Pannekoek.\n\nThere are even some for whom the syndicalist/council-communist approach is too conservative; the 'Patriotten', authoritarian socialists led by David Wijnkoop and Paul de Groot, see themselves as the guardians of the revolution, claiming to intend to keep it away from its tendency of falling to a new 'elitism'. Many of their ideas are consistent with the ideology the Internationale recently codified as Vanguardism.\n\nWith all these factions vying for the chance to leave their own mark on the history of the Netherlands, the parliamentary democratic system is well and truly under siege from the left."
holst.9.a:0 "More radical leftists? Good Lord!"

holst.10.t:0 "Formation of the Landwacht"
holst.10.d:0 "In the wake of the Jordaan Riot, the police very rapidly found out that the black-shirted youths who were laying into the crowd of protesters, and who disappeared the moment the soldiers turned up, were more than just random thugs. These figures represent the first public appearance of the Landwacht, a paramilitary organisation set up by the VNH, supposedly led directly by Cornelis van Geelkerken himself.\n\nSince the Jordaan, the Landwacht has popped up all over the country, standing watch at VNH rallies and assemblies, disrupting meetings of left-wing organisations, and occasionally fighting in the streets against their syndicalist counterparts, the Nationale Rode Front, or 'Red Front'. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially among the youth.\n\nThe Landwacht is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."
holst.10.a:0 "Mijn hemel!"

holst.11.t:0 "The Death of Van Gybland Oosterhoff"
holst.11.d:0 "The leader of the ultra-nationalist VNH, Van Gybland Oosterhoff, died today in his home in Amsterdam.\n\nHis last few years had seen a rapid rise in fortunes of the VNH, brought on by the economic struggles facing many in the country, fear of Syndicalism and disillusionment with democracy. However, the party he leaves behind is highly divided itself between the young, newer members of the party lead by Cornelis van Geelkerken and the older, more established segment possessing ties to the Dutch military and bureaucracy in the hands of H.N.A. Swart.\n\nSwart has been named the new party leader with van Geelkerken his deputy, and the pair look set to challenge the established parties for control of the Hague in the May elections - provided the two wings can keep working together."
holst.11.a:0 "We must be careful with them..."

holst.12.t:0 "Social Unrest in the Netherlands"
holst.12.d:0 "The past few months have seen the growth of violent confrontations between the paramilitary bands of both the left and the right, with street fights an almost daily occurrence in the larger cities. Strikes are commonplace, with either the police or the Landwacht's 'Blackshirts' breaking the strikers' pickets. The police have failed to keep order, with the army often having to offer support, but this has only served to increase dissent and further civil disobedience. If the situation continues to escalate, the elections in May look set to be the most contentious in living memory."
holst.12.a:0 "Bloody thugs!"

holst.13.t:0 "The Zwolle Massacre"
holst.13.d:0 "A socialist rally outside Zwolle, organised by local council communists, ended in tragedy, as one of the strikers threw a bomb into the midst of the police, who were trying to disperse the crowds. Four policemen died, and the police immediately returned fire on the crowd, killing two dozen strikers.\n\nAt dawn the next morning, the police, openly backed up by the local chapter of the Landwacht, arrested local socialist leaders en masse, including the nephew of Henk Sneevliet, founder and leader of the RSAP.\n\nThese actions have elicited further protests throughout the country, and even the VDB is calling on Prime Minister Colijn to publicly condemn what they refer to as 'illegal detentions'."
holst.13.a:0 "The police did well in rounding up the troublemakers so quickly."
holst.13.b:0 "These people are innocent, and must be released at once!"

holel.1.t:0 "Dutch Elections"
holel.1.d:0 "With the incidents in Amsterdam and Zwolle still fresh in people's memories, the parliamentary elections are going to be hotly contested this year, and the police are out in force to deter would-be troublemakers.\n\nThe CNA super-bloc currently has the strongest parliamentary position, but with the pillars teetering on the brink of destruction and haemorrhaging voters left and right their superiority at the ballot box is very much in question. However, Lijst Links, the combination of the left-liberals and moderate social democrats, can also count on a broad support base, perhaps even enough to dethrone the CNA. And there's always the spectre of radicalism waiting in the wings..."
holel.1.a:0 "The radical socialist RSAP achieves victory!"

holel.1.b:0 "Lijst Links Dethrones the CNA Juggernaut!"
holel.1.c:0 "CNA retains its dominance."
holel.1.e:0 "VNH becomes the largest party."

holel.2.t:0 "Moderate Left Cabinet"
holel.2.d:0 "The Lijst Links electoral alliance has successfully and soundly defeated the CNA. The increasingly authoritarian stance of the Christian Right has led to a surge in support for the moderate left, and now Colijn and his bloated, oversized party have been sent packing.\n\nHowever, unlike the total monolithic unification of the CNA, Lijst Links was merely an electoral alliance of convenience, and the left-liberals of the VDB and social democrats of the SDAP still retain their separate parties, with their own programmes and ideals. The few half-hearted efforts made towards further unification have been shouted down, and so Lijst Links is no more.\n\nObviously the SDAP was the larger side in this pact, and thus are in a position to choose who they'll work with. Queen Wilhelmina has informed them that she is only willing to give the post of Formateur to a social liberal, thus it's impossible for Albarda to become minister-president without an impasse in forming a new government."
holel.2.a:0 "VDB-SDAP moderate coalition with Oud as PM."
holel.2.b:0 "SDAP will work with the RSAP so Albarda becomes PM."

holel.3.t:0 "Moderate Right Cabinet"
holel.3.d:0 "The CNA gamble has paid off! Despite losing a large number of voters, the confessional bloc proved to be large enough to sweep away the opposition. The godless socialists have been thoroughly cowed, and appear to be laying low for the time being. Now the time has come to form the next government, the fourth Colijn cabinet.\n\nMany prominent CNA members are confident that this victory means that the CNA still carries the people's mandate, and should thus form a cabinet by itself - albeit one which is only barely in the majority. However, since our majority is only marginal, any dissent within the party itself could destabilise the cabinet that needs to be sturdy in these roaring times.\n\nDue to our reduced majority, the now-decimated LSP have proposed joining our cabinet to assist us in coalition, and some reactionaries are suggesting that this one electoral victory is not enough to deter the radical leftists. Some senior figures are even floating the idea of cooperating with the VNH in order to use their resources to stamp out the red menace."
holel.3.a:0 "We'll work with the liberal LSP."
holel.3.b:0 "Multi-party cabinets are by definition unstable!"
holel.3.c:0 "The VNH will work."

holel.4.t:0 "VNH Electoral Victory"
holel.4.d:0 "In such trying times as these, it's no surprise the people clamour for strong leadership to guide them. The ideals of the VNH have proven to be a strong enough rallying point that we have trounced every one of our adversaries at the ballot box, and now we take upon ourselves the task of stamping out the spectre of international Syndicalism and restoring the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the status it deserves.\n\nThis is not going to be an easy road, however - in addition to the Red menace, the factional party politicians who spend their days chattering away in Parliament will likely be fighting us every step of the way as well for we lack parliamentary majority. We could assuage their concerns and form a proper coalition with the CNA, if only to pacify the public and make the transition easier, or we could could let the Landwacht 'convince' parliament to give us emergency powers."
holel.4.a:0 "Form a coalition with the CNA."
holel.4.b:0 "'Convince' parliament with the Landwacht."

holel.5.t:0 "Queen Wilhelmina Abdicates"
holel.5.d:0 "Disillusioned with the unconventional outcome of the elections, Queen Wilhelmina has announced that she will abdicate.\nShortly after this announcement the demissionary Colijn government then asked the new parliament to approve the financing of the crowning ceremony, yet the RSAP and republican wing of the SDAP voted the suggestion away.\nAfter the voting procedures Henk Sneevliet came outside to speak to the crowd of people and NRFers and declared that 'the queen has abdicated and the former government is rapidly packing its bags. The Dutch left has won!'\nThe day after the Red Front stopped other parliamentarians from entering parliament, and voted a completely rewritten, socialist, constitution in."
holel.5.a:0 "Leve de Republiek!"

holel.6.t:0 "Queen Wilhelmina Abdicates"
holel.6.d:0 "Queen Wilhelmina was unwilling to give Albarda the post of Formateur, despite the fact that he had won a resounding victory in the elections. As a result Albarda had announced that he would only take part in a coalition if he would become prime minister, meaning he would need to work with the RSAP.\n\nCritics are now saying Wilhelmina pushed Albarda into radicalism and many are demanding that she resigns, it wouldn't take long."
holel.6.a:0 "Leve de Republiek!"
holel.6.b:0 "Juliana is crowned and makes Albarda Formateur."

holel.7.t:0 "General Reijnders Requests Support"
holel.7.d:0 "We have been watching our small neighbour, the Netherlands, for quite some time. It has become apparent that the Dutch left has won this year's elections and that it may soon join find itself being ruled by syndicalists. This is a worrying development as the Ruhr area is heavily dependent on the Dutch harbour of Rotterdam.\n\nToday the leader of the Dutch armed forces, Izaak Reijnders, came here to ask for support to launch a putsch; this could be the perfect opportunity to ensure the Dutch government remains aligned with our interests. Others however argue that in those days of crisis it should not be Germany's place to mess with other countries, even less so when it would cost money or resources."
holel.7.a:0 "Herr Reijnders can count on our support."
holel.7.b:0 "Sadly, we cannot support you."

holel.8.t:0 "Reijnders Launches a Military Putsch"
holel.8.d:0 "While the last votes were being counted, General Reijnders suddenly seized control of the nation's primary radio broadcaster and unilaterally declared the country to be in 'state of emergency'.\n\nIn Amsterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Eindhoven and Groningen, soldiers were deployed to occupy strategic points, such as bridges and public buildings. The demissionary Colijn government was preparing its response when suddenly a putschist detachment of soldiers burst into the building and placed all ministers under house arrest.\n\nIn Groningen, the crisis lasted less than an hour, however, as a loyalist army group joined up with the NRF and several 'volunteer guards', driving the revolting putschists back to the city limits. Following this, more loyalist forces began to rendezvous and launch attacks on the military forces holding the key strong points across the nation."
holel.8.a:0 "The loyalist counter-attack is routed."

holel.9.d:0 "General Reijnders was apprehended at the border today, carrying documents showing that he was seeking German support to carry out a putsch, something he evidently didn't receive as he was returning by motorcarriage rather than the plane he demanded.\nBecause of the successful arrest of Reijnders, any risk of a putsch by the military seems to have been averted, though it may be beneficial to assess what measures we can take to improve the loyalty of the army to our constitutionally-appointed government."

holel.10.d:0 "The last loyalist strongholds have been broken and the country is firmly in our hands, now the question remaining is how the country shall be ruled henceforth.\n\nDemocracy is, at least for now, ruled out because the people would just vote in leftists to parliament, which is not what we want. The choice lies between whether we set up a military junta under the lead of Reijnders or whether we let the VNH, who had tactitly supported our putsch, set up a provisional government capable of rooting out the red menace that has nestled itself in our country.\n\nMany are afraid however that the VNH will not be too willing to give up their power once they have it. On top of that they also have an extremist branch that may seek to take advantage of such a situation to seize power for themselves, while this deal is of course based solely on agreement with the moderate military branch of the VNH."

holsdap.1.d:0 "The SDAP's growing public support has paid off in a big way. The votes have been tallied, and not only has the SDAP managed to gain the majority of the Lijst Links votes, it has won a landslide victory and actually enjoys a small, but comfortable parliamentary majority, with even the CNA relegated to the sidelines. This has sparked a massive debate within the party regarding which course to take.\n\nThere is a large moderate lobby which advocates abandoning the last vestiges of revolutionary thought, and to form a coalition with the VDB liberals in order to cement our position as a legitimate part of the political landscape. Others claim that our majority position means we alone have the mandate of the people, and that we should thus forge ahead on our own. Finally, some suggest that we should return to our roots, and seize this opportunity to start a revolution within the system, seeking out the help of the RSAP in establishing a socialist state."
holsdap.1.a:0 "Oke!"

holvdb.1.t:0 "VDB Electoral Victory"
holvdb.1.d:0 "The votes have been counted, and it seems the Dutch have not lost their trust in liberalism. The VDB is now set to lead the first liberal cabinet since the Weltkrieg - but we do not have the support base to do it alone. The decision now is where to find that support. The party is split between those who want to work with the SDAP, and those who want to work with the CNA. The social democratic ideal may be quite different from the liberal one, but both parties are averse to extremism and authoritarianism on either end of the political spectrum, and the fairly broad public support for the SDAP would help cement the VDB's position. Plus, both parties have already proven they can work together, if only to win an election. On the other hand, the CNA is more well-established in politics and has closer ties to the bureaucracy and the military, its constituent parties have decades of experience running the government, not to mention the sizeable contingent of right-liberals in their ranks, who would be happy to form a stronger, more centrist liberal bloc. Now the VDB must decide which of these two it wishes to partner up with."

hol.4.d:0 "It is time to select a ruler to lead the Netherlands, who are now reduced to our puppet state. While it seems obvious that general Reijnders should be put in charge on the local side of things, it depends on whether we trust him: we could install the duchess of Luxembourg as queen of the Netherlands as she has a light claim and will be very motivated to move the Netherlands towards annexation into the empire (as this would expand her domain and thus political power within it), or we could establish the husband of the Dutch crown-princess as regent. Lastly it is of course also possible to just give Reijnders a free hand."

Four policemen and two dozen strikers were left dead, and the next day the local authorities hanged 4 SDAP leaders, all of whom were on the speaker's podium at the time.

holpostel.2.t:0 "Anti-Syndicalist Riots"
holpostel.2.d:0 "The rhetoric of the VNH, and especially its deputy leader Cornelis van Geelkerken, seems to have taken grip on the Dutch populace. Moderates who earlier might have dismissed the party as paranoid radicals have now taken up arms en-masse to join the VNH's calls for organised action against what they have labelled a systematic attempt to bring revolution to the Netherlands.\n\nThe results of this hostile rhetoric have been riots across the nation targeting known socialists as well as a number of leftist institutions. There have even been reports of Landwacht-backed attempts to break into the SDAP party headquarters hoping to take control over membership records. Some have suggested this was done in order to assist nationwide attacks on everything leftwards of the VDB.\n\nWhat should our response be to this upsurge in violence?"

Within hours more forces stationed in the area had joined the revolt. Soon after this David Wijnkoop appeared on the radio through a hijacked radio station declaring that hatred towards the left 'is institutionalised' and that the Binnenhof Fire was a signal for a new revolution.\n\nWhen the national government tried to direct the military to put down the revolt it appeared a good part of the armed forces, even in the rest of the country, mutinied in favour of the reds.

At the same time we have been observing Red Front stragglers digging in inside the city of Leeuwarden.\nTheir huge numerical superiority makes it apparent that the Landwacht will crush the Red Front for years to come if we let them fight each other, but letting them do so will not only put us at a risk of having to deal with a virtually unopposed paramilitary organisation, but it will probably also result in a massacre!"
holpostel.11.a:0 "Let the extremists kill each other."

holpostel.13.t:0 "Finsterwolde Conspiracy"
holpostel.13.d:0 "Deputy leader Cornelis van Geelkerken of the VNH called a nationwide party assembly in Maastricht. During the assembly, he gave a speech denouncing our government as secretly being ruled by syndicalists. The press had previously mockingly dubbed this conspiracy theory the 'Finsterwolde conspiracy' after the sole municipality in the Netherlands that has the RSAP as the majority in its municipal council.\n\nConspiracy theory or not, an open revolt was declared against our government, with members of the VNH proclaiming that the rebels sought to end enduring syndicalist influence over the Dutch state for good. This message appears to have been effective at resonating with the population, or at least with VNH supporters, many of whom appeared to be more than happy to join the revolt.\n\nWhile initially sympathetic to the government, which had sought to block the revolt by using a broadcast by the Queen, the VNH's more moderate leadership decided to switch sides in favour of the rebellion, and a populist takeover seems almost inevitable."

holpostel.15.d:0 "Following our lack of action against anti-syndicalist riots, there have not only been reports of the riots growing in size, but it appears that in multiple cities, local law enforcement have in fact joined the raving mobs in attacking socialists. In some cases, the socialists are the ones arrested, in others, local law enforcement have used their weapons against them, instead of to defend them. Socialist elements, especially the more moderate ones, are crying out for the government to do something to alleviate the suffering they have been going through ever since the Binnenhof was burned to the ground."

holpostel.15.b:0 "They have no one to blame but themselves."

holpostel.16.t:0 "Formation of the Dorpswacht"
holpostel.16.d:0 "Following our orders to the national police to abstain from attacking left-wing civilians and institutions without proper reason, the VNH has announced the formation of the Dorpswacht. Unlike the Landwacht it is not a nationwide institution, but more of a weaponised neighbourhood watch, taking up extrajudicial policing duties as well as organising raids on the properties of alleged syndicalists and marching along the most important streets.\nMore Dorpswacht organisations are springing up across the country, and it appears that many moderate rightists view the Dorpswacht as a more acceptable alternative to the Landwacht, who are frequently seen as overly aggressive."
holpostel.16.a:0 "Shut every single one of them down."
holpostel.16.b:0 "Allow them to operate."

holpostel.17.d:0 "People who once considered the Landwacht little more than paranoid radicals are, as a result of our crackdown on the local Dorpswacht, flocking towards the regular Landwacht. This is because these radicalised former moderates feel that the government is failing to protect them from radical leftists intending to kill them."

holpostel.18.d:0 "With Dorpswachten springing up all across the country, it soon became clear that the people seized by these organisations were not being handed over to the legally recognised police. This has prompted the 'Centrale Inlichtingendienst', the Dutch central intelligence service, to start an investigation on where these people actually vanished to.\n\nInvestigators have discovered that leftists apprehended by the Dorpswachten across the Netherlands are typically handed over to provincial camps run by the Landwacht, where they being held under tight control. Unsurprisingly, this is legally considered kidnapping."
holpostel.18.a:0 "This is fine."

holpostel.19.t:0 "March on the Hague"
holpostel.19.d:0 "A number of people have increasingly viewed our government as too soft on the forces of extremism tearing the Netherlands apart. On the other hand, the VNH and its use of extrajudicial measures against the syndicalists have gained it great support amongst the population.\n\nNow the Landwacht, which has gained a great deal of influence in past months, has come together in Amsterdam to march to the Hague on foot.\nThe Queen, seeing that the Landwacht has now grown so strong and so influential within the military, has recognised that resisting what clearly represents a coup would be futile. Therefore Wilhelmina has dismissed our government in favour of a new VNH cabinet led by Swart that plans on ruling the country like a dictatorship."
holpostel.19.a:0 "Perhaps we were too soft."

holpostel.20.t:0 "Rising Crime Levels"
holpostel.20.d:0 "As the recession continues, more and more unemployed Dutchmen are turning to crime as a last resort to support themselves and their family.\nThe result is that the paramilitary Landwacht and Red Front are getting a policing role in those areas where they reign supreme and the police is unable to keep this trend in check. This is in turn leading to growing sympathy amongst the population towards the political movements behind these organisations.\n\nIf we are to avoid membership of more extreme political ideologies growing, then we must stop this, though that will probably not be a popular measure."
holpostel.20.a:0 "Prohibit paramilitaries from policing."
holpostel.20.b:0 "Let them do their thing."

holpostel.21.t:0 "The Scourge of Alcoholism"
holpostel.21.d:0 "As general living standard continues to decline, there is a disturbing trend of people resorting to the bottle in order to forget their problems.\nThe economy will recover at some point, with or without government intervention, but if alcoholism becomes too serious an issue it might affect our productivity even after the crisis. As a result many are advocating the prohibition of sales of alcoholic beverages. Still others, say this goes against the freedom of the individual."
holpostel.21.a:0 "Cheers to the prohibition."
holpostel.21.b:0 "Making my dear whiskey illegal? No way."

holpostel.22.t:0 "Alcohol Crime Cartels"
holpostel.22.d:0 "Not so long ago, the only parties that kept our streets unsafe were political in nature, but since we have started to prohibit the sale of alcoholic drinks, several criminal cartels involved in smuggling or producing liquor have sprung up. What's worse, they are fighting each other for the sole right to sell liquor in certain areas. The police are far from capable of keeping this in check and as a result the Red Front and Landwacht have started to supplant them in keeping the streets safe. Either we rescind the prohibition and give in to criminals, or we keep things as they are, probably resulting in the extreme left and right taking credit for containing the cartels."
holpostel.22.a:0 "Abandon the prohibition."
holpostel.22.b:0 "Keep the prohibition."

holpostel.23.t:0 "'Labourers Don't Drink Beer!'"
holpostel.23.d:0 "'Arbeiders drinken geen bier' is the name of the syndicalist campaign to fight alcoholism in the working class, seeing it as method by which the reactionaries and capitalists keep the proletariat crushed underfoot. As alcoholism became a growing problem in the Netherlands, and with the governments unwillingness to act on it, independent conservative movements pursuing the same goal started to work together with the syndicalists, resulting in growing sympathy for both ideologies and increasing political polarisation."
holpostel.23.a:0 "Encourage private actions against alcoholism..."
holpostel.23.b:0 "...but not when syndicalism is involved!"

holpostel.24.t:0 "Populist Welfare"
holpostel.24.d:0 "Since the beginning of the crisis many sections of our welfare system have deteriorated, and the country is filled with unemployed people who can hardly obtain the food required to support their families. As a result, the VNH has started a nationwide campaign distributing food to these areas and opening food banks and soup kitchens. These actions have created a lot of goodwill towards them and makes it look like, even though they are currently not in power, they are the ones who care for the people.\nWe could shut their project down, but risk inciting a great deal of anger amongst the working classes."
holpostel.24.a:0 "It's good for the people."
holpostel.24.b:0 "Shut it down."

holpostel.25.t:0 "NAS Overtakes NVV"
holpostel.25.d:0 "The NVV, the most important social democratic union within the Netherlands for years, has, according to the latest CBS report, been overtaken by the syndicalist NAS in terms of membership.\nThis is a bad sign for the SDAP, as it sends a loud signal that their power base is quickly leaking away to the more radical side of Dutch politics. It also provides evidence that their pillar, so far fairly untouched by the ongoing process of depillarisation, is now undergoing the same crumbling that the other pillars have felt. The NAS becoming the most important trade union in the country has the potential to be very dangerous, therefore some voices in our government have called for an official announcement that we will not countenance any negotiations with the NAS, hopefully limiting its appeal."
holpostel.25.a:0 "We do not negotiate with syndicalists."
holpostel.25.b:0 "We accept the new status quo."

holpostel.26.t:0 "Malieveld Protests"
holpostel.26.d:0 "A huge rally of radical socialists, syndicalists and other left-wing fringe movements has started on the Malieveld in The Hague.\nThey are protesting against what they call the rule of the capitalists and some even openly call for a revolution. The local police is wondering what they should be doing - should they crack down on the demonstration or let it run its course?"
holpostel.26.a:0 "Let the rally proceed."
holpostel.26.b:0 "Shut that red scum gathering down."

holpostel.27.t:0 "February Strike"
holpostel.27.d:0 "This morning, the trams stood still in Amsterdam. At the same time, RSAP and NAS followers were spreading the manifesto 'Staakt, staakt, staakt!' - Strike, strike, strike! among Amsterdam companies. By noon, it had become a general strike and by the evening it has spread to all nearby cities, including Haarlem, Hilversum and Utrecht. It is clear that this syndicalist-organised strike is quickly becoming the largest strike the Netherlands has ever seen.\nAn emergency meeting is taking place in The Hague and three options are being considered: accept the demands, which is the preferred approach of the left, wait the strike out, regardless of the potential harm to the economy, or break the strike up, the preferred option of the right."
holpostel.27.a:0 "Give the Syndies their win."
holpostel.27.b:0 "They will give up in time."
holpostel.27.c:0 "Drive them back to where they belong!"

holpostel.28.t:0 "February Strike Continues"
holpostel.28.d:0 "Our waiting strategy does not seem to be working so far, it has only emboldened the strikers, who have now been holding out for a whopping three months. Meanwhile, our economy remains largely still, and many who were earlier in favour of waiting the strike out are now advocating giving in to their demands. Unfortunately, the respect the syndicalists have gained during these days will only grow if we back down now."
holpostel.28.a:0 "Raise the white flag."
holpostel.28.b:0 "Time is on our side."
holpostel.28.c:0 "Break it up, it's been long enough!"

holpostel.29.t:0 "Strikers Return to Work"
holpostel.29.d:0 "After five months of continuous striking, it appears that finally the strikers are giving up. More and more workers have been returning to their workplaces in recent weeks, where they should be, and today the NAS has called off the strike without having gained any concessions.\n\nThis is a serious political blow to the radical left, who have been humiliated and no longer seen as being able to press their will. On top of that their monetary resources expended to maintain the strikers has depleted massively. Still, we ought to be careful, because we've won a battle, not the war."
holpostel.29.a:0 "Take that, red scum."

holpostel.30.t:0 "Radio Rood"
holpostel.30.d:0 "Founded by a group of Dutch syndicalist exiles, Radio Rood is a London-based radio station slandering 'the Dutch capitalist dictatorship' and calling for acts of resistance 'against the bourgeois pigs occupying our country'.\nThey are spreading lies about certain events happening here as well as making up events of their own and claiming that the legitimate media is ignoring these fact to keep the proletariat dumb. The problem is that there is a significant portion of our population who actually believes this rubbish, and we have little to no way to shut down a radio station based in a country our relations are hostile with, to say the least."
holpostel.30.a:0 "Confiscate every civilian radio!"
holpostel.30.b:0 "They don't harm anyone."

holpostel.31.t:0 "French Arms Smugglers Captured"
holpostel.31.d:0 "We have captured a group of French nationals carrying explosives across the Flemish-Walloon-Dutch border.\nThey won't explain their presence, nor the source of their explosives, and after a search the name of a prominent local syndicalist and a location was discovered in one of the men's pockets. Police arriving at the designated location did not find anyone present despite a prolonged search. According to the law, the smugglers will be designated 'unwanted foreigners' and evicted, but the Central Intelligence Service wants to interrogate the men; they might be affiliated with the Communard government which would make this an act of espionage."
holpostel.31.a:0 "Let the CI interrogate the foreigners."
holpostel.31.b:0 "Just evict them!"

holpostel.32.t:0 "French Nationals Confess"
holpostel.32.d:0 "The French nationals we apprehended at the border a few days ago came clean with their plans to the CI after the interrogation: apparently they sought to supply explosives to a local Sorelian-affiliated group in order to blow up the Amsterdam Centraal Station, the heart of our nation's train infrastructure, in an operation that is at least not directly attributable to the Communard government.\nThey have given up their contacts within our country and the police are ready to shut down every foreign Vanguardist terrorist cell residing within our country."
holpostel.32.a:0 "Roll them up and evict the French."

holpostel.33.t:0 "French Nationals Stay Silent"
holpostel.33.d:0 "Despite a prolonged interrogation, the CI has been unable to extract any meaningful information from the French nationals we captured at the border. They are now asking for explicit government sanction to use physical... arguments to convince them to speak. This would, strictly speaking, be unconstitutional, but they are syndicalist foreigners after all."
holpostel.33.a:0 "Permission granted."
holpostel.33.b:0 "No, just throw them out."

holpostel.34.t:0 "French Nationals Remain Silent"
holpostel.34.d:0 "Despite the extra rights granted to the CI in this case, the mysterious French nationals still do not seem willing to talk. Continuing the torture might now result in their death however, so the CI once again has sought orders from the government as to what they are supposed to do..."
holpostel.34.a:0 "We'll keep going until they speak or die!"
holpostel.34.b:0 "It's not worth the effort."

holpostel.35.t:0 "French Nationals Die"
holpostel.35.d:0 "After a prolonged interrogation, that became very emotional for a while, one by one the French nationals somehow ended up dead. Obviously it was purely accidental and of course we had nothing to do with it as we would never violate the constitution by torturing these people. Still, the fact remains that we still do not know what they were planning with those explosives, but at least the world is better off with seven syndicalists removed from it."
holpostel.35.a:0 "Put the designer of the interrogation room on trial for manslaughter!"

holpostel.36.t:0 "Centraal Station Bombing"
holpostel.36.d:0 "The Amsterdam Central Station, the heart of rail infrastructure in our country, has today been blown up resulting in 127 deaths. Responsibility was claimed by a small syndicalist group affiliated with the Communard Sorelian faction in France.\nAfter investigation of the debris, it appears that the explosives used are the same as those confiscated from a group of French nationals that were smuggling them. It appears that this was a tragedy that could have been avoided."
holpostel.36.a:0 "Verdomde Syndies!"

holpostel.37.t:0 "Torture Story Leaks!"
holpostel.37.d:0 "How it has ended up the hands of the press no-one knows, but the fact is that they somehow acquired a copy of the document sanctioning the CI to torture the French nationals we arrested at the border not so long ago.\nThis will only strengthen the syndicalists in their rhetoric that the Dutch government is in fact a banana republic that is violating its own constitution. They will inevitably state that we are not even close to the democracy we portray ourselves as and that the Dutch regime will need to be replaced with a syndicalist model."
holpostel.37.a:0 "Aargh."

holpostel.38.t:0 "Revolutionary Statue Vandalised!"
holpostel.38.d:0 "A statue in Rotterdam erected in honour of the revolution has been besmirched in orange, white and blue by a filthy reactionary. Sadly the response is that more and more young people, who admire the courage of the deed, have been inspired to follow the anti-revolutionary underground VNH, who are plotting to take down the fragile nation we have just established. If we are to prevent a growth of this form of underground resistance, we must crack down hard on this!"
holpostel.38.a:0 "Crack down on all anti-revolutionaries in Rotterdam!"
holpostel.38.b:0 "Just wash it off!"

holpostel.39.t:0 "Assassination in Utrecht"
holpostel.39.d:0 "Johan Albarda drove through Utrecht today on his way for a public event. He was accompanied by the minister of interior, Wilem Drees as he went.\nSadly, a lone gunman, a member of the VNH, decided to take aim for Albarda. Sadly for him though, Drees and Albarda wear similar suits, and from his location the gunman is unable to recognise who is who his target is; he has to take a guess. Which man should he shoot?"
holpostel.39.a:0 "The man on the left."
holpostel.39.b:0 "The man on the right."

holpostel.40.t:0 "Assassin Arrested"
holpostel.40.d:0 "The police are reported to have arrested the lone gunman responsible for the assassination. He goes by the name of Peter Ton and appears to be an active member of the VNH, as well as fiercely opposed to everything affiliated with socialism. For now he's being held at the prison in Vught."
holpostel.40.a:0 "Good!"

holpostel.41.t:0 "Vught Prison Siege"
holpostel.41.d:0 "A huge crowd gathered today in Vught, demanding the prison hand over Peter Ton to them. It didn't take long for the pressure to build leading to the prison kommandant giving Ton up, resulting in him being lynched on the spot by the furious crowd. In the throes of victory, the mob have started to demand that the prison releases syndicalists imprisoned there and deliver other right-wingers to them, presumably to do the same to them!"
holpostel.41.a:0 "Intervene fast!"
holpostel.41.b:0 "They asked for it!"

holpostel.42.t:0 "Anti-Rightist Riots Cease"
holpostel.42.d:0 "Following public speeches by several social democratic politicians, the mobs targeting right-wing figures and groups around the country, undoubtedly stirred up by the syndicalists, have started to disperse."
holpostel.42.a:0 "We survived one more crisis."

holpostel.43.t:0 "Amerikagangers"
holpostel.43.d:0 "Amerikagangers or 'America-goers' are Dutch syndicalists that have assembled in large groups to prepare to fight as volunteers with the Combined Syndicates in the American Civil War. Their preparations are almost complete which poses a problem for our government as to how to approach them. If we let them leave it could jeopardise potential future relations with whichever non-syndicalist power is victorious in America.\n\nWithin the government, most people are advocating forfeiture of citizenship if they join the syndicalist army, as per the law; some say the Dutch expression 'prevention is better than to cure' applies here, and then there are some who think we should just let them spend their holiday in America."
holpostel.43.a:0 "Confiscate their passports."
holpostel.43.b:0 "Warn them they will lose their citizenship."
holpostel.43.c:0 "Just let them go."

holpostel.44.t:0 "Dutch Volunteers Arrive"
holpostel.44.d:0 "Dutch volunteers have arrived to help the syndicalist cause; they are not very well trained however and their division is rather small, so we may need to invest in them in order to make them a significant fighting force or just throw them at the enemy, which will probably result in high casualties."
holpostel.44.a:0 "We need all help we can get!"

holpostel.45.t:0 "Annual VNH Landdag"
holpostel.45.d:0 "The annual VNH landdag will start in a week in Utrecht, the first one since the 1937 elections. The CI, the Dutch secret service, has found out that they will be announcing a major policy change for coming year and they themselves seem rather certain that this will result in a boost of support for their movement, reinforced by the fact that the VNH is encouraging non-members to come as well. The CI has sadly not been able to retrieve information about the said policy change.\n\nSome are saying that the ideology of the VNH is dangerous and that it would be best if we stop the landdag from occurring at all, possibly through revoking their permit to hold a rally; others say this gathering is protected by freedom of speech and should just go ahead."
holpostel.45.a:0 "The landdag may go ahead."
holpostel.45.b:0 "Revoke their permit."

holpostel.46.t:0 "VNH National Landdag 1937"
holpostel.46.d:0 "As expected the VNH national landdag in the Utrechtse Jaarbeurs went ahead today. First VNH leader Swart held a little inspiring cliché-speech about how much the movement had grown since he joined, but the truly interesting part came after that. Deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming the VNH's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while also curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the CNA in favour of the VNH."
holpostel.46.a:0 "I'm glad it's over."

holpostel.47.t:0 "VNH Landdag in Nijmegen?"
holpostel.47.d:0 "After their permit for a rally in Utrecht was revoked, the VNH leadership has now asked the municipality of Nijmegen to allow a rally in the open air. Nijmegen is much more remote than Utrecht, and so it will probably attract far fewer visitors."
holpostel.47.a:0 "Alright then!"
holpostel.47.b:0 "No, thank you."

holpostel.48.t:0 "VNH National Landdag 1937"
holpostel.48.d:0 "Though expected to take place in Utrecht, the VNH national landdag went ahead in Nijmegen today. First VNH leader Swart held a little convincing speech condemning the municipal authorities in Utrecht for revoking the permit to rally in the jaarbeurs there. After that, the interesting part came, when deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming VNH's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the CNA in favour of the VNH, although the new location of the landdag is probably less ideal for attracting new members."
holpostel.48.a:0 "I'm glad it's over."

holpostel.49.t:0 "VNH Landdag in Antwerpen?"
holpostel.49.d:0 "The Dutch far-right party VNH is requesting the right to hold a rally in Antwerpen. Apparently their permit to hold a rally was revoked in the Netherlands itself and attempts to choose a different location or time also failed, with the help of their hostile government. Now they are asking us if they may hold the landdag in Antwerpen, outside the authority of the Dutch government, so that they can in fact hold their landdag."
holpostel.49.a:0 "Flanders-Wallonia welcomes you!"
holpostel.49.b:0 "Surely their permit was revoked for a reason!"

holpostel.50.t:0 "VNH National Landdag 1937"
holpostel.50.d:0 "Though expected to take place in Utrecht, the VNH national landdag went ahead in Antwerpen today. First VNH leader Swart held a little convincing speech condemning us for trying to stop their landdag. After that, the interesting part came, when deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming VNH's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the CNA in favour of the VNH, although most would-be new members probably won't like having to go to Flanders-Wallonia to attend the rally."
holpostel.50.a:0 "I'm glad it's over."

holpostel.51.t:0 "VNH National Landdag Cancelled"
holpostel.51.d:0 "Following the failure to find a location to hold the landdag, the VNH leadership has declared the cancellation of the annual landdag of 1937 and condemned us for being the primary cause for it. They also said that they won't let themselves be muzzled and that the landdag of 1938 will be held properly prepared to deal with another so-called cowardly attempt by the government to stop them."
holpostel.51.a:0 "Take that, populists!"

holpostel.52.t:0 "VNH Demonstration during Prinsjesdag"
holpostel.52.d:0 "Prinsjesdag is the day the Dutch government publicises its plans for spending for the next year: the Queen will read out the annual plans of the government and it is usually a festive affair, however this year the VNH has started a demonstration along the road where the Queen will pass, flying their black flags, beating up alleged syndicalists and using their party greeting 'houzee' towards Cornelis van Geelkerken, deputy leader of the VNH, who is present. The mayor of The Hague wants to let the police break up the demonstration as he fears it would pose a threat to public order and the safety of the royal family. On the other hand, the VNH-opposition in the municipal council of The Hague says this is an essential part of freedom of speech and asserts that the VNH will not attack the Royal family."
holpostel.52.a:0 "Remove them."
holpostel.52.b:0 "Let them hold their silly little protest."

holpostel.53.t:0 "Nationaal Herstel Expands"
holpostel.53.d:0 "The far-right newspaper 'Nationaal Herstel', closely affiliated with the VNH, has recruited two high-profile reporters today. Some consider this a threat as it will likely broaden the appeal of the newspaper that spreads unconventional ideas and is in fact a propaganda tool for the VNH and the far right in general. Purely legally speaking however, there is no real basis to ban the paper, as it would be both contrary to freedom of the press and freedom of speech, two values that normally are respected within our country."
holpostel.53.a:0 "Just ban it already."
holpostel.53.b:0 "Leave them alone."

holpostel.54.t:0 "Landwacht Breaks Strike"
holpostel.54.d:0 "The Landwacht has broken a local strike today, resulting in an excellent photo-opportunity with the company's employers stemming from the Landwacht's, and by extension the VNH's, willingness to act where the government didn't want to do so. Some are calling for a response against this action saying that the strike was justified, that the government didn't put it down for a reason and that the Landwacht had no right to do it in the government's place."
holpostel.54.a:0 "Sanctions will be in order."
holpostel.54.b:0 "It's only good when strikes are broken."

holpostel.55.t:0 "Landwacht and Red Front clash"
holpostel.55.d:0 "The Landwacht and the National Red Front are clashing today in Haarlem, resulting in a large riot, many casualties as well as large damage to public and private property. The police are ready to intervene, but in governmental circles there is uncertainty as to who should be targeted. Some say that the Red Front counter-demonstration was a direct attack on the pro-VNH demonstrators, so only Red Front members should be arrested. Others however say that the VNHers should not have immediately have picked a fight with their long sticks when they spotted the Red Front counter-movement."
holpostel.55.a:0 "Only arrest syndicalists."
holpostel.55.b:0 "Objectively arrest everyone who caused trouble."
holpostel.55.c:0 "Only arrest populists."

holpostel.56.t:0 "Nationale Jeugdstorm"
holpostel.56.d:0 "The VNH has today announced the founding of the nationale jeugdstorm. It is in effect a scouting organisation, but it appears to be seen by VNH leadership as a way to expand on the growing appeal the VNH has on the younger generation and to set up an ideological base among those that are at this point in time too young to vote but who will attain that age within the coming years."
holpostel.56.a:0 "Dangerous, ban the institution!"
holpostel.56.b:0 "An initiative that only should be applauded!"

holpostel.57.t:0 "Military voices support for the VNH"
holpostel.57.d:0 "Several high ranking officers have today publicly voiced their support for the VNH, in particular the more moderate part represented by Henri Swart. They released a manifesto detailing their reasoning behind this move that details how they feel misrepresented by the democratic government and how the government is unwilling to truly serve Dutch interests. This is a sign that VNH support may be greater than previously expected. While these are only officers it is probable that this sentiment is present amongst the common soldiery as well, and so some officials have proposed measures to limit VNH presence in the military."
holpostel.57.a:0 "Institute those measures."
holpostel.57.b:0 "The military has always been a nationalist institution."

holpostel.58.t:0 "March on The Hague"
holpostel.58.d:0 "Tensions have been brewing for some time already, and the VNH was already gaining increasing influence and popularity over the last few months, but today it all spilled over: a huge crowd in Landwacht uniforms gathered in Rotterdam and they collectively marched on The Hague, the seat of government.\nSeeing the huge crowd, and recognising that a civil war would be unavoidable in the event of resistance, the prime minister capitulated and accepted all of the VNH crowd's demands: cabinet would become demissionary, and the VNH would set up an extra-parliamentary cabinet which would be given emergency powers. A few hours later, and Dutch democracy was gone."
holpostel.58.a:0 "We will make the Netherlands great again!"

holpostel.59.t:0 "The Velvet Revolution"
holpostel.59.d:0 "The Dutch far left had been gaining unprecedented momentum in recent months: record high membership records, influence in all layers of society and a growing feeling among the general populace that the current government is illegitimate. Today it all changed as nationwide, people went onto the streets, openly calling for the resignation of the government and for the establishment of a syndicalist state. Soon after, the petty bourgeois saw that they would never be able to crush the popular revolution and are crossing the border as we speak. The people have won today!"
holpostel.59.a:0 "Set up a provisionary government."

holpostel.60.t:0 "CNA Schism"
holpostel.60.d:0 "What many had already foreseen became reality today as a group of Catholic MPs announced that they would henceforth form the New NRKSP, or New Roman Catholic State Party, faction - the CNA quickly fell apart.\n\nBefore the confessional parties united the Catholics had always had the most loyal base, and therefore the most seats - yet in the CNA the Protestants, the smaller party in the union, were somewhat controversially calling all the shots, as per the statement.\n\nWhile a number of Protestant denominations and several important loyalist Catholics have announced that they will continue the CNA project, it is clear that the CNA has lost her already marginal absolute majority, and without it we will need to compromise with opposition parties per-issue."
holpostel.60.a:0 "Maybe it was too good to be true from the start."

holpostel.61.t:0 "Elections of 1938"
holpostel.61.d:0 "As a result of the schism in the CNA, elections are being held barely a year after the last elections. A harsh three months of campaigning are now behind us and it is time to count the votes; this will clearly be a referendum on CNA leadership; on whether Catholics will abandon them in favour of the NRKSP, and whether the CNA base will still hold this time."
holpostel.61.a:0 "The RSAP sweeps the elections."
holpostel.61.b:0 "The SDAP becomes the largest party."
holpostel.61.c:0 "The CNA loses but remains the largest party."
holpostel.61.e:0 "The CNA base defects to the VNH."

holpostel.62.t:0 "SDAP Forms New Government"
holpostel.62.d:0 "The SDAP has become the largest party in the elections. After days of celebration it will soon be time to form a new government. We do not have an absolute majority like the CNA had last year, so we will have to form our cabinet with other parties and act as part of a coalition. Time is short however, as the humbled CNA is seeking to negotiate with a wide range of figures in an effort to create a reactionary front against us."
holpostel.62.a:0 "A purple cabinet with the LSP and VDB."
holpostel.62.b:0 "A Roman-Red cabinet with the NRKSP."
holpostel.62.c:0 "A centre-left cabinet with the RSAP and VDB."
holpostel.62.e:0 "The CNA assembles a rainbow cabinet to oppose us."

holpostel.63.t:0 "Wilhelmina's Demands"
holpostel.63.d:0 "Queen Wilhelmina is only willing to allow this coalition to form if the more moderate VDB get the prime minister post. This would reduce us to a junior partner despite us being the largest party in the coalition."
holpostel.63.a:0 "Accept the demands."
holpostel.63.b:0 "She'll just have to deal with our success."

holpostel.64.t:0 "Wilhelmina Abdicates"
holpostel.64.d:0 "Following our unwillingness to cave in to her demands, the Queen has decided that she will not be Queen in an SDAP-ruled country, and as such she has decided to abdicate. We can allow Princess Juliana to be crowned, but the RSAP and the more radical side of the SDAP are clamouring to exploit this opportunity to institute a republic while we still have momentum on our side. The moderates in the SDAP and the VDB favour Juliana however."
holpostel.64.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
holpostel.64.b:0 "Long live Queen Juliana!"

holpostel.65.t:0 "CNA Forms New Government"
holpostel.65.d:0 "Despite the treachery of the Catholics, we once again became the largest party in parliament. Contrary to last year however, we do not have an absolute majority meaning that we will need to compromise with some people in order to form a new government."
holpostel.65.a:0 "Staphorster variant: With the LSP, NRKSP and SGP parliamentary support."
holpostel.65.b:0 "A right-wing government with the VNH."
holpostel.65.c:0 "A centre-right government with the LSP, NRKSP and VDB."

holpostel.66.t:0 "CNA Schism"
holpostel.66.d:0 "What many had already foreseen became reality today as a group of Catholic MPs announced that they would henceforth form the New NRKSP, or New Roman Catholic State Party, faction - the CNA quickly fell apart.\n\nBefore the confessional parties united the Catholics had always had the most loyal base, and therefore the most seats - yet in the CNA the Protestants, the smaller party in the union, were somewhat controversially calling all the shots, as per the statement.\n\nLuckily, many Protestants of multiple denominations as well as several high ranking Catholics have expressed their support for continuing the CNA, meaning that the cabinet can, thanks to our coalition with others, continue to rule."
holpostel.66.a:0 "It could have been worse."

holpostel.67.t:0 "CNA Collapses"
holpostel.67.d:0 "The CNA electoral pact was originally created to win victory in the 1937 elections, and once it failed in that goal its continued survival became increasingly precarious. Today matters came to a head as the Catholics announced their withdrawal from the pact and determination to refound their RKSP party. Shortly thereafter, former CHU members announced that they too would leave the unstable union and thus, with no alliance anymore, the ARP has returned as well. So much for united confessional politics."
holpostel.67.a:0 "Conservative politics is splintered again."

holpostel.68.t:0 "Formation of the Labour Party"
holpostel.68.d:0 "After the 1937 victory through their 'Lijst Links', the SDAP and VDB started flirting with the idea of permanently uniting the parties into one 'Party of Labour' or 'Partij van de Arbeid' in Dutch.\nBy late 1941, after almost completing a successful term of coalition rule in governing the country, both the annual landdag of the SDAP and that of the VDB elected to dissolve partisan differences and found this party, with the former doing it very quietly to avoid angering more leftist members. This has resulted in the creation of a progressive juggernaut that could be a dominant force in Dutch politics for the rest of the century."
holpostel.68.a:0 "We're the PvdA now!"

holpostel.69.t:0 "Committee Oud"
holpostel.69.d:0 "While for the SDAP the merger was far less painless, there was certainly a lot more friction caused within the VDB. At first the right-wing of the VDB saw it out, but now after two months the current prime minister Oud has formed 'Committee Oud' with other former VDB members who feel that the PvdA has been kowtowing far too much towards social democratic views. Committee Oud has successfully negotiated a merger with the market liberal LSP, to form a more conservative liberal party that could also be a force to be reckoned with in post-Weltkrieg Dutch politics. All that is left is how the party should be named."
holpostel.69.a:0 "Partij van de Vrijheid, or 'Freedom Party'."
holpostel.69.b:0 "... sounds too much like a futuristic populist party."

holpostel.70.t:0 "Elections of 1941"
holpostel.70.d:0 "After four years of leftwing rule, it is once again time to go to the ballot box. Contention is high, as each party seeks to take the plurality in hopes of gaining the key role in the formation: the question shall be whether the populace thinks things have improved since 1937 and who is responsible for that fact."
holpostel.70.a:0 "The [hol_socdems_variable_party_name] takes an absolute majority."
holpostel.70.b:0 "The [hol_socdems_variable_party_name] is the largest party but lacks a majority."
holpostel.70.pvdv:0 "The PvdV is the largest party but lacks a majority."
holpostel.70.vvd:0 "The VVD is the largest party but lacks a majority."
holpostel.70.e:0 "The ARP, RKSP and CHU seize a key role."
holpostel.70.f:0 "The VNH becomes the largest but lacks a majority."

holpostel.71.t:0 "PvdA Forms 1941 Government"
holpostel.71.d:0 "The people apparently were very happy with our progress, and having received a comfortable majority in parliament we do not even need to consider forming a coalition with other parties.\nOf course we cannot help but laugh a bit at Pieter Oud and his committee who would've probably led his second cabinet had he not abandoned us; now he and his liberals are banished to the opposition, like all other non-PvdA parties."
holpostel.71.a:0 "What does he have now? Nine seats?"

holpostel.72.t:0 "PvdA Forms 1941 Government"
holpostel.72.d:0 "We have won the elections, and while it is clearly not enough to attain an absolute majority and to rule by ourselves, it is still more than enough for us to get the initiative in the formation. Several options are available, and it is up to us to decide who we'd prefer as our new partner"
holpostel.72.a:0 "Purple with the PvdV."
holpostel.72.b:0 "Purple with the VV.D."

holpostel.73.t.vvd:0 "VVD Forms 1941 Government"
holpostel.73.d:0 "Prime minister Oud managed to make excellent use of the premiersbonus, and coupled with a series of fresh liberal policies, we have managed to attract the most votes compared to all other parties in the Netherlands in our first general election. While obviously not enough seats were won to rule the country by ourselves, we have won the initiative in the formation negotiations, and so we may see who we'd like best as our partner."
holpostel.73.a:0 "Purple with the PvdA."
holpostel.73.b:0 "Conservative Liberalism with the CHU and Catholics."
holpostel.73.c:0 "Stikkercoalitie: ARP with VNH outside support."

holpostel.74.t:0 "Conservatives Form 1941 Government"
holpostel.74.d:0 "Even though the CNA project failed, we still managed to attract the most votes when combined. This means that we are in a good position to influence the formation, probably with the ability to have at least one of our parties deliver the prime minister. We'll just need to wait out the proposals of the other parties."
holpostel.74.a:0 "CHU rules with Oud's liberals, the RKSP and ARP."
holpostel.74.b:0 "ARP rules with Oud's liberals and Drees' Social Democrats."
holpostel.74.c:0 "CHU rules with the PvdA, RKSP and ARP."
holpostel.74.e:0 "ARP rules with the VNH, CHU and RKSP."

holpostel.75.t:0 "Progressives Flock to the LSP"
holpostel.75.d:0 "Following the government-induced red scare, every left-wing organisation politically left of the LSP has been discredited and has since either disbanded or been banned. As a result progressives instead flocked towards the conservative-liberal LSP, which was seen as 'the least bad' resulting in both a subtle yet decisive shift to the left yet also and a breath of life into a party that had been in an impasse since the first Weltkrieg."
holpostel.75.a:0 "Fascinating."

holpostel.76.t:0 "Elections of 1941"
holpostel.76.d:0 "Colijn has done it again: completing yet another term with the cabinet he formed in 1937. Now it is once again election time, and the question on everyone's mind in The Hague right now is whether the people feel he has used his time well or whether a different approach is in order."
holpostel.76.a:0 "Colijn takes once again an absolute majority."
holpostel.76.b:0 "CNA becomes the largest but without a majority."
holpostel.76.c:0 "LSP becomes the largest but without a majority."
holpostel.76.e:0 "SDAP becomes the largest but without a majority."
holpostel.76.f:0 "VNH becomes the largest but without a majority."
holpostel.76.g:0 "RSAP becomes the largest but without a majority."

holpostel.77.t:0 "CNA Forms 1941 Government with Increased Majority"
holpostel.77.d:0 "Beyond all of our greatest hopes, our party managed to seize more than fifty seats in parliament. Colijn has announced that he will retire and Louis Beel will form the next government and he has a comfortable majority at hand in parliament to push through his policies."
holpostel.77.a:0 "Continue working with the liberals."
holpostel.77.b:0 "So we rule one!"

holpostel.78.t:0 "CNA Forms 1941 Government with Reduced Majority"
holpostel.78.d:0 "While we have been unable to secure the absolute majority like in 1937, we're still the largest party in parliament by a noticeable margin. As such, we get the initiative in the formation of a new government, which will be the first task of Louis Beel as the new leader of the CNA after Colijn's retirement."
holpostel.78.a:0 "The LSP represents a reliable partner."
holpostel.78.b:0 "The SDAP is less radical and therefore viable now."
holpostel.78.c:0 "The VNH agrees with us on key points."

holpostel.79.t:0 "LSP Forms 1941 Government"
holpostel.79.d:0 "After the red scare, it was obvious that we were on the receiving end of a lot of former left-wingers - as could be seen during this year's annual party congress, where a lot of left-wing policies were chosen by a group of new members. It apparently did boost our party however. With the progressive Dutch population pulling their electoral weight with us we went, within a single term, from a party close to falling below the minimum voting threshold to the largest party in parliament."
holpostel.79.a:0 "Now we shall govern with the CNA."
holpostel.79.b:0 "Now we shall govern with the VNH."

holpostel.80.t:0 "SDAP Forms 1941 Government"
holpostel.80.d:0 "After posing as more moderate electoral force, and perhaps thanks to the fresh campaign by our new leader Willem Drees, the SDAP has managed to account the most votes and has therefore got the initiative in the formation of the new government. Rumour has it that former leader Albarda will be appointed 'informateur' on the request of the SDAP leadership."
holpostel.80.a:0 "Purple with the LSP and VDB."
holpostel.80.b:0 "Roman-Red with the RKSP."
holpostel.80.c:0 "Deep-Red with the RSAP."

holpostel.81.t:0 "Elections in 1941?"
holpostel.81.d:0 "The mandate of our coalition government is about to expire and technically we should hold elections in a few months. Many within the VNH are arguing over whether we should do this: within the VNH, the stability argument is consistently raised, and many believe that elections should therefore be suspended. On the other hand holding the elections could also strengthen the VNH's grasp on power. In the CNA, holding elections is seen as something that should be nurtured, if guided. If the elections are not suspended, the chance that they will move through fairly is still highly unlikely."
holpostel.81.a:0 "Suspend the elections."
holpostel.81.b:0 "Just hold the elections."

holpostel.82.t:0 "Elections of 1941"
holpostel.82.d:0 "After four years of Henri Swart as prime minister elections are due to be held once again, even if cynics are pointing out obviously imaginary flaws in the democratic process - some dissidents are even suggesting that the VNH has been using election fraud as a tool."
holpostel.82.a:0 "The VNH takes an absolute majority."
holpostel.82.b:0 "The VNH becomes the largest."

holpostel.83.t:0 "VNH Forms 1941 Government"
holpostel.83.d:0 "Though the process may have been guided to prevent the populace from making the wrong choice, we have soundly won the elections and will take over half of the seats of the house of representatives. Noone in the VNH is even considering taking aboard a coalition partner."
holpostel.83.a:0 "The VNH rules alone, forever..."

holpostel.84.t:0 "VNH Forms 1941 Government"
holpostel.84.d:0 "The same results as last time have come in - interestingly popular opinion has hardly shifted in four long years. Either way, the same choice stands as last time - we can intimidate the house of representatives for the votes needed to give us emergency powers, or we could just continue cabinet Swart I with the CNA."
holpostel.84.a:0 "Work with the CNA."
holpostel.84.b:0 "Have the Landwacht visit the house of reps."

holpostel.85.t:0 "[GetYear] Pensionary Elections"
holpostel.85.d:0 "Election time has come, and every Dutchman may vote today who their council pensionary shall be. The SDAP is the only party to nominate a pensionary candidate on their own: meanwhile the liberals have nominated a candidate together and the ARP and CHU do not contend, instead urging voters to vote in the RKSP candidate instead as they know they do not stand a chance alone either way and would prefer a conservative pensionary over a progressive one."
holpostel.85.a:0 "SDAP's Adriaan Gerhard."
holpostel.85.b:0 "LSP/VDB's Cornelis Lodewijk van der Bilt."
holpostel.85.c:0 "LSP/VDB's Roelof Kranenburg."
holpostel.85.e:0 "RKSP's Carel Goseling."

holpostel.86.t:0 "Nacht van de Dooie Rooie Ratten"
holpostel.86.d:0 "The red filth hit us hard in the heart of our power, by burning down the Binnenhof. And they know what will come next: unless we act fast, they'll band together in the north to start a revolt in the hope of wearing down our regime. Hoping to avoid such an occasion, Van Geelkerken has ordered the Landwacht to get as many reds in custody as possible before they seize an opportunity to arm themselves, leading to resistance necessitating major violence. This night will go down in Dutch history as the 'night of dead red rats' as Van Geelkerken has aptly named it."
holpostel.86.a:0 "If you can't find someone, bring in their entire family!"
holpostel.86.b:0 "Surely this is unnecessary..."

holpostel.87.t:0 "Daniel Goulooze Arrested"
holpostel.87.d:0 "Our massive round-ups have resulted, aside from the capturing of less important leftists, in the high-profile arrest of Daniel Goulooze, a senior member of the syndicalist 'National Labour Secretariat'. The Landwacht brought him to a makeshift prison camp in the politically charged ruins of the Binnenhof, the question is what we shall do with him."
holpostel.87.a:0 "Move him to the actual prison in Vught."
holpostel.87.b:0 "Interrogate him here!"

holpostel.88.t:0 "Goulooze's Prison Convoy Was Ambushed"
holpostel.88.d:0 "Syndicalist partisans have ambushed the prison convoy carrying the high-profile prisoner Goulooze. Now we may be certain that the syndicalists will revolt as they have now publicly committed a major crime which will force them to openly rebel."
holpostel.88.a:0 "We should have kept him in The Hague."

holpostel.89.t:0 "Harm Kolthek Located"
holpostel.89.d:0 "Despite his initial resistance to the idea, some special tools convinced Goulooze to share the location of his boss, NAS-leader Harm Kolthek, with us. Apparently he hides in a diplomatic neighbourhood in The Hague. Deputy-leader Cornelis van Geelkerken is personally accompanying the Landwachters sent to bring him in."
holpostel.89.a:0 "Praise Kees for his bravery!"

holpostel.90.t:0 "Dutch Syndicalist Seeks Refuge"
holpostel.90.d:0 "The legislative building in the Netherlands was attacked a few days ago by a terrorist. Blaming the syndicalists for the endeavour, the Dutch authorities and their paramilitary supporters have started rounding up syndicalists all over the country. Now Harm Kolthek, the leader of the Dutch syndicalists, is being pursued by angry paramilitaries and he is requesting refuge in our embassy. There is a good chance that he will be killed if we do not assist him."
holpostel.90.a:0 "We'll protect him."
holpostel.90.b:0 "Leave him out in the open."

holpostel.91.t:0 "Kolthek in the Mexican Embassy"
holpostel.91.d:0 "After having knocked open the door of the villa where Kolthek was hiding, the Landwacht was just in time to see Kolthek escaping. Conveniently for the syndicalist, the villa was just a few hundred metres from the Mexican embassy, the only country with ties to syndicalism that has a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands. Sadly, the Mexican ambassador decided that Kolthek could have his refuge, which means that according to international law, we cannot get him. The Landwacht is not officially part of the Dutch government however, and so Van Geelkerken has a choice."
holpostel.91.a:0 "Embassies are inviolable."
holpostel.91.b:0 "We have to get Kolthek at all costs!"

holpostel.92.t:0 "Kolthek Announces Revolt Support"
holpostel.92.d:0 "From inside the Mexican embassy, Kolthek has announced that the reds grouping together in the north should proceed with their rebellion so that he and Daan may soon be free again. It seems that our attempt at avoiding open rebellion has failed."
holpostel.92.a:0 "Thanks Mexico..."

holpostel.93.t:0 "Dutch Embassy Raided!"
holpostel.93.d:0 "After seeing us granting refuge to Kolthek the Dutch 'Landwacht' paramilitary organisation decided to assault our embassy. According to early reports, they completely trashed the building and multiple members of our diplomatic mission have been wounded. Shockingly they've even kidnapped our ambassador, supposedly to hand him over to the police for helping a fugitive. While at least he was released by the Dutch police immediately, this violation is completely outrageous!"
holpostel.93.a:0 "48 hours to leave the country, Dutch ambassador!"

holpostel.94.t:0 "Mexican Embassy Raided"
holpostel.94.d:0 "The Landwacht simply assaulted the Mexican embassy upon finding out that they granted refuge to Kolthek, wounding several Mexican members of the mission in the process as well as extracting Kolthek and assuring the partial destruction of the embassy. They also, somewhat scandalously, handed the Mexican ambassador over to the police, claiming he 'was helping a fugitive'. We've released him at once, seeking to distance ourselves from this controversial deed by the Landwacht.\nIn any case, having successfully arrested Kolthek makes it unlikely that the moderate Sneevliet and radical Wijnkoop will be capable of working together in a revolt. Our sources already state that they are currently taking over a coastguard vessel to sail to the syndicalist sphere while the Red Front and moderates began to engage in brutal infighting."
holpostel.94.a:0 "The Mexicans still won't be pleased."

holpostel.95.t:0 "Kolthek Arrested"
holpostel.95.d:0 "After having knocked down the door of the villa where Kolthek was hiding, the Landwacht was just in time to see Kolthek escaping. Conveniently for the syndicalist, the villa was just one block away from the Mexican embassy, the only country with ties to syndicalism that has a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands. Sadly for Kolthek, they didn't want to grant him refuge, and as such the Landwacht arrested him. Now it seems highly unlikely that any leftist revolt in the short term will succeed, as moderate Sneevliet and radical Wijnkoop do not get along so well and the orthodox syndicalists were a binding factor. Our intelligence has suggested that both are now fleeing Groningen by boat into exile as the Red Front and moderates descend into acrimony."
holpostel.95.a:0 "Good!"

holpostel.96.t:0 "Leftist Revolt"
holpostel.96.d:0 "As had been feared, the leftists have taken control of the streets of Groningen, and soon other cities in Friesland, Drenthe and Groningen province followed suit. The rebels have armed themselves and are harboured by a population that supports their efforts to overthrow the government. Unrest is growing in the rest of the country too, and some in the government are saying that it would be wise to set up a government in exile ready to restore rightful Dutch rule in case of collapse. Others, like Queen Wilhelmina, would rather see us try to quash the rebellion with force."
holpostel.96.a:0 "The cowardly populist-capitalists flee the mainland."
holpostel.96.b:0 "We will crush this rebellion."

holpostel.97.t:0 "Independence of Indonesia"
holpostel.97.d:0 "The Independence of the Dutch East Indies has always been a longstanding promise of the Dutch syndicalist scene, therefore it is hardly surprising that one of the first acts of the National Assembly has been to declare the independence of the colony. The question is how loose should our continuing relationship with Indonesia be?"
holpostel.97.a:0 "Release it as a puppet."
holpostel.97.b:0 "Grant them complete independence."

holpostel.98.t:0 "Socialist Putsch"
holpostel.98.d:0 "During recent times the revolutionary socialists have been gaining momentum at an alarming rate and today the ticking timebomb exploded as what started as a small military mutiny in the Peel engulfed the entire country like a wildfire. Within a few hours, redshirts had seized control of all major cities and the old plutocratic government evacuated the country, seemingly preparing a government in exile in the East Indies. At home, the syndicalists have formed a provisional revolutionary committee, to take over administrative responsibilities until a proper government has been formed."
holpostel.98.a:0 "Breek uw ketens!"

holpostel.99.t:0 "March on The Hague"
holpostel.99.d:0 "While it had already caught the attention of the political elite, the once small VNH party has recently expanded its influence at a rapid pace across the country. Today, in a giant demonstration, thousands of members of the party marched on the Binnenhof. The numbers involved were substantial, and realising that refusing their demands would lead to a bloody civil war, our government was forced to step down. A new order has risen under the VNH, and now their grip on power has been solidified."
holpostel.99.a:0 "We shall make the Netherlands stable again!"

holpostel.100.t:0 "Military Putsch"
holpostel.100.d:0 "While the government has until now been sufficiently capable of keeping the VNH and socialists under control, it has been at dear cost. Street fights are happening daily across the country, and as police is unable to restore order, the military frequently needs to be deployed. Today, Reijnders, supreme commander of the Dutch armed forces, demanded that the government declare a state of emergency. The government has complied, and factual power now lies with Reijnders, rather than the old government."
holpostel.100.a:0 "Aye-aye sir!"

holpostel.101.t:0 "Provisional Revolutionary Committee"
holpostel.101.d:0 "We have ended the liberal parliamentary system that the Netherlands has laboured under for decades, and now we need to lay out the basis for our new socialist state. We will need to propose a new constitutional body that is truly fairly elected by the people without parties in the pockets of the capitalists. To organise all this, we shall form a provisional revolutionary committee, until a new National Assembly is properly elected."

holpostel.102.d:0 "Election day has finally come, by decree of the junta. Soon after this, the military will restore control to the States-General and the Netherlands shall then once again have a civilian government.

holpostel.104.t:0 "Confessionals Form [GetYear] Government"
holpostel.104.d:0 "The election results are in, and it seems that the conservatives have won. The Catholic RKSP is the largest and the smaller Protestant parties won a decent amount of seats as well. The question is now whether or not they work together in the old fashion, or will the RKSP claim the 'Torentje' for themselves by working with the social democrats, as the Protestants would not put up with a Catholic prime minister otherwise."

holpostel.106.d:0 "Election day has come again, and after a campaigning for several months the politicians are awaiting the exit polls anxiously.

holpostel.112.b:0 "Thus we rule one!"

holpostel.113.t:0 "CNA Forms [GetYear] Government with Reduced Majority"
holpostel.113.d:0 "While we have been unable to secure the absolute majority like in earlier times, we're still the largest party in parliament by a noticeable margin. As such, we get the initiative in the formation, which will be the first task of Louis Beel as the leader of the CNA."
holpostel.113.a:0 "The LSP poses a reliable partner."
holpostel.113.b:0 "The SDAP is less radical and therefore viable now."
holpostel.113.c:0 "The VNH agrees with us on key points."

holpostel.114.t:0 "LSP Forms [GetYear] Government"
holpostel.114.d:0 "The LSP has secured the plurality of seats by a noticeable margin, and as such we will now get the initiative in the formation of a government. The question that rests is whether we can agree with the CNA on the formation of a government or with the VNH."
holpostel.114.a:0 "Now we shall govern with the CNA."
holpostel.114.b:0 "Now we shall govern with the VNH."

holpostel.115.t:0 "SDAP Forms [GetYear] Government"
holpostel.115.d:0 "We have secured the plurality of seats and now time has come to do something with it. As we lack an outright majority we will have to compromise: we could work with the liberals, or with the Catholics, or we could go for a full socialist government and work with the RSAP."
holpostel.115.a:0 "Purple with the LSP and VDB."
holpostel.115.b:0 "Roman-Red with the RKSP."
holpostel.115.c:0 "Deep-Red with the RSAP."

holpostel.117.t:0 "Second Prussian Intervention"
holpostel.117.d:0 "Syndicalists have taken over the Netherlands, exposing a vulnerable flank through which the Ruhr area, our primary industrial centre can be hit. Military hotheads are proposing that we invade right now, while they still lack international recognition, but the Dutch, or Batavians as they call themselves now, are surely dug in having expected this move already. Others propose that we send agents to undermine the new regime's stability, which could be a more subtle way of securing their loyalty. The third possibility is to just let them lie, at the current they seem unsupported by the International and even if they would join that alliance, what harm can the Netherlands do?"
holpostel.117.a:0 "Send the agents!"
holpostel.117.b:0 "Send the soldiers!"
holpostel.117.c:0 "Send the border guards!"

holpostel.118.t:0 "The Prussians Intervene once more!"
holpostel.118.d:0 "Just like in 1787, when the Dutch republic was overtaken by revolutionaries who ousted the Dutch republic, the reactionaries from the east have come to put the Dutch people back in chains. Not again is our creed! We shall fight for our future as any proud people would!\nUp with Batavian virgin and down with the 'mof'!"
holpostel.118.a:0 "Eerst was hier de Pruis in 't land..."

holpostel.119.t:0 "German Destabilisation efforts"
holpostel.119.d:0 "The kaiser has noticed the takeover of our righteous government and chose to send agents destabilizing our regime. Even if this makes our government a bit more secure for now, it still hurts, as these people are clearly having a harmful effect on our grip over the situation."
holpostel.119.a:0 "Ze zullen ons niet krijgen!"

holpostel.122.t:0 "The Question of Surinamese Independence"
holpostel.122.d:0 "With the ascension of the worker's state in the Netherlands, the situation of Dutch Guyana, also known as Suriname, is becoming an embarassing affair: it does not fit a modern worker's nation to maintain an archaic testament of imperialism. While there does not seem to be a very extensive independence movement in the region, likely due to the lacking development of the area, proposals have been pitched to send the exiled independence activist Anton de Kom back to Paramaribo to establish a socialist republic in Suriname."
holpostel.122.a:0 "Suriname deserves its independence"
holpostel.122.b:0 "Isn't it more imperialistic to force their independence?!"

### Shitty things happening - tumbling down ###
holgen.5.t:0 "Syndicalists Strike"
holgen.5.d:0 "Syndicalist trade unions have called a strike against one of our major companies.\nIf we do not act the company in question will be forced to offer concessions to its workers which will surely strengthen the syndicalist cause and incentivise other unions to do the same."
holgen.5.a:0 "The boys in the blue will end this problem!"
holgen.5.b:0 "Negotiation always trumps violence."

holgen.6.t:0 "Landwacht Attacks Socialist Newspaper"
holgen.6.d:0 "The Landwacht is currently raiding the office of an RSAP party propaganda headquarters in one of our cities. While we obviously do not agree with what is written there, the violence is completely out of bounds and is attracting other anti-syndicalists to the VNH."
holgen.6.a:0 "Intervene, freedom of speech everyone!"
holgen.6.b:0 "Let them have their fun!"

holgen.7.t:0 "Syndicalist Mutiny"
holgen.7.d:0 "Following a dispute about their salaries, soldiers in one of our army camps have mutinied in protest at the calling up of syndicalists. If we do not suppress this motion with force it will result in increasing influence by the syndicalists."
holgen.7.a:0 "Siege the base and arrest everyone!"
holgen.7.b:0 "Negotiate with the mutineers."

holgen.8.t:0 "Landwacht Assassinates a Mayor"
holgen.8.d:0 "The Landwacht has been found to have murdered the mayor of one of our rural municipalities because he was allegedly too soft on syndicalism and now they refuse to give us the perpetrators. If we fail to set an example on this, it will probably not be the last time."
holgen.8.a:0 "Arrest everyone who obstructs the arrests!"
holgen.8.b:0 "They can't be forced to cooperate."

holgen.9.t:0 "Red Front Attacks a Post Office"
holgen.9.d:0 "The Red Front has caused great upset by attacking a post office in one of our major cities, brutalising its workers and burning vast quanities of letters - including government mail. If we do not crack down on this hard, the potential for future seditious activity should not be ruled out."
holgen.9.a:0 "Send in the police!"
holgen.9.b:0 "This isn't worth spending extra resources on."

holgen.10.t:0 "VNH Opens New Local HQ"
holgen.10.d:0 "The VNH has opened a new party headquarters in one of our cities, which they intend to use in order to spread their ideas and bolster local party forces. We have found intelligence on illegal activities however, thus we can raid the headquarters to find more information."
holgen.10.a:0 "Raid it!"
holgen.10.b:0 "Let them be."

holgen.11.t:0 "RSAP Gathering"
holgen.11.d:0 "The RSAP is holding a large rally in one of our cities. The protesters are not seemingly violent, but such action does inspire other leftists to join their cause. Stopping it might mean that it may end up turing violent, however."
holgen.11.a:0 "Stop the rally!"
holgen.11.b:0 "Let it run its course."

holgen.12.t:0 "Red Front Expands"
holgen.12.d:0 "As a result of our choice to prematurely abort the RSAP rally, we have seen a rise in support to the patriot movement. It seems that disgruntled leftists are being increasingly radicalised due to our actions."
holgen.12.a:0 "Damn!"

holgen.13.t:0 "VNH Rally"
holgen.13.d:0 "One of our major towns is going to be site of a major VNH event, where a number of activists and nationalist supporters will wave the Dutch flag and sing the national anthem. While we should not assume that such a gathering will get a violent, letting it proceed might inspire others to join the nationalists. Stopping it could backfire on us however."
holgen.13.a:0 "End this charade."
holgen.13.b:0 "It would be foolish to interfere."

holgen.14.t:0 "Anarchist Bombing"
holgen.14.d:0 "An anarchist has set off a bomb in the seat of the local government in one of our cities. We are currently still looking for survivors among the rubble, but it appears that the casualties from this will no doubt be politically toxic to our government."
holgen.14.a:0 "Damn it!"

holgen.15.t:0 "Shooting at Party Rally"
holgen.15.d:0 "A VNH-affiliated person has taken his gun and started shooting at a crowd of socialdemocrats at a party rally. Police managed to arrest the shooter, but there have been multiple deaths and another group of people are seriously wounded."
holgen.15.a:0 "Resquiescat in Pace."

holgen.16.t:0 "Syndicalist Speech"
holgen.16.d:0 "A high-profile member of the NAS has held a rousing speech at a manifestation at a syndicalist-organised minor strike. As a result, we are seeing a spike in new NAS membership in the area."
holgen.16.a:0 "Eh, well..."

holgen.17.t:0 "Strong Debate Performance"
holgen.17.d:0 "One of the representatives of the RSAP in our house of representatives has showed a particularly strong debating performance and managed to convince people of his standpoint around the country as the papers report on it."
holgen.17.a:0 "I didn't think it was that good..."

holgen.18.t:0 "VNH speech"
holgen.18.d:0 "An officer who was member of the VNH has held a rousing speech at the funeral of one of his comrades. As a result, the influence of old guard in the military and beyond has visibly increased as everyone is speaking about it two days later."
holgen.18.a:0 "Is that so?"

holgen.19.t:0 "Groepsleider Speaks Up"
holgen.19.d:0 "One of the 'officers' of the Landwacht, a 'groepsleider' had an interview with one of the country's major papers. He had a strong showing, arguing for and defending a lot of policies backed by the new guard of the VNH. It seems to have convinced a lot of people that the VNH is not that boring after all!"
holgen.19.a:0 "A sad development..."

holgen.20.t:0 "Socialists Block VNH March"
holgen.20.d:0 "The VNH, particularly its new guard, has the habit of holding marches through our major cities to show their strength. Leftists however, have blocked the way, and to show they do not back away from confrontation the VNHers ended up using violence to break their lines. The syndicalist counter-attack ended up culminating in a riot. We should direct the police to investigate, but who is to be blamed for this violence?"
holgen.20.a:0 "The syndicalists, they sought the confrontation."
holgen.20.b:0 "The VNHers, they started using violence."

holgen.21.t:0 "Landwacht Breaks Up Demonstration"
holgen.21.d:0 "The Landwacht has dispersed a demonstration of radical leftists as if they were the riot police. Some are saying this behaviour ought to be penalised, but others point out that the demonstration was illegal and that they merely did their citizen's duty."
holgen.21.a:0 "Merely doing their duty."
holgen.21.b:0 "They are not the law. We are the law."

### Focus Events ###
hol.200.t:0 "The Dutch Army Plan"
hol.200.d:0 "Tensions are running high around us, causing our army staff to hold a meeting to decide upon a doctrine for our army.\nThe more traditional part of our general staff wishes to concentrate on the defence of our country, repairing and reactivating the traditional defensive lines making use of the water to stop the enemy.\nHowever, some note that these tactics may not work anymore due to the changing nature of warfare, and have expressed that the Dutch army should be a highly mobile force capable with motorised troops and tanks to respond to threats quickly and decisively.\nMore naval oriented officers however see the role of the army to be a subsidary of our naval force, with an army of specialists conducting operations around our empire allowing for a small but highly efficient army while the navy keeps the enemy at bay."
hol.200.a:0 "We need to make Holland an impenetrable fortress!"
hol.200.b:0 "Our army is useless cowering in bunkers, trucks and tanks are what we need."
hol.200.c:0 "We are nothing without our empire, and we need the navy and marines to protect it!"

hol.201.t:0 "The Future of the Dutch Navy"
hol.201.d:0 "The Admiralty is discussing the best way to proceed onwards. Our resources are limited, so a plan is needs to be devised on how to make use of our naval assets the most.\n\nSome of the admirality place our merchant fleet above all. They believe that if we merchant fleet is unable to operate, our country will be reduced to poverty. They want to emphasise the need of our navy to protect the fleet with fast surface ships, and if possible harass the fleet of potential adversaries with submarines.\nArguments to focus on large surface ships to protect our vital colonies from a potential Japanese incursion are also heared. Our capital ships are reaching an respectable vintage and will probably not be able to protect the Dutch East Indies in particular if they are not modernised or even expanded in number.\n\nSome propose the Dutch navy to focus on naval aviation, a relatively new but potentially radically altering the way how naval battles are fought in the future. They wish to see a further expansion of the carrier force supported by a strong naval aviation branch."
hol.201.a:0 "Our merchant fleet needs to be protected at all times."
hol.201.b:0 "The Japanese are indeed an ever growing threat, we must focus on our capital ships."
hol.201.c:0 "Battleships are just floating pieces of scrap, focus on the carrier force!"

hol.202.t:0 "New Oil Refinery on Curaçao?"
hol.202.d:0 "Curaçao lies in close proximity to the oil producing Venezuela. Seeing the opportunity this presents, Royal Dutch Shell has asked the government to lease a large piece of land near Willemstad to construct a new refinery.\n\nIf we agree to this, we will also need to construct new docking facilities for oil tankers to enter and leave the harbour.\n\nThe construction of the refinery will give a massive economic boost to the Dutch Antilles, however it might put us on odds against Venezuela... especially considering the fact that they claim these islands as theirs."
hol.202.a:0 "We can never have enough oil, proceed!"
hol.202.b:0 "Actually, we have enough oil already... never mind."

hol.203.t:0 "Willemstad Refinery Completed!"
hol.203.d:0 "The work on the new refinery and necessary harbour facilities is being finished and the new refinery in the heart of Curaçao has been put into operation!"
hol.203.a:0 "Driewerf Hoera!"

holfocus.4.t:0 "The Search For Resources"
holfocus.4.d:0 "Although the vast majority of our resources come from our colonies, our homeland should also harbour some resources we have not yet unconvered.\n\nGeological surveys in Brabant have found traces of tungsten, a resource we thus far completly lack. Furthermore, we can dig deeper in our mines in southern Limburg and perhaps find usable iron for our smelters to produce steel from."
holfocus.4.a:0 "Less reliance on foreign steel would be nice."
holfocus.4.b:0 "We could really use the tungsten."
holfocus.4.c:0 "Why not both? We'll pay for it! Somehow..."

holfocus.5.t:0 "Iron Discovered in Limburg!"
holfocus.5.d:0 "Our mining efforts are successful, there is indeed usuable iron in the mines of Limburg, boosting our steel production considerably!"
holfocus.5.a:0 "Fantastisch!"

holfocus.6.t:0 "Tungsten Discovered in Limburg!"
holfocus.6.d:0 "The surveys were right, there is indeed tungsten in our country. This will certainly prove useful for our military industry."
holfocus.6.a:0 "Heerlijk!"

holfocus.7.t:0 "Vesting Holland"
holfocus.7.d:0 "We have started with the construction of Vesting Holland. The plan will be to surround Holland, the industrial and political heart of the Netherlands, with fortifications so that our defensive positions will be secure in any future war. Should we start construction?"
holfocus.7.a:0 "Begin!"
holfocus.7.b:0 "Rather not."

holfocus.8.t:0 "Vesting Holland's First Stage Completed"
holfocus.8.d:0 "Phase 1 of Vesting Holland has been completed: a limited layer of fortifications hopefully capable of strengthening our defensive capabilities to at least an extent. The project is not finished, however, as much more can be done."
holfocus.8.a:0 "Voortreffelijk!"

holfocus.9.t:0 "Vesting Holland Completed"
holfocus.9.d:0 "We have completed Vesting Holland. Our most important defensive lines are sufficiently secured and any enemy would have to go through a lot more trouble to reach our homeland. While perhaps it might be possible to fortify Fortress Holland even more, this at least sets up a basis we can work with!"
holfocus.9.a:0 "We can sleep easy at night now!"

holfocus.10.t:0 "Question of the SDAP"
holfocus.10.d:0 "Following the removal of the shackles of capitalist rule, the workers have successfully abolished the States-General and are preparing to elect a third National Assembly. One of the first orders of business is whether to allow the SDAP to partake in the upcoming elections; most other remnants of bourgeois elitism may not, but the SDAP have once before tried to jumpstart the revolution, granting them some measure of gruding respect amongst other leftist groups. Unfortunately the SDAP have been drifting to the right in recent years, which is one of our main concerns - they could provide a backdoor to subvert the revolution."
holfocus.10.a:0 "Let the SDAP take part."
holfocus.10.b:0 "Reject SDAP admissions as communal representatives."

holfocus.11.t:0 "Third National Assembly Elected"
holfocus.11.d:0 "Following an election, every municipal commune has sent their representatives to the third National Assembly. This assembly will decide over the future of the new Dutch order."
holfocus.11.a:0 "Good."

holfocus.15.t:0 "Battle for Gouda"
holfocus.15.d:0 "The Red Front and Landwacht were planning to turn the city of Gouda into one huge riot, but we were prepared this time; in a grand operation where the police, military and intelligence government groups worked together, we made sure we had a sizeable police force ready. Using that force, we took down local leadership of both sides, dispersing the crowds. Even if there had been some deaths, it is clear that every would-be fight between them will be met with the same force, until they run out of fighting power."
holfocus.15.a:0 "That's good."

holfocus.16.t:0 "Rebuilding the Binnenhof"
holfocus.16.d:0 "Now that the filthy syndicalists have burned down the Binnenhof, it is up to us to build a replacement so that our centre of power is sheltered and that our government can once again function in The Hague, rather than Amsterdam where we are now temporarily located."
holfocus.16.a:0 "In these times of crisis, we should keep it small."
holfocus.16.b:0 "Just rebuild the old Binnenhof."
holfocus.16.c:0 "Create a giant art-deco style testament to the Dutch spirit!"

holfocus.17.t:0 "Papua Camps"
holfocus.17.d:0 "While camps in West Guinea were always used to store dissidents in the Indies, shipping syndicalists from the mainland Netherlands is actually something we have yet to put into practice despite suggestions. The great advantage of camps in New Guinea compared to a prison in Vught is that syndicalists cannot just flee for France or Britain upon escape and the thick jungle and rumours of native man-eating tribes were a good reason to continue labouring. Following the building of several new camps, there is now room for syndicalists to be arrested and shipped there en-masse."
holfocus.17.a:0 "Let them fester on that malaria-ridden rock."

holfocus.18.t:0 "Zonderlinge Zaterdag"
holfocus.18.d:0 "Early this morning, the Landwacht was found to be unusually active on the streets of Amsterdam. Around 10 a group of around seventy-five Landwachters were spotted marching into the Palace on the edge of Dam Square, the place where Henri Swart's office is. Upon entry into the office their intentions have quickly become clear: they are demanding that Swart publicly resign from his position and prepare for a handover of power. With Swart placed on air on the national broadcaster, the nation's fate hangs on a knife-edge."
holfocus.18.a:0 "The police burst in and seize the conspirators."
holfocus.18.b:0 "Swart publicly resigns."

holfocus.19.t:0 "Trade Mission"
holfocus.19.d:0 "The Netherlands, to put it bluntly, is an export economy. One of the main issues affecting our nations in recent years is that almost all of our exports go to Germany, meaning that now that the Reich's willingness to engage in overseas trade has plummeted, our own economy suffers. In an effort to diversify our export partners, we could approach the nearby Scandinavians, or look beyond Europe to the Americas for new markets."
holfocus.19.a:0 "Send the mission to Scandinavia."
holfocus.19.b:0 "Send the mission to North America."
holfocus.19.c:0 "Send the mission to South America."

holfocus.20.t:0 "Dutch Trade Mission Arrives"
holfocus.20.d:0 "A Dutch trade mission has arrived. They hope to negotiate a treaty so that at least some trade barriers can be removed, a highly unusual request in these times of crisis. Regardless, agreeing to it could boost our trade with each other, but cynics point out that this is probably more an attempt by the Dutch to get out of German economic dependency than them caring for our mutual economic prospects."
holfocus.20.a:0 "Trade barriers begone."
holfocus.20.b:0 "No, the barriers are fine as it is."

holfocus.21.t:0 "Trade Mission Reports Back"
holfocus.21.d:0 "Our trade mission has returned from their trip. Outside of great stories of those who came along about what had happened during it they are also reporting on the gains they have made."
holfocus.21.a:0 "Let's see!"

holfocus.22.t:0 "Welfare Negotiations"
holfocus.22.d:0 "One of the first demands the leftists came up with was some limited reforms in welfare and regulation; ranging from shorter working hours to mandatory safety regulation to subsidies for unemployed and those not able to work at all."
holfocus.22.a:0 "A despicably un-Dutch proposal!"
holfocus.22.b:0 "Some reforms should be fine."
holfocus.22.c:0 "Implement all of their reforms."

holfocus.23.t:0 "Communard Diplomatic Status Negotiations"
holfocus.23.d:0 "While most 'conventional' countries have the tendency to recognise governments-in-exile like Canada and National France over the syndicalists ruling their homeland, the Netherlands were also one of the few countries who viciously refused to even de-facto recognising their existence. That may change now, because the leftists demand we negotiate with the Commune of France for a diplomatic mission in the interests of our citizens travelling there."
holfocus.23.a:0 "We don't negotiate with terrorists!"
holfocus.23.b:0 "Fine, but we will explicitly deny de-facto recognition!"
holfocus.23.c:0 "Alright, but we won't say this is de-jure recognition!"

holfocus.24.t:0 "Anti-Landwacht Protection Negotiations"
holfocus.24.d:0 "The leftists are demanding that we divert manpower in order to protect them from 'blackshirted thugs', after consulting our spy in the NAS it was found out that they meant the Landwacht with this. Still, diverting our precious manpower to defending some lefties is especially in CNA spheres seen as completely unacceptable!"
holfocus.24.a:0 "We're not going to do that."
holfocus.24.b:0 "Divert a few reservists."
holfocus.24.c:0 "Give them what they want."

holfocus.25.t:0 "Red Front Restriction Negotiations"
holfocus.25.d:0 "The Red Front is arguably one of the biggest threats to civil peace in the Netherlands as they have a tendency to constantly brawl with the Landwacht. Demanding that they restrain themselves in the deal is a no-brainer, but the lefties won't just go for that."
holfocus.25.a:0 "Demand must cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.25.b:0 "They may henceforth only defend their activists from the Landwacht."
holfocus.25.c:0 "Don't restrict their rights in the deal."

holfocus.26.t:0 "NAS Negotiations"
holfocus.26.d:0 "The NAS, arguably the most important syndicalist union in the Netherlands, has the potential to bring our economy to ruin and furthermore, taking at away will damage the influence of orthodox syndicalism, probably badly!"
holfocus.26.a:0 "Demand they cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.26.b:0 "They must merge with the social democratic NVV!"
holfocus.26.c:0 "Don't make demands of them."

holfocus.27.t:0 "RSAP Negotiations"
holfocus.27.d:0 "The RSAP is the only far-left party represented in parliament, mainly because the rest of the left rejects our parliament's legitimacy. Still, they are a threat to our current system, as they would no doubt dissolve it if they came to power. Limiting what they can do will diminish the political influence of the radical socialists as well."
holfocus.27.a:0 "They must dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.27.b:0 "Demand they refrain from activity in strikes and demonstrations."
holfocus.27.c:0 "Don't make demands of them."

holfocus.28.t:0 "Landwacht Restrictions Negotiations"
holfocus.28.d:0 "The Landwacht is an obvious problem with regards to keeping the streets of the Netherlands safe, as they seem to constantly start brawling with leftwingers. The Dutch government wants to make clear that the Landwacht should make way for the police to round up troublemakers where needed."
holfocus.28.a:0 "Demand they cease their activities and dissolve themselves!"
holfocus.28.b:0 "They may henceforth only defend their activists from the Red Front."
holfocus.28.c:0 "Don't restrict their rights in the deal."

holfocus.29.t:0 "Military Influence Negotiations"
holfocus.29.d:0 "A large problem iss that a lot old-guard officers in our military is member of the VNH at the behalf of their 'moderate-but-still-authoritarian' faction. This undermines the reliability of our military and makes a putsch by the VNH possible. We are determined to change this, and moreso by altering their party rules."
holfocus.29.a:0 "Demand that one can no longer be actively in the military and be a VNH-member."
holfocus.29.b:0 "Make sure that active military personnel can no longer become VNH-members."
holfocus.29.c:0 "Don't push this issue."

holfocus.30.t:0 "VNH Rally Negotiations"
holfocus.30.d:0 "One of the most important reasons that the VNH is growing so fast in recent years is that Van Geelkerken is holding enormous party rallies propagating a future under the VNH. This leads to growth of a radical young guard and it is proving to be a threat to our parliamentary system."
holfocus.30.a:0 "Demand that these rallies will no longer be held."
holfocus.30.b:0 "Only allow it at the annual VNH landdag."
holfocus.30.c:0 "Don't put restrictions on it like that."

holfocus.31.t:0 "Union Rights Negotiations"
holfocus.31.d:0 "The first demand the VNH placed down was that we ban trade unions as they are, as the VNH's Van Geelkerken states, 'thugs who only seek to sabotage our nation'. This would be neither stabilising nor popular, however."
holfocus.31.a:0 "Strong unions are vital to our society."
holfocus.31.b:0 "Limit their rights, but don't outright ban them."
holfocus.31.c:0 "Ban the unions as demanded."

holfocus.32.t:0 "Tariff Negotiations"
holfocus.32.d:0 "The VNH demands that we protect Dutch businesses through tariffs to make foreign goods more expensive. The Netherlands is an export country however and overdoing this is risking a trade war that we cannot afford, so the government must remain cautious."
holfocus.32.a:0 "We don't do tariffs."
holfocus.32.b:0 "Some tariffs are acceptable."
holfocus.32.c:0 "Implement all the tariffs they want."

holfocus.33.t:0 "Nationalisation Negotiations"
holfocus.33.d:0 "The most controversial demand of the populists was that we would nationalise all German property in the Netherlands. Some are afraid that doing this will bring upon us the wrath of the Kaiserreich."
holfocus.33.a:0 "We're nationalising nothing!"
holfocus.33.b:0 "Germans don't need all that property."
holfocus.33.c:0 "We'll nationalise all German property."

holfocus.34.t:0 "Successful Negotiations with the Syndicalists"
holfocus.34.d:0 "We have successfully negotiated a deal with the extreme left. Now it is time to implement our part of the deal and see them implement their part."
holfocus.34.a:0 "Excellent news!"

holfocus.36.t:0 "Negotiations Failed with the Syndicalists"
holfocus.36.d:0 "The syndicalists have left the negotiation as they feel we are willing to give away too little to force actual change through. As such the negotiations have fallen apart and the chances of a deal are now minimal."
holfocus.36.a:0 "Sodding reds."

holfocus.37.t:0 "Successful Negotiations with the Nationalists"
holfocus.37.d:0 "We have successfully negotiated a deal with the extreme right. Now it is time to implement our part of the deal and see them implement their part."
holfocus.37.a:0 "Neat."

holfocus.39.t:0 "Negotiations Failed with the Nationalists"
holfocus.39.d:0 "The VNH has left the negotiation table as they feel that 'we are too weak to even stand a chance at saving the country' and that they would have to give too much away to end with a deal. Negotiations have thus fallen apart and of the chances a deal after all are slim."
holfocus.39.a:0 "These extremists really are a piece of work."

holfocus.40.t:0 "Dutch Diplomatic Mission"
holfocus.40.d.a:0 "The Dutch government has grudgingly approached us to exchange diplomatic missions between our countries, which amounts to de-facto recognition of our existence, something they have not shown before. It could be a chance to make sure our citizens have some place to turn to when in the Netherlands, but our sources have told us that they agreed to do this only by the grace of having negotiated with their local syndicalists, so we could perhaps extract more."
holfocus.40.d.b:0 "The Dutch government has grudgingly approached us to exchange diplomatic missions between our countries, though they have said that this amounts to no recognition of our government at all. This is insulting, but our sources say this move stems from negotiations with our comrades there, so perhaps we could pressure them into recognising our government."
holfocus.40.a:0 "Accept the proposal."
holfocus.40.b:0 "Demand de-jure recognition by the Dutch government."

holfocus.41.t:0 "Commune Accepts the Proposal"
holfocus.41.d.a:0 "The Dutch government has begrudgingly approached us to exchange diplomatic missions between our countries, which amounts to de-facto recognition of our existence, something they have not shown before.

holfocus.41.b:0 "Demand de-jure recognition by the Dutch government."

holfocus.42.t:0 "Commune Accepts the Mission"
holfocus.42.d:0 "The French Communards have accepted our proposal to exchange diplomatic missions, and the necessary preparations to buy a building in Paris and The Hague by our countries respectively has started. The syndicalists will be satisfied which will cement our deal."
holfocus.42.a:0 "I still don't like this."

holfocus.43.t:0 "Commune Demands De-Jure Recognition"
holfocus.43.d:0 "The French have said that they will only accept our proposal if we officially recognise their government, something objectively not possible without repealing our recognition of National France. Besides that it also makes our government look weak. Not doing it might jeopardise our deal with the left though..."
holfocus.43.a:0 "Never!"
holfocus.43.b:0 "Ok then..."

holfocus.44.t:0 "Dutch Diplomatic Recognition"
holfocus.44.d:0 "The Dutch government has given in to our pressure and is now recognising us as the legitimate government of France. Their government has suffered a humiliating political loss while we have gained a massive diplomatic win on the world stage."
holfocus.44.a:0 "Pressure helps!"

holfocus.45.t:0 "Holland Refuses to Recognise Us"
holfocus.45.d:0 "Despite our pressure, the Dutch have refused to recognise us. While this means no diplomatic missions it is not particularly crushing for us. We could however tell the Dutch syndicalists how awfully unreasonable their government was, with their outrageous demands... like... well we will just have to make something up!"
holfocus.45.a:0 "No, its better to just leave it at this!"
holfocus.45.b:0 "Let me think of some outrageous demands..."

holfocus.46.t:0 "Syndicalists Protest"
holfocus.46.d:0 "When we didn't hear back from the Communards, we assumed that it was no deal. However, now the syndicalist negotiators have appeared saying that we made outrageous demands of the Communard government and that we intentionally blew the negotiations to punish them..."
holfocus.46.a:0 "OK, OK, we'll recognise them!"
holfocus.46.b:0 "We deny this and we won't go back."

holfocus.47.t:0 "The Netherlands Nationalises German Property"
holfocus.47.d.a:0 "The Dutch government has announced a large-scale nationalisation programme following negotiations with their ultranationalists. They are targeting German property across their country and voices from left to right of the political spectrum are calling for action to defend German interests."
holfocus.47.d.b:0 "The Dutch government has announced a small-scale nationalisation programme that seems to be solely targeting Germans. There has been some outrage in German politics about this and there are calls for us to do something to safeguard German interests in our small neighbour."
holfocus.47.a:0 "The German military will safeguard German interests."
holfocus.47.b:0 "Give it up or lose access to the Reichspakt markets."
holfocus.47.c:0 "There is nothing we can do."

holfocus.48.t:0 "German Military Ultimatum"
holfocus.48.d:0 "The Germans have sent an ultimatum: either we cancel our nationalisation plans or the German Heer will intervene to protect German interests by force. It appears like we have little choice but to cancel, even if it would not be popular with our new nationalistic partners or even moderates."
holfocus.48.a:0 "They're bluffing!"
holfocus.48.b:0 "We would be squashed under their heel."

holfocus.49.t:0 "Dutch Refuse our Ultimatum"
holfocus.49.d:0 "The Dutch apparently think we are bluffing, and have refused to call off the nationalisation. While not attacking now would have us lose face in the international community, some are saying that it is unwise to attack a 'normal' country while the syndicalists knock at our gates. Besides, that nationalisation is hardly a valid casus belli."
holfocus.49.a:0 "War it is!"
holfocus.49.b:0 "Don't act on it."

holfocus.50.t:0 "German Economic Ultimatum"
holfocus.50.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has demanded that we cancel our nationalisation, and that if we fail to do so they will remove our access to the Reichspakt market, which could potentially ruin our economy. Caving in will likely anger our nationalistic partners however."
holfocus.50.a:0 "Thanks to policy and Black Monday we can afford it."
holfocus.50.b:0 "We have no choice."

holfocus.51.t:0 "Dutch Refuse our Ultimatum"
holfocus.51.d:0 "In spite of our threats, the Dutch have refused to cancel the nationalisation process. Now it is up to us to decide whether we will go through with our threat or just let it slide."
holfocus.51.a:0 "You'll get your embargo."
holfocus.51.b:0 "Sliding sounds nice."

holfocus.52.t:0 "Dutch Cave In"
holfocus.52.d:0 "Following our pressure the Dutch have caved in and German property will not be nationalised. Those owning assets in the Netherlands have cheered the strong reaction of the German government and showered praise upon us for not letting them be bullied by our tiny neighbour's government."
holfocus.52.a:0 "That will teach them."

holfocus.53.t:0 "VNH Publicly Denounces Us"
holfocus.53.d:0 "Our 'partners', the VNH, have publicly denounced the way we handeled the German diplomatic row, saying that we failed to do what it took to serve our country's best interesdt and that we let the German violate our sovereignty. So much for our deal."
holfocus.53.a:0 "It can hardly be cancelled if it never truly existed!"

holfocus.54.t:0 "Government Negotiations Collapse"
holfocus.54.d:0 "Following the failure to negotiate a deal with either the left or the right, the CNA and LSP are both polling at historically low levels, with most of their voters having defected to the SDAP and VDB. At the same time, the far left and far right are intending to boycott the elections. The LSP has sought to return to the negotiating table, but the CNA claims the time for talk is over. It turns out they couldn't get out."
holfocus.54.a:0 "We need new elections in a few month time!"

holfocus.55.t:0 "Elections of [GetYear]"
holfocus.55.d:0 "Following the fall of the Cabinet of the CNA and LSP, elections were ordered to be held. The SDAP and VDB are said to stand a good chance as their interventions have caused the CNA and LSP to lose a lot of support and their bad experience with working with the democratic parties had caused both the VNH and the RSAP to boycott the elections, at least this time around."
holfocus.55.a:0 "The SDAP beats the CNA."
holfocus.55.b:0 "The CNA remains the largest, but loses its majority."

holfocus.56.t:0 "SDAP Forms [GetYear] Government"
holfocus.56.d:0 "Having become the largest party in the house, the SDAP get the first chance to form a government. It has not taken long to make a deal with the VDB, who are the only ones willing to rule with them. The only dark spot of the whole affair has been that Queen Wilhelmina has refused to give Albarda the posto of Formateur, meaning that it would have to be filled by VDB-leader Oud."
holfocus.56.a:0 "And so cabinet Oud came to be."

holfocus.57.t:0 "SDAP Forms [GetYear] Government"
holfocus.57.d:0 "While the CNA again stood victorious, we unfortunately lost our majority. While we got the first shot at forming a government, we discovered that cruelly we could only do so if we made a deal with the SDAP or VDB who saw each other as preferable partners. After failing to find a viable partner, we had to give the SDAP a chance. The SDAP formed a cabinet with the VDB, for unknown reasons, though it is said the Queen was involved in negotiating that."
holfocus.57.a:0 "... but we won!"

holfocus.58.t:0 "Prime Secretary of the External Affairs"
holfocus.58.d:0 "The Third National Assembly took to electing the 'Eerste Secretaris der Externe Zaken' of the Batavian Commune - leading the department of external affairs. There are multiple individuals running for this office, but only those endorsed by a faction stand a real chance of winning as representatives that stand as independents, while not unimportant, are unable to swing crucial votes."

holfocus.59.d:0 "The Third National Assembly is now electing the 'Eerste Secretaris der Economie' of the Batavian Commune - who will be in charge of the department of economics.

holfocus.61.e:0 "SDAP party leader Willem Albarda."

holfocus.62.t:0 "Patriots Gain a Majority"
holfocus.62.d:0 "The Patriot movement had the overwhelming support of the independents who appear not so independent after all. The first law of the Volksraad was that of filling the post of council pensionary, henceforth filled by David Wijnkoop until his death, which went flawlessly through the National Assembly. Undoubtedly the new constitution will fully suit the needs of the patriots."
holfocus.62.a:0 "Batavian democracy was a brief experience."

holfocus.63.t:0 "NAS Gains a Majority"
holfocus.63.d:0 "The Nationaal Arbeids-Secretariaat and their unionist philosophy has clearly won the hearts of a majority of the people. The delegates of every Dutch commune have granted their representatives a majority in the Volksraad. The newly assembled Volksraad has elected NAS-chairman Harm Kolthek as the first council pensionary of the Batavian Commune. The Volksraad has now started drafting a constitution that will determine the rules of state."
holfocus.63.a:0 "The unions will get a special place."

holfocus.64.t:0 "RSAP Gains a Majority"
holfocus.64.d:0 "Henk Sneevliet left the National Assembly today announcing that the RSAP has gained a majority in the Volksraad, the executive organ of the Batavian Commune, owing to their support from the National Assembly. Sneevliet also announced that the Volksraad had expressed their trust in him as first council pensionary of the new nation."
holfocus.64.a:0 "Pensionary Sneevliet it is."

holfocus.65.t:0 "SDAP Gains a Majority"
holfocus.65.d:0 "The SDAP has received support from the most delegates in the National Assembly, culminating in control over the Volksraad. Willem Albarda declared over the radio that he would not run for pensionary, leaving this office to Willem Drees instead. This is because one of the new constitution's clauses will be that anyone running for pensionary cannot simultaneously run for chairman of the Volksraad."
holfocus.65.a:0 "Is the revolution subverted now?"

holfocus.66.t:0 "Hung Assembly"
holfocus.66.d:0 "The delegates of the communes clearly did not agree on the future of the nation, as the Volksraad and Assembly are divided into rivalling factionalism. No majority has been attained, and the factions are debating whether a coalition can be formed through compromise. At the same time however, Red Front-leader Arnold Meijer, together with a few patriots is openly denouncing how the revolution just resembles another flavour of indecisive parliamentarism, and with some patriots openly supporting such a move, it appears his calls will be heard if no deal can be made soon."
holfocus.66.a:0 "Sneevliet and Albarda make a deal."
holfocus.66.b:0 "RSAP and NAS see an option."
holfocus.66.c:0 "The Red Front launches a coup against the government."

holfocus.67.t:0 "An End to the Violence"
holfocus.67.d:0 "The government has invited the leadership of the VNH, the RSAP and the NAS to the Binnenhof for a stern warning. The prime minister has warned both sides, stating that 'we did not invite you here without reason, and neither did we ban the Red Front and Landwacht without reason. The Dutch people are tired of the violence in the streets between your factions and so am I. Rest assured that if any further violence by an organisation set up by members of your parties results in the NAS, the RSAP or VNH being outlawed, the entire leadership of said organisation will be considered guilty of inciting violence. Dismissed!'.\nThe press was impressed by the fact that the VNH members and syndicalists left the building without attacking each other."
holfocus.67.a:0 "I hope they received the message."

holfocus.68.t:0 "The Rhine Line"
holfocus.68.d:0 "One of the policies of the VNH to recover from Black Monday was a keynesian project to have people build fortifications along the Rhine as a safeguard against a hypothetical advance of the syndicalists from France. This way, it was argued, did the government both spend money to increase the purchasing power of the common man, while also making preparations for the future."

We can still refuse them if we do not want to be pulled into a war with Japan, though the European Netherlands could in the future also prove a good staging ground against the Kaiserreich."

Some people say that it is best for both sides if we maintain friendly relations with the rulers of Belgium. There is however, especially on the far-right, also a lobby that demands we stake our claims on Flanders, where most people speak Dutch too and which should, by that logic, be part of the Dutch state."

At the turn of the 20th century, however, this sentiment started to change, perhaps under influence of the 'apartheid' concept.

### Dutch navy focuses events

holnavy.3.t:0 "A New O-Class Submarine"
holnavy.3.d:0 "The first submarine minelayer to serve for the Netherlands, the O19 class were the largest Dutch submarines to date, displacing 998 tons. They were also the fastest, capable of 19.25 knots surfaced (and 9 knots submerged). Armament comprised of eight 530mm torpedo tubes (4 bow, 2 stern, 2 external amidships), a dual-purpose 88mm deck gun, two 40mm Bofors guns and a 12.7mm machine gun, giving them a very strong anti-aircraft capability for a pre-war submarine.\n\nProbably the most innovative element of the design was the world's first operational submarine snorkel, a pipe that enabled the diesel engines to be run at periscope depth."
holnavy.3.a:0 "That looks dangerous, I'd rather not!"
holnavy.3.a.tt:0 "By not having to go back to the drawing table, we will have the ship as soon as possible.\nGrants the standard tech tree design."

holnavy.4.t:0 "A New Colonial Submarine"
holnavy.4.d:0 "Most of our so called 'K-class' submarines are getting quite old. These submarines are specifically designed for patrol duties in the warm waters of the Indies. A new design with the latest technological advances in submarine design will bolster our ability of keeping the Dutch East Indies defendable or even cause the diversion of enemy ships to counter these submarines. With these newer designs, we can not only make them patrol boats, but design them to operate further away from bases as well by specifically improving their endurance."
holnavy.4.a:0 "We'll opt for a more well-rounded design."
holnavy.4.a.tt:0 "By not having to go back to the drawing table, we will have the ship as soon as possible. Grants the standard tech tree design.\n"
holnavy.4.b:0 "Ensure these submarines will be able to operate far from their bases."

We can therefore opt to specialise our smaller ships in an anti-submarine role, by equipping them with the newest submarine-detecting technologies and additional weaponry to counter them.\n\nThis will make them somewhat more expensive though."

holnavy.13.d:0 "As we possess a rather large arsenal of destroyers. rather than building full sized cruisers, we opt for a design which is considerably smaller yet retains its cruiser like armament. These ships will act as the leader of a squadron of destroyers.\n\nThe planned design as is, codenamed 'Argonaut 600', has a displacement of just 3500 tonnes, but will be armed with 6 150mm guns, and equipped with a decent amount of AA and ASW equipment. She will also carry a Fokker C.XI(W) floatplane. The small size will come at the cost of nearly no armour protection but will make these cruisers to be considerably cheaper to produce."

holnavy.6.d:0 "The old armoured cruisers of the Koningin-Regentes class being way too outdated to be of any use to the navy anymore, these ships are to be scrapped or converted to another use. However, the idea of having compact, relatively affordable ships which still can pack a punch is a compelling one.\n\nWith advances in technology, the biggest drawback of a design like this is negated, its relatively slow speed. We can therefore opt for a more well-rounded design, or we can alter the design and choose for a slower but more heavily armed coastal defence ship.\nWe can also do the opposite and opt for a lighter version with reduced armament with some extra anti-aircraft capabilities which might prove useful if they are to be used in the East Indies."

holfocus.400.d:0 "Design on a Koolhoven high-performance aircraft first started late in 1937. The result, finished in early 1938 was the F.K.55, a single-seat fighter of radical design with contra-rotating propellers and an engine housed behind the pilot. It had initially been proposed to do away with ailerons on the wings, and replace them with "slot-spoilers" for lateral control, however this idea was abandoned early in the project."
holfocus.400.a:0 "Lets build them!"
holfocus.401.t:0 "Fokker D.XXI Developed"
holfocus.401.d:0 "The Fokker D.XXI was a low-wing monoplane fighter aircraft. Following standard Fokker design practice of the period, it featured a welded steel tube fuselage that was largely covered by fabric, including the flight control surfaces; element forward of the trailing edges of the wings were covered by detachable aluminium panels instead. The wings were of a wooden construction, being composed of two box spars attached to ribs made of plywood. The aircraft was outfitted with a fixed spatted undercarriage with cantilever legs; braking was provided by independently-operated pedals using compress air.\n\nThe cockpit of the D.XXI was fully enclosed by a plexiglas hood featuring large sliding sections, and was entirely jettisonable in an emergency situation to enable pilots to bail out. Two pilots were protected against turnover injuries by means of a pylon built into the structure of the aircraft set behind the seat. Fuel was housed in a 77-gallon tank located aft of the engine, wing-mounted auxiliary fuel tanks could also be installed.\nThe main armament consisted of two pairs of 7.92mm M36 FN-Browning machine guns, two being housed within the wings and the other pair within the forward fuselage, requiring the latter to shoot through the propeller blades; guns installed within the fuselage carried 500 rounds each while wing-mounted guns had 300 rounds each.\nUpon its entry to service in 1938, the D.XXI represented a significant leap forward for the Dutch Army Aviation Group, whose fighter force had until that time consisted of aging biplanes with open cockpits. The new Fokker quickly proved to be an extremely sturdy aircraft, being capable of attaining a speed of 700 km/h in a dive."
holfocus.401.dxxi-2.t:0 "Fokker D.XXI Developed"
holfocus.401.dxxi-2.d:0 "The Luchtvaartafdeling (LVA) consists of just a couple of squadrons of antiquated biplanes... on paper. The LVA is thus currently in no condition to defend the skies of the Netherlands, let alone our far flung colonial empire.\n\nFokker has once again been chosen to provide the machines for our air force, and has a near production ready prototype of the Fokker D.XXI ready.\n\nUpon its entry to service the D.XXI shall represent a significant leap forward for the LVA.\nThe new Fokker possess some interesting characteristics like being an extremely sturdy yet manoeuvrable aircraft and being capable of attaining a speed of 700 km/h in a dive.\nHowever its engine might be underpowered and the twin rifle calibre machineguns might prove to be underwhelming compared to the competition."
holfocus.401.dxxi-5.t:0 "Fokker D.XXI-5 Developed"
holfocus.401.dxxi-5.d:0 "With the Fokker D.XXI steadily replacing the antiqudated biplanes in service of the LVA, concerns have been raised about the relatively low engine power as well as drag created by the non retractable landing gear. Although the plane is well liked by its pilots, it does have some room for improvement.\n\nSeveral design changes have been proposed, and one redesigned model with an upgraded engine and retractable landing gear is now ready for production.\nThis will provide a cheap boost to the combat worthyness of the Luchtvaartafdeling, as existing production lines can be used."
holfocus.401.dxxiii.t:0 "Fokker D.XXIII Developed"
holfocus.401.dxxiii.d:0 "The Fokker D.XXI planes are serving us well, but their limited engine power means their obsoledence is nearing quickly. Fortunally, Fokker has been designing a replacement in the form of the twin engined D.XXIII. With two engines instead of one and thus double the horsepower, our pilots should definitely get the advantage of enemey designs.\n\nThe Fokker D.XXIII is to be equipped with two 7.92mm calibre machineguns along with two 13mm guns, more than doubling the firepower of the previous designs."

The British and French syndicalist regimes have yet to be diplomatically recognised by the Dutch authorities and Flanders-Wallonia has already moved to Central European time under German pressure.\n\nThis debate has quietly carried on through the 1930s, raging between the camp arguing that the Netherlands should follow Amsterdam's natural timezone and the faction that believes the Netherlands should move to the Kaiserreich's timezone - they are after all our single most important trading partner. While an accord in favour of the latter was finally reached in 1935, being that the first of February 1936 would be one hour longer to put the nation's clocks on par with those of the Reichspakt, the ultimate decision is up to us."

holdei.4.d:0 "Japan attacked us in hope of seizing our East Indian colonies for themselves, however it seems that the Japanese have been unable to drive us out of our colony.

holdei.5.t:0 "Dutch Propose an Armistice!"

Still, some in the Homeland might construe this as a form of defeat."

hol.8984.t:0 "A Question of the Monarchy"
hol.8984.d:0 "As we have cleansed ourselves of the vile yoke of the syndicalists, we must decide the fate of the monarchy. While many wish see the restoration of Maria as queen, some instead vew her husband Bernhard as more ammendable. Radical factions say that the monarchy lead to the syndicalist victory in the first place. Others still say we should appoint Juliana once more to the throne, as it is her rightful place. It is up to the military to decide."

hol.8984.b:0 "Long live King Bernhard!"

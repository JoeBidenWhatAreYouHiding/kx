FIU_HORTHY_DESC:0 "Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya, or just Horthy to many, has amassed quite the reputation both in Austria and beyond. Having been the Commander of the Austro-Hungarian Fleet since an ill-fated mutiny in 1918, Horthy has brought a wealth of good to the Navy. Austria-Hungary is mocked for its inefficiency in the bureaucracy, its air force, and its army, but there is no peep about the Navy, frequently touted as the pride of the Empire.\n\nIn 1927, Horthy was appointed Governor of the new Fiume-Zadar Port Authorities after the Ausgleich in the same year. During the Ausgleich, Croatia-Slavonia was detached from the Kingdom of Hungary, much to the Hungarian nobles' disdain. At first, Fiume and Zadar were to be taken too, but the Hungarians, after much persistence and empty threats, got to keep the two cities under a special mandate. As with his success in the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Horthy has a reputation for amelioration of Fiume and Zadar too; in the 1935 reports Fiume narrowly edged out more of a profit that the famous Trieste port. None know how he did it, but Fiume and Zadar are rapidly enriching at what some say is a suspicious rate.\n\nSome accuse Horthy of being the one behind the mysterious "Jolly Roger Fleet," a mysterious fleet bearing the Jolly Roger that intercepts shipping from the Otranto Strait, plundering their riches and retreating northwards. None believe the tall tale however, and very few sources even speak of the Jolly Roger Fleet.\n\nHorthy, now, continues Fiume-Zadar's great upwards trend, even though the line is slowly flattening out."

BOTDE_FIU_jolly_roger_desc:0 "The Dual Cities of Fiume-Zadar have a deep, dark secret: the black flag that bears the signature skull and crossbones of piracy have their home in their ports. The Fleet's sole purpose, in the early years, was simply a way for Austro-Hungarian cadets and sailors to earn some real experience in the chaotic aftermath of the Weltkrieg. However, in 1927, shortly after Fiume-Zadar's independence, it all changed. The previously non-existent standard of that Ghost Fleet were adorned with the black and white Jolly Roger, with the sole purpose of encouraging business to Austro-Hungarian ports however possible, even if it meant by plunder.\nThe grizzled sailors and the company of battle-hardened marines that man the unflinchingly loyal and avaricious Fleet have made stops as far as Gibraltar and Malta.\n\nWith Fiume-Zadar's shipping industry secured, the fleets found not much use - until Black Monday. With shipping at an all-time low, the Jolly Roger has been raised again, and Horthy has given it one objective: bring money to Fiume-Zadar, and Austria, by any means possible.\n\nIf the Fleet is too proactive, it could be discovered who is really behind the mysterious fleet - and if that happens, a scandal, the likes of which will never be seen again for decades, will annihilate the reputation of Austria and the ports.\n\nThe Jolly Roger Fleet is at a risk level of [?FIU.FIU_RISK|%R0]. The higher risk is, the higher chance raids will be discovered, and it is but a matter of time until when the curtain is pulled wide open.\nThe Fleet has been compromised [?FIU.RiskFailures|R0] times."

FIU_italian_problem:0 "Irredentist Issue"
FIU_italian_problem_desc:0 "While the ports of Fiume and Zadar are under the de facto rule of Budapest, their Hungarian population is dwarfed by that of the Illyrians and Italians.\nFiume and Zadar is populated by a majority of Italians and Illyrians, with Italians being the larger of the two. The Hungarians, and by extent any Austrian officials, are merely there as administrators or commanders, when it comes to a political sense. The ethnic Hungarians of FIume only number around 18%, but none of them are particularly political. Not all Hungarians in Fiume are ethnic. These people include Horthy, Csatay, and Decleva, who are all members of the Kikötői hatóságok, or port authorities.\nThis Hungarian dominance over a place with restless minorities and a silent "preferred" ethnicity has formed a fertile breeding ground for nationalism, especially in Italian irredentist circles.\n\nWhile the two Italies spar off against one another, both native Fiumeans and friends of D'Annunzio come to Fiume to advance Italian irredentism. The Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, as it goes, is officially banned, but holds a significant hold over the agitated Italians of Fiume. Icilio Bacci has gained a significant hold over these Italians, currently presiding as the chairman of the party. The other half follow the Associazione Autonoma, who are not necessarily against Vienna, but would not mind separation from it either. This group is led by Riccardo Zanella.\nAll in all, the Fiume-Zadar guard is made up mostly of non-Italians, rather Austrians, Hungarians, Croats, Czechs, and even Poles. People from all over the Empire serve in the Fiume-Zadar Guard, and all have strict ties to the monarchy, making any coup nigh impossible."
FIU_police_pirates:0 "Police-Pirates"
FIU_police_pirates_desc:0 "As the Fiume-Zadar Guard is made up from men all around the Habsburg Empire, it is difficult sometimes for Budapest to finance the oversized Guard. Besides that, Fiume, which has become the richest port of the Empire, only recently eclipsing Trieste, has seen a vast upturn in local wealth. Some of the porters of the Guard have a reputation among the soldiers and the upper administration as police-pirates, taking little bits of imports from themselves if possible. The administration has turned a blind eye, but many wonder what will happen if this problem is never dealt with."

This thought has culminated in heavy fortifications outside the city, along with a sizeable elite garrison, the Fiume-Zadar Guard, men with loyalty to the Crown alone."

nufiu.1.t:0 "The Great Seaports of Fiume-Zadar"
nufiu.1.d:0 "Over the course of the 20th century, the one thing that has only been on the upturn in Austria-Hungary is trading. The ports of the Empire are flourishing, without Italians to interfere or British to blockade. The ports of Fiume and Zadar were in the Transdanubian kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, up until 1933, when the Hungarian kingdom was whisked away, in a plan to form the Kingdom of Illyria, as Karl planned to federalize and save his Empire.\nHowever, the backlash from Hungary was apparent - nobles made threats, and nationalists made marches around Budapest, openly defying Vienna. In an effort to quench the nationalist thirst, Karl conceded the ports of Fiume and Zadar back to Hungary, as Fiume stands as one of the Empire's most important shipping ports. This compromise worked, with Miklos Horthy, commander-in-chief of the Navy, elected to govern the cities of Fiume-Zadar. Horthy retains his rank as commander-in-chief of the Navy, and thus the Fiume harbor has experienced massive growth to allot for the cities' navy.\n\nHorthy's tenure as the Dual Governor has been so economically successful, in fact, that a large portion of the Austro-Hungarian fleet has been moved to base near the city. Besides Horthy, Hungarian land commanders such as Zoltán Decleva and Lajos Csatay have become officers of the new Fiume-Zadar Guard, a military-police force comprised of men from all over the Empire. Archduke Joseph August von Habsburg sits as the second-in-command, acting as a diplomat and police chief in case Horthy is out elsewhere.\nHowever, some people have been suspicious of Fiume's extreme prosperity. Some say that, as Italian ships leave their ports, a fleet bearing the Jolly Roger will come into view, steal the possessions, and sail eastwards. Others say, that at markets in Ravenna, they are threatened into forking over their belongings for a man they will not name. Many already know some of the Fiumean policemen to take bits and pieces of incoming shipments for themselves, giving them the nickname 'Police-Pirates'. However, such a nickname does not solve the mystery of the Adriatic Pirates.\n\nBesides the issue of the mysterious Jolly Roger Fleet, Italian irredentists and nationalists have been gaining increased influence in Fiume, as Austria sorts out the occupation of Vienna and makes a clear shift towards uniting the broken Empire. Two notable men are Riccardo Zanella and Icilio Bacci, heads of the Autonomist Association and the Irredentist Party respectively. While Zanella is willing to work with Vienna, Bacci and his connections to D'Annunzio are hellbent on kicking out the Port Authorities and bringing Fiume to the second Risorgimento. As such, laws have been passed recently oppressing Italian parties, only exacerbating the issue with both Zanella and Bacci. Neither of them will ever be able to storm Fiume or Zadar by force, as it is always under tight supervision from the Guard from every angle.\nDespite its situation, Fiume's prosperity continues, and with any luck it might have a true golden age."

nufiulore.1.t:0 "History of the Dual Guard of Fiume-Zadar"
nufiulore.1.d:0 "The Doppelter Schutz, or the Dual Guard, makes up the military-police force that governs and defends the cities of Fiume-Zadar. Under the direct command of Miklós Horthy, the Dual Guard is not comprised of native Croas, Hungarians, and Italians - rather, its ranks are filled with peoples from all over the Empire. Poles, Czechs, Romanians, Rusyns, Croats, and even Montenegrin veterans serve in the Dual Guard.\n\nThe heavily-multiethnic force draws criticism from many inner circles of the Empire, citing the failures of the Empire during the Weltkrieg as a teller to the Guard's inevitable collapse. However, the Kaiser has different plans: under his guise, the Dual Guard would serve as a proof of concept of the K.u.K. Armee's military reform, including linking these different cultures together into one cohesive fighting force.\n\nThe Guard's stories of battle are not extensive: the only time the Guard ever saw conflict was in the South Slavic Revolts, during the 1928-1929 Siege of Zadar and the 1929 Battle of Fiume. Here, rebellious Slavic forces laid the cities to siege with artillery fire for a gruelling 683 days. While the Guard was relieved of Fiume by 1929, Zadar remained entirely supplied by other Austrian ports. The Dual Guard proceeded to serve in the Dalmatian Offensive in the latter third of the Revolts, seeing action at Gospić. Despite its small numbers, the Guard's veteran training proved the Kaiser's military reformation theories, leading to a wider adoption of the new reforms. Dual Guards further served at Split, Mostar, and Livno alongside Tyrolean Kaiserjägers.\n\nAlmost every veteran of the Revolts still serve in the Guard today, mostly suppressing Italian irredentism. Comparable in viciousness to the Arditi, the Dual Guards are a major factor in the stability of the surrounding region. Like the Tyroleans before them, the Dual Guard is not required to serve on the front lines since the end of the South Slavic Revolts."

nufiulore.2.t:0 "The Legend of the Jolly Roger Fleet"
nufiulore.2.d:0 "Besides the Dual Guard, Fiume-Zadar is funded by both Cisleithania and Transleithania for the Zwillingsmarinen, or 'Twin Navies.' Unlike the Dual Guard, the Zwillingsmarinen is crewed primarily by Germans and Hungarians, intermingled ship by ship; the same principles that guide the Doppelter Schutz guide the Zwillingsmarinen. Also under the direct command of the Governor, without Imperial supervision due to a clause of the Fiume Accord of 1927, the Zwillingsmarinen's sailors are veterans of a conflict bound by silence and known by none except the Governor himself.\n\nThe young Zwillingsmarinen was inexperienced and outfitted with new, state-of-the-art ships. Seeing a vital need to train the sailors of the Zwillingsmarinen, Governor Horthy took to great lengths to ensure the competency of his navy. At first, dummies were used, but rising tensions in the West gave to a dark, secretive path. The raging Italian Civil War saw the Socialist Republic of Italy heavily financed by Franco-British efforts, and the Italian Republicans locked more and more into a stalemate.\n\nThe Zwillingsmarinen was deployed into the Tyrrhenian, lacking a designating banner - to anyone who laid eyes upon new designs bearing no sigil, it was a ghost fleet. Sailors of the Zwillingsmarinen were instructed to fire on small Syndicalist naval forces as part of live fire.\n\nThe results were, once again, highly beneficial to the inexperienced sailors. During the South Slavic Revolts, this ghost fleet took on a similar approach, attacking Croat forces while under the banner of the Kriegsmarine.\n\nBut in 1930, shortly after the beginning of the Great Milan Strike, which led to the Trans-Alpine Strikes, there came a call from tradition to the ghostly, nameless fleet. The Jolly Roger was raised in the Adriatic, and Socialist Italian vessels were terrorized into forking over cargo to be discreetly dropped at Zadar. While not the ultimate factor in Fiume's unquestioned economic port supremacy, it played a small role - one that, if the economy ever falls again, may once more raise the skull and crossbones in the name of the Governor."

Partying, gambling, and lively clubbing now have prominent places in the Fiumean downtown, raking in vast amounts of illicit cash, notwithstanding the already booming legitimate practices of the city. Exhausted sailors have found much comfort in the city's brothels, giving the beautiful, highly-demanded Italian women an illustrious reputation that few can hope to match. The reputation as an 'evening city' has transformed further into a night-life hotspot that come with matching amounts of intrigue.\n\nA notable new club rising to prominence, the Primavera, has nestled itself solidly on the Corso, attracting wild nightlife from across the lands. Noted for its fine Italian women and scrumptious pasta, not to mention its feared, lion-like guard staff, the Primavera club has attracted both vast amounts of fortune and many juicy secrets for the officials to pore over. City forces have made a deal with the Primavera, promising its protection against rival gangs, as its information networks benefit the government as the traffic from the ports benefits the Primavera. It's somewhat of a custom for some officials to visit the Primavera on days to share a dinner over some pasta and discuss the volatile matters that is the city's politics.\n\nThe Primavera is one of many clubs, but it forms the face of the new underground tunnels that are beginning to sprawl outside the city as we gain a new reputation as a city of tomorrow night's super moon."

The pirates, known to be under the banner of the new nation of Maritime Fiume, have to be dealt with later, as right now we have no means to combat them.\nThe effect of pirates on our exportations can bring our already skidding industry fully to a standstill.\nWhen reported to the commanders, every one of them placed the blame on admiral-turned-captain Miklos Horthy."
fiu.1.a:0 "It seems there was a traitor in our midst."
fiu.2.t:0 "Pirates Target Montenegro"
fiu.2.d:0 "The Montenegrin lands, rich in aluminium and chromium, have recently hit a roadblock - the appearance of pirates. These pirates, modernized and not in any way primitive, are using state of the art electronics and radio equipment to relay orders. They have successfully evaded our policemen for the time being, and few have ended up in cuffs. Any who do are soon broken out, creating a severe problem.\nThere is now a clamoring for police reform... it'll take a lot of resources, but it will bring us some of our resources back..."

fiu.3.t:0 "The Pirates in Fiume Offer a Deal"
fiu.3.d:0 "The Pirates of the Mediterranean, really just the Pirates in Fiume, have targeted our shipping in the Mediterranean for some time now. But now they come forth with a treaty - we give them protection, and they will give us a portion of our lost valuables back and will cease targeting our trade. This means that their large navy will be on our side.\nSome politicians in the government vehemently hate the idea, quoting their previous misdemeanors and distrust of the pirates, but other politicians note the reputation of Captain Miklos Horthy, who would never dishonor a treaty such as this. What shall we say to such a potentially useful deal?"
fiu.3.a:0 "This reeks of fraud and trickery."

fiu.4.d:0 "Our admiral Miklos Horthy has been packing bags for a while, but only today he announced his intentions with this luggage. He plans to move to Illyria, but refuses to specify the exact location of his new harbor.\nIt is rumored that he is moving to Fiume, next to the shipyards, with the pirates he turned to our side. Many have secretly plotted against him, trying to convince him to stay, and a few have directly petitioned to the Kaiser to stop Horthy from leaving. But it is now his turn to make a verdict; what shall he say?"
fiu.4.a:0 "Stay put, this seems fishy..."

fiu.5.d:0 "Today is the date marked for the completion of our first battleship. Crowds gather around the shipyards to see its unveiling, blocked by a gate. As the clock ticked closer to the moment of surprise, the people grew more curious.\nNow they rush in, gazing at our handiwork. Nicknamed the Admiral's Revenge by the people, it bears no official name yet - but it is a milestone in our short history. It is marvelled by many. The flag was raised upon the ship, slowly but surely, to cheering crowds and wondering eyes.\nBut the second one slipped by unnoticed..."
fiu.5.a:0 "Anchors aweigh!"
fiu.6.t:0 "Pirates in Afyon"
fiu.6.d:0 "The pirates who have plagued the Adriatic Sea for too long now have decided that their stay must be lengthened. They approach our lands, stealing and looting our resources, bribing our workers with promises of meagre riches that will just slightly benefit them...\nIt is to be monitored carefully. While many in our government directly support the declaration of war, many others fear the pirate navy, nicknamed the Grand Armada. Afyon, while landlocked, has a dedicated smuggler network that siphon away unimaginable amounts of resources from our grasp. What shall we do?"

Horthy, the one who prowls the rich blue waters of the Mediterranean, leaving his mark on each drop the ships graze. The Adriatic has been struck with such a wave of water that they refuse to leave the coast, where they are closer to their larger guns. Soon not even the coast will be safe from the skull and crossbones..."

fiu.10.d:0 "While a patrol was out in the Persian Gulf today, they came across a lone oil tanker, unguarded. It seemed to be heading on what was supposed to be a quick trip. But fate had it that it was not so swift, as our men forced the white flag to be raised over the ship. Its course turned and the sailors returned safely to shore, we need to figure out what to do with this ship. Perhaps we could learn about it, its properties, and how to make it ourselves, if possible."

fiu.11.d:0 "The Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean used to be the hotspots of the pirates of old. Famous pirates such as Blackbeard roamed the waters of the aforementioned areas.\nToday the first ships were sent westwards to scout the area. It shall mean that we will return to the waters of the masters. We'll learn from them, and thus make history... if we haven't already. The trade of the Caribbean is rich. The oil fields north of the Gulf are ripe for the hijacking. It's a perfect place to pirate."

fiu.12.d:0 "Today a shady pair of men approached the authorities. They claimed to be the professional bribers. Although we have no idea who these two people are, there may some truth to their claim, if they were able to gain the attention of Horthy so easily. Now Horthy has a direct line of contact with these two unknown figures. We have a choice - hire them, or don't.\nThe pair claim to be able to bribe factory owners to give production over to us.\nWhat do we say?"
fiu.12.a:0 "Hire them!"
fiu.12.b:0 "No need to further tarnish our image."
fiu.13.t:0 "Pirate Activity Increasing Worldwide"
fiu.13.d:0 "It seems that our actions around the globe have inspired other would-be pirates to take the name of a pirate themselves - all over the world, world trade is slightly decreasing due to pirates. This will surely turn some of the international community's attention towards us, as if we weren't scorned already by our numerous "unlawful" actions. Whatever they say, we will proceed with our duties and jobs."

fiu.14.t:0 "Pirates Blockade Malta"
fiu.14.d:0 "Not on Horthy's order, rather on independent decision, it appears that some of our sailors have blockaded Malta. The Maltese government has denounced us furiously, and demands the immediate lifting. Of course, it is now our choice to decide. We can force them to surrender, to take the land for ourselves, or we could not do so, and apologize to the Maltese. Our image gets tarnished more by the day!"
fiu.14.a:0 "Order the lifting of the blockade and apologize."

fiu.15.d:0 "A blockade around Malta that suddenly appeared this morning has departed by nightfall. According to the Grand Admiral of Fiume, it was an accident and none of those ships were ordered to set up a blockade, and they were acting themselves not under any orders.\nMiklos Horthy has issued us a sincere apology, coupled with a little bit of money."
fiu.15.a:0 "Bullet dodged."
fiu.16.t:0 "The Blockade Remains!"
fiu.16.d:0 "The blockade that appeared around Malta this morning was apparently an accident, but a good accident according to the Grand Admiral of Fiume. They demand the immediate cessation and surrender of Malta.\nTheir claims are backed with a large and powerful navy... what should we do about this? Do we surrender? It's just an island..."

fiu.17.d:0 "This morning, the residents of Malta and its nearby islands were awakened to booming foghorns and the encirclement of the island with a large navy flying the Jolly Roger. It is clear that these are Fiumean pirates. The people of Malta cry for us to relieve them of the blockade, or else they shall starve and die out. The Grand Admiral of Fiume, Miklos Horthy, has not provided us a statement on the blockade yet, leading some to believe it was a mistake.\nNevertheless, this development is quite disturbing. It's best to try and find the diplomatic solution..."
fiu.17.a:0 "Order the immediate cessation of the blockade!"
fiu.18.t:0 "Hiding Our Wealth"
fiu.18.d:0 "The nation has too much money on its hands. Far too much. Some have suggested classic pirate and treasure tactics, such as burying a jackpot somewhere secluded. Many others have suggested state-funded vaults and capsules to be distributed in charted locations around the world. Option B, vaults, was decided upon.\nBy now, at least half of our wealth has been buried in vaults all over the world, from Cuba to Alaska to even Rhodesia and Papua, not mentioning the Gobi Desert. No international government has taken notice of our intrusion, and it'll take some time to extract the wealth. But hopefully by the time it's time to dig up our buried treasure, we'll have a better method of extraction."
fiu.18.a:0 "We'll hide it safely for time untold."
fiu.19.t:0 "Raid on Schonbrunn Palace!"
fiu.19.d:0 "Looters under the command of an unnamed lieutenant general have, with permission of the Grand Admiral, dug their way into the Austrian imperial palace, Schonbrunn Palace. The looters cleared out as much as they could, but returned disappointed, as there really wasn't much of extraordinary value. The Austrian authorities are furious at us, but are unable to do anything except further trash our already janky international reputation.\nMaybe the Hofburg will have more valuables?"
fiu.19.a:0 "Not as much as we expected..."
fiu.20.t:0 "Organized Looters Raid Schonbrunn Palace"
fiu.20.d:0 "In the middle of the night, eight masked men learned to be from Fiume and actively working for the government there snuck their way into Schonbrunn Palace, and killed all the guards and took a few valuables - but really not much. The most devastating loss was of life, not of materials and artifacts. It seems they are disappointed at their raid, so they may come back for more... may. We don't know anything about Fiume's next moves yet, but we can't do anything about their blatant crimes at this current moment."
fiu.20.a:0 "How nefarious!"
fiu.21.t:0 "The Choices at Hand"
fiu.21.d:0 "Fiume has found itself in the position to expand at last! There are a few options - Hungary, and Venice. Horthy has sometimes expressed interest in the takeover of Budapest and the restoration of Greater Hungary, and he is also interested in the great naval power of old that was Venice. He demands we pick now, and fight a war. What's the choice here? There can only be one, for if we fight both, we'll have overextended our reach."
fiu.21.a:0 "Restore the legacy of Venice!"
fiu.21.b:0 "Return Horthy to Hungary!"
fiu.22.t:0 "The Roots of Obsession"
fiu.22.d:0 "Horthy has found himself going with the ideals of money more and more lately. The other higher-ups of Fiume have taken notice, and behind his back worry of an impending obsession. A few of the highest ranks have already begun actively attempting to suppress any want for such copious amounts of money, but as we have so much money, it will be difficult. Horthy himself has noticed it strange that he is being talked to like this, with the whole pirate thing and all.\nFor now it's just a minor problem, but we should keep an eye on it."
fiu.22.a:0 "Hopefully he doesn't go crazy."
fiu.23.t:0 "Pirates in the Mediterranean"
fiu.23.d:0 "A recent upturn of pirates have been noticed in the Mediterranean Sea, specifically the Adriatic Sea, where captains have noticed far-away flags of the Jolly Roger waving on destroyers and submarines. No casualties have been noted yet, but it's wise to tell someone to get rid of them early. Horthy will do that job for us.\nHe's the best option, right?"
fiu.23.a:0 "Ask our trusted admiral Horthy to take them down."
fiu.24.t:0 "The Pen is Mightier than the Sword?"
fiu.24.d:0 "When Miklos Horthy, Admiral of the Austrian Empire, was approached with his orders to hunt down the pirates, he presented an alternate, "more profitable", method of dealing with the pirates. He suggests that we try to negotiate with them to stop targeting us, and in return we'll pay them just enough money to satisfy their greed. The proposition was a shock to the parties involved, who are split, as per usual, on the course of action. But it was decided in a vote that Horthy was to attempt diplomatic procedures first.\nHere's to hoping..."
fiu.24.a:0 "If you say so..."
fiu.25.t:0 "Horthy Orders Construction of Naval Facilities in Fiume"
fiu.25.d:0 "Miklos Horthy has requested the construction of dockyards and a large naval port to be constructed in the coastal Illyrian city of Fiume. When asked why, Horthy said to store the ships he intended to acquire soon, but did not specify how soon "soon" was. The construction workers over in Fiume have accepted his demands, and have begun porting materials over to the coast to build a large harbor.\nHow interesting."
fiu.25.a:0 "Why there?"
fiu.26.t:0 "Pirates Turn to Our Side"
fiu.26.d:0 "Admiral Miklos Horthy has told us of his success of diplomacy with the pirates in the Adriatic. He has turned them to our side successfully, and according to Horthy they will not target ships bearing the Austrian flag. However, this means that Illyrian ships will have to bear the Austrian flag in the case that they were already equipped with the Illyrian flag. A pirate delegate was with Horthy as well, who confirmed all of his statements, but something seemed wrong to a few members of the meeting. None of them can point it out, but they say that the pirates may have duped us.\nFor now, though, as long as they don't target our ships, we will mind our own business and not interfere with theirs."
fiu.26.a:0 "He did it, the mad man!"
fiu.27.t:0 "Horthy Settles in Fiume"
fiu.27.d:0 "After the Admiral had arrived in Illyria, further details arrived - he was to settle in Fiume, close to Slovenia and the coast. This was the place he constructed those shipyards, after all.\nIt's an appropriate location, hopefully the house he has prepared is enough for him, looking out at the dockyards he ordered..."
fiu.27.a:0 "A great place for him."
fiu.28.t:0 "Admiral Horthy to Join Us"
fiu.28.d:0 "Admiral Miklos Horthy of the Austrian Empire is moving to Illyria!\nAfter some discussion, he also is to become an admiral of the Illyrian Navy. A great victory for our fledgling naval ideas. Perhaps with him as the highest-ranking admiral of the navy we will be able to both command forced competently and expand appropriately.\nHis home shall be in Fiume, where he constructed naval facilities for reasons unknown to us. He refuses to expand the details on why he built the dockyards, and furthermore his reason for moving, and even his reason for going to Fiume of all places."
fiu.28.a:0 "Welcome!"
fiu.29.t:0 "The Truth about the Pirates"
fiu.29.d:0 "The pirates! Those suspicions harbored by a select few members of that long ago meeting were correct! It appears that Horthy did indeed make a treaty with them - but we were not the commanders of the pirate forces, he was! He gave the orders for the pirates to stop targeting Austrian ships, but now that he has been exposed, Austrian ships have been being torpedoed by the lurking pirate submarines."
fiu.29.a:0 "Horthy, you traitor!"
fiu.30.t:0 "Benefits of Money"
fiu.30.d:0 "The benefits of money are immense!\nIt makes the soul feel alive. It's the thing we love, from pennies to dollars any amount'll do.\nIt's no contest, there's only one thing we love the best!\nFrom every sight, smell, and sound we've ever heard, we'd give it all up for the vast earnings of money we've earned!\nIt's a song commonly recited by some of the sailors, whether they rank high or not. It's become a staple tune of the ships of Fiume, and has been proposed as the anthem - but that's silly!\n\nThe song also seems to have a strange effect on crabs. Nobody knows what causes it."
fiu.30.a:0 "There's nothing on earth like the feeling of greed!"
fiu.31.t:0 "Gold On Display"
fiu.31.d:0 "Our vast wealth has overflowed! The solution, according to Horthy? "Fiume is to be the City of Gold," he stated. The city has been laden with golden decorations dotted throughout the city, and one of the most notable golden concoctions is a very large statue of Grand Admiral Horthy, waving the banner of Fiume, and a small anchor attached to a rope on his other hand. It's quite the beautiful statue, and experts agree.\nStreet lights, store fronts, fences, anything that won't be run over. They are laden with pure, shiny gold."
fiu.31.a:0 "We might have TOO much... maybe...?"
fiu.32.t:0 "Horthy Orders Mandatory Jolly Rogers on Ships"
fiu.32.d:0 "The Jolly Roger is now an official flag of Fiume, the tertiary flag of the nation. Horthy dictated today that all ships are to have the Jolly Roger on board and able to be raised.\nIt's a curious move. He's really getting into all this pirate stuff, but oh well, the money and resources continue flowing into Fiume. While it's a city rumored to be horrible and a land of crime, in fact, Horthy has made it a free metropolis. To all citizens, we're the fairest of all rulers!\nAnd the Jolly Roger will continue to bless us with more money."
fiu.32.a:0 "Something's definitely different about him."
fiu.33.t:0 "Horthy Asks about Oak Island"
fiu.33.d:0 "Horthy shut the small leather book he was deeply invested into at last!\nImmediately he was asked what he was reading, and he responded with legends of treasure and lost artifacts. He seemed especially interested in the legend of Oak Island, an island in Nova Scotia, Canada. It'd take some time to stealthily dig up the landscape, but he insists we take a gander at finding Captain Kidd's lost treasure.\nGuess we have no choice..."
fiu.33.a:0 "Mount an expedition, let's see what lies there..."
fiu.34.t:0 "The Robber's Corps"
fiu.34.d:0 "A secret edict issued by Horthy and the secret agents of Maritime Fiume have ordered the creation of a extremely secret special operations corps. It is to be named the Robber's Corps, where professional heisters will be trained and put to use stealing all things great and small from the biggest and most secure banks, museums, and temples. Anything that's valuable to them are fit for harvest. The corps will be ready within a month, and within that month put on their first test at the largest targets. We know they'll do their jobs. At this time, no one expects the Fiumean Robbery!"
fiu.34.a:0 "We're literally criminals now."
fiu.35.t:0 "Captain Kidd's Treasure!"
fiu.35.d:0 "The radio gave Horthy the transmission he had wished for for so long, the pinpointing of the location of Captain Kidd's lost treasure. The treasure's contents are to be a surprise for him, but they state that the contents of the hoard are "as sizeable as we expected." Horthy is visibly excited about the whole thing, many note.\nThe pirate's life is paying off for Fiume!"
fiu.35.a:0 "Ha!"
fiu.36.t:0 "No sign of treasure."
fiu.36.d:0 "After many days of searching and digging, the party dispatched to Oak Island have come up empty-handed. Nothing. Zilch.\nMiklos Horthy was disappointed at the findings, but he accepted it and has already moved on to other sites of lost treasure. He hopes that one day Fiume can over at least one great mystery regarding old artifacts and treasure. We know, though, that eventually we shall. It's part of the job as a Fiumean, isn't it?"
fiu.36.a:0 "Too bad."

fiu.37.t:0 "Suspicions regarding the Pirates' Intentions"
fiu.37.d:0 "A treaty with such a dangerous band of individuals is bound to backfire eventually - and backfire it has. Suspicions regarding the intention of the "too clean" pirates we have made a treaty with have arisen, enough suspicion to allow for the demanding of a new policy towards them."
fiu.37.a:0 "Let's do this the quiet way."
fiu.37.b:0 "They are trustworthy for now."
fiu.38.t:0 "Defeat at sea!"
fiu.38.d:0 "The intended attack on the pirate fleet backfired immensely! The planes and ships assigned to sink the navy were initially met by a few submarines and destroyers, but within thirty minutes cruisers, destroyers, and more submarines had arrived. A few of the planes ran out of fuel, and all of our ships were damaged in some way. We only managed to sink a destroyer and two submarines, but at what cost?\nThere is no doubt Horthy will hear about our "treason"."
fiu.38.a:0 "Sounds like we underestimated them... who's calling us?"
fiu.39.t:0 "The Siege of Fiume"
fiu.39.d:0 "The small detachment of soldiers sent to Fiume to detain Horthy were met by fierce opposition from both opponents at sea and on land. The buildings were manned and ready, almost as if they were ready for our incursion. Immediately after the arrival of the soldiers ensued a hail of gunfire. A surprising number, far too large compared to expectations. Our men gained ground using a few armored vehicles, but it was in vain - their drivers were either narrowly shot dead or blown to smithereens by explosives.\nOn the other hand, the Illyrian government has not taken kindly to us attacking one of their cities, without their approval. This may be a problem..."
fiu.39.a:0 "Illyria...?"
fiu.40.t:0 "Illyria Intervenes Against Us"
fiu.40.d:0 "Illyrian banners waved over the hilltops, causing a halt of gunfire as Austrian soldiers turned to look at the delegation arriving. The delegation was more that absolutely furious. Anger was the delegation, with a torrent of yelling and fury directed at the Austrian commander at the siege. Eventually, after reaching no conclusion, the Illyrians departed and returned, armed with rifles. They demanded the immediate halt of the siege, and they will protect Fiume. A few gunshots were actually exchanged between Illyrian and Austrian soldiers as the Illyrians began to go back home. The commander issued an apology as fast as he could, but the damage has been done..."
fiu.40.a:0 "Is it too late?"
fiu.41.t:0 "The Free City of Fiume is declared"
fiu.41.d:0 "Horthy and his garrison, with supposed support from the Illyrians, have declared the Free City of Fiume. Why did the Illyrians allow it? Because they trusted the pirates enough. A stupid move, according to us, but it shall be seen the results of the "trust" in pirates. But for now the Illyrians have abandoned the city, likely due to its damage, and have issued harsh words to the Kaiser and the Austrian government overseeing the operation."
fiu.41.a:0 "Against the Habsburg menace Fiume stands!"

fiunews.1.d:0 "Last night, what could be the greatest robbery off all time so far was pulled off in the famous British Museum. Holding the last vestiges of the British monarchy with beautiful artifacts, what is suspected to be a team of at least four burglars snuck into the museum and either bribed the guards, sleepy from an extended shift, or killed the ones who attempted resistance. Numerous valuables were pillaged from the museum, including Chinese, Indian, and Egyptian artifacts. Paintings were swiped off their walls, and by the time the alarm was finally raised at the quiet museum, it was too late - the thieves had driven away into the night.\nUpon closer inspection, one of the few remaining artifacts was the Rosetta Stone, which had been slightly damaged by knives and partially chipped. The world is in shock of such a tasteless thievery..."

fiunews.2.d:0 "It seems that the theft of the Mona Lisa nearly three decades ago was not enough for the painting, as when French authorities checked on the Louvre this morning, they found the museum looted, in ruin, and ransacked. The coveted Mona Lisa was one of the ransacked valuables, its wall empty. A few statues found themselves out of the Louvre, stolen by merciless thieves.\nEven Liberty Leading the People, one of the most famous French paintings, was stolen - among numerous Greek statues. The common thought of how the robbery occurred was that a distraction was created while a team of thieves broke into the grand museum, swiped what they wanted, and drove off in at least four cars' worth of artworks. It is rumored that the thieves are headed to the Mediterranean coast, awaited by ships to take them home."

fiunews.3.d:0 "America, having a recent turbulent history, has been dealt a heavy cultural blow - as its prized museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was found nearly empty this morning, along with a broken alarm system. Paintings stolen included ones by Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Peter Bruegel, and Raphael. One of the few paintings left was a rather inappropriate painting, titled "Beauty Revealed", which was damaged and censored by the thieves. Other than it, the most valuable paintings, and many of the older ones, were not found present. It is thought that at least five thieves broke into the museum at night, severed the alarm, and quieted any guards with cheap bribes or knives and suppressed weaponry. "Quite a mess, I'd say. A shame too," said an authority on scene. The last sighting of anyone suspicious nearby was a quiet road packed with six cars heading eastwards."

With much of its gold supply purloined by vicious thieves, the vault was repeatedly cracked by threats on a novice security guard. The authorities were alerted to the crime upon the smell of smoke reaching the public from the vault, found to be burning piles of bank notes. The blaze claimed much of the bank, but as of now it has been contained. The Germans have denounced the thieves, of course, while there is no knowledge on the whereabouts of the thieves. "It'd be such a large effort to do this," said a German police officer, who also commented that it'd take at least eight thieves to pull off such a heist, arguably the greatest of the time. The world has reacted similarly to the Germans, aside from the Internationale, who increasingly guard their cultural sites."

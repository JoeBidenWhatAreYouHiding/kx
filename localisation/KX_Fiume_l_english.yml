FIU_HORTHY_DESC:0 "Miklos Horthy, the Grand Admiral of the Grand Armada of the infamous Pirates of the Mediterranean, never really expected to ever be in charge of a famous pirate fleet, much less so in this day and age. But here he is.\nUsing promises of Austrian riches and gold, Horthy was able to sway the already existing and leaderless pirate flotillas under his command with ease. The flotillas were merged into a single fleet, known as the Grand Armada, and from then history was made. As Horthy portrayed himself as an admiral, and not a pirate captain, the Austrian government was easily duped by his facade. The facade allowed for Horthy to operate the pirates as he saw fit, but without damaging the Austrian trade - as was the agreement he made with the government when he pledged to "tame" the pirates.\nThe Grand Arsenal of Fiume was established soon after, and then Admiral Horthy found himself in Illyria, specifically in the small city of Fiume. The city welcomed the fleet with open arms, and the grand shipyard as well. As the fleet grew in size, Horthy found it acceptable to quietly seat himself as the mayor of Fiume, with a mutual agreement.\n\nNow Horthy finds Fiume as an independent nation, a merry band of pirates... with great ambitions. Horthy is determined to see his fleet prosper - and he will do anything in his power to ensure it."

The Grand Admiral of Fiume, Miklos Horthy, has not provided us a statement on the blockade yet, leading some to believe it was a mistake.\nNevertheless, this development is quite disturbing.

Option B, vaults, was decided upon.\nBy now, at least half of our wealth has been buried in vaults all over the world, from Cuba to Alaska to even Rhodesia and Papua, not mentioning the Gobi Desert. No international government has taken notice of our intrusion, and it'll take some time to extract the wealth.

The looters cleared out as much as they could, but returned disappointed, as there really wasn't much of extraordinary value. The Austrian authorities are furious at us, but are unable to do anything except further trash our already janky international reputation.\nMaybe the Hofburg will have more valuables?"
fiu.19.a:0 "Not as much as we expected..."
fiu.20.t:0 "Organized Looters Raid Schonbrunn Palace"
fiu.20.d:0 "In the middle of the night, eight masked men learned to be from Fiume and actively working for the government there snuck their way into Schonbrunn Palace, and killed all the guards and took a few valuables - but really not much. The most devastating loss was of life, not of materials and artifacts. It seems they are disappointed at their raid, so they may come back for more... may. We don't know anything about Fiume's next moves yet, but we can't do anything about their blatant crimes at this current moment."
fiu.20.a:0 "How nefarious!"
fiu.21.t:0 "The Choices at Hand"
fiu.21.d:0 "Fiume has found itself in the position to expand at last! There are a few options - Hungary, and Venice. Horthy has sometimes expressed interest in the takeover of Budapest and the restoration of Greater Hungary, and he is also interested in the great naval power of old that was Venice. He demands we pick now, and fight a war. What's the choice here? There can only be one, for if we fight both, we'll have overextended our reach."
fiu.21.a:0 "Restore the legacy of Venice!"
fiu.21.b:0 "Return Horthy to Hungary!"
fiu.22.t:0 "The Roots of Obsession"
fiu.22.d:0 "Horthy has found himself going with the ideals of money more and more lately. The other higher-ups of Fiume have taken notice, and behind his back worry of an impending obsession. A few of the highest ranks have already begun actively attempting to suppress any want for such copious amounts of money, but as we have so much money, it will be difficult. Horthy himself has noticed it strange that he is being talked to like this, with the whole pirate thing and all.\nFor now it's just a minor problem, but we should keep an eye on it."
fiu.22.a:0 "Hopefully he doesn't go crazy."
fiu.23.t:0 "Pirates in the Mediterranean"
fiu.23.d:0 "A recent upturn of pirates have been noticed in the Mediterranean Sea, specifically the Adriatic Sea, where captains have noticed far-away flags of the Jolly Roger waving on destroyers and submarines. No casualties have been noted yet, but it's wise to tell someone to get rid of them early. Horthy will do that job for us.\nHe's the best option, right?"
fiu.23.a:0 "Ask our trusted admiral Horthy to take them down."
fiu.24.t:0 "The Pen is Mightier than the Sword?"
fiu.24.d:0 "When Miklos Horthy, Admiral of the Austrian Empire, was approached with his orders to hunt down the pirates, he presented an alternate, "more profitable", method of dealing with the pirates. He suggests that we try to negotiate with them to stop targeting us, and in return we'll pay them just enough money to satisfy their greed. The proposition was a shock to the parties involved, who are split, as per usual, on the course of action. But it was decided in a vote that Horthy was to attempt diplomatic procedures first.\nHere's to hoping..."
fiu.24.a:0 "If you say so..."
fiu.25.t:0 "Horthy Orders Construction of Naval Facilities in Fiume"
fiu.25.d:0 "Miklos Horthy has requested the construction of dockyards and a large naval port to be constructed in the coastal Illyrian city of Fiume. When asked why, Horthy said to store the ships he intended to acquire soon, but did not specify how soon "soon" was. The construction workers over in Fiume have accepted his demands, and have begun porting materials over to the coast to build a large harbor.\nHow interesting."
fiu.25.a:0 "Why there?"
fiu.26.t:0 "Pirates Turn to Our Side"
fiu.26.d:0 "Admiral Miklos Horthy has told us of his success of diplomacy with the pirates in the Adriatic. He has turned them to our side successfully, and according to Horthy they will not target ships bearing the Austrian flag. However, this means that Illyrian ships will have to bear the Austrian flag in the case that they were already equipped with the Illyrian flag. A pirate delegate was with Horthy as well, who confirmed all of his statements, but something seemed wrong to a few members of the meeting. None of them can point it out, but they say that the pirates may have duped us.\nFor now, though, as long as they don't target our ships, we will mind our own business and not interfere with theirs."
fiu.26.a:0 "He did it, the mad man!"
fiu.27.t:0 "Horthy Settles in Fiume"
fiu.27.d:0 "After the Admiral had arrived in Illyria, further details arrived - he was to settle in Fiume, close to Slovenia and the coast. This was the place he constructed those shipyards, after all.\nIt's an appropriate location, hopefully the house he has prepared is enough for him, looking out at the dockyards he ordered..."
fiu.27.a:0 "A great place for him."
fiu.28.t:0 "Admiral Horthy to Join Us"
fiu.28.d:0 "Admiral Miklos Horthy of the Austrian Empire is moving to Illyria!\nAfter some discussion, he also is to become an admiral of the Illyrian Navy. A great victory for our fledgling naval ideas. Perhaps with him as the highest-ranking admiral of the navy we will be able to both command forced competently and expand appropriately.\nHis home shall be in Fiume, where he constructed naval facilities for reasons unknown to us. He refuses to expand the details on why he built the dockyards, and furthermore his reason for moving, and even his reason for going to Fiume of all places."
fiu.28.a:0 "Welcome!"
fiu.29.t:0 "The Truth about the Pirates"
fiu.29.d:0 "The pirates! Those suspicions harbored by a select few members of that long ago meeting were correct! It appears that Horthy did indeed make a treaty with them - but we were not the commanders of the pirate forces, he was! He gave the orders for the pirates to stop targeting Austrian ships, but now that he has been exposed, Austrian ships have been being torpedoed by the lurking pirate submarines."
fiu.29.a:0 "Horthy, you traitor!"
fiu.30.t:0 "Benefits of Money"
fiu.30.d:0 "The benefits of money are immense!\nIt makes the soul feel alive. It's the thing we love, from pennies to dollars any amount'll do.\nIt's no contest, there's only one thing we love the best!\nFrom every sight, smell, and sound we've ever heard, we'd give it all up for the vast earnings of money we've earned!\nIt's a song commonly recited by some of the sailors, whether they rank high or not. It's become a staple tune of the ships of Fiume, and has been proposed as the anthem - but that's silly!\n\nThe song also seems to have a strange effect on crabs. Nobody knows what causes it."
fiu.30.a:0 "There's nothing on earth like the feeling of greed!"
fiu.31.t:0 "Gold On Display"
fiu.31.d:0 "Our vast wealth has overflowed! The solution, according to Horthy? "Fiume is to be the City of Gold," he stated. The city has been laden with golden decorations dotted throughout the city, and one of the most notable golden concoctions is a very large statue of Grand Admiral Horthy, waving the banner of Fiume, and a small anchor attached to a rope on his other hand. It's quite the beautiful statue, and experts agree.\nStreet lights, store fronts, fences, anything that won't be run over. They are laden with pure, shiny gold."
fiu.31.a:0 "We might have TOO much... maybe...?"
fiu.32.t:0 "Horthy Orders Mandatory Jolly Rogers on Ships"
fiu.32.d:0 "The Jolly Roger is now an official flag of Fiume, the tertiary flag of the nation. Horthy dictated today that all ships are to have the Jolly Roger on board and able to be raised.\nIt's a curious move. He's really getting into all this pirate stuff, but oh well, the money and resources continue flowing into Fiume. While it's a city rumored to be horrible and a land of crime, in fact, Horthy has made it a free metropolis. To all citizens, we're the fairest of all rulers!\nAnd the Jolly Roger will continue to bless us with more money."
fiu.32.a:0 "Something's definitely different about him."
fiu.33.t:0 "Horthy Asks about Oak Island"
fiu.33.d:0 "Horthy shut the small leather book he was deeply invested into at last!\nImmediately he was asked what he was reading, and he responded with legends of treasure and lost artifacts. He seemed especially interested in the legend of Oak Island, an island in Nova Scotia, Canada. It'd take some time to stealthily dig up the landscape, but he insists we take a gander at finding Captain Kidd's lost treasure.\nGuess we have no choice..."
fiu.33.a:0 "Mount an expedition, let's see what lies there..."
fiu.34.t:0 "The Robber's Corps"
fiu.34.d:0 "A secret edict issued by Horthy and the secret agents of Maritime Fiume have ordered the creation of a extremely secret special operations corps. It is to be named the Robber's Corps, where professional heisters will be trained and put to use stealing all things great and small from the biggest and most secure banks, museums, and temples. Anything that's valuable to them are fit for harvest. The corps will be ready within a month, and within that month put on their first test at the largest targets. We know they'll do their jobs. At this time, no one expects the Fiumean Robbery!"
fiu.34.a:0 "We're literally criminals now."
fiu.35.t:0 "Captain Kidd's Treasure!"
fiu.35.d:0 "The radio gave Horthy the transmission he had wished for for so long, the pinpointing of the location of Captain Kidd's lost treasure. The treasure's contents are to be a surprise for him, but they state that the contents of the hoard are "as sizeable as we expected." Horthy is visibly excited about the whole thing, many note.\nThe pirate's life is paying off for Fiume!"
fiu.35.a:0 "Ha!"
fiu.36.t:0 "No sign of treasure."
fiu.36.d:0 "After many days of searching and digging, the party dispatched to Oak Island have come up empty-handed. Nothing. Zilch.\nMiklos Horthy was disappointed at the findings, but he accepted it and has already moved on to other sites of lost treasure. He hopes that one day Fiume can over at least one great mystery regarding old artifacts and treasure. We know, though, that eventually we shall. It's part of the job as a Fiumean, isn't it?"
fiu.36.a:0 "Too bad."

fiu.37.t:0 "Suspicions regarding the Pirates' Intentions"
fiu.37.d:0 "A treaty with such a dangerous band of individuals is bound to backfire eventually - and backfire it has. Suspicions regarding the intention of the "too clean" pirates we have made a treaty with have arisen, enough suspicion to allow for the demanding of a new policy towards them."
fiu.37.a:0 "Let's do this the quiet way."
fiu.37.b:0 "They are trustworthy for now."
fiu.38.t:0 "Defeat at sea!"
fiu.38.d:0 "The intended attack on the pirate fleet backfired immensely! The planes and ships assigned to sink the navy were initially met by a few submarines and destroyers, but within thirty minutes cruisers, destroyers, and more submarines had arrived. A few of the planes ran out of fuel, and all of our ships were damaged in some way. We only managed to sink a destroyer and two submarines, but at what cost?\nThere is no doubt Horthy will hear about our "treason"."
fiu.38.a:0 "Sounds like we underestimated them... who's calling us?"
fiu.39.t:0 "The Siege of Fiume"
fiu.39.d:0 "The small detachment of soldiers sent to Fiume to detain Horthy were met by fierce opposition from both opponents at sea and on land. The buildings were manned and ready, almost as if they were ready for our incursion. Immediately after the arrival of the soldiers ensued a hail of gunfire. A surprising number, far too large compared to expectations. Our men gained ground using a few armored vehicles, but it was in vain - their drivers were either narrowly shot dead or blown to smithereens by explosives.\nOn the other hand, the Illyrian government has not taken kindly to us attacking one of their cities, without their approval. This may be a problem..."
fiu.39.a:0 "Illyria...?"
fiu.40.t:0 "Illyria Intervenes Against Us"
fiu.40.d:0 "Illyrian banners waved over the hilltops, causing a halt of gunfire as Austrian soldiers turned to look at the delegation arriving. The delegation was more that absolutely furious. Anger was the delegation, with a torrent of yelling and fury directed at the Austrian commander at the siege. Eventually, after reaching no conclusion, the Illyrians departed and returned, armed with rifles. They demanded the immediate halt of the siege, and they will protect Fiume. A few gunshots were actually exchanged between Illyrian and Austrian soldiers as the Illyrians began to go back home. The commander issued an apology as fast as he could, but the damage has been done..."
fiu.40.a:0 "Is it too late?"
fiu.41.t:0 "The Free City of Fiume is declared"
fiu.41.d:0 "Horthy and his garrison, with supposed support from the Illyrians, have declared the Free City of Fiume. Why did the Illyrians allow it? Because they trusted the pirates enough. A stupid move, according to us, but it shall be seen the results of the "trust" in pirates. But for now the Illyrians have abandoned the city, likely due to its damage, and have issued harsh words to the Kaiser and the Austrian government overseeing the operation."
fiu.41.a:0 "Against the Habsburg menace Fiume stands!"
fiu.41.b:0 "We'll get them eventually..."

fiunews.1.d:0 "Last night, what could be the greatest robbery off all time so far was pulled off in the famous British Museum. Holding the last vestiges of the British monarchy with beautiful artifacts, what is suspected to be a team of at least four burglars snuck into the museum and either bribed the guards, sleepy from an extended shift, or killed the ones who attempted resistance. Numerous valuables were pillaged from the museum, including Chinese, Indian, and Egyptian artifacts. Paintings were swiped off their walls, and by the time the alarm was finally raised at the quiet museum, it was too late - the thieves had driven away into the night.\nUpon closer inspection, one of the few remaining artifacts was the Rosetta Stone, which had been slightly damaged by knives and partially chipped. The world is in shock of such a tasteless thievery..."
fiunews.1.a:0 "No longer shall they be imprisoned!"

fiunews.2.t:0 "Mona Lisa Swiped Once More!"
fiunews.2.d:0 "It seems that the theft of the Mona Lisa nearly three decades ago was not enough for the painting, as when French authorities checked on the Louvre this morning, they found the museum looted, in ruin, and ransacked. The coveted Mona Lisa was one of the ransacked valuables, its wall empty. A few statues found themselves out of the Louvre, stolen by merciless thieves.\nEven Liberty Leading the People, one of the most famous French paintings, was stolen - among numerous Greek statues. The common thought of how the robbery occurred was that a distraction was created while a team of thieves broke into the grand museum, swiped what they wanted, and drove off in at least four cars' worth of artworks. It is rumored that the thieves are headed to the Mediterranean coast, awaited by ships to take them home."
fiunews.2.a:0 "Come to where you belong."

fiunews.2.c:0 "Vincenzo Peruggia struck back, it seems."

fiunews.3.t:0 "Plunder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art"
fiunews.3.d:0 "America, having a recent turbulent history, has been dealt a heavy cultural blow - as its prized museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was found nearly empty this morning, along with a broken alarm system. Paintings stolen included ones by Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Peter Bruegel, and Raphael. One of the few paintings left was a rather inappropriate painting, titled "Beauty Revealed", which was damaged and censored by the thieves. Other than it, the most valuable paintings, and many of the older ones, were not found present. It is thought that at least five thieves broke into the museum at night, severed the alarm, and quieted any guards with cheap bribes or knives and suppressed weaponry. "Quite a mess, I'd say. A shame too," said an authority on scene. The last sighting of anyone suspicious nearby was a quiet road packed with six cars heading eastwards."
fiunews.3.a:0 "Relish in the spoils, men!"

fiunews.4.d:0 "The Deutsche Bank, the largest bank of the German Empire, was found looted this morning! With much of its gold supply purloined by vicious thieves, the vault was repeatedly cracked by threats on a novice security guard. The authorities were alerted to the crime upon the smell of smoke reaching the public from the vault, found to be burning piles of bank notes. The blaze claimed much of the bank, but as of now it has been contained. The Germans have denounced the thieves, of course, while there is no knowledge on the whereabouts of the thieves. "It'd be such a large effort to do this," said a German police officer, who also commented that it'd take at least eight thieves to pull off such a heist, arguably the greatest of the time. The world has reacted similarly to the Germans, aside from the Internationale, who increasingly guard their cultural sites."
fiunews.4.a:0 "Operation successful."

One of the most popular thoughts as to the location of Kidd's treasure was on Oak Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. A team of reportedly Fiumeans had gained access to the island, and it was reported to Admiral Miklos Horthy of the find as soon as it was discovered.\nHorthy made a broadcast, telling of the finding of Captain Kidd's buried treasure, and the entire bountry of gold was loaded onto a ship and sailed back to Fiume.\nHorthy has repeatedly stated his intent to find more lost and buried treasure, but it remains to be seen if any more will be uncovered."

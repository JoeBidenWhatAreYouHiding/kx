 KRLAT.1.t:0 "Bittersweet Victory"
 KRLAT.1.d:0 "For seven hundred years Latvia was subjugated - lorded over by Germans, Poles, Swedes, and Russians one after the other. Many Latvians, however, never lost hope. They knew that freedom would one day come. The Latvian National Awakening of the 19th century enkindled similar dreams throughout the entire populace. The Young Latvians and the New Current movement in particular led to the development of modern Latvian nationalism and politics.\n\nAt the end of the Weltkrieg, these Latvian patriots at last had the chance to fight for freedom, and yet, this struggle was in vain. Divided between exiled movements in Riga, Petrograd and Moscow, the Latvians never made a true declaration of independence like their Estonian brothers had - the socialist Iskolat in Valmiera was destroyed by German arms, the Latvian National Council in Petrograd never returned, and the Riga Democratic Bloc surrendered to the new Baltic German order. Latvian nationalism did not die out, however, and returned even stronger, embraced by socialist exiles in the Union of Britain and the large Latvian community in Russia. The collapse of the United Baltic Duchy has fulfilled the dream of so many at long last - Latvia is finally an independent state.\n\nThe capital of the Latvian people, Riga, however, fell just out of the grasp of the Forest Brothers, and a German redoubt remains in control of the city, preparing for an opportunity to snuff out Latvia's independence. This insult to the pride of our nation must never be forgotten - and one way or another, the jewel of the Baltic Sea will return to its rightful owners. As the world inches closer to war, Latvia is sure to play a role."
 KRLAT.1.a:0 "Latvians, never forget Riga!"

 KRLAT.2.t:0 "Dual Rule in Latvia"
 KRLAT.2.d:0 "While Estonian nationalists generally supported a unified provisional government in the aftermath of the collapse of the Russia Empire, Latvian partisans remained internally divided until the bitter end. A similar, though less dysfunctional dynamic has emerged once again.\n\nIn the east, Jānis Kurelis heads a faction of trained exiles from Russia and the so-called "Imanta Regiment". Inspired by the ideas of his mentor, Kārlis Ulmanis, Kurelis envisions a uniquely Latvian political system, strong enough to weather the battles yet to come.\n\nIn the west, centred around Liepāja, lies the so-called "Second Iskolat", organised by the Revolutionary Latvian Legion and led by Jēkabs Peterss. They descend from the Latvian Bolsheviks who escaped the failing October Revolution to join their peers in the West, and have returned home to turn Latvia into a model Marxist-Leninist state.\n\nTo ease the brewing conflict between these two factions, a Constitutional Convention has been called in Valmiera to decide the nature of the new state - without the backing of either one of the main players, however, it is effectively powerless."
 KRLAT.2.a:0 "There can only be one regime in Latvia."

 KRLAT.3.t:0 "Manteuffel's Insurgency"
 KRLAT.3.d:0 "The collapse of the United Baltic Duchy was not as definitive as it first appeared, and low-level fighting continues between Latvian and isolated German units. The Second Baltic German Battalion of the Baltische Landeswehr, commanded by Hans von Manteuffel-Szoege, has proven a particularly tough nut to crack. Now known as the \"Eiserne Division\", they have torn a path of blood and fire through the Latvian countryside with the ultimate goal of restoring the Duchy.\n\nTheir supplies and ammunition are running low, however, and the Germans of Riga have been thusfar unable to provide them much assistance - as such, with few options left, Manteuffel has ordered an all-or-nothing attack on Valmiera, the seat of the Constitutional Convention and the headquarters of Kurelis's clique. Despite attrition and their partial degeneration into a horde of looting brigands, the Eiserne Division remains a powerful force, and is equally matched with its opponents in the Valmiera region.\n\nKurelis and his assembled men could potentially withstand this final German assault by themselves, but perhaps they should put politics aside for a moment, request aid from the Iskolat, and stand together with the Jēkabs Peterss and the Revolutionary Latvian Legion?"
 KRLAT.3.a:0 "We will do this ourselves,\nthe socialists are not to be trusted."
 KRLAT.3.b:0 "It’s too dangerous, we must\nreach out to Peterss and the reds."

 KRLAT.4.t:0 "Kurelis's Latvia"
 KRLAT.4.d:0 "Kurelis has managed to crush the last remnants of the Eiserne Division alone, and his position as the hero of the people has become even more eminent.\nIn his actions, he has seized upon his initial momentum and general enthusiasm among the wider populace. The Constitutional Convention in Valmiera has become a forgone conclusion, with support for Kurelis far outweighing that for Peterss, and indeed, several prominent members of the Revolutionary Latvian Legion are thinking twice about their leadership.\n Had Peterss been a in a stronger position, more resistance would likely have been expected. But for now, the dreams of a Second Iskolat Republic are sidelined, as it is Kurelis’ vision that will lead Latvia forward!"
 KRLAT.4.a:0 "Latvia for Latvians!"

 KRLAT.5.t:0 "Peterss's Latvia"
 KRLAT.5.d:0 "This morning Kurelis was discovered hiding in Liepāja by socialist militiamen. Comrade Peterss and his men managed to overcome Kurelis's contingent, capturing Kurelis himself. A socialist Republic, known as the "Iskolat" was quickly declared, though some regions have been slow to recognise the change."
 KRLAT.5.a:0 "Now we build real socialism!"

 KRLAT.6.t:0 "Latvia wishes to join the Third Internationale"
 KRLAT.6.d:0 "We have received a diplomatic message from our comrades in Eastern Europe - Latvia, also known as the Iskolat Republic, wishes to finally put an end to their enforced neutrality and join the Third Internationale as an equal partner. Should we accept the Latvian Leninists into the worldwide Syndicalist community?"
 KRLAT.6.a:0 "Of course!"
 KRLAT.6.b:0 "We'd rather not."

 KRLAT.7.t:0 "We are accepted"
 KRLAT.7.d:0 "The Internationale has accepted our fledgling republic into their alliance."
 KRLAT.7.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 KRLAT.8.t:0 "We have been denied"
 KRLAT.8.d:0 "The Internationale has refused to accept our fledgling republic into their alliance."
 KRLAT.8.a:0 "Damn."

 KRLAT.9.t:0 "The Wind Blows"
 KRLAT.9.d:0 "When the Second Weltkrieg began, the loss of Latvia and Estonia strangely provided protection to Riga. The two states, Latvia and Estonia, served as a neutral bulwark which protected Riga from the full force of the Russian invasion. The Riga defence forces and their commanders, however, understood the fleeting nature of this state of affairs. Patrols became more frequent, logistics systems were strengthened, and a system of food rationing was implemented for general population.\n\nIncreasing Latvian military movement near the city, sometimes even in the range of Rigan artillery outposts seemed to prove the validity of the Rigan Defence Force's fears - although the German troops opted to not fire upon the Latvians just yet. Enemy artillery is stationed in the surroundings of the city, preparing to bombard hastily assembled barricades and fortifications. The Latvians remain silent in diplomatic channels, as if they have forgotten that Riga exists entirely.\n\nBoth sides had something to finish from their last engagements in 1936. The Latvians - to evict the Germans from their homeland at last, to reclaim Riga, their one and only capital. The Baltic Germans - to destroy this insurgency for good, and reclaim their birthright.\n\nA chilling wind blows across the streets of Riga, and with it, follows a barrage of yells, all shouting the same thing."
 KRLAT.9.a:0 "To the barricades!"

 KRLAT.10.t:0 "The Assembly Convenes"
 KRLAT.10.d:0 "An extraordinary session of the Constitutional Assembly has been called in Liepāja with the aim of rewriting the provisional Latvian constitution in the face of increased political dominance by Kurelis and his clique. The Assembly cannot help but cede a large degree of power to Kurelis and the executive, a stark contrast from the political structure laid out provisionally, but many questions remain unresolved."
 KRLAT.10.a:0 "We have a lot to sort out."

 KRLAT.11.t:0 "The Question of Powers of the Seima"
 KRLAT.11.d:0 "While the Seima shall have the nominal authority to enact legislation independent of the executive, members of Kurelis's faction hold differing views on the degree of direct oversight the office should have over legislative action."
 KRLAT.11.a:0 "Don't water down the legislature"
 KRLAT.11.b:0 "The President shall have unrestricted veto powers"

 KRLAT.12.t:0 "Meeting place of the Seima"
 KRLAT.12.d:0 "The Latvian constitution in exile held that the Latvian assembly should convene in Riga and only in Riga. However, it did not consider the special circumstances the country now faces. The question remains: should we formally establish the assembly in Liepāja or continue to only operate from the city de-facto awaiting the liberation of Riga."
 KRLAT.12.a:0 "Riga is our capital."
 KRLAT.12.b:0 "Recognise the reality of the situation - Liepāja."

 KRLAT.13.t:0 "The Generalis"
 KRLAT.13.d:0 "The extraordinary challenges facing Latvia at the moment have won wide popular support for Kurelis's authoritative actions. While Kurelis shall remain president at least until the end of the current crisis, some have called for his rule to be plainly written into the constitution - president-for-life."
 KRLAT.13.a:0 "Write it into the document."
 KRLAT.13.b:0 "He shall remain only until the crisis passes."

 KRLAT.14.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 KRLAT.14.d:0 "Latvia is in a difficult position on the global stage. Indeed the country is under diplomatic pressure from both Germany and Russia, and the threat of invasion from either of those powers looms large. The provisional constitution gave the Seima a role in treaty-making and diplomatic appointments, with the assent of the body required for treaties to be ratified and posts to be filled. While awkward, and given Kurelis's control over the Seima, a bit of a farce, some call for this quirk of the constitution to be kept intact."
 KRLAT.14.a:0 "The Seima must approve the government's decisions"
 KRLAT.14.b:0 "Only the Generalis knows what is good"

 KRLAT.15.t:0 "Responsibilities of Powers"
 KRLAT.15.d:0 "The last major debate of the Constituent Assembly concerns whether or not the president can unilaterally dissolve the legislature in perpetuity. While doing so would be highly inefficient and place and outsized burden on the administration, allowing for such under the right circumstances would all but eliminate the independence of the legislature at least for the remainder of the crisis."
 KRLAT.15.a:0 "The Executive has no Power over the Seima."
 KRLAT.15.b:0 "The president may dissolve the Seima."

 KRLAT.16.t:0 "A Strong Executive"
 KRLAT.16.d:0 "The directorial system has been all but eliminated, with the office of the president assuming greater authority. General Kurelis, while nominally neither head of the government nor the state, now directs most functions of the central government."
 KRLAT.16.a:0 "A hero at the helm."

 KRLAT.17.t:0 "Executive Authority Constrained"
 KRLAT.17.d:0 "The directorial system established after the collapse of the United Baltic Duchy has been entrenched while the authority and role of the state has grown."
 KRLAT.17.a:0 "Onwards!"

 KRLAT.18.t:0 "Integration of Dvinsk"
 KRLAT.18.d:0 "The administration of Dvinsk has become increasingly ordinary. Owing to the area's strong Latvian identity, it has quickly been integrated into our administration."
 KRLAT.18.a:0 "Latvia is whole!"

 KRLAT.19.t:0 "Economic Stabilisation"
 KRLAT.19.d:0 "The economic crisis which followed the dissolution of the United Baltic Duchy has finally subsided.\n\nWe are now in a position where our economy is functioning smoothly, as the measures we have undertaken after independence have come to fruition."
 KRLAT.19.a:0 "Great!"

 KRLAT.20.t:0 "Political Stabilisation"
 KRLAT.20.d:0 "The political crisis which followed the dissolution of the United Baltic Duchy has finally subsided.\n\nThe independent Latvian administration has become thoroughly entrenched."
 KRLAT.20.a:0 "Great!"

 KRLAT.21.t:0 "Kurelis's Latvia"
 KRLAT.21.d:0 "Kurelis has convinced the members of the Constitutional Convention that Peterss’ goal in forming a socialist state will result in nothing more than an immediate loss of our independence. The socialists’ attempts to work with the workers in the city of Riga will only mean greater German influence in our country, invariably leading to German re-annexation.\nIn this attack on Peterss and his movement, Kurelis has seized upon his previous momentum and general enthusiasm among the wider populace. The Constitutional Convention in Valmiera has swayed in his favour, with support for Kurelis now outweighing that for Peterss.\nHad Peterss been a in a stronger position, more resistance would likely have been expected. But for now, the dreams of a Second Iskolat Republic are sidelined, as it is Kurelis’ vision that will lead Latvia forward!"
 KRLAT.21.a:0 "Latvia for Latvians!"

 KRLAT.22.t:0 "Kurelis's Latvia"
 KRLAT.22.d:0 "Kurelis has convinced enough members of the Constitutional Convention that Peterss’ is unfit to lead to lead the country. Such is his cowardice, that the socialist leader cannot even bring himself to defend his own position in the Convention. If this is the case, how could we expect such a man to ensure Latvia’s independence, let alone retake our capital? \nIn this attack on Peterss and his movement, Kurelis has seized upon his previous momentum and general enthusiasm among the wider populace. The Constitutional Convention in Valmiera has swayed in his favour, with support for Kurelis now outweighing that for Peterss.\nHad Peterss been a in a stronger position, more resistance would likely have been expected. But for now, the dreams of a Second Iskolat Republic are sidelined, as it is Kurelis’ vision that will lead Latvia forward!"
 KRLAT.22.a:0 "Latvia for Latvians!"

 ISKO.1.t:0 "The Convention Convenes"
 ISKO.1.d:0 "The Eiserne Division were poised to launch one last desperate attempt to take Valmiera, and with it, the Constitutional Convention. Seeing Latvia’s newly-gained independence to be too fragile to risk losing to inter-partisan squabbling, Kurelis took it upon himself to call upon his political rivals for aid.\nJust as Manteuffel’s men were set to assail Kurelis’ position, Peterss and his Revolutionary Latvian Legion ambushed them, and with support coming from Valmiera, the final remnant of the German forces were made short work of.\nWith the independence of Latvia secured, even if without Riga, the Constitutional Convention must now decide on Latvia’s future direction. As with many post-independence states however, the next challenge may be to navigate the differences in our population’s views, without descending into civil war and chaos. \nBoth Kurelis and Peterss are seen as viable candidates for leadership – both seek continued Latvian independence, and both seek to regain the City of Riga. Peterss believes that only with the alliance of the Commune of France can Latvia remain independent. Kurelis, on the other hand, is adamant that Latvia must put itself first – either by remaining truly independent, or, depending on how the situation develops, by seeing common cause with another likeminded regional power bloc that may wish to challenge the Germans.\nAs the stability and very existence of an independent Latvia is at stake, Kurelis has decided that it is in the country’s interest to end this farce of a Constitutional Convention as soon as possible. Lest Latvia be handed over to socialists, who run the risk of losing the previous independence we have finally gained after centuries, we must make sure to discredit Peterss and his movement. Or, we could just arrest him... "
 ISKO.1.a:0 "We will accuse Peterss of fraternising with the enemy!"
 ISKO.1.b:0 "We will quietly arrest Peterss under false pretences!"

 ISKO.2.t:0 "The Capture Fails"
 ISKO.2.d:0 "When the small group of men from the Imanta Regiment came to Liepāja to secretly apprehend Peterss, he was nowhere to be found. They were soon made aware that Peterss has been leading his movement from the underground for the past number of days, and details of his precise whereabouts at the moment are scanty at best.\nSupport from the public and the Constitutional Convention itself remains within reach for both main groups, so we cannot take any chances. It may be best to root out Peterss like the rat he is, and apprehend him definitely, rather than resort to the more subtle means we had tried and failed with previously. Or, we just could make an example of his cowardice, increasing our own support among the Convention.\nOf course, our attempts to publically root him out may not go down as well with the general population, but they will learn the necessity of such measures, in time."
 ISKO.2.a:0 "We will not leave Liepāja until we find him!"
 ISKO.2.b:0 "Show the people that Peterss’ weakness makes him unfit to rule!"

 ISKO.3.t:0 "A Fork in the Road"
 ISKO.3.d:0 "Revolutionary syndicalism has come to dominate the international socialist movement. In Latvia, however, many socialists, including much of the leadership of our new republic, still cling to the ideals of the Bolsheviks. While the relationship would not be otherwise unworkable, agreeing to adopt syndicalist ideas, at least in part, could facilitate greater cooperation with the syndicalist powers of Europe. Should this idea be made a reality?"
 ISKO.3.a:0 "Hold fast to the ideals of the Bolsheviks"
 ISKO.3.b:0 "Implement a Syndicalist model"

 ISKO.4.t:0 "Looking to the Past"
 ISKO.4.d:0 "Syndicalism has been rejected in favour of the further development of the ideals of the old Bolsheviks of the Russian revolution to whom we are so intimately linked."
 ISKO.4.a:0 "Lenin shall be avenged."

 ISKO.5.t:0 "Syndicalism Ascendant"
 ISKO.5.d:0 "The ascendency of syndicalism cannot be denied. To facilitate relations with the powers of the Third Internationale, we must accept a basically syndicalist economic model."
 ISKO.5.a:0 "A necessary choice."

 ISKO.6.t:0 "The Direction of the Economy"
 ISKO.6.d:0 "Disagreements over rural economic policies have proven difficult to resolve. As such, beginning today, the members of the politburo will work non-stop on an all-encompassing plan thereof."
 ISKO.6.a:0 "Let the forces of reaction quiver."

 ISKO.7.t:0 "Oversight of the Collectivisation Process"
 ISKO.7.d:0 "How the state should bring about reform has caused disagreement among members of the central government. While some, including comrade Peterss, would prefer the central government directly carry out the process of reform, some have called for a more nuanced approach. They argue that the rural people, already inclined towards revolutionary action, could be encouraged to carry out the policy themselves, dispensing with reaction how they see fit. That, they argue, while perhaps more difficult and less comprehensive, would ensure popular support for even more controversial state policies."
 ISKO.7.a:0 "The state shall act alone."
 ISKO.7.b:0 "Allow for local implementation."

 ISKO.8.t:0 "The Expropriation Debate"
 ISKO.8.d:0 "While it is undeniable that central management will rapidly transform rural production networks for the better, short term economic disruption could turn the people against the revolution. As such, some moderates, much to the disdain of Comrade Peterss, call for smaller businesses and landowners to be spared from complete expropriation, even if they are to be brought down a peg."
 ISKO.8.a:0 "Take it all."
 ISKO.8.b:0 "Small operations need not be disrupted."

 ISKO.9.t:0 "On Direct State Ownership"
 ISKO.9.d:0 "In addition to mere collectivisation, some call for the state to take direct control of some agricultural lands."
 ISKO.9.a:0 "Implement direct state ownership."
 ISKO.9.b:0 "Push for collectivisation instead."

 ISKO.10.t:0 "The Kulak Question"
 ISKO.10.d:0 "The rich-peasant Kulak class has long attempted to conceal their exploitative practices beneath a faux-toiler veneer. Without question, the day of reckoning for all deemed to be Kulaks has dawned. some, however, wish to treat the Kulaks more harshly than others. The Kulaks, these moderates argue, can be reformed simply by transforming their relationship with productive forces. They argue that rather than expropriate Kulaks entirely, thy should be allowed to maintain small plots for their own cultivation without the assistance of contracted labourers."
 ISKO.10.a:0 "Foolish! We must treat them as outright reactionaries."
 ISKO.10.b:0 "Kulaks can be reformed."

 ISKO.11.t:0 "The Compensation Debate"
 ISKO.11.d:0 "As part of the collectivisation process, the land and possessions of some otherwise revolutionary-spirited individuals will have to taken by the state. In the interest of equality, many believe even such upright individuals should not receive formal compensation in one form or another, much to the chagrin of some."
 ISKO.11.a:0 "Ignore the idea."
 ISKO.11.b:0 "Offer compensation."

 ISKO.12.t:0 "The Abolition of Private Agriculture"
 ISKO.12.d:0 "With the most contested issues surrounding rural economic policy resolved, a draft has been completed and disseminated throughout the party. As the result of the debates, the politburo has further promulgated a memo affirming the party's intent to ultimately abolish individual ownership of land, framing the much debated policy draft as a step towards that goal."
 ISKO.12.a:0 "A communist society surely dawns!"

 ISKO.13.t:0 "The Spread of Collectivisation"
 ISKO.13.d:0 "With the most contested issues surrounding rural economic policy resolved, a draft has been completed and disseminated throughout the party. As the result of the debates, the politburo has further promulgated a memo affirming the party's intent to see the gradual amalgamation of all farms into large collective operations without disrupting the countryside, framing the much debated policy draft as a step towards that goal."
 ISKO.13.a:0 "From the people to the people!"

 ISKO.14.t:0 "Rural Structures Upended"
 ISKO.14.d:0 "Aggressive state policies in pursuit of the abolition of the individual ownership of land have totally upended established informal systems of trade and resource allocation. While this may be necessary in the long run, certain regions have begun to experience profound social, and increasingly economic, turmoil."
 ISKO.14.a:0 "This could have grave consequences."

 ISKO.15.t:0 "A Weak Harvest"
 ISKO.15.d:0 "Owing to the disruption in the countryside, entire several large farms have suddenly gone belly-up and left their crops to whither. While central leadership were initially shielded from this grim news, the resulting famine in certain localities has become undeniable. While decisive action to relieve affected areas has now been taken, the bodies are still being counted."
 ISKO.15.a:0 "A least the worst has passed."

 LATFOR.1.t:0 "Ultimatum for Dvinsk?"
 LATFOR.1.d:0 "With Russia embroiled in conflict, it seems that now would be an opportune time to bring the Latvians of Dvinsk into the fold. We could send an ultimatum to the socialists in control of Dvinsk, bypassing the white government entirely. Afterall, intervention by even a small power such as ourselves could affect the outcome of the civil war."
 LATFOR.1.a:0 "Do it."
 LATFOR.1.b:0 "Back down."

 LATFOR.2.t:0 "Latvian Provocations"

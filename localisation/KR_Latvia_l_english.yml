### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_JEKABS_PETERSS_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 3rd, 1886, in Brinken, Hasenpoth District, Governorate of Courland, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Jēkabs Peterss was born in Courland in 1886 to ethnic Latvian farmers. At 22, he left Latvia and the Russian Empire for London where he contributed to the development of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party. He returned to Latvia after the outbreak of the Bolshevik Revolution in the country but fled in civilian clothes from German troops as they closed in on the last remnants of the first Iskolat Republic during the Russian Civil War. After a stint in neutral Sweden and later the newly-established Union of Britain, Peterss left his British family once again and slipped back into the United Baltic Duchy along with other Latvian former Bolsheviks, and took a leading role in organising the workers and peasants of western Latvia along old Bolshevik lines.\n\nAs the undisputed leader of the restored Iskolat Republic, Peterss seeks to, at last, fulfil the economic and political promises made to the common people back in 1917. To that end, in order to facilitate integration with the nations of the Third Internationale and secure the Latvian people their place in the world, Peterss has promulgated the ideological harmonisation of revolutionary syndicalism and Bolshevism in the Latvia Communist Party."
 POLITICS_ERNESTS_MORICS_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 13th, 1889, in Stende Parish, Talsi District, Governorate of Courland, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Ernests Morics was born in the north of Courland in 1889. During the Bolshevik Revolution, he made robust connections with labour leaders in Latvia's cities. Rather than flee abroad with his comrades before the ultimate end of the first Iskolat Republic, Morics found shelter among the ethnically diverse labour unions of the city of Riga.\n\nOwing to the predominantly agricultural character of Latvia, he failed to make inroads beyond the relatively small urban centres. Upon the re-founding of a socialist Latvia, he left Riga for Liepāja where he swore allegiance to the new state. Now, however, he has come to power in the Iskolat Republic in his own right. What Orthodox Syndicalism should look like in a nation of peasants is anyone's guess."
 POLITICS_PAULS_KALNINS_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 3rd, 1872, in Vilce Parish, Dobele District, Governorate of Courland, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Pauls Kalniņš was born in 1872 in Courland. During the Russian Civil War, he became the de facto leader of the right-wing of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party that refused to participate in the Iskolat Republic, even in the face of German domination. Kalniņš instead lead his faction into a tentative alliance with the short-lived moderate-conservative independence movement headed by Kārlis Ulmanis, and along with Ulmanis acquiesced to German political control. Even after Ulmanis left the nascent Baltic Duchy to organise anew for Baltic independence in Kerensky's Russia, Kalniņš remained and became a leading voice for native Balts - Latvians and Estonians alike - in the face of a hostile ethnic-German nobility.\n\nKalniņš, as leader of the opposition in the Baltic Landtag, the Democratic Bloc, was typically willing to work with the German liberals under Paul Schiemann, although he often decried Schiemann's economic and political reform agenda as insufficient. When the Baltic Duchy swiftly devolved into chaos following Black Monday, Kalniņš finally threw his lot in with the Baltic independence movements, bolstering them substantially and seeing his star rise rapidly in the Latvian camp. With the establishment of a free Latvian Republic, Kalniņš was declared its provisional president."
 POLITICS_MARGERS_SKUJENIEKS_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! June 22nd, 1886, in Riga, Riga District, Livonia Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Margers Skujenieks was born in 1886 in Riga. He left the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party prior to the establishment of the Iskolat Republic, and though this action cost him much of his influence among the Latvian centre-left, he eventually built a power base among ethnic Latvians in Riga and the surrounding region."
 POLITICS_PETERIS_JURASEVSKIS_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 23rd, 1872, in Sesava Parish, Dobele District, Governorate of Courland, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Pēteris Juraševskis was born in Courland in 1872. He participated, along with Ulmanis, in the aborted right-wing Latvian government during the Russian Civil War. Under the United Baltic Duchy, he became a prominent advocate for the Latvian middle class in Courland and won a few high-level concessions from the German-dominated government, though these victories won him only limited acclaim among the Latvian population. Now, as leader of Latvia, he seeks to turn the new country into a stable democracy where the rights of all are respected within the framework of an ordered legal process."
 LAT_karlis_ulmanis_desc_body: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! September 4th, 1877, in Bērze, Doebele Distrcit, Governorate of Courland, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Kārlis Ulmanis was born to wealthy farmers in Courland in 1877 and fled to the United States in light of his activism during the 1905 protests and the Russian crackdown. He organised in German-occupied Courland during the Weltkrieg and upon the outbreak of the Bolshevik Revolution, began to organise Latvian anti-socialists to proclaim independence. Following the German intervention, however, Ulmanis and his fellow leading conservatives unsuccessfully attempted to forge a middle path between independence and acquiescence to the German occupiers.\n\nWhile increasingly eclipsed by a younger generation of Latvian politicians, Ulmanis nonetheless was highly influential in developing the structure of the provisional Latvian government. Now, as head of state in his own right, Ulmanis seeks to develop a state where the interests of ethnic Latvian landowners are advanced within an orderly and efficient framework"

 LAT_janis_kurelis_desc_body: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! May 6th, 1882, in Ergême Parish, Valka District, Livonia Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Jānis Kurelis was born in 1882 in Livonia to a family of civil servants. He was eventually commissioned as a lieutenant in the Russian army and served with distinction in both the war with Japan and the Weltkrieg. During the Russian Civil War, he led a group of White-aligned Latvian soldiers in Siberia nominally swearing allegiance to the nascent Latvian proto-state which emerged under German occupation and opposed the Iskolat government in Liepāja. He eventually returned to Latvia along with his loyal rifleman in the chaos shortly before German control was fully consolidated; under the nominal authority of the former anti-communist Latvian government, he began to organise armed Latvian resistance to German rule in the Baltic in cooperation with his fellow in Estonia.\n\nKurelis's \"Imanta Regiment\" was pivotal in the collapse of the United Baltic Duchy and the founding of the nascent Latvian state, of which he leveraged his role at the head of the organisation to consolidate control over Latvia."

 POLITICS_KRISTAPS_UPELNIEKS_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! June 24th, 1891, in Sauka Parish, Jaunjelgavas District, Governorate of Courland, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Kristaps Upelnieks was born in 1891 in southeastern Latvia. He returned to Latvia before even Kurelis himself and rose through the ranks of the \"Imanta Regiment\", becoming a force within the organisation in his own right. His governing principles are modelled on the precepts of Kurelis himself."
 POLITICS_GUSTAVS_CELMINS_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! April 1st, 1899, in Riga, Riga District, Livonia Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Gustavs Celmiņš was born in Riga in 1899. He quickly aligned with ethnic Latvian nationalists within that heavily German city, drawing the ire of the newly formed United Baltic government based in the city. He eventually dropped out of university and joined the \"Imanta Regiment\" in armed opposition to German rule and distinguished himself as an orator, though he was reportedly not a particularly tenacious guerrilla. Celmiņš eventually became the de facto leader of the Rigans within the organisation and along with his fellow Rigan Imanta guerrillas, formed a particularly radical grouping with the regiment. Now as the leader of Latvia, his dream of a Latvian nation united and purified of any possible foreign elements may become a reality."
 POLITICS_KARLIS_GOPPERS_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! April 2nd, 1876, in Valka County, Livonia Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Kārlis Goppers, general of the Latvian Army, is known to be a true Latvian patriot, despite his general pro-Russian stance. In July 1917 together with colonel Frīdrihs Briedis he established a Latvian military compatriotic organisation - LKNA. His group of Latvian soldiers participated in the Kornilov affair, an attempted military coup in September 1917. Soon he became an active opponent of the Bolsheviks and, together with Boris Savinkov, created the SZRS organisation, aimed to lead peasant revolts against the Reds. The Success of the Yaroslavl Uprising helped the White forces to get an advantage against the Bolsheviks and contributed in their final defeat.\nAs a close associate of Boris Savinkov, he has been leading an insurgent movement in the United Baltic Duchy since the end of the Russian Civil War, as a part of the Russian Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom.\nNow, after seizing power in Latvia, the National Association of Latvian Warriors will finally liberate the Latvian peasants. However, their ambitions are even grander: total liberation of the Baltic States from German yoke under the Savinkovist banner."

### Opinions ###

### Events ###

 KRLAT.1.t: "Bittersweet Victory"
 KRLAT.1.d: "For seven hundred years Latvia was subjugated - lorded over by Germans, Poles, Swedes, and Russians one after the other. Many Latvians, however, never lost hope. They knew that freedom would one day come. The Latvian National Awakening of the 19th century enkindled similar dreams throughout the entire populace. The Young Latvians and the New Current movement in particular led to the development of modern Latvian nationalism and politics.\n\nAt the end of the Weltkrieg, these Latvian patriots at last had the chance to fight for freedom, and yet, this struggle was in vain. Divided between exiled movements in Riga, Petrograd and Moscow, the Latvians never made a true declaration of independence like their Estonian brothers had - the socialist Iskolat in Valmiera was destroyed by German arms, the Latvian National Council in Petrograd never returned, and the Riga Democratic Bloc surrendered to the new Baltic German order. Latvian nationalism did not die out, however, and returned even stronger, embraced by socialist exiles in the Union of Britain and the large Latvian community in Russia. The collapse of the United Baltic Duchy has fulfilled the dream of so many at long last - Latvia is finally an independent state.\n\nThe capital of the Latvian people, Riga, however, fell just out of the grasp of the Forest Brothers, and a German redoubt remains in control of the city, preparing for an opportunity to snuff out Latvia's independence. This insult to the pride of our nation must never be forgotten - and one way or another, the jewel of the Baltic Sea will return to its rightful owners. As the world inches closer to war, Latvia is sure to play a role."
 KRLAT.1.a: "Latvians, never forget Riga!"

 KRLAT.2.t: "Dual Rule in Latvia"
 KRLAT.2.d: "While Estonian nationalists generally supported a unified provisional government in the aftermath of the collapse of the Russia Empire, Latvian partisans remained internally divided until the bitter end. A similar, though less dysfunctional dynamic has emerged once again.\n\nIn the east, Jānis Kurelis heads a faction of trained exiles from Russia and the so-called "Imanta Regiment". Inspired by the ideas of his mentor, Kārlis Ulmanis, Kurelis envisions a uniquely Latvian political system, strong enough to weather the battles yet to come.\n\nIn the west, centred around Liepāja, lies the so-called "Second Iskolat", organised by the Revolutionary Latvian Legion and led by Jēkabs Peterss. They descend from the Latvian Bolsheviks who escaped the failing October Revolution to join their peers in the West, and have returned home to turn Latvia into a model Marxist-Leninist state.\n\nTo ease the brewing conflict between these two factions, a Constitutional Convention has been called in Valmiera to decide the nature of the new state - without the backing of either one of the main players, however, it is effectively powerless."
 KRLAT.2.a: "There can only be one regime in Latvia."

 KRLAT.3.t: "Manteuffel's Insurgency"
 KRLAT.3.d: "The collapse of the United Baltic Duchy was not as definitive as it first appeared, and low-level fighting continues between Latvian and isolated German units. The Second Baltic German Battalion of the Baltische Landeswehr, commanded by Hans von Manteuffel-Szoege, has proven a particularly tough nut to crack. Now known as the \"Eiserne Division\", they have torn a path of blood and fire through the Latvian countryside with the ultimate goal of restoring the Duchy.\n\nTheir supplies and ammunition are running low, however, and the Germans of Riga have been thusfar unable to provide them much assistance - as such, with few options left, Manteuffel has ordered an all-or-nothing attack on Valmiera, the seat of the Constitutional Convention and the headquarters of Kurelis's clique. Despite attrition and their partial degeneration into a horde of looting brigands, the Eiserne Division remains a powerful force, and is equally matched with its opponents in the Valmiera region.\n\nKurelis and his assembled men could potentially withstand this final German assault by themselves, but perhaps they should put politics aside for a moment, request aid from the Iskolat, and stand together with the Jēkabs Peterss and the Revolutionary Latvian Legion?"
 KRLAT.3.a: "We will do this ourselves,\nthe socialists are not to be trusted."
 KRLAT.3.b: "It’s too dangerous, we must\nreach out to Peterss and the reds."
 KRLAT.3.c: "We need help of Goppers and his insurgent group."

 KRLAT.4.t: "Kurelis's Latvia"
 KRLAT.4.d: "Kurelis has managed to crush the last remnants of the Eiserne Division alone, and his position as the hero of the people has become even more eminent.\nIn his actions, he has seized upon his initial momentum and general enthusiasm among the wider populace. The Constitutional Convention in Valmiera has become a forgone conclusion, with support for Kurelis far outweighing that for Peterss, and indeed, several prominent members of the Revolutionary Latvian Legion are thinking twice about their leadership.\n Had Peterss been a in a stronger position, more resistance would likely have been expected. But for now, the dreams of a Second Iskolat Republic are sidelined, as it is Kurelis’ vision that will lead Latvia forward!"
 KRLAT.4.a: "Latvia for Latvians!"

 KRLAT.5.t: "Peterss's Latvia"
 KRLAT.5.d: "This morning Kurelis was discovered hiding in Liepāja by socialist militiamen. Comrade Peterss and his men managed to overcome Kurelis's contingent, capturing Kurelis himself. A socialist Republic, known as the "Iskolat" was quickly declared, though some regions have been slow to recognise the change."
 KRLAT.5.a: "Now we build real socialism!"

 KRLAT.6.t: "Latvia wishes to join the Third Internationale"
 KRLAT.6.d: "We have received a diplomatic message from our comrades in Eastern Europe - Latvia, also known as the Iskolat Republic, wishes to finally put an end to their enforced neutrality and join the Third Internationale as an equal partner. Should we accept the Latvian Leninists into the worldwide Syndicalist community?"
 KRLAT.6.a: "Of course!"
 KRLAT.6.b: "We'd rather not."

 KRLAT.7.t: "We are accepted"
 KRLAT.7.d: "The Internationale has accepted our fledgling republic into their alliance."
 KRLAT.7.a: "Hurrah!"

 KRLAT.8.t: "We have been denied"
 KRLAT.8.d: "The Internationale has refused to accept our fledgling republic into their alliance."
 KRLAT.8.a: "Damn."

 KRLAT.9.t: "The Wind Blows"
 KRLAT.9.d: "When the Second Weltkrieg began, the loss of Latvia and Estonia strangely provided protection to Riga. The two states, Latvia and Estonia, served as a neutral bulwark which protected Riga from the full force of the Russian invasion. The Riga defence forces and their commanders, however, understood the fleeting nature of this state of affairs. Patrols became more frequent, logistics systems were strengthened, and a system of food rationing was implemented for general population.\n\nIncreasing Latvian military movement near the city, sometimes even in the range of Rigan artillery outposts seemed to prove the validity of the Rigan Defence Force's fears - although the German troops opted to not fire upon the Latvians just yet. Enemy artillery is stationed in the surroundings of the city, preparing to bombard hastily assembled barricades and fortifications. The Latvians remain silent in diplomatic channels, as if they have forgotten that Riga exists entirely.\n\nBoth sides had something to finish from their last engagements in 1936. The Latvians - to evict the Germans from their homeland at last, to reclaim Riga, their one and only capital. The Baltic Germans - to destroy this insurgency for good, and reclaim their birthright.\n\nA chilling wind blows across the streets of Riga, and with it, follows a barrage of yells, all shouting the same thing."
 KRLAT.9.a: "To the barricades!"

 KRLAT.10.t: "The Assembly Convenes"
 KRLAT.10.d: "An extraordinary session of the Constitutional Assembly has been called in Liepāja with the aim of rewriting the provisional Latvian constitution in the face of increased political dominance by Kurelis and his clique. The Assembly cannot help but cede a large degree of power to Kurelis and the executive, a stark contrast from the political structure laid out provisionally, but many questions remain unresolved."
 KRLAT.10.a: "We have a lot to sort out."

 KRLAT.11.t: "The Question of Powers of the Saeima"
 KRLAT.11.d: "While the Saeima shall have the nominal authority to enact legislation independent of the executive, members of Kurelis's faction hold differing views on the degree of direct oversight the office should have over legislative action."
 KRLAT.11.a: "Don't water down the legislature"
 KRLAT.11.b: "The President shall have unrestricted veto powers"

 KRLAT.12.t: "Meeting place of the Saeima"
 KRLAT.12.d: "The Latvian constitution in exile held that the Latvian assembly should convene in Riga and only in Riga. However, it did not consider the special circumstances the country now faces. The question remains: should we formally establish the assembly in Liepāja or continue to only operate from the city de-facto awaiting the liberation of Riga."
 KRLAT.12.a: "Riga is our capital."
 KRLAT.12.b: "Recognise the reality of the situation - Liepāja."

 KRLAT.13.t: "The Generalis"
 KRLAT.13.d: "The extraordinary challenges facing Latvia at the moment have won wide popular support for Kurelis's authoritative actions. While Kurelis shall remain president at least until the end of the current crisis, some have called for his rule to be plainly written into the constitution - president-for-life."
 KRLAT.13.a: "Write it into the document."
 KRLAT.13.b: "He shall remain only until the crisis passes."

 KRLAT.14.t: "Foreign Policy"
 KRLAT.14.d: "Latvia is in a difficult position on the global stage. Indeed the country is under diplomatic pressure from both Germany and Russia, and the threat of invasion from either of those powers looms large. The provisional constitution gave the Saeima a role in treaty-making and diplomatic appointments, with the assent of the body required for treaties to be ratified and posts to be filled. While awkward, and given Kurelis's control over the Saeima, a bit of a farce, some call for this quirk of the constitution to be kept intact."
 KRLAT.14.a: "The Saeima must approve the government's decisions"
 KRLAT.14.b: "Only the Generalis knows what is good"

 KRLAT.15.t: "Responsibilities of Powers"
 KRLAT.15.d: "The last major debate of the Constituent Assembly concerns whether or not the president can unilaterally dissolve the legislature in perpetuity. While doing so would be highly inefficient and place and outsized burden on the administration, allowing for such under the right circumstances would all but eliminate the independence of the legislature at least for the remainder of the crisis."
 KRLAT.15.a: "The Executive has no Power over the Saeima."
 KRLAT.15.b: "The president may dissolve the Saeima."

 KRLAT.16.t: "A Strong Executive"
 KRLAT.16.d: "The directorial system has been all but eliminated, with the office of the president assuming greater authority. General Kurelis, while nominally neither head of the government nor the state, now directs most functions of the central government."
 KRLAT.16.a: "A hero at the helm."

 KRLAT.17.t: "Executive Authority Constrained"
 KRLAT.17.d: "The directorial system established after the collapse of the United Baltic Duchy has been entrenched while the authority and role of the state has grown."
 KRLAT.17.a: "Onwards!"

 KRLAT.18.t: "Integration of Dvinsk"
 KRLAT.18.d: "The administration of Dvinsk has become increasingly ordinary. Owing to the area's strong Latvian identity, it has quickly been integrated into our administration."
 KRLAT.18.a: "Latvia is whole!"

 KRLAT.19.t: "Economic Stabilisation"
 KRLAT.19.d: "The economic crisis which followed the dissolution of the United Baltic Duchy has finally subsided.\n\nWe are now in a position where our economy is functioning smoothly, as the measures we have undertaken after independence have come to fruition."
 KRLAT.19.a: "Great!"

 KRLAT.20.t: "Political Stabilisation"
 KRLAT.20.d: "The political crisis which followed the dissolution of the United Baltic Duchy has finally subsided.\n\nThe independent Latvian administration has become thoroughly entrenched."
 KRLAT.20.a: "Great!"

 KRLAT.21.t: "Kurelis's Latvia"
 KRLAT.21.d: "Kurelis has convinced the members of the Constitutional Convention that Peterss’ goal in forming a socialist state will result in nothing more than an immediate loss of our independence. The socialists’ attempts to work with the workers in the city of Riga will only mean greater German influence in our country, invariably leading to German re-annexation.\nIn this attack on Peterss and his movement, Kurelis has seized upon his previous momentum and general enthusiasm among the wider populace. The Constitutional Convention in Valmiera has swayed in his favour, with support for Kurelis now outweighing that for Peterss.\nHad Peterss been a in a stronger position, more resistance would likely have been expected. But for now, the dreams of a Second Iskolat Republic are sidelined, as it is Kurelis’ vision that will lead Latvia forward!"
 KRLAT.21.a: "Latvia for Latvians!"

 KRLAT.22.t: "Kurelis's Latvia"
 KRLAT.22.d: "Kurelis has convinced enough members of the Constitutional Convention that Peterss’ is unfit to lead to lead the country. Such is his cowardice, that the socialist leader cannot even bring himself to defend his own position in the Convention. If this is the case, how could we expect such a man to ensure Latvia’s independence, let alone retake our capital? \nIn this attack on Peterss and his movement, Kurelis has seized upon his previous momentum and general enthusiasm among the wider populace. The Constitutional Convention in Valmiera has swayed in his favour, with support for Kurelis now outweighing that for Peterss.\nHad Peterss been a in a stronger position, more resistance would likely have been expected. But for now, the dreams of a Second Iskolat Republic are sidelined, as it is Kurelis’ vision that will lead Latvia forward!"
 KRLAT.22.a: "Latvia for Latvians!"
 
 
 KRLAT.23.t: "The Curonian Kings"
 KRLAT.23.d_1: "Not long before the collapse of the United Baltic Duchy, the Germans recognised the nobility of the so-called 'Curonian Kings', the legitimate descendants of the pre-German nobility in Courland. While only 600 in number, the newly granted noble titles raised the standing of the 'Kings' and allowed some of them access to gain titles to albeit-marginal land estates in the short time before the collapse of the Duchy.\n\nIn order to justify the preservation of their newfound status and holdings, Mārtiņš Peniķis, the former representative for the Kings in the Baltic Landtag, has publicly sworn allegiance to our new republic and to support our government by any means necessary."
 KRLAT.23.d_2: "Shortly before the collapse of the Baltic Duchy, Mārtiņš Peniķis as sole representative of the 'Curonian Kings', the descendants of the pre-German nobility of Courland, sought to gain noble titles for the 600 remaining 'Kings' of Courland. With our independence, he has approached our new government and again asked for titles to be granted in exchange for the political support of the 'Kings'."
 KRLAT.23.a: "Kurzeme sure is unique."
 KRLAT.23.b: "Grant the titles."
 KRLAT.23.c: "We are a republic..."

 KRLAT.24.t: "Outreach to the Polish Minority?"
 KRLAT.24.d_1: "Concentrated in Courland, particularly in the Ilūkste region, the Polish minority wields notable influence in parts of Latvia. While the Poles were generally enthusiastic about Latvian independence and an end to German domination, the Poles have generally been unsettled by the direction of our government and 'buyer's remorse' now largely prevails among them. While our regime has made clear its intention to protect the rights of non-German ethnic minorities within the country, the state's preference for Letts is clear. Poles resent the rapid rise in social status that many common Letts have enjoyed as, among other things, semi-prestigious jobs in the state administration have opened up to them alone. The closing of the political sphere and curtailing of political rights by the army has also prompted some concern, especially in light of the generally Lutheran affiliation of most members of the regime.\n\nAn opportunity to mend our relationship with a large part of the Polish community has presented itself, however. The Catholic bishop in charge of the community has offered to host an event connecting general Kurelis with prominent Polish citizens and inviting the general to speak. Delivering a favourable speech here would be an easy way to garner support among the ethnic Poles, though staying home might engender more than a few subtle nods of the head from within our administration. Should we give the speech and attend?"

 KRLAT.26.t: "The Association for National Freedom"
 KRLAT.26.d: "Following the capture of the city of Riga, Paul Schliemann largely disappeared from the political scene. Now, however, news from Riga tells of the founding of a new liberal political association (not a party to avoid running afoul of current restrictions), "The Association for National Freedom", headed up by none other than Schliemann himself. While Schliemann was once a friend of the Letts during the days of German rule over the Baltic, he was certainly still a German and sometimes opposed minority interests in the old Landstag. His new grouping seeks to protect the rights of ethnic minorities, particularly Germans, within Latvia through legal means and publicise their cause internationally. Feelings from within our government are thus mixed. Some wish to crack down on the Association and others to let it be. What should be done?"
 KRLAT.26.a: "Silence it."
 KRLAT.26.b: "Let it be."

 KRLAT.27.t: "The Brothers to the Sword"
 KRLAT.27.d: "Many Germans have already fled our new state and many more continue to leave. Naturally, however, some Germans refuse to leave the country. Among those Germans are members of the far-right in the former Duchy who advocated harsh treatment of native Balts. Calls for vengeance cannot entirely be ignored, and in the interests of maintaining order and heading off individual reprisals, local governments have arrested several former members of the Baltic Brotherhood who stayed in the country. The number of such arrests seems poised to grow rapidly and while the national government has not joined in the manhunt, it has also not intervened to stop it. It seems that popular justice will be meted out against those who once expressed their contempt for their soon-to-be judges. Some may even face capital punishment."
 KRLAT.27.a: "What goes around comes around."

 KRLAT.28.t: "Nationalised Dairy"
 KRLAT.28.d: "Dairy prevails in Latvia. Dairy farms can be found on the edge of nearly every village and the population of dairy cows is not dissimilar from the human population in some areas. The industry, however is also highly diffuse with little integration between various farmers except via small producers collectives and trade organisations. In order to ensure the stability of the industry, the government of general Kurelis has promulgated an ever increasing number of regulations targeting the industry in particular. Yesterday, however, state oversight of the dairy industry increased greatly. A new department within the interior ministry was announced to act as sole distributor of dairy products. Dairy farmers will be prevented from commercially distributing their milk independent of the state. In effect, anyone living in the cities or in large towns will only have access to dairy products via the state, with packaging and form standardised the nation over. If the industry experiences difficulties, the state will simply increase the price it pays for dairy products."
 KRLAT.28.a: "Milk gives us life."

 KRLAT.29.t: "Galvaspilsēta Degvīns"
 KRLAT.29.d: "A year ago, the Latvian state announced a large new investment series into the production of grain alcohol. In the time since, the liquor landscape has transformed as the state's market share has increased and various smaller manufacturers and distributors have been acquired by state-owned enterprises. Notably, a new product has come to prominence the country over and has begun to be marketed abroad. Galvaspilsēta, known simply as 'Galva' to many, is fast becoming something of a cultural staple, even replacing traditional liquors in the cultural zeitgeist. While various knock-offs have entered the market, 'authentic' Galva is legally owned by the state liquor distribution monopoly and its growth will undoubtedly further our government's clout the world over."
 KRLAT.29.a: "Galva, the new national drink."

 KRLAT.30.t: "Unpatriotic Artists"
 KRLAT.30.d: "A little over a month ago, an affirmative duty to oppose anti-national subversion was written into the Latvian constitution. Citizens working in many sectors of the economy were required to swear an oath of loyalty much like public servants. One group of artists from the city of Liepāja, however, have very publicly refused to do so. Rumblings within the wider artistic community suggest that such sentiments are widely shared among their compatriots. As result, local authorities have launched a series of police raids around the country and placed many artists under arrest. It is likely that this action will affect the productivity of creatives generally moving forward. Some are sure to leave the country as a direct result."
 KRLAT.30.a: "Art is decadent anyhow."

 KRLAT.31.t: "A National Military Academy"
 KRLAT.31.d: "Yesterday in Liepāja, general Kurelis presided over the opening of a new university under the purview of the army. The ceremony was tremendous and it bodes well for the future of our army. That, however, is not what dominated headlines in the state press. Following the ceremony, the university grants the general an honorary diploma in political science and announced that the general would enrol as its first doctoral candidate."
 KRLAT.31.a: "Does he never sleep?"

 KRLAT.32.t: "Doctor, General, President"
 KRLAT.32.d: "Years ago, general Kurelis announced his doctoral candidacy at the military university opened in Liepāja. In spite of his time-consuming duties in his role as president, it seems the general kept up with his academic responsibilities as today state press organs announced that the general had become a doctor of political science."
 KRLAT.32.a: "Wow, impressive."

 KRLAT.33.t: "Latvianisation of Mechanisation"
 KRLAT.33.d: "Along with the importation of foreign agricultural machines, domestic Latvian production has grown rapidly over the last year as a result of knowledge-sharing and technology-transfer requirements in the purchase agreements. Demand from farmers is now being fulfilled in part by Latvian domestic firms and exports of agricultural machinery have even begun."
 KRLAT.33.a: "Our investment paid off."

 KRLAT.34.t: "Return of Curonian Jews"
 KRLAT.34.d_1: "The Jews of Courland are unique in their cultural and theological disposition and form a community distinct from other Jews, including those residing in Livonia. During the Weltkrieg, many Curonian Jews, owing to Russian anti-Semitism and suspicion that Curonian Jews in particular were loyal to Germany, were deported elsewhere in Russia. While few returned to Latvia during the years under the German boot, with independence, many Curonian Jews recently settled back in Courland along with their Lett countrymen. In line with our policy of national atheism, the influx of so many religious minorities has prompted some concern from within our government. More than a few ministers have suggested the imposition of a religious test on new returnees, avowedly Jewish or otherwise, to identify the devout among and head off security concerns."
 KRLAT.34.d_2: "The Jews of Courland are unique in their cultural and theological disposition and form a community distinct from other Jews, including those residing in Livonia. During the Weltkrieg, many Curonian Jews, owing to Russian anti-Semitism and suspicion that Curonian Jews in particular were loyal to Germany, were deported elsewhere in Russia. While few returned to Latvia during the years under the German boot, with independence, many Curonian Jews recently settled back in Courland along with their Lett countrymen. While our government does indeed favour ethnic Letts over ethnic minorities in many regards, it recognises the essentially Latvian character of the nation's Jews. The return of the Curonian Jewish exiles has provided general Kurelis with something of a publicity opportunity. He has publicly met with Jewish returnees and proclaimed his support for the community in the state press."
 KRLAT.34.a: "Sign the Test Act."
 KRLAT.34.b: "Kurzeme continues to exceed expectations."
 
 KRLAT.35.t: "Goppers's Latvia"
 KRLAT.35.d: "Kurelis managed to defeat the last remnants of the Eiserne Division with the help of the National Association of Goppers, but it was the latter that gained great importance in the eyes of the public.\nGoppers, who for many years had been waging an insurgent war against the Germans, became a real hero and cause for celebration in the eyes of the population. The constitutional convention in Valmiera was a done deal, because the support of Goppers far exceeded that of Peterss and Kurelis.\nHad Kurelis been in a stronger position, one would have expected more resistance. But for now the dreams of Kurelis are pushed to the back burner, because it is Goppers' vision that will lead Latvia forward!"
 KRLAT.35.a: "Latvia for Latvians!"
 
 KRLAT.36.t: "Power Struggle"
 KRLAT.36.d: "Goppers's advantage caused some outrage in the ranks of the armed forces, especially among Kurelis's supporters and himself. He had rather serious ambitions about Latvia's future, and now power had passed from his hands to another military formation. \n\nRumors reached Goppers that Kurelis was planning an armed coup to restore the Constituent Assembly. We cannot allow this to happen, so the assembled emergency council soon decided to arrest the conspirators and dismiss them from the Latvian Army."
 KRLAT.36.a: "Kurelis is forced to retire"
 
 KRLAT.37.t: "Ending the Chaos"
 KRLAT.37.d: "The Constituent Assembly only resulted in our country being divided into two parts and the people being offered another struggle. It is time to end it. A Constituent Assembly will solve nothing, and it is utterly meaningless. The people of Latvia must not be seduced by the tales of the Bolsheviks and Chekists, murderers and traitors. \n\nEarly this morning, armed Goppers rebels invaded the building where the extraordinary assembly was being held, only to dissolve it immediately and arrest the assembled delegates."
 KRLAT.37.a: "Assembly only tears our nation apart."
 
 KRLAT.38.t: "The Second Yaroslavl"
 KRLAT.38.d: "Of course, taking advantage of the general chaos, the Chekist leaders were able to escape and entrench themselves in the east of the country. But their hustle and bustle would not lead to anything good. Once, a group of Goppers and his supporters successfully led an armed uprising against similarly cowardly murderers in Yaroslavl. \n\nThen they were victorious in spite of the numerical superiority of their opponents. Now it remains to arrest and preferably execute the Bolshevik criminals."
 KRLAT.38.a: "Bolshevism must be destroyed once and for all!"
 
 KRLAT.39.t: "Latvijas Skautu centrālā organizācija"
 KRLAT.39.d: "At the end of the Weltkrieg Karlis Goppers was one of those people who sacrificed a lot of time and work so that the Latvian Scout movement could look with genuine pride at the activities of its organization.\nGoppers said: \"A Scout is not a war scout, but a peace scout; a life scout who knows how to find the right path in life and show it to others.\" His speech was full of serious reflections, and he listened with bated breath, and every speech of this kind aroused more and more respect for the old general.\nToday the Scout family is rightly proud as the Central Organisation of Scouts of Latvia has been established with Goppers as its chief.\nThanks to the popularity of Goppers's outstanding personality and the very active chanting of the idea of Scouting in Latvian society, as well as articles in the press, the Scout movement from a few boy groups, about which no one really knew anything, had turned into a youth organization well-known throughout the country, very popular and recognized by the whole society and the government, in which the number of participants reached already thousands."
 KRLAT.39.a: "Always ready!"

 KRLAT.40.t: "Elections to the Saeima Scheduled"
 KRLAT.40.d: "Through the art of diplomacy and the subtle manipulation of some of our politicians in the Constituent Assembly, Kurelis' almost dictatorial powers have been curtailed. The key ones were the right of the Latvian Constitutional Assembly to meet in Liepaja, and the inevitability of holding presidential elections as soon as possible. Of course, the concessions made by Kurelis are just a ruse - as he is confident of his high public support. Nevertheless, the law is the law - and the long-awaited first free elections in Latvia's history should finally take place in a couple of months."
 KRLAT.40.a: "Is there still a hope for democracy in Latvia?"
 
 KRLAT.41.t: "The Latvian Social Democrats"
 KRLAT.41.d: "The Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party is without a doubt the favorite in the elections. Despite the loss of Riga, where the party's main urban proletarian electorate and social base was located, the LSDSP easily gained a majority in all regions of the country. For many, there is no doubt that in these elections, at least for now, a plurality for the Social Democrats is guaranteed.\n\nHowever, this, of course, does not suit Kurelis. A number of advisers have suggested the rather fraudulent but possibly effective approach of demonizing the LSDSP and blatantly running a campaign that discredits Marxism by calling them Bolsheviks. Although this is false, it will certainly help us to turn at least some of the population away from them."
 KRLAT.41.a: "Label them as communists and demonize them!"
 KRLAT.41.b: "We must play fair and square."
 
 KRLAT.42.t: "The LZS and Kurelis"
 KRLAT.42.d: "Latvian Farmer's Union is the second most popular party in Latvia, after LSDSP, popular among peasants and rural population. However, its support is still not high enough to obtain a plurality. Moreover, there are a number of local parties throughout Latvia, also of an agrarian and conservative orientation, which are siphoning off some of the votes, but are happy to support the government if it is formed by the LZS. Kurelis is facing a dilemma that could well claim to be fundamental for the future of Latvia. On the one hand, the LZS is ready to support Kurelis's candidacy in the next presidential election, in exchange for his publicly announcing his support for the LZS. Such mutual support guarantees that even without a plurality in the Saeima, Kurelis will be elected president. On the other hand, it has the potential to strengthen the power and authority of Kārlis Ulmanis, the conservative leader, and, given the significant restrictions on the presidency recently imposed by Latvia's Constituent Assembly, Kurelis runs the risk of not being able to stay afloat. Accordingly, another solution may be to create his own party for the elections - even though the party runs the risk of failing miserably in the coming elections."
 KRLAT.42.a: "Announce support for the LZS - the people will listen."
 KRLAT.42.b: "We need our men to win - announce our own movement."
 
 KRLAT.43.t: "Strategy For the Demokrātiskais Centrs"
 KRLAT.43.d: "The Demokrātiskais Centrs, officially the Democratic Centre and Non-Partisan Public Workers (Demokrātiskais centrs un bezpartejiskie sabiedriskie darbinieki), was founded as an electoral bloc of the Labour party of the Latvian SRs and Marģers Skujenieks's Menshevik party, a split from the LSDSP. This Menshevik-SR coalition, despite growing to become far more rightist, that their Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian counterparts, still greatly emphasizes social welfare. Being a third largest party in Latvia after the LSDSP and the LZS, Demokrātiskais Centrs has little chance to win a plurality in the elections, but they understand their role as a potential coalition member. The only question is - coalition with whom?\n\nUnfortunately, this was the bone of contention among the party leadership. Skujenieks refuses any cooperation with the Social Democrats, of which he himself used to be a member. First, since the founding of the Demokrātiskais Centrs, the \"Mensheviks\" have embraced a nationalist and liberal-conservative ideology, and Skujenieks hopes that a coalition with the LZS will bring party to a long-awaited power and help connect the Centrs's urban electorate with the LZS's peasant base, creating a truly popular government. Some of the leadership on the \"SRs\" side, however, are radically opposed to a coalition with the LZS, but are ready to support the Social Democrats. In the end, for the sake of party unity, there are also voices of those who suggest abandoning all coalitions, at least for now - and focusing on supporting their own electorate."
 KRLAT.43.a: "Turn to LSDSP - we must oppose authoritarianism."
 KRLAT.43.b: "Cooperate with LZS - they have more chances to win."
 KRLAT.43.c: "Aim for our own victory - strike both left and right!"
 
 KRLAT.44.t: "Elections in Latgale"
 KRLAT.44.d: "Latgale is truly a diverse region. Not only it is a home to a significant Russian, Belarusian, Catholic and Baltic German minority, it is also a home to two major local parties, that are almost guaranteed to win the majority of votes in the region. Neither of the mainstream Latvian parties are popular there. The Christian Peasant and Catholic Party (Kristīgo Zemnieku un Katoļu Partija, KZKP) and the Progressive Association of Latgale Farmers (Zemnieku Progresīvā Apvienība, ZPA) are both conservative and are likely to work together. While their support for the LZS is almost guaranteed, some members of the party are becoming more and more anxious that without strong support for the Farmers’ Union in Latgale, we risk constant concessions to the KZKP and the ZPA, as well as other minor parties. These politicians suggest that instead we have to strongly promote LZS in the region, and do what we can to oppose the Catholics and the ZPA and prevent them from uniting in an electoral bloc."
 KRLAT.44.a: "Push for a conservative bloc in Latgale!"
 KRLAT.44.b: "Divide and conquer!"
 
 KRLAT.46.t: "Securing Support of the 'Bļodnieki'"
 KRLAT.46.d: "One of the curious cases among the many small parties operating in Latvia is Bļodnieki, formally the Latvian Party of New Farmers and Smallholders (Latvijas Jaunsaimnieku un sīkgruntnieku partija, LJSP). Named after their permanent leader Ādolfs Bļodnieks, Bļodnieki is probably the largest of Latvia's small parties. Supporters of the \"Baltic Entente\" and national democracy, this party though has much in common with the LZS and it will be very important to achieve an alliance with Bļodnieks, who, for example, is quite willing to support the Demokrātiskais Centrs as well. On the other hand, such an alliance will force us to resort to a national democratic policy, stimulating exports, balancing exports with imports, banning agricultural imports, implementing austerity measures, reducing unemployment and implementing a national democratic school policy - everything that Bļodnieks wrote in his program."
 KRLAT.46.a: "Promise a portfolio to Bļodnieks."
 KRLAT.46.b: "We don't need him."
   
 KRLAT.47.t: "The Demokrātiskais Centrs Falls Apart!"
 KRLAT.47.d: "Unfortunately, the leadership of the Demokrātiskais Centrs failed to agree on a strategy - and this failure will be remembered for a long time, as the liberal center of Latvian politics collapsed, splitting into two new parties. The SR faction declared the restoration of the Latvian Labor Party and supported the LSDSP, while Skujenieks's \"Mensheviks\" declared support for the conservative forces and Kurelis. With the split of the Centrs, both the LSDSP and the LZS sharply increased their chances for a plurality in the Saeima."
 KRLAT.47.a: "A great blow to liberals!"

 KRLAT.48.t: "[GetYear] Elections to the Saeima"
 KRLAT.48.d: "The elections are over and the votes are counted. The first Latvian Saeima is finally convened. And even though a long fight awaits us as we should get ready to march on Riga, it seems that the Latvian democracy has triumphed. With the 100 MPs ready to appoint a president, there's no doubt that the parliamentary majority will vote for the candidate from the ruling coalition."
 KRLAT.48.a: "LSDSP forms a coalition with LDP."
 KRLAT.48.b: "LZS leads a conservative front."
 KRLAT.48.c: "LNA leads a conservative front."
 
 KRLAT.49.t: "[GetYear] Elections to the Saeima"
 KRLAT.49.d: "After a fierce election season, with many parties pushing their messaging feverishly onto the populace, we now come to the elections. Who will the voters choose this year?"
 KRLAT.49.a: "$KRLAT.48.a$"
 KRLAT.49.b: "Demokrātiskais Centrs manages to win."
 KRLAT.49.b2: "Labour Party manages to win."

 KRLAT.49.f: "$KRLAT.48.c$"
 
 
 ISKO.1.t: "The Convention Convenes"
 ISKO.1.d: "The Eiserne Division were poised to launch one last desperate attempt to take Valmiera, and with it, the Constitutional Convention. Seeing Latvia’s newly-gained independence to be too fragile to risk losing to inter-partisan squabbling, Kurelis took it upon himself to call upon his political rivals for aid.\nJust as Manteuffel’s men were set to assail Kurelis’ position, Peterss and his Revolutionary Latvian Legion ambushed them, and with support coming from Valmiera, the final remnant of the German forces were made short work of.\nWith the independence of Latvia secured, even if without Riga, the Constitutional Convention must now decide on Latvia’s future direction. As with many post-independence states however, the next challenge may be to navigate the differences in our population’s views, without descending into civil war and chaos. \nBoth Kurelis and Peterss are seen as viable candidates for leadership – both seek continued Latvian independence, and both seek to regain the City of Riga. Peterss believes that only with the alliance of the Commune of France can Latvia remain independent. Kurelis, on the other hand, is adamant that Latvia must put itself first – either by remaining truly independent, or, depending on how the situation develops, by seeing common cause with another likeminded regional power bloc that may wish to challenge the Germans.\nAs the stability and very existence of an independent Latvia is at stake, Kurelis has decided that it is in the country’s interest to end this farce of a Constitutional Convention as soon as possible. Lest Latvia be handed over to socialists, who run the risk of losing the previous independence we have finally gained after centuries, we must make sure to discredit Peterss and his movement. Or, we could just arrest him... "
 ISKO.1.a: "We will accuse Peterss of fraternising with the enemy!"
 ISKO.1.b: "We will quietly arrest Peterss under false pretences!"

 ISKO.2.t: "The Capture Fails"
 ISKO.2.d: "When the small group of men from the Imanta Regiment came to Liepāja to secretly apprehend Peterss, he was nowhere to be found. They were soon made aware that Peterss has been leading his movement from the underground for the past number of days, and details of his precise whereabouts at the moment are scanty at best.\nSupport from the public and the Constitutional Convention itself remains within reach for both main groups, so we cannot take any chances. It may be best to root out Peterss like the rat he is, and apprehend him definitely, rather than resort to the more subtle means we had tried and failed with previously. Or, we just could make an example of his cowardice, increasing our own support among the Convention.\nOf course, our attempts to publically root him out may not go down as well with the general population, but they will learn the necessity of such measures, in time."
 ISKO.2.a: "We will not leave Liepāja until we find him!"
 ISKO.2.b: "Show the people that Peterss’ weakness makes him unfit to rule!"

 ISKO.3.t: "A Fork in the Road"
 ISKO.3.d: "Revolutionary syndicalism has come to dominate the international socialist movement. In Latvia, however, many socialists, including much of the leadership of our new republic, still cling to the ideals of the Bolsheviks. While the relationship would not be otherwise unworkable, agreeing to adopt syndicalist ideas, at least in part, could facilitate greater cooperation with the syndicalist powers of Europe. Should this idea be made a reality?"
 ISKO.3.a: "Hold fast to the ideals of the Bolsheviks"
 ISKO.3.b: "Implement a Syndicalist model"

 ISKO.4.t: "Looking to the Past"
 ISKO.4.d: "Syndicalism has been rejected in favour of the further development of the ideals of the old Bolsheviks of the Russian revolution to whom we are so intimately linked."
 ISKO.4.a: "Lenin shall be avenged."

 ISKO.5.t: "Syndicalism Ascendant"
 ISKO.5.d: "The ascendency of syndicalism cannot be denied. To facilitate relations with the powers of the Third Internationale, we must accept a basically syndicalist economic model."
 ISKO.5.a: "A necessary choice."

 ISKO.6.t: "The Direction of the Economy"
 ISKO.6.d: "Disagreements over rural economic policies have proven difficult to resolve. As such, beginning today, the members of the politburo will work non-stop on an all-encompassing plan thereof."
 ISKO.6.a: "Let the forces of reaction quiver."

 ISKO.7.t: "Oversight of the Collectivisation Process"
 ISKO.7.d: "How the state should bring about reform has caused disagreement among members of the central government. While some, including comrade Peterss, would prefer the central government directly carry out the process of reform, some have called for a more nuanced approach. They argue that the rural people, already inclined towards revolutionary action, could be encouraged to carry out the policy themselves, dispensing with reaction how they see fit. That, they argue, while perhaps more difficult and less comprehensive, would ensure popular support for even more controversial state policies."
 ISKO.7.a: "The state shall act alone."
 ISKO.7.b: "Allow for local implementation."

 ISKO.8.t: "The Expropriation Debate"
 ISKO.8.d: "While it is undeniable that central management will rapidly transform rural production networks for the better, short term economic disruption could turn the people against the revolution. As such, some moderates, much to the disdain of Comrade Peterss, call for smaller businesses and landowners to be spared from complete expropriation, even if they are to be brought down a peg."
 ISKO.8.a: "Take it all."
 ISKO.8.b: "Small operations need not be disrupted."

 ISKO.9.t: "On Direct State Ownership"
 ISKO.9.d: "In addition to mere collectivisation, some call for the state to take direct control of some agricultural lands."
 ISKO.9.a: "Implement direct state ownership."
 ISKO.9.b: "Push for collectivisation instead."

 ISKO.10.t: "The Kulak Question"
 ISKO.10.d: "The rich-peasant Kulak class has long attempted to conceal their exploitative practices beneath a faux-toiler veneer. Without question, the day of reckoning for all deemed to be Kulaks has dawned. some, however, wish to treat the Kulaks more harshly than others. The Kulaks, these moderates argue, can be reformed simply by transforming their relationship with productive forces. They argue that rather than expropriate Kulaks entirely, thy should be allowed to maintain small plots for their own cultivation without the assistance of contracted labourers."
 ISKO.10.a: "Foolish! We must treat them as outright reactionaries."
 ISKO.10.b: "Kulaks can be reformed."

 ISKO.11.t: "The Compensation Debate"
 ISKO.11.d: "As part of the collectivisation process, the land and possessions of some otherwise revolutionary-spirited individuals will have to taken by the state. In the interest of equality, many believe even such upright individuals should not receive formal compensation in one form or another, much to the chagrin of some."
 ISKO.11.a: "Ignore the idea."
 ISKO.11.b: "Offer compensation."

 ISKO.12.t: "The Abolition of Private Agriculture"
 ISKO.12.d: "With the most contested issues surrounding rural economic policy resolved, a draft has been completed and disseminated throughout the party. As the result of the debates, the politburo has further promulgated a memo affirming the party's intent to ultimately abolish individual ownership of land, framing the much debated policy draft as a step towards that goal."
 ISKO.12.a: "A communist society surely dawns!"

 ISKO.13.t: "The Spread of Collectivisation"
 ISKO.13.d: "With the most contested issues surrounding rural economic policy resolved, a draft has been completed and disseminated throughout the party. As the result of the debates, the politburo has further promulgated a memo affirming the party's intent to see the gradual amalgamation of all farms into large collective operations without disrupting the countryside, framing the much debated policy draft as a step towards that goal."
 ISKO.13.a: "From the people to the people!"

 ISKO.14.t: "Rural Structures Upended"
 ISKO.14.d: "Aggressive state policies in pursuit of the abolition of the individual ownership of land have totally upended established informal systems of trade and resource allocation. While this may be necessary in the long run, certain regions have begun to experience profound social, and increasingly economic, turmoil."
 ISKO.14.a: "This could have grave consequences."

 ISKO.15.t: "A Weak Harvest"
 ISKO.15.d: "Owing to the disruption in the countryside, entire several large farms have suddenly gone belly-up and left their crops to whither. While central leadership were initially shielded from this grim news, the resulting famine in certain localities has become undeniable. While decisive action to relieve affected areas has now been taken, the bodies are still being counted."
 ISKO.15.a: "A least the worst has passed."


 ISKO.17.t: "Comrade Peterss Visits Skulte"
 ISKO.17.d: "Following the Rural Commune acts after the abolition of serfdom in the Baltic provinces, Latvian and Estonian peasantry began to organise into rural communes, known in German as the Landgemeinde, which were granted autonomy, democratic self-government and certain powers as well as privileges. As a result, a generation of peasants in these areas have grown up under largely autonomous and democratic conditions. Participation in the political process and the upkeep of traditional Baltic culture were the norm in these areas, even under wider German domination.\n\nWhile mostly left alone, the election of one Pēteris Briedis as the elder of the Skulte Landsgemeinde, however, caused something of a stir among the Germans. Briedis, an inhabitant of the parish who had at the time moved to Riga to work in its naval dockyards and joined its trade union movement, came to identify as a syndicalist, and was elected by the commune with with a political platform focused on the implementation of syndicalism locally.\n\nToday, Comrade Peterss made a high-profile visit to the commune and shook hands with Elder Briedis. The two shook hands in front of cameras operated by the state press and the success of the commune was documented to promote socialism among the people more broadly. Despite the ideological differences between the two men, the image of Peterss and Briedis shaking hands has come to prominence among state propaganda."
 ISKO.17.a: "An inspiration."

 ISKO.18.t: "The Red Graf In Red Latvia"
 ISKO.18.d_1: "Alexander von Stenbock-Fermor, better known as the Red Graf, became the most prominent German voice for socialism within the Duchy. He chose to stay in Riga following the collapse of German authority over the rest of the Baltic and further did not flee after the conquest of Riga. Indeed, he has today publicly sworn allegiance to our government and released a new political pamphlet urging the Germans of Riga to uphold the authority of the Iskolat Republic."
 ISKO.18.d_2: "Alexander von Stenbock-Fermor, better known as the Red Graf, became the most prominent German voice for socialism within the Duchy. While he initially chose to stay in Riga following the collapse of German authority over the rest of the Baltic but after releasing a few pamphlets in support of our regime, he eventually relocated to Liepāja and encouraged the people of Riga and the Germans under Iskolat rule to uphold our government. His support has been pivotal in increasing German enthusiasm for socialism."
 ISKO.18.a: "Welcome, comrade!"

 ISKO.19.t: "Bureaucratic Consolidation"
 ISKO.19.d: "With the consolidation of the economy, the various ministries established to oversee the function of particular sectors have now been brought under one unifying umbrella with a single minister responsible for economic development more broadly. We now fully affirm that no economic function is independent from any other. The bread that the worker eats every day comes from the fields and allows him to work in the factories. One area should not be administered without full concerned for the others."
 ISKO.19.a: "Less is more."

 ISKO.20.t: "The Question of Federalism"
 ISKO.20.d: "The Iskolat Republic was established as a unitary state, with all power assigned to the regions and localities devolved by the national government. This was ultimately a matter of simplicity which was deemed necessary in light of the small size of Latvia while the Republic found its feet. Our leadership however remains committed to the federalist ideal almost to the one, at least in theory. Time and time again, pressure has emerged from within the party to establish a federalist system, albeit without compromising the leading position of the party and its control over all organs of state power. While the impact of federalism would be rather minor practically, if our country were ever to expand (for whatever reason), it might be worth the initial difficulty in changing over."
 ISKO.20.a: "No need."
 ISKO.20.b: "Implement the change."

 ISKO.21.t: "Anarchists Cell Uncovered"
 ISKO.21.d: "Today in the heart of the Livonian countryside, authorities in one small village garnered some amount of attention, including in the state press, in light of their capture of a cell of anarchists. While many anarchists around the world generally identify with the socialist bloc as it now exists, many, including here at home, oppose our present regime and hope to see it undone by any means necessary, and our recent military build-up has provided them the opportunity to get their hands on armaments which they intended to use to affect our overthrow. Fortunately, however, this particular group was headed off and the local authorities have drawn praise."
 ISKO.21.a: "Excellent."

 ISKO.22.t: "Academic Discontent"
 ISKO.22.d: "The disloyalty of the academic community has become increasingly clear over the last few months. In particular, the failure of three pro-regime doctoral candidates across the country drew condemnation from our government, though Comrade Peterss himself remained silent. But despite his silence, Peterss began to push for a thorough cleansing of the ivory tower, drafting a series of potential justifications and replacement candidates for members of certain departments at the few academies operating in Latvia. With a word, the upending of the academy can begin."
 ISKO.22.a: "Being the purge."

 ISKO.23.t: "Official Embarrassment"
 ISKO.23.d: "The effort to redevelop Liepāja into an appropriate venue for an exposition to proletarian internationalism and the promise of a socialist future has progressed quickly. Wide avenues have replaced crowded streets and grand government buildings have been built in mere months with proper investment with further projects still in progress. However, reactionary elements in society have seized on the increased publicity given the city by our western socialist allies to undermine our regime and its foreign relationships. One famous church in Liepāja, with its crucifixes already removed, but not entirely shuttered, unfurled a series of political banners before a camera crew from the Internationale ahead of an important visit. The leadership of the church will be punished and the building will certainly be bulldozed, but the damage has already been done to our international relationship and we dare not further inflame the incident by coming down on the crew and requiring that the footage be deleted. Hopefully the damage will be minimal."
 ISKO.23.a: "Tear that steeple down."

 ISKO.24.t: "Spontaneous Revolutionary Tribunals"
 ISKO.24.d: "With the decapitation of the reactionary faction within Latvia, the task of eliminating anti-socialist elements in society at larger has often fallen on the hands of local patriots and comrades. Now, however, the practice of localities establishing unregulated revolutionary tribunals to try and sentence reactionary elements outside of the purview of the formal legal system has grown to a fever pitch. The fervour and radicalism of these local comrades has become a cause for concern among or government and agents have been sent down to the villages in an attempt to curtail the practice and move the accused individuals to state courts."
 ISKO.24.a: "Such is for the state alone."

 ISKO.25.t: "Payback"
 ISKO.25.d: "The build-up of foreign equipment, which began almost three months ago, has led some arms to filter down to Lett comrades abroad, particularly in nearby Latgale and the city of Daugavpils. Owing to their past conflicts, Boris Savinkov has long sought to one-up Peterss and the influx of weapons provided that opportunity. The details are quite grim, but needless to say, pro-Iskolat cells within the Latgale region were thoroughly infiltrated and their leaders identified. The photos of one comrade forced to bear a gruesome message for Peterss from Savinkov signalled the gruesome end of one particular cell and clearly communicated a personal animosity."
 ISKO.25.a: "He'll get his due in turn."

 LATFOR.1.t: "Ultimatum for Dvinsk?"
 LATFOR.1.d: "With Russia embroiled in conflict, it seems that now would be an opportune time to bring the Latvians of Dvinsk into the fold. We could send an ultimatum to the socialists in control of Dvinsk, bypassing the white government entirely. Afterall, intervention by even a small power such as ourselves could affect the outcome of the civil war."
 LATFOR.1.a: "Do it."
 LATFOR.1.b: "Back down."

 LATFOR.2.t: "Latvian Provocations"
 LATFOR.2.d: "Apparently, the upstart Latvian Republic, a tiny nation by every measure, is planning to make a move for the Latvian-inhabitted Dvinsk region in the near future."
 LATFOR.2.a: "Issue a warning."

 LATFOR.3.t: "Latvian Ultimatum"
 LATFOR.3.d: "As expected, Latvia has officially made its move for Dvinsk. Latvian troops have been moved to the border and an ultimatum formally issued - Dvinsk or war."

 LATFOR.7.a: "Thank you kindly."

 LATFOR.8.t: "Latvia Demands Unification"
 LATFOR.8.d: "As expected, the pro-Russian Latvian government has officially made its move for Baltic unification. Latvian troops have been moved to the border and ultimatum formally issued - Unification or war."

 LATFOR.8.b: "Long-awaited independence for nothing?"
 
 LATFOR.9.t: "The [FROM.GetName] Accepts"
 LATFOR.9.d: "While war was expected, our demands have been met. Estonia is ours."
 LATFOR.9.a: "A welcome surprise."

 LATFOR.10.t: "A Proposal From Latvia"
 LATFOR.10.d: "Latvia has put forth an interesting proposal. Seeking investment from nearby governments and the deepening of economic interdependency, the Latvians have drafted a plan for the creation of a jointly owned industrial holdings company."
 LATFOR.10.a: "An agreeable proposal."
 LATFOR.10.b: "No, thank you."

 LATFOR.11.t: "Offer Accepted"
 LATFOR.11.d: "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our proposal. This shall surely deepen economic interdependence."
 LATFOR.11.a: "Great!"

 LATFOR.12.t: "Offer Rejected"
 LATFOR.12.d: "Despite the obvious economic benefits, [FROM.GetName] has rejected our proposal."
 LATFOR.12.a: "Damn!"

 LATFOR.13.t: "Latvian Arms Deal"
 LATFOR.13.d: "While they seek to build their own armaments industry, Latvia lacks sufficient arms for the time being. As such, they have requested several thousand small arms as assistance."
 LATFOR.13.a: "We accept."
 LATFOR.13.b: "Tell them to keep their money."

 LATFOR.14.t: "Arms Deal Finalised"
 LATFOR.14.d: "[FROM.GetName] has agreed to supply us with a few thousand guns and infantry kit."

 LATFOR.16.d: "Latvia, our old brothers in arms, have proposed the immediate loosening of many trade and border laws in an attempt to solve the structural economic issues caused by the dissolution of the United Baltic Duchy in areas on our shared border. Eventually, the proposed agreement stipulates that we should explore the development of a unified trade policy."
 LATFOR.16.a: "We cannot help but agree."
 LATFOR.16.b: "No, thank you."

 LATFOR.17.t: "Estonia Accepts"
 LATFOR.17.d: "Estonia has agreed to develop a common trade policy, immediately lowering certain trade barriers."
 LATFOR.17.a: "As it should be."

 LATFOR.18.a: "The end of an era."

 LATFOR.19.t: "Common Defence Agreement"
 LATFOR.19.d: "Latvia, our old brothers in arms, have proposed an exchange of defence commitments in case the independence of one nation or this other was genuinely threatened in the course of war."

 LATFOR.21.b: "No. This shall go no further."

 LATFOR.22.t: "Russia Accepts"

 LATFOR.22.a: "Great!"

 LATFOR.23.t: "Russia Refuses"
 LATFOR.23.d: "Russia has refused, leaving adrift for the time in our search for a great power benefactor."
 LATFOR.23.a: "Damn."

 LATFOR.24.t: "Latvian Ultimatum"
 LATFOR.24.d: "Relations with Latvia have soured, and in a shocking move, the aggressive little Latvian state has now all but threatened war, seemingly out of the blue."
 LATFOR.24.a: "We must prepare."

 LATFOR.27.t: "A Baltic Last Stand?"
 LATFOR.27E.d: "War is upon us, and we are without allies. But this need not be the case.\n\nWe have been approached by our former brothers in arms in the Latvian government, who wish to upgrade our previous common defensive strategy into a more formal arrangement. They propose that we stand together and face our foes as one, a truly united front against the odds, just as we brought down that abominable Duchy together."
 LATFOR.27L.d: "War is upon us, and we are without allies. But this need not be the case.\n\nWe have been approached by the Latvians, who like ourselves have broken free of the German grip. They propose that we stand together and face our foes as one, a truly united front against the odds."
 LATFOR.27.a: "Yes, we should stand together."
 LATFOR.27.b: "We'd rather not."

 LATFOR.28.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts"

 LATFOR.29.d: "In a shocking result, the [FROM.GetAdjective]s have announced that would rather keep their current military arrangements as they are, and not formalise any further common defensive strategy."
 LATFOR.29.a: "Are they out of their minds?"

 LATFOR.30.t: "[FROM.GetName] seeks to join our Alliance"
 LATFOR.30.d: "At this dire hour, we have received a request from [FROM.GetNameDef] to join our alliance. They wish to show the world that small nations are not to be trifled with!"
 LATFOR.30.a: "Welcome, brothers!"
 LATFOR.30.b: "Faction's full, sorry."

 LATFOR.25.a: "War it is then."

 LATFOR.26.t: "The Direction of the Military"
 LATFOR.26.d: "While all agree on the need to integrate our nation into international trade networks and all of the defence implications involved, the army wishes to decide on its own vision for how it will operate.\nRegardless of whether or not we are alone in the world, or in an alliance with others, the army holds the position that it can either act as if it is part of a larger alliance, or attempt to act as a stand-alone force in its own right.\nThis positioning that the army will take, will affect how it trains and maintains its forces, and prepares them for whatever will happen in the future – regardless of what the political situation of the country is at the time."
 LATFOR.26.a: "The Latvian army will act as\npart of a greater whole."

### Easter egg stuff ###

 LAT_SOV_Create_Soviet_Union: "Repudiate the Failure of October"
 LAT_SOV_Create_Soviet_Union_desc: "The Great October Revolution was supposed to bring a socialist revolution to the entire Russian Empire, but it was suppressed by the reactionaries. We, the remnants of the Bolsheviks, have returned to Moscow, and can finally avenge this failure. The Union of Soviets shall rise again!"
 ISKO.16.t: "A New October!"
 ISKO.16.d: "Before France, before Britain, the Russian Empire raised the red flag, overthrowing its masters in the Great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 under the wise leadership of Vladimir Lenin and the Bolshevik Party. However, the material conditions of Russia proved to be insurmountable for the revolutionaries, and in a gruesome civil war, this revolution was destroyed by the reactionary powers.\n\nThose Russian socialists who survived eventually abandoned the Bolshevik ideas, believing them to have failed in practice, and adopted influences from the French and British syndicalists. But the Latvian socialists remained stalwart in their loyalty to Lenin's ideas. Before the Revolution, Latvia was the Bolshevik Party's greatest stronghold, it was the Latvian Riflemen who formed the first units of the Red Army, so even after Soviet Russia was destroyed, the Latvian exiles kept the spirit of the Party alive.\n\nEventually, they established a modest stronghold by the Baltic Sea, and now, they have returned to Moscow, where they may finally shed the shell of the Latvian socialist republic and restore the dream of Lenin - a Soviet Union of the peoples of the former Russian Empire. Lenin, Trotsky and the other martyrs of 1917 will finally be honoured."

 LAT_SOV_formulate_marxism_leninism: "Formulate Marxism-Leninism"
 LAT_SOV_formulate_marxism_leninism_desc: "Now entrenched in Russia, we must turn the memory of Lenin's ideas and the brief experience of the Soviet republic into a concise ideology, one which can rival Syndicalism. Marxism-Leninism eschews the decentralisation of our Syndicalist opponents and promotes the supremacy of the Party vanguard, a collective of dutiful socialists who can orchestrate the construction of socialism effectively."
 LAT_SOV_establish_red_army: "Establish the Red Army"
 LAT_SOV_establish_red_army_desc: "Syndicalist experiments at militias and communal defence have shown their weakness. The socialist motherland can only be defended by a strong, centralised military which is overseen by ideological commisars to ensure their loyalty to the Revolution."

 LAT_SOV_collectivization_desc: "In Latvia, we replaced private farms with agricultural collectives and witnessed the amount of grain extracted grow.

 LAT_SOV_new_soviet_man: "Construct Humanity Anew"
 LAT_SOV_new_soviet_man_desc: "Above all, we must pursue the creation of a New Man - a New Soviet Man.

The new humanity will be intelligent, educated, atheist, heroic, and loyal to the home of socialism."

 LAT_SOV_world_revolution_desc: "Our ultimate goal should be no less than the liberation of all of humanity - and we shall do it solely our way.

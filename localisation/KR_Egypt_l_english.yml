### Leaders ###
POLITICS_FUAD_I_DESC:0 "Fuad ascended to the Egyptian throne amidst the turmoil of the Weltkrieg and growing nationalism bolstered by continued British defeats in Europe. When the British Revolution broke out, Egypt revolted in turn. Fuad co-opted the revolution, presenting himself as an ardent nationalist, and promulgated a system of government modelled on that of Germany.\nFuad's subsequent social and economic reforms have raised questions in Egyptian society about the very identity of the Egyptian people and its place in a region still dominated by the hated Turk. Perhaps the seeds of progress sewn by Fuad will lead to glory. Perhaps his successors may succeed where other rulers have failed and lead Egypt to its rightful place as the shield and sword of an at last liberated Arab people."

EGY_egyptian_reforms_decisions:0 "Egyptian Reforms"
EGY_egyptian_reforms_decisions_desc:0 "Sultan Farouk, though still a teenager, has a grand vision of a modern Egypt. This vision sees an Egypt that merges the greatness inherent in herself with the best parts of western ways of governing. To that end he is exerting the considerable authority given to the Sultan to embark on a programme of nation-building, extending and codifying the power of the Egyptian state over previously untouched aspects of life."

EGY_libyan_egyptian_unification_decisions:0 "Libyan-Egyptian Unification"
EGY_libyan_egyptian_unification_decisions_desc:0 "With the dust settled in the Levant, Egyptian hawks have set their sight on the struggling nation of Tripolitania. Having only recently received its independence, the state is still struggling to decide its identity with concepts such as nationality new to most Libyans. This has opened up a window for expansion as the Bureau for Arab Affairs in Cairo has proposed to use subterfuge to bring the HIMT to power and through them annex Tripolitania into a greater Egyptian state."
EGY_promote_the_HIMT:0 "Fund the HIMT"
EGY_promote_the_HIMT_desc:0 "Named the Egypto-Tripolitanian Unification Party, this small offshoot of the wider Arab nationalist movement is the initiative of 'Ali Rajab who enlightened by the greatness of Egypt during his visit to Alexandria pursues the integration of Tripolitania into the greater Egyptian state, claiming that Tripolitania on its own has not the resources nor power to stand on its own."
EGY_pan_arabist_propaganda:0 "Pan-Arabist Propaganda"
EGY_pan_arabist_propaganda_desc:0 "Used to great effect in the lead-up to the War in the Desert, Radio Free Cairo and our network of Arab propagandists are working overtime to spread their message far and wide. Even in the tiniest village must Libyans be glued to their radio sets, listening to the great deeds of the Egyptian people and their immense martial prowess."

EGY_decry_tripolitanian_nationalism_desc:0 "Although there has been a recent rise in Tripolitanian nationalism, exceeding the normal city and family ties that Libyans traditionally held sacred, it's still weak and through renewed efforts of our propaganda machine, can be replaced by a feeling of Arab statehood and with it a desire to become part of the Egyptian state."

### Focus Tree - Economy ###
EGY_modernization_program:0 "Modernisation Program"
EGY_modernization_program_desc:0 "The extremely weak nature of the Egyptian industrial economy requires our attention, through a programme of subsidies and state-sponsored businesses we can bring industrialisation to Egypt and become a truly modern country."
EGY_egyptian_oil:0 "Egyptian Oil"
EGY_egyptian_oil_desc:0 "Egypt has rich oil resources, if we could only exploit them. Foreign companies are keen to gain access to our reserves and will pay top dollar for them, by setting up joint ventures between them and the state we can save on the equipment required and ensure we get our cut."
EGY_nile_dams:0 "Nile Dams"
EGY_nile_dams_desc:0 "In 1903 the Nile was dammed by British engineer William Willcocks, now to support the electrification of Egypt we have several further damming projects planned along the White Nile that will provide power for thousands of homes and cities."
EGY_industrialization:0 "Industrialisation Plan"
EGY_industrialization_desc:0 "Egyptian industry requires substantial investment if it is to bloom, and to that end we have prepared a battery of policies intended to foster the growth of both heavy and light industries."
EGY_civilian_improvements:0 "Civilian Improvements"
EGY_civilian_improvements_desc:0 "Our policies have begun to pay off in the field of civilian manufacturing, with the manufacturing sector showing strong growth in our major urban centres."
EGY_modernized_agriculture:0 "Modernised Agriculture"
EGY_modernized_agriculture_desc:0 "The tractor is a wonderous invention that could revolutionize agriculture on the banks of the Nile. By supporting the mechanisation of farming we can not only vastly increase output but also increase migration to towns and cities, supporting industy."
EGY_civilian_investments:0 "Civilian Investments"
EGY_civilian_investments_desc:0 "While the private sector has been encouraged by our investments we must go further, and found some entirely state-owned enterprizes to produce vital goods for our industry."
EGY_red_see_trade:0 "Red Sea Ports"
EGY_red_see_trade_desc:0 "Egypt's focus has long been the Mediterranean Sea, however there is a vast expanse to our south that could benefit from some infrastructure to support both military and trading vessels."
EGY_railroad_expansion:0 "Railroad Expansion"
EGY_railroad_expansion_desc:0 "Transportation is a vital part of our programme, and while previously our railraods had been purely built for the purposes of transporting goods to ports for export we intend to make the network much denser and provide for transportation between settlements for internal movement of goods and people."
EGY_egyptian_airports:0 "Egyptian Air Ports"
EGY_egyptian_airports_desc:0 "Aviation is more of a prestige project for us currently, showing Egypt to be the leading light of the Middle East in technical innovation. By constructing new airports with the help of European experts we can reinforce this notion and work towards a commercially viable aviation industry."
EGY_military_improvements:0 "Military Investments"
EGY_military_improvements_desc:0 "One of the easiest areas in which we can expand out industry is in arms production, over which we have a great deal of direct influence. Encouraging the domestic production of lisenced German firearms will not only support the economy but arm the nation."
EGY_dockyards_of_alexandria:0 "Dockyards of Alexandria"
EGY_dockyards_of_alexandria_desc:0 "Alexandria was once the largest and most important port on the Mediterranean, while she may no longer claim this particular honour some expansion of her drydock and anchorage will let us accomodate the young Egyptian fleet more comfortably."
EGY_cairo_institute_of_arms:0 "German Investment"
EGY_cairo_institute_of_arms_desc:0 "Mauser and Walther, these names are a byword for quality armaments the world over. Now prestigious German firms are seeking to establish factories in Egypt and buy government arms contracts, we see no reason to prevent them."
EGY_military_factories:0 "Electrification Program"
EGY_military_factories_desc:0 "Electricity in Egypt is entirely under the control of private companies, and as such there is very little standardisation of voltage and outlets. By introducing the Egyptian Electrical Authority we can bring electricity to rural areas as well as enforcing nation-wide standards."
EGY_egyptian_cinema:0 "Hollywood On The Nile"
EGY_egyptian_cinema_desc:0 "Our burgeoning middle class has shown a great appetite for the cinema and for the state it presents an untapped industry. Egypt is a sunny country with striking landscapes suitable for filming in, and as such large tax breaks should bring film companies flocking to our shores."
EGY_egyptian_radio:0 "Egyptian Radio"
EGY_egyptian_radio_desc:0 "Sultan Farouk's coronation speech was the first nationwide royal broadcast in Egyptian history, bringing the masses closer to their king than many of them could have dreamed. Now by investing in our communications infrastructure the whole nation may hear the Sultan's voice! The music is also popular."
EGY_blue_nile_dams:0 "Blue Nile Dams"
EGY_blue_nile_dams_desc:0 "Damming the White Nile was politically easy, given that over 90% of it lies within our realm. However the Blue Nile has presented a harder challenge, as much of it lies within the sometimes hostile nation of Ethiopia. We have resolved to press ahead with the project however and bring electrification to most of Sudan."
EGY_synthetic_resources:0 "More Desert Oil"
EGY_synthetic_resources_desc:0 "The success of our earlier oil ventures has given rise to a greater demand for exploitation than we have the resources to meet. By legalising and engaging in the sale of oil futures we can gain the capital to expand production extremely quickly."
EGY_modernize_sudan:0 "Modernise Sudan"
EGY_modernize_sudan_desc:0 "Thus far most of our efforts in modernisation have focussed on Egypt proper, and Sudan has benefited only maringally. By investing in the major urban centres at Khartoum, Omdurman and Jubba we can extend our reforms southward."
EGY_expand_railroads:0 "Expand Railroads Southwards"
EGY_expand_railroads_desc:0 "By expanding the rail network in Sudan and making it part of the wider Egyptian rail system we will not only improve the economy but ensure that Sudan is more strongly linked with Egypt proper than the rest of Africa."
EGY_invest_in_sudan:0 "Invest in Sudan"
EGY_invest_in_sudan_desc:0 "There are any number of rich people, Egyptian or otherwise, who wish to invest in our nation. Perhaps tax incentives could encourage them to take their money southwards, where it will breathe new life into the local economy."
EGY_airports_for_sudan:0 "Airports for Sudan"
EGY_airports_for_sudan_desc:0 "While the railway is a wonderful way to travel it just isn't fast enough for the breakneck pace at which business can move. By investing in air transport links with Khartoum we can ensure that businessmen resident in Cairo and Alexandria can look to their interests in the south at a moment's notice, as well provide air bases for the Royal Egyptian Air Force."
EGY_resources_of_the_south:0 "Resources of the South"
EGY_resources_of_the_south_desc:0 "We have it on good authority from a geological expedition by the University of Cairo that there are immense mineral deposits in Sudan just waiting to be tapped. Backing a new joint German-Egyptian Chromium concern will allow us to bring heavy industry to our southern reaches and diversify their economy immensely"
EGY_new_universities:0 "New Universities"
EGY_new_universities_desc:0 "It is not enough simply to rely on foreign experts to run our businesses. The creation of several new Austrian-style institutes of technology and research universities that will teach not just the liberal arts but physics, chemical engineering and nuclear science will greatly expand the knowledge base of our nation and provide skilled workers for modern industries."
EGY_egyptian_steel:0 "Egyptian Steel"
EGY_egyptian_steel_desc:0 "Consumerate with our new commitment to technical education comes a need to invest in a broader resource base. Rather than shipping ore abroad we intend to set up rolling mills in Port Said to produce Egyptian Steel for domestic use."
EGY_new_economy:0 "New Economy"
EGY_new_economy_desc:0 "In just a few short years Egypt's economy has begun to turn around, far from being a backwards agricultural nation she now enjoys a strong industrial base, institutions of higher education and a modern transport system. Whatever else may be, nobody can accuse the New Sultanate of being behind the times."
### Focus Tree - Politics ###
EGY_black_monday_recovery:0 "Begin Black Monday Recovery"
EGY_black_monday_recovery_desc:0 "While Black Monday has hit our relatively small manufacturing sector hard the biggest harm has been the fall in exports, particularly that of cotton. A vigorous program of support for agriculture, the financial sector and industrial assets should begin as soon as possible."
EGY_secure_cotton_fields:0 "Secure Cotton Fields"
EGY_secure_cotton_fields_desc:0 "Cotton has a long history in Egypt, and is one of the crops most vital to our export economy. By taking unprofitable plantations into state ownership and consolidating them we can shore up the industry, as well as supporting our farmers and land owners."
EGY_cotton_subsidies:0 "Cotton Subsidies"
EGY_cotton_subsidies_desc:0 "The success of our purchase of cotton plantations has been apparent. Now that we have cushioned the impact of Black Monday on this sector we should institute a minimum price for cotton while simultaneously allowing estates to pass back into private hands, hopefully insuring us against another crash."
EGY_secure_holdings:0 "Secure Holdings"
EGY_secure_holdings_desc:0 "Not since the 1907 crash has the Egyptian stock market taken such a beating, the fallout from Black Monday is immense, but also opens up opportunities for us if we can manage matters correctly. For now we will close the Cairo and Alexandria stock exchanges in order to carry out some emergency restructuring."
EGY_protect_industry:0 "Protect Industry"
EGY_protect_industry_desc:0 "Protecting Egypt's small and fragile industrial base is a task best undertaken without too much foreign competition. With the introduction of tariffs and inducements to 'Buy Egyptian' we can show our support to our industrialists and aid them in weathering the economic storm."
EGY_reopen_stock_exchange:0 "Re-open the Stock Exchange"
EGY_reopen_stock_exchange_desc:0 "Allowing the Alexandria and Cairo Stock Exchange to remain closed any longer would be a mistake. The longer we keep one of Africa and the Middle East's most active stock markets closed the more we risk its position as a hub of trading. Reopening the market will show our confidence in the emergency reforms we have pushed through as well as allowing the recovery to begin."
EGY_black_monday_over:0 "Black Monday is Over"
EGY_black_monday_over_desc:0 "It seems that our programs are begining to pay off. While economies closer to the German sphere or embroiled in civil unrest continue sluggishly Egypt is already seeing a recovery in employment and economic growth."
EGY_farouks_reforms:0 "Farouk's Reforms"
EGY_farouks_reforms_desc:0 "Sultan Farouk, though still a teenager, has a grand vision of a modern Egypt. This vision sees an Egypt that merges the greatness inherent in herself with the best parts of western ways of governing. To that end he is exerting the considerable authority given to the Sultan to embark on a programme of nation-building, extending and codifying the power of the Egyptian state over previously untouched aspects of life."
EGY_adminstrative_reforms:0 "Adminstrative Reforms"
EGY_adminstrative_reforms_desc:0 "Currently in Egypt the state's power is based around notable locals, be they land owners or village headmen. This is an obvious area of priority for our young Sultan, who aims to standardize administration into four dozen governorates. The question now becomes who should be appointed to each one, and how?"
EGY_judical_reforms:0 "Judicial Reforms"
EGY_judical_reforms_desc:0 "Egypt's court system was innovative in 1875, however jurisprudence has moved on. Now with collaboration of jurists from the University of Cairo Sultan Farouk intends to overhaul the legal process. This affords the various factions in the Government to help influence exactly what that means"
EGY_land_reform:0 "Land Reforms"
EGY_land_reform_desc:0 "With the new governorate system proving effective the question of land reform has come up: we now have the authority to redistribute land and put it in the hands of peasants, who previously had rented it or even been enslaved. We could however formalize the status quo to win the support of the nobility, or use this chance to enhance the personal power of the Sultan instead."
EGY_legal_reforms:0 "Legal Reforms"
EGY_legal_reforms_desc:0 "Laying down the new Egyptian Civil Code is a huge task, and it would be a much better idea to base the system on a prexisting legal code. To that end various jurists are advising the Sultan on different codes of law, to see which one takes his fancy..."
EGY_bureaucracy_reforms:0 "Bureaucracy Reforms"
EGY_bureaucracy_reforms_desc:0 "Day-to-day bureaucracy is required to run a modern state with any kind of efficiency, to that end the hiring of officials must be overhauled to create a single system. Two camps are emerging pushing different ideas: one calls for meritocratic examinations to be given, the other for pedigree and tradition to be respected."
EGY_parliament_reform:0 "Parliamentarian Reforms"
EGY_parliament_reform_desc:0 "The question of the day is that of elections. While Egypt has adopted the German model of the royal diet being able to veto but not introduce legislation the question of liberalisation is being raised by those hoping to hope for a more British-style system. It will fall to the Sultan to support the status quo, liberalise or possibly even gut the diet all together!"
EGY_islams_status:0 "Religious Reforms"

### Events ###

egy.1.t:0 "The Sultanate of Egypt"
egy.1.d:0 "The history of modern Egypt conventionally began in 1882 when Egypt joined the British sphere of influence in the region, a situation that conflicted with Egypt's de jure position as part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1914 the Protectorate was made official and the title of the head of state, which had changed from Pasha to Khedive in 1867, was again changed to Sultan. This formally repudiated the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, who was backing the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg. Abbas II was deposed by the British and replaced as Sultan by his uncle, Husayn Kamil. Upon his death in 1917, his only son, Prince Kamal al-Din Husayn, declined the succession, and Husayn Kamil's brother Ahmed Fuad ascended the throne as Fuad I.\n\nWith the ratification of the Peace with Honour, Egypt remained part of a now weakened British sphere. This would increase anger within the Egyptian populace that exploded in violence in 1925 during the collapse of the British Empire. This would become known as the Egyptian Revolution where Fuad I proved his legitimacy by leading the people in the revolution. The Revolution was largely nationalistic in nature uniting Egyptians of all social classes, faiths, and occupations together to rid Egypt of the foreign British once and for all. In the chaos of the revolution, an international coalition (primarily led by Britain and Germany) seized the Suez canal, which Egypt was forced to accept in order to avoid an open conflict with the former central powers.\n\nSince the revolution there has been a conflict between liberals that seek to go further and make the monarchy a true constitutional monarchy and the conservatives that wish to keep the status quo. Moreover as 1936 arrives, the sultanate's eyes go increasingly upon the Young Farouk, the heir to the throne whom is being groomed for the throne. With the decline of the Ottoman empire, members of all political parties began to wonder and plan of restoring the might of Egypt and dreaming of an Ottoman Free Middle-East..."

The issue at hand is that less than six percent of Egypt's population owns more than 65% of the land of the country with less than 0.5% of Egyptians owning more than one third of all Fertile land. The liberals wish to combat this by redistributing the land to the people, principally through buying the land from the nobility. However, the conservatives despise such a notion and believe that such an action will only hurt Egypt's agricultural production. A third possibility has been brought up, and that would be to nationalise the land and have it all be the Sultan's land - at least on paper, anyways. The Sultan is already the largest landowner in Egypt, so this would not be impossible to implement."

The liberals believe that the British law within our legal system might be the best way to adopt, while conservatives believe that the French law is better. Finally some believe looking at the ideas of Muhammad Ali that he brought into the Egyptian system would yield the best system."

egy.15.a:0 "Land Tax."
egy.15.b:0 "Flat Tax."
egy.15.c:0 "Progressive Tax."

egy.16.t:0 "Literacy Program"
egy.16.d:0 "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the topic of literacy has been brought up. The vast majority of Egypt's population is illiterate with nearly an 80% illiteracy rate, principally within the rural areas. To counter this a program of educating the population is to begin.

egy.20.t:0 "Absolutist Egypt"

egy.100.t:0 "Questions of Egyptian Identity"
egy.100.d:0 "When the Egyptian revolution of 1925 happened, questions started to emerge asking what does it mean to be Egyptian? When was Egypt great? For it was the first time in centuries that we are free and independent and now we are able to properly ask these questions. Thus two concepts of what it means to be Egyptian have formed looking back on the past with romanticism though at radically different periods of Egyptian history.\n\nThe first camp is known as the Pharaonism. They look to the pre-Islamic past to the days of the Pharaohs for a time when Egypt was truly great and powerful. They argue that Egypt is a Mediterranean civilisation and stress the role of the Mediterranean sea within Egyptian Culture, though they do not neglect the Nile. Largely it aligns with the Liberal parties though strictly speaking it is not liberal, and even some of the Watani support it. It is by far the most influential form of identity of Egypt in 1936.\n\nThe Second cultural movement is the Islamist movement that arose as a counter to the more mainstream Pharaonism. They answer the question as to when was Egypt great by looking to the Fatimid Caliphate and the Ayyubid dynasty. Instead of the Pharaohs, whom they decry as pagan and absolute tyrants, they look back to the time when Egypt was the centre of the Islamic world. When a multi-ethnic and tolerant Egypt was the dominate Islamic power. This cultural movement is more of a conservative counter to the more mainstream Pharaonism and is largely tied to the Conservative movements, particularly the Ittihad Party.\n\nIt should be noted that both camps support a multi-ethnic Egypt, both Pharaonists and Islamist believe that Egypt has always been a multi-ethnic state. Both concepts are largely romantic nationalist in nature and have an impact upon culture and the arts."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_FUAD_I_DESC:0 "Fuad ascended to the Egyptian throne amidst the turmoil of the Weltkrieg and growing nationalism bolstered by continued British defeats in Europe. When the British Revolution broke out, Egypt revolted in turn. Fuad co-opted the revolution, presenting himself as an ardent nationalist, and promulgated a system of government modelled on a mix of those of Germany and Britain, helped in this task by the Wafd party, which will proceed to dominate the political life under the constitutional-minded Fuad, happy to cooperate with the Wafd to preserve Egypt's places as a regional power, even if he did not hesitate to use his rights to dissolve parliament to solve any potential governmental issues.\n\nTheir subsequent social and economic reforms have raised questions in Egyptian society about the very identity of the Egyptian people and its place in a region still dominated by the hated Turk. Perhaps the seeds of progress sewn by Fuad will lead to glory. Perhaps his successors may succeed where other rulers have failed and lead Egypt to its rightful place as the shield and sword of an at last liberated Arab people."
POLITICS_FAROUK_DESC:0 "Born in 1920, the now-ruler of Egypt Farouk may be young, but that doesn't stop him from being a colorful personality. His family is of Albanian origin, but Farouk also has Ottoman, Greek, Circassian and French roots. He honored his origins during his childhood, which he spent traveling all over Europe, where he received a first-rate education that inspired a taste for modernity he would like to bring to his native country, and enabled him to establish numerous contacts with members of the nobility and elites he met. As crown prince, Farouk's character was already quite the opposite of that of his father Fuad, a rather passive monarch. Indeed, Farouk urged his father to intervene more in matters of governance, which created a rift between the crown prince and the ruling constitutionalist Wafd party.\n\nNow at the head of Egypt at just 16 years of age following his father's death, Farouk announced major reform projects and set up a committee, headed by himself, to carry them out. Despite his popularity with both the elite and the common people, Farouk has a peculiar character, known for being a notorious hedonist and dabbler in corruption, and his autocratic tendencies do not necessarily make him a competent leader in the eyes of many. It remains to be seen in which direction Farouk will lead his Egyptian homeland..."
POLITICS_KING_ABBAS_DESC:0 "Born into the Muhammad Ali dynasty in Alexandria in 1897, Nabil Abbas Halim was far from the image of an Egyptian prince. Abbas is indeed a man of the field, war pilot for Germany during the war, then president of a boxing club and a motor racing club; but it is above all his political activism that has made his reputation. Opposing Faoud and then Farouk, Price Halim was a fervent supporter of a more democratic and social system, his most cherished struggle being for better wages and working conditions for Egyptian workers and better living conditions for the poorest members of Egyptian society. Abbas also leads the Egyptian trade union movement as head of the General Federation of Labour Unions in the Kingdom of Egypt, serving as a unifying figure and moderator between the federation's moderate and radical tendencies.\n\nNow that a referendum has finally expelled the incompetent wannabe dictator Farouk, Abbas Helmy III intends to lead a new Egyptian monarchy, truly democratic and caring for its people, letting governments implement their policies without being a mindless obstructionist like Farouk."

This vision sees an Egypt that merges the greatness inherent in herself with the best parts of western ways of governing. To that end he is exerting the considerable authority given to the Sultan to embark on a programme of nation-building, extending and codifying the power of the Egyptian state over previously untouched aspects of life."

EGY_libyan_egyptian_unification_decisions_desc:0 "With the dust settled in the Levant, Egyptian hawks have set their sight on the struggling nation of Tripolitania. Having only recently received its independence, the state is still struggling to decide its identity with concepts such as nationality new to most Libyans. This has opened up a window for expansion as the Bureau for Arab Affairs in Cairo has proposed to use subterfuge to bring the HIMT to power and through them annex Tripolitania into a greater Egyptian state."
EGY_promote_the_HIMT:0 "Fund the HIMT"
EGY_promote_the_HIMT_desc:0 "Named the Egypto-Tripolitanian Unification Party, this small offshoot of the wider Arab nationalist movement is the initiative of 'Ali Rajab who enlightened by the greatness of Egypt during his visit to Alexandria pursues the integration of Tripolitania into the greater Egyptian state, claiming that Tripolitania on its own has not the resources nor power to stand on its own."

EGY_egyptian_oil:0 "Egyptian Oil"
EGY_egyptian_oil_desc:0 "Egypt has rich oil resources, if we could only exploit them. Foreign companies are keen to gain access to our reserves and will pay top dollar for them, by setting up joint ventures between them and the state we can save on the equipment required and ensure we get our cut."
EGY_nile_dams:0 "Nile Dams"
EGY_nile_dams_desc:0 "In 1903 the Nile was dammed by British engineer William Willcocks, now to support the electrification of Egypt we have several further damming projects planned along the White Nile that will provide power for thousands of homes and cities."

EGY_modernized_agriculture:0 "Modernised Agriculture"
EGY_modernized_agriculture_desc:0 "The tractor is a wonderous invention that could revolutionize agriculture on the banks of the Nile. By supporting the mechanisation of farming we can not only vastly increase output but also increase migration to towns and cities, supporting industy."
EGY_civilian_investments:0 "Civilian Investments"
EGY_civilian_investments_desc:0 "While the private sector has been encouraged by our investments we must go further, and found some entirely state-owned enterprizes to produce vital goods for our industry."
EGY_red_see_trade:0 "Red Sea Ports"

EGY_railroad_expansion:0 "Railroad Expansion"
EGY_railroad_expansion_desc:0 "Transportation is a vital part of our programme, and while previously our railraods had been purely built for the purposes of transporting goods to ports for export we intend to make the network much denser and provide for transportation between settlements for internal movement of goods and people."
EGY_egyptian_airports:0 "Egyptian Air Ports"
EGY_egyptian_airports_desc:0 "Aviation is more of a prestige project for us currently, showing Egypt to be the leading light of the Middle East in technical innovation.

EGY_military_improvements:0 "Military Investments"
EGY_military_improvements_desc:0 "One of the easiest areas in which we can expand out industry is in arms production, over which we have a great deal of direct influence. Encouraging the domestic production of lisenced German firearms will not only support the economy but arm the nation."
EGY_dockyards_of_alexandria:0 "Dockyards of Alexandria"
EGY_dockyards_of_alexandria_desc:0 "Alexandria was once the largest and most important port on the Mediterranean, while she may no longer claim this particular honour some expansion of her drydock and anchorage will let us accomodate the young Egyptian fleet more comfortably."

EGY_military_factories:0 "Electrification Program"
EGY_military_factories_desc:0 "Electricity in Egypt is entirely under the control of private companies, and as such there is very little standardisation of voltage and outlets. By introducing the Egyptian Electrical Authority we can bring electricity to rural areas as well as enforcing nation-wide standards."
EGY_egyptian_cinema:0 "Hollywood On The Nile"
EGY_egyptian_cinema_desc:0 "Our burgeoning middle class has shown a great appetite for the cinema and for the state it presents an untapped industry. Egypt is a sunny country with striking landscapes suitable for filming in, and as such large tax breaks should bring film companies flocking to our shores."
EGY_egyptian_radio:0 "Egyptian Radio"
EGY_egyptian_radio_desc:0 "Sultan Farouk's coronation speech was the first nationwide royal broadcast in Egyptian history, bringing the masses closer to their king than many of them could have dreamed.

EGY_blue_nile_dams:0 "Blue Nile Dams"
EGY_blue_nile_dams_desc:0 "Damming the White Nile was politically easy, given that over 90% of it lies within our realm.

We have resolved to press ahead with the project however and bring electrification to most of Sudan."
EGY_synthetic_resources:0 "More Desert Oil"
EGY_synthetic_resources_desc:0 "The success of our earlier oil ventures has given rise to a greater demand for exploitation than we have the resources to meet. By legalising and engaging in the sale of oil futures we can gain the capital to expand production extremely quickly."
EGY_modernize_sudan:0 "Modernise Sudan"
EGY_modernize_sudan_desc:0 "Thus far most of our efforts in modernisation have focussed on Egypt proper, and Sudan has benefited only maringally. By investing in the major urban centres at Khartoum, Omdurman and Jubba we can extend our reforms southward."

EGY_invest_in_sudan_desc:0 "There are any number of rich people, Egyptian or otherwise, who wish to invest in our nation. Perhaps tax incentives could encourage them to take their money southwards, where it will breathe new life into the local economy."
EGY_airports_for_sudan:0 "Airports for Sudan"
EGY_airports_for_sudan_desc:0 "While the railway is a wonderful way to travel it just isn't fast enough for the breakneck pace at which business can move. By investing in air transport links with Khartoum we can ensure that businessmen resident in Cairo and Alexandria can look to their interests in the south at a moment's notice, as well provide air bases for the Royal Egyptian Air Force."
EGY_resources_of_the_south:0 "Resources of the South"
EGY_resources_of_the_south_desc:0 "We have it on good authority from a geological expedition by the University of Cairo that there are immense mineral deposits in Sudan just waiting to be tapped.

EGY_new_universities:0 "New Universities"
EGY_new_universities_desc:0 "It is not enough simply to rely on foreign experts to run our businesses.

EGY_black_monday_recovery_desc:0 "While Black Monday has hit our relatively small manufacturing sector hard the biggest harm has been the fall in exports, particularly that of cotton.

EGY_secure_cotton_fields:0 "Secure Cotton Fields"

EGY_reopen_stock_exchange_desc:0 "Allowing the Alexandria and Cairo Stock Exchange to remain closed any longer would be a mistake.

While Egypt has adopted the German model of the royal diet being able to veto but not introduce legislation the question of liberalisation is being raised by those hoping to hope for a more British-style system.

### Events ###

egy.1.t:0 "The Sultanate of Egypt"
egy.1.d:0 "The history of modern Egypt conventionally began in 1882 when Egypt joined the British sphere of influence in the region, a situation that conflicted with Egypt's de jure position as part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1914 the Protectorate was made official and the title of the head of state, which had changed from Pasha to Khedive in 1867, was again changed to Sultan. This formally repudiated the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, who was backing the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg. Abbas II was deposed by the British and replaced as Sultan by his uncle, Husayn Kamil. Upon his death in 1917, his only son, Prince Kamal al-Din Husayn, declined the succession, and Husayn Kamil's brother Ahmed Fuad ascended the throne as Fuad I.\n\nWith the ratification of the Peace with Honour, Egypt remained part of a now weakened British sphere. This would increase anger within the Egyptian populace that exploded in violence in 1925 during the collapse of the British Empire. This would become known as the Egyptian Revolution where Fuad I proved his legitimacy by leading the people in the revolution. The Revolution was largely nationalistic in nature uniting Egyptians of all social classes, faiths, and occupations together to rid Egypt of the foreign British once and for all. In the chaos of the revolution, an international coalition (primarily led by Britain and Germany) seized the Suez canal, which Egypt was forced to accept in order to avoid an open conflict with the former central powers.\n\nSince the revolution there has been a conflict between liberals that seek to go further and make the monarchy a true constitutional monarchy and the conservatives that wish to keep the status quo. Moreover as 1936 arrives, the sultanate's eyes go increasingly upon the Young Farouk, the heir to the throne whom is being groomed for the throne. With the decline of the Ottoman empire, members of all political parties began to wonder and plan of restoring the might of Egypt and dreaming of an Ottoman Free Middle-East..."

egy.10.t:0 "Land Reform"
egy.10.d:0 "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt, the topic of land reform has been brought up. The issue at hand is that less than six percent of Egypt's population owns more than 65% of the land of the country with less than 0.5% of Egyptians owning more than one third of all Fertile land. The liberals wish to combat this by redistributing the land to the people, principally through buying the land from the nobility. However, the conservatives despise such a notion and believe that such an action will only hurt Egypt's agricultural production. A third possibility has been brought up, and that would be to nationalise the land and have it all be the Sultan's land - at least on paper, anyways. The Sultan is already the largest landowner in Egypt, so this would not be impossible to implement."

The current legal system is an absolute mess with overlapping and conflicting areas of British, Ottoman, French and Egyptian Law all mixed together. Such a thing is not suitable for the new modern Egypt. To that end the laws must be reformed. However where one should look within the current laws for the main basis is a big question. The liberals believe that the British law within our legal system might be the best way to adopt, while conservatives believe that the French law is better. Finally some believe looking at the ideas of Muhammad Ali that he brought into the Egyptian system would yield the best system."

egy.14.t:0 "Education Reforms"
egy.14.d:0 "As part of the reforms that Farouk is bringing about to Egypt the topic of education has been brought up. The issue is what should be taught within schools. The conflict is between the Pharaonists who believe that Egypt's identity is Mediterranean and looks to the pre-Islamic era, and the Islamist whom believe that Egypt's identity is rooted in Islam and looks to the age of the Fatimids, Ayyubids and even Mamluks for identity."

egy.100.t:0 "Questions of Egyptian Identity"
egy.100.d:0 "When the Egyptian revolution of 1925 happened, questions started to emerge asking what does it mean to be Egyptian? When was Egypt great? For it was the first time in centuries that we are free and independent and now we are able to properly ask these questions. Thus two concepts of what it means to be Egyptian have formed looking back on the past with romanticism though at radically different periods of Egyptian history.\n\nThe first camp is known as the Pharaonism. They look to the pre-Islamic past to the days of the Pharaohs for a time when Egypt was truly great and powerful. They argue that Egypt is a Mediterranean civilisation and stress the role of the Mediterranean sea within Egyptian Culture, though they do not neglect the Nile. Largely it aligns with the Liberal parties though strictly speaking it is not liberal, and even some of the Watani support it. It is by far the most influential form of identity of Egypt in 1936.\n\nThe Second cultural movement is the Islamist movement that arose as a counter to the more mainstream Pharaonism. They answer the question as to when was Egypt great by looking to the Fatimid Caliphate and the Ayyubid dynasty. Instead of the Pharaohs, whom they decry as pagan and absolute tyrants, they look back to the time when Egypt was the centre of the Islamic world. When a multi-ethnic and tolerant Egypt was the dominate Islamic power. This cultural movement is more of a conservative counter to the more mainstream Pharaonism and is largely tied to the Conservative movements, particularly the Society of the Muslim Brothers .\n\nIt should be noted that both camps support a multi-ethnic Egypt, both Pharaonists and Islamist believe that Egypt has always been a multi-ethnic state. Both concepts are largely romantic nationalist in nature and have an impact upon culture and the arts."
egy.100.a:0 "We are all Egyptians."

egy.101.t:0 "Library Debate"
egy.101.d:0 "As part of the modernisation program, one of the things that have been brought up is that we should build a grand new library to celebrate the new Egypt.

However, from his position in the party, Hussein has pushed his Pharaonist ideas, seeking to unite this non-Islamic and non-Arab Egypt under a revived identity of Kemet - or Ancient Egypt. Far from insane as one of the most prolific and respected writers, cultural figures, and intellectuals in the nation, Taha Hussein seeks to use the ancient glories buried beneath the sands as a rallying force for our non-Islamic national identity. If raised to the head of the party, Hussein would be free to guide the nation fully down the path of Pharaonism, allowing the party to achieve its goals at the cost of burning every bridge we have left standing with the Islamic community and the conservatives and traditionalists in government. What shall we do?"
egy.1042.a:0 "He shall continue to aid the party from his current position."

egy.1043.d:0 "As Shaykh Hasanayn Muhammad Makhluf, Grand Mufti of Egypt and newly appointed Grand Imam of al-Azhar or acting head of the Sunni Islamic faith in the Levant, draws closer to our state and our increasingly Islamic government, the idea of elevating the Grand Sheikh to a true political position of power within the government has begin to grow as ideas of Secularism continue to go the way of the dodo. If His Holiness the Grand Imam were to be elevated to such a position, there would be no stopping the process of ‘Islamization’ that has swept the nation, furthering the process of Egypt fully embracing a Muslim identity over its pre-Islamic past and inexorably connecting Egypt to the Arab world for good. However, despite their sworn faith and piety, some within our party resist this movement as they wish to maintain some semblance of secular governance and syncretic national identity in an otherwise Muslim-dominated society. What shall we decide?"
egy.1043.a:0 "Egypt shall be Muslim but we will maintain our identity."
egy.1043.b:0 "Elevate the Grand Mufti and proceed with the Islamization of Masr."

Today though a new Grand Imam must be chosen and the two leading contenders are naturally divided between the Pharaonist and Islamist camp. The Pharaonist candidate is Muhammad al-Zawahiri whom has earned praise for his efforts to support the University as well as his reformist ideals. The Islamist candidate is Mustafa Hassan Abdul Razek who has earned praise for sparking a renaissance of Islamic philosophy within the University as well wanting to expand Islamic education throughout the realm.

Today is that glorious day. The Aswan Lower Dam is finally complete, allowing Egypt unparalleled control over the Nile. The only question that remains is who to honour. Should we honour Ibn al-Haytham, who first envisioned the dam in the days of the caliphate? Should we name it after our honored guest Adrian Daninos instead? It was he that made this possible."

egy.1104.d.nokemet:0 "With the lands of Albania united with their distant Egyptian brethren under one sovereign crown, there stands a monumental decision before King Farouk. While it would be simple to just keep the royal titulary as is and extended the administrative name of Egypt into Albania many of our new subjects and even some visionary courtiers propose that we should use this opportunity for a change. Two major proposals have been laid out by the Royal Commission on the Unification of the Crowns of Egypt and Albania. While the official name of the nation shall combine the previous ones into one united whole, the King has two choices when it comes to his possible regnal name. He can either choose to be Skanderbeg II, as recognition of the importance of the medieval Lord of Albania's deeds for Farouk's new subjects in his ancestral homeland. Another option, favoured by the royal family itself, is to take upon the mantle of the founder of our dynasty, Farouk's great-grandfather Muhammad Ali. Such a matter might seem trivial to some of our subjects, yet it is of vital importance to our perception in the outside world. Of course our benevolent sovereign might simply keep his current name, for it has a great meaning of 'the one who distinguishes between right and wrong'."

The nation would come to be known as the Dual Crown of Kemet-Tinayu. Although Tinayu was the way the ancients of this grand land called what is today mainland Greece the definition could be extended to the lands of Albanians. If the King chooses this option, his new regnal name would come to be Mekemet, a loose interpretation of one of Ramesses the Great's names 'Mek kemet, waf khasut' (Protector of Egypt who curbs foreign lands)."

From the top of the Nile in Sudan to the Nile’s mouth at Alexandria, across the straits of Sinai and up the sands of Syria and Palestine, our former domain is united at last. With these lands under our control, the Pharaonists suggest that we fully embrace our past imperial legacy, recreating the empire in name that fell all those millenia ago.

egy.192.t:0 "HIMT Coup in Tripoli"
egy.192.d:0 "Riding on the tide of Pan-Arab fervor, the HIMT launched a coup early this morning. Politicians, notables and suspected enemies of the movement were lifted from their beds and shots could be heard on the outskirts of Tripoli where the leaders of the old regime were brought to their early death.\n\nAs the army parades through the streets of Tripoli to the sound of cheering masses, the matrons of Tripoli could be seen on their balconies overlooking the streets. Shaking their heads in dissapproval, their thoughts go out to their sons and husbands who bled for the independence of Tripolitania and they wonder if their homeland will ever know peace."
egy.192.a:0 "So ends the Tripolitanian state..."

egy.193.t:0 "Coup in Tripolitania"
egy.193.d:0 "Riding on the tide of Pan-Arab fervor, the HIMT launched a coup early this morning. Politicians, notables and suspected enemies of the movement were lifted from their beds and shots could be heard on the outskirts of Tripoli where the leaders of the old regime were brought to their early death.\n\nAs the army parades through the streets of Tripoli to the sound of cheering masses, the matrons of Tripoli could be seen on their balconies overlooking the streets. Shaking their heads in dissapproval, their thoughts go out to their sons and husbands who bled for the independence of Tripolitania and they wonder if their homeland will ever know peace."
egy.193.a:0 "Marvelous!"

egy.194.t:0 "Egypt Proposes Unification"
egy.194.d:0 "Desiring the further pursuit of close relation between Tripolitania and Egypt, the government in Cairo has officially proposed the unification of the two states as to further the dream of a united Arab state. Our government, recently having taken over from their civilian predecessor, has been working tirelessly to achieve this union and is thrilled that the moment has finally arrived. Amongst the people there is less enthusiasm however as the man on the streets wonders if Tripoli should hand its newfound independence away this quickly."
egy.194.a:0 "We accept!"
egy.194.b:0 "Never!"

egy.196.t:0 "Tripolitania Refuses Unification"
egy.196.d:0 "Tripolitania says nyet"
egy.196.a:0 "Traitors!"

egy.197.t:0 "Tripolitania Counters Our Influence"
egy.197.d:0 "It seems that the government in Tripoli has caught wind of our latest attempt to pursue the pan-Arab dream in their state and pulled out all the stops in an attempt to 'protect' their citizens from 'foreign subterfugre'. A setback to be sure but the bureau in Cairo is confident that it is only temporary and is working hard to ensure that the next operation is all the more succesful."
egy.197.a:0 "A small setback."

egy.198.t:0 "Egypt Demands the Suez!"
egy.198.d:0 "Following their victory over the Ottoman Empire, the envigored Egyptian government has formally demanded that we hand over the vital Suez Canal! Claiming the land and canal as their rightful land, the Egyptians have threated us with war should we refuse to hand over the canal! While the canal is obviously vital to our maritime operations, with the looming threat of the Communards, perhaps the time is finally come to return to the Canal to Egypt?"
egy.198.a:0 "We cannot risk war with the Communards at our doorstep, hand over the canal."
egy.198.b:0 "Are they insane? We will never hand over rightful German conquests!"

egy.199.t:0 "Germany Refuses!"
egy.199.d:0 "As was expected, the Kaiserreich has refused to peacefully hand over the canal. With this being the case, war is between us is imminent. However, there is no reason that we need to follow up on our threats. While yes, backing down would be seen as an act of cowardice, few believe we would actually stand a chance against the full might of the Reich. Either way, a decision on which the very fate of the nation hangs must now be made..." 
egy.199.a:0 "To War, we shall reclaim our land by force!"
egy.199.b:0 "Back Down, the Reich would surely crush us..."   

egy.200.t:0 "Peace With Egypt?"
egy.200.d:0 "The war over Suez has been raging for more than six months, but we have not been able to defeat the Egyptians. Perhaps we should sign peace with them."
egy.200.a:0 "Yes, we'll retake the Suez later."
egy.200.b:0 "Egypt will become another colony!"

egy.201.t:0 "A Republican Egypt?"
egy.201.d:0 "At last, the Ottoman Empire's tyranny over the Arab peoples has come to an end, thanks to the courage of our proud Egyptian soldiers and our comrades from all over the Arab world who are striving for self-determination. Among Egyptian citizens, our popularity seems to know no bounds, and even those conservatives in the rural world who doubted our government's ability to properly govern Egypt seems to be reconsidering their position. However, one man still refuses to support us: our sovereign Farouk. He, with his barely concealed autocratic tendencies, can't stand that our liberal government applies policies contrary to his vision, even giving funds to radical groups like Young Egypt and the Muslim Brotherhood with the sole aim of preventing us from fulfilling our mandate, which comes from the people themselves. Yet his autocratic tendencies do not prevent Farouk from being widely regarded as incompetent and favoring his own corrupt sins over the welfare of the Egyptian people.\n\nNow that a large part of the people is behind us, thanks to the prestige of our victory, it might be time to get rid of the corrupt buffoon that is our 'beloved sovereign'. Indeed, the government has the power to organize a referendum for the proclamation of a Republic, which Farouk could not refuse on pain of losing all his remaining credibility. However, some believe that the monarchical institution is essential to the stability of our nation, with their camp split between those who refuse republicanism in all instances, and those who seek a compromise by ousting Farouk and replacing him with Prince Abbas Halim - a noted labor leader and progressive of the Muhammad Ali dynasty once groomed for the throne before being ostracized from the family for his support of fair democracy - who would serve as the new king of a reformed liberal constitutional monarchy. The government must make a decision as quickly as possible before the memory of our recent victories fades among the people..."
egy.201.a:0 "Organize a referendum at once! Long live the Republic!"
egy.201.b:0 "The government elects to not move against the Monarchy."
egy.201.c:0 "A compromise is reached! Farouk is out and Prince Abbas Halim is in."

egy.202.t:0 "A Kingdom or a Sultanate?"
egy.202.d:0 "A question which may seem minor but which was quickly raised in the reform committee created recently by our Sultan Farouk is that of the name of our country and the title of our sovereign. Indeed, we are currently a Sultanate, a traditional title in the Arab world, meaning that our sovereign holds secular power but not religious power, we still officially recognize the authority of the Turkish Caliph at the head of the Ottoman Empire as commander of the assembly of Muslim believers, the Ummah. However, it is no secret that tensions between us and the Ottomans continue to grow and are not likely to be resolved peacefully any time soon.\n\nThus the Sultan himself proposed to give himself the title of King and reject that of Sultan, no longer recognizing the Ottoman Sultan as Caliph as a sign of contestation. Such a change would also make us appear more modern in the eyes of European nations with whom Farouk has many links. However, certain conservative councilors argued that the title of Sultan was more recognizable to the Arab masses we want to lead against Ottoman authority, and that changing the title would not be popular with them. The debates seem to drag on and it is therefore up to our Sultan, or future King, to settle the question once and for all."
egy.202.a:0 "Declare Farouk the first King of Egypt and Sudan!"
egy.202.b:0 "Our traditional title fits us better, the Sultanate shall stay."

egy.203.t:0 "Suspicious Activities of the Muslim Brotherhood"
egy.203.d:0 "It would be a lie to say that we did not expect to see challenges to our new secularist policies from the most zealous of our citizens, but it was a necessary step in the creation of a Modern Egypt whose national identity and politics would not depend on religious dogmas. Although we are not anti-religious like more radical socialists and we let everyone practice their religion in peace without discrimination from the state, some, notably the Society of the Muslim Brothers, have violently criticized our legislation as Anti-Islam, contrary to the deep cultural roots of our country and as an act of prostitution for the European imperialist powers and their nauseating western ideals.\n\nSimple criticism is normal and healthy in a democratic system, but it seems that this time it goes much further, Sayyid Qutb, leading the radical and violently anti-democratic wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, is rising in popularity very quickly. Some reports indicate arms trafficking and the formation of Islamist militias wanting to establish Sharia law in Egypt. Our government must decide on a response strategy as quickly as possible: appeasement through dialogue or strengthening security and investigating these rumors."
egy.203.a:0 "We can trust the Brotherhood, they respect the democratic system."
egy.203.b:0 "Assign officials to suppress any signs of armed insurrection."

egy.204.t:0 "The Battle of Cairo"
egy.204.d:0 "It seems that we have underestimated the seriousness of the rumors concerning the radicalization of the Society of the Muslim Brothers. This morning, around 5 a.m., gunshots and explosions in the suburbs were heard by the majority of residents of Cairo. It is the Islamist militias, until then hidden in rural areas and the desert, who have organized a tactical assault towards our capital, they intend to carry out the arrest and trial of our government and of Farouk himself seen as an accomplice of our secularist policies.\n\nThe Prime Minister ordered the immediate mobilization of the army to counter the rebels. The Egyptian National Army being much more professional and trained, there is no doubt that it would succeed in crushing any popular insurrection, although suffering numerous losses. But it seems that many of our officers and soldiers share the beliefs of the Muslim Brotherhood and are defecting to join the self-proclaimed 'Restorer of the Caliphate' Sayyid Qutb. The streets of Cairo are now a spectacle of unprecedented urban violence and the outcome of the fight is uncertain..."
egy.204.a:0 "The loyalists manage to beat the Brotherhood, forcing their radical wing to flee the country!"
egy.204.b:0 "Down with foreign liberalism! The Brotherhood shall restore religious order! Allahu Akbar!"

egy.205.t:0 "The Saadist Plea"
egy.205.d:0 "It is no secret that His Majesty shares no love for the domineering Wafd party and their liberal, secular, and nationalist machinations, thus leaving Farouk with mostly conservative and reactionary allies to choose from. In the past, he has used this to his advantage, begrudgingly cozying up to groups like the National Party and even the Muslim Brotherhood in secret at times in order to weaken Wafd’s hold on Egyptian politics while using subterfuge, espionage, sabotage, and even paramilitary action to weaken the Delegation Party’s monopoly over the minds of the Egyptian masses, but this has also unintentionally empowered the Brotherhood to a dangerous degree. However, Farouk’s foreign allies frequently hold more liberal views themselves, leading to some within the royal court to suggest His Majesty follow suit by aligning with the Saadists. \n\nFormally called the Saadist Institutional Party - or Hizb Al Hayyat Al Saedi, the Saadists are a splinter group of the Wafd party committed to fusing Royalist and Liberal ideas while swearing total loyalty to Farouk and the Crown, being led by Ahmed Maher Pasha, Makram Ebeid Pasha, Mahmoud Elknokrashy Pasha, and Ibhraim Abdel Hady Pasha. Despising their former allies in Wafd, for the Saadists see their increasingly anti-Farouk rhetoric as borderline treasonous and overall dangerous to the long-term stability of Egypt, these Saadists riding in on their platform of purple and yellow are likely the only liberal force in Egypt so willing to fully attach themselves to the throne, allowing us to use them to resist both Wafd and the Brotherhood while letting Farouk still live and rule his way. What should our stance be towards these royalist liberals knowing full well that aligning ourselves with them would mean throwing our long-held conservative allies to the curbside, for better or for worse?"
egy.205.a:0 "Yield to Liberal Royalism in order to wound Wafd." 
egy.205.b:0 "Stay true to the Islamist Conservatism of our current allies."
egy.205.c:0 "His Majesty is above such temporal matters. Toe a middle line."

egy.206.t:0 "Issues Within the Royal Military Academy Class of 1937"
egy.206.d:0 "Thanks to the under-secretary of war Ibrahim Khairy Pasha acting as a wasta - or an influential intermediary used to promote applications and promotions within Egyptian society - the charismatic young face of this year’s class of new graduates from the Royal Military Academy has begun to take the nation by storm. Called Gamal Abdal Nasser, the young firebrand has risen under the guidance and stewardship of the respected general and secret anti-royalist dissident Mohamad Naguib over Nasser’s past year or so in the academy, and together this duo have already begun to attract unwanted attention. Behind closed doors, the duo lead a faction of military officers, disgruntled soldiers, and would-be revolutionaries who call themselves the ‘Free Officers Clique’ that is staffed by fellow classmates at the academy to Nasser such as Abdel Hakim Amer, Ali Sabri, and Anwar Sadat, who all share the pair’s increasingly radical rhetoric as they all convene regularly to secretly discuss their dissatisfaction at the widespread corruption spread by the monarchy that has only crippled Egypt and her people and their pipedream of toppling Farouk’s supposed failstate. Although Naguib himself is quite moderate in his ideological convictions by comparison while being a leading member of the Democratic Socialist Party and still holding some loyalty for the Crown despite desiring royalist reform and the demise of Farouk’s corrupt reign, largely functioning as the moderating force and source of wisdom and aged expertise within the Clique and the Party as he promotes his own idea of progressive Egyptian nationalism and social reform aimed at the agrarian peasantry, the young Nasser has taken these ideas farther by promoting a Pharaonic form of Egyptian republican nationalism dyed a revolutionary red that pulls on Egypt's African and Arabic pasts while calling for extreme agrarian reform, mass modernization and social justice programs, secularism, and the complete removal of all imperialist and foreign sources of influence and power in the nation. As this new class of officers rises to take their place within the hierarchy and command structure of our armed forces, we must remain vigilant as to not let these dangerous firebrands spread their misguided fears to a broad audience or to the rest of our largely-conservative military. Let us keep an eye on them just to be sure they aren’t up to anything no good."
egy.206.a:0 "We shall watch his career with cautious interest..."

egy.207.t:0 "Internal Debates after Our Recent Victory"
egy.207.d:0 "We have finally succeeded in defeating the forces of reaction and the dogs of foreigners at the ballot box to gain a comfortable majority in parliament! We must celebrate our victory, but also ask ourselves who should become our next prime minister.\n\nThe obvious choice would be Mohammed Naguib Youssef, a member of our party's 'old guard', an experienced officer with many connections in the army and a political veteran, Naguib intends to implement a classic but secular policy of social nationalism. However, another choice would be Naguib's protégé, Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein. Considered to have ideals close to those of his mentor, he is nonetheless younger and more radical, and has numerous contacts with other nationalist organizations such as Young Egypt. He is also surrounded by a clique of young and loyal officers, mainly Anwar Sadat, Ali Sabri, and Abdel Hakim Amer, and is also a supporter of Pharaonist theses in the constitution of a secular national identity.\n\nA vote is due to take place within our party, Naguib is the favorite, but Nasser could well take control with a bit of luck..."
egy.207.a:0 "Naguib is more experienced and pragramatic, he is our man!"
egy.207.b:0 "We need fresh blood, Nasser shall be Prime Minister!"

egy.208.t:0 "Reclaiming the Equatoria?"
egy.208.d:0 "The former province known as the Equatoria is a strip of land that intersects the borders of the Congo and Uganda, formally acquired under the oversight of Samuel Baker, a British explorer and former Governor-General of the Equatorial Nile Basin. This strip of land enjoyed a period of self-sufficiency and prosperity. Unfortunately, this period was cut short due to conflicts such as the Mahdist War, leading to the province's collapse as Egyptian forces withdrew from the forts established in the area.\n\nThis area however is not all lost to us forever, as our triumphant victory in the Desert War and our dominance over Abyssinia has proven the true might of our nation, perhaps we can snatch back this lost land that had belonged to us many years ago, as we finally meet Lake Victoria. Already confident with our capability to overcome our geopolitical enemies, we can rightfully take back the Equatoria and reap the riches that awaits us at the source of the Nile, rekindling the wealth and luxury it had offered us."
egy.208.a:0 "Onwards! For we shall gain full control of the Nile!"
egy.208.b:0 "Forget these claims, we do not plan to make new enemies."

egy.209.t:0 "A United Arabia under Cairo?"
egy.209.d:0 "For months now, the countries of the Arab League have been deepening their cooperation, whether economic, military or in the field of education. Since our victory over the Ottomans, this apparent fraternal unity between the Arab peoples has only increased support for Pan-Arabism among our population, and it would seem that Egypt has embarked on the final stage: the creation of an Arab Federation uniting all Arab peoples within the same nation with common institutions and government. A diplomat straight from Cairo arrived in the capital this morning and asked for our nation's integration into this new federation. Many are in favor of our acceptance, but others see this new country as nothing more than a tool for Egyptian imperialism."
egy.209.a:0 "We accept, the Arab people shall be one!"
egy.209.b:0 "We must resist against this obvious form of Egyptian imperialism!"

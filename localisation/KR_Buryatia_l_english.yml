### Events ###
burnatskom.1.t: "Burnatskom Consolidates Its Power"
burnatskom.1.d: "The Central National Committee of the Buryat-Mongols of Eastern Siberia, or shortly Burnatskom, has now consolidated its power in the Transbaikal region. With the power finally in their hands, it is time to solve some important issues and convene the national parliament to hold the first free elections in Buryat-Mongolian history."
burnatskom.1.a: "Let's start!"

burnatskom.2.t: "The Matter of Religion"
burnatskom.2.d: "Buryat-Mongolia is a country of Buddhists and Buddhism has been practiced here for centuries. However, Burnatskom needs to make an important decision on the state status of religion, since representatives of other faiths live on our territory. Our subsequent policy towards the non-Buddhist minority, as well as State policy in the field of education and, possibly, even international relations, will depend on this decision.\n\nThe 4 parties that are members of the Burnatskom have different ideas about the future of Buddhism in Buryat-Mongolia. Buddhist socialists believe that Buddhism should not be the state religion, but nevertheless, socialist and Buddhist principles can be counted together, given the religious history of the people. The Buryat-Mongolian social revolutionaries advocate the secularization of Buddhist society and a gradual departure from Buddhist dogmas as the basic rules and norms of society. The National Democrats are in favor of giving Buddhism the status of a state religion, since it is inextricably linked with the Buryat-Mongolian people. Radical Buddhists believe that Buddhism should not just be a state religion, but new laws and regulations should be based only on religious dogmas, and monasteries should have political power."
burnatskom.2.a: "Endorse Buddhist Socialism idea."
burnatskom.2.b: "Secularize Buryat-Mongolia."
burnatskom.2.c: "Buddhism is our state religion."
burnatskom.2.e: "Buddhism should have an overwhelming influence."

burnatskom.4.t: "Russian Minority"
burnatskom.4.d: "The lands of Buryat-Mongolia are the homeland of not only the local population, but also a fairly large number, but nevertheless, a minority of the Russian population.\n\nBuddhist socialists advocate the preservation of the status quo, that is, the absence of any privileges of the Russian population. Socialists-revolutionaries believe that a small autonomy should be created for the Russian population, and the Russians themselves should have the same rights and obligations as the Buryat Mongols. The National Democrats are in favor of depriving Russians of any privileges, since they now live in a national republic. Radical Buddhists are quite keen on this issue, believing that any resident of Buryat-Mongolia is obliged to profess Buddhism, and in case of refusal, should be extradited from the territory of the state."
burnatskom.4.a: "Status-quo."
burnatskom.4.b: "Small autonomy for Russians."
burnatskom.4.c: "Deprive Russians from any privileges."
burnatskom.4.e: "They should profess Buddhism or be extradited."

burnatskom.5.t: "Status of Land"
burnatskom.5.d: "An important issue discussed in Burnatsky was also the issue of land. Buddhist socialists and social revolutionaries are convinced that the land should be socialized and belong to society for the self-organization of the Buryat-Mongolian peasants. The National Democrats believe that private property should be preserved on the land for the sake of the development of capitalism in the country. Radical Buddhists advocate the transfer of land to monastic parishes, which will have the power to distribute this land among the population or even have it in their property."
burnatskom.5.a: "Socialization of land"
burnatskom.5.b: "Private land ownership"
burnatskom.5.c: "The land should belong to local Monasteries"

burnatskom.6.t: "Reviving Burnarduma"
burnatskom.6.d: "During the short existence of Buryat-Mongolia during the civil war, the Buryat-Mongolian People's Duma, the parliament, was established by the Burnatskom of those times. After the liberation of Transbaikalia from the Bolsheviks, the Burnatskom also formally recognized the regime of Semyenov and in November 1918 the committee was transformed into the Buryat-Mongolian People's Duma. Thus, in 1918-19, Burnatsky's policy was to prevent attempts to interfere in the process of establishing national autonomy by both the Soviet government and the White Regime. On January 23, 1919, the Burnarduma issued a decree on the mobilization of Buryat-Mongols into the army, in the ranks of the Mongol-Buryat brigade 'Zrikto-Bator' as part of the troops of Ataman Semyenov, about 2000 people were subject to mobilization. However, in the autumn of 1919, the Burnarduma was actually defeated due to disagreement with the policy of Ataman Semyenov. Since then, the Burnarduma has ceased to exist, and now it is time to restore it as a full-fledged parliament of our state."
burnatskom.6.a: "The birth of Buryat-Mongolian democracy"

burnatskom.7.t: "Buryat-Mongolian [GetYear] Elections"
burnatskom.7.d: "The first free elections in the history of the Buryat-Mongolian people are coming to an end. The dawn and subsequent flourishing of the Buryat-Mongolian democracy is coming. The counting of votes at the polling stations ends, and the winner is..."
burnatskom.7.a: "SBSO, Buddhist Socialists"
burnatskom.7.b: "PSR, Buryat-Mongolian SRs"
burnatskom.7.c: "BNP, National-Democrats"
burnatskom.7.e: "Khudanay Erhete Balgaahan, Radical Buddhists"

burnatskom.8.t: "The Militant Godless Intervene"
burnatskom.8.d: "Having been in the shadows for a long time, and doing mischief to the freedom-loving Buryat-Mongolian people, The Militant Godless led by Yemelyan Yaroslavsky came to light. Armed detachments, mainly consisting of NRA partisans, have captured several settlements near Verkhneudinsk today. Strongly opposed to the decision of the Burnatskom on the issue of religion, the SVB demands the immediate dispersal of the Committee, the establishment of the Transbaikal Soviet and transfer of the power to the workers and peasants. We need to fight back against the Godless before it's too late."
burnatskom.8.a: "Defend Verkhneudinsk!"
burnatskom.8.b: "Attack them first."
burnatskom.8.c: "Burnatskom has no power to intervene."

burnatskom.9.t: "Fall of Verkhneudinsk!"
burnatskom.9.d: "Despite our efforts to defend the city, the mobilized forces of NRA partisans and The Militant Godless have managed to seize key infrastructure and buildings in the city. They have arrested Burnatskom in its entirety and now it seems that the Buryat-Mongolian state will cease to exist."
burnatskom.9.a: "Red Banner over Transbaikalia."

burnatskom.10.t: "The Militant Godless Crushed!"
burnatskom.10.d: "We have striked first and won in decisive battles against the Militant Godless. Yemelyan Yaroslavsky was found and arrested, the trial about his fate will start soon. At least, we have dealt with one major issue and Soyombo will fly over Transbaikalia."
burnatskom.10.a: "This pathetic movement has been destroyed."

burnatskom.11.t: "Fall of Verkhneudinsk!"
burnatskom.11.d: "Due to our indifference, the mobilized forces of NRA partisans and the Militant Godless have managed to seize key infrastructure and buildings in the city. They have arrested Burnatskom in its entirety and now it seems that the Buryat-Mongolian state will cease to exist."
burnatskom.11.a: "Red Banner over Transbaikallia."

## Democratic Events ##
bry.1.t: "Choosing a Flag For Our Nation"
bry.1.d: "Now that the elections have been held, we will have to establish a new flag instead of the flag of Bogdo-Khan Mongolia, which has been used by the Burnatskom since the civil war to show the unity of our and the Mongolian peoples. We have three options: the first is a blue-white-yellow tricolor with a Buryat-Mongolian soyombo; the second is the same tricolor, but vertical; the third is a dark blue canvas with an enlarged soyombo in the center."
bry.1.a: "Horizontal tricolor"
bry.1.b: "Vertical tricolor"
bry.1.c: "Blue banner with soyombo"

bry.10.t: "A New Ally in [FROM.GetName]?"
bry.10.d: "The friendly regime of [FROM.GetName] has approached us with signing a treaty of peace and mutual friendship. The Buryat-Mongolian and Mongolian peoples are not only close in name, but also we share same history and customs. However, if we don't like their government, we can always refuse their offer."
bry.10.a: "A toast for our brothers!"
bry.10.b: "We don't trust their government."

bry.11.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
bry.11.d: "The government of [FROM.GetName] has refused a treaty of friendship between our countries. We consider this to be an act of aggression towards brotherly nation, and we won't have any more connections with the closest people to us."
bry.11.a: "Embarassing."

bry.12.t: "Ties with Transbaikal Cossacks"
bry.12.d: "The Transbaikal Cossacks are actually our neighbors in the region. For a long time, the Buryat Mongols and the Cossacks lived together, but this cohabitation on the same territory was not always beneficial and friendly. Our new government believes that if there was a feud, then it needs to end."
bry.12.a: "That will be good for all of us."

bry.13.t: "Evaluating Our Policy Towards Russia"
bry.13.d: "Since the end of the civil war, relations between our people and the Russians have been strange. Hoping to get at least some autonomy, for 5 years after the end of the civil war, Burnatskom remained a temporary authority under the leadership of Bogdanov, and the elections in the region were constantly delayed. In 1925, when these lands were again seized by Ataman Semyenov and were annexed to Transamur, hopes for autonomy dried up for good. Now that we are independent again, it is time to decide what to do with our Russian neighbors."
bry.13.a: "We should work towards becoming Russian autonomy"
bry.13.b: "We should detente from Russia"
bry.13.c: "Russia should guarantee our independence"

bry.14.t: "[FROM.GetName] Wants to Become Our Autonomy"
bry.14.d: "The government of self-proclaimed [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has approached us with a request to join our country, but saving a great amount of autonomy, local parliament and local elections."
bry.14.a: "They're welcomed!"
bry.14.b: "They are integral part of our country."

bry.15.t: "Buryat-Mongol Autonomy"
bry.15.d: "With positive reaction from Russian authorities we now can start the formal preparation for joining Russia as an autonomous republic."
bry.15.a: "Better autonomous then dead."

bry.16.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused Our Autonomy"
bry.16.d: "As many years ago, the Russian Government has once again refused to give us as much autonomy as we need. Well, it seems that we should get ready for war."
bry.16.a: "We will fight for our freedom."

bry.17.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Guarantees"
bry.17.d: "The government of self-proclaimed [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has approached us with a request to guarantee their independence as a sovereign nation. They're awaiting for our answer."
bry.17.a: "Fine. We respect their independence."
bry.17.b: "They are integral part of our country."

bry.18.t: "Russian Guarantees"
bry.18.d: "With positive reaction from Russian authorities we now can be sure that they will not encroach on our territories and our independence."
bry.18.a: "Great!"

bry.19.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused Guarantees"
bry.19.d: "As many years ago, the Russian Government has once again refused to respect our nation, our territory and our sovereignity. Well, it seems that we should get ready for war."
bry.19.a: "We will fight for our freedom."

bry.20.t: "Khudanay Erhete Balgaahan"
bry.20.d: "The history of our state begins when Lubsan-Sandan Tsydenov proclaimed the First Khudanay Erhete Balgaahan in 1919 and called himself Tsog-Tuguldur Dharma Raja-Khan. Crushed soon after by the Transbaikal Cossacks, the movement of Balagats, however, never ceased to exist. Before his death, Lubsan-Sandan has given the young boy Dandaron, who was recognized as the rebirth of the hambo-lama Jayagsa-gegen, the abbot of the Kumbum complex in Tibet, the title of the King of the Teaching - Dharmaraja.\n\nSince then, the boy, and now the young adult, has been the indisputable leader of the Balagats, trying to promote his own views of radical Buddhism among the Buryat-Mongols.\nNow the time to proclaim the Khudanay Erhete Balgaahan - the theocratic state of Hudan has come."
bry.20.a: "Thank you, teacher!"

bry.21.t: "Ties With [FROM.GetName]?"
bry.21.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has approached us to install friendly ties."
bry.21.a: "That's ridiculous!"
bry.21.b: "Perhaps, we need allies now more."

bry.22.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
bry.22.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to install friendly ties between our nations"
bry.22.a: "Great!"

bry.23.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
bry.23.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to install friendly ties between our nations"
bry.23.a: "They always hated us."

bry.50.t: "The Supreme Ruler Is Gone!"
bry.50.d: "Due to the coup in [TRM.GetName] it became obvious that the Supreme Ruler is gone and now we can try to break free from our overlord and end the military district."
bry.50.a: "Let's do it!"

bry.51.t: "Transbaikal Military District Breaks Free!"
bry.51.d: "The traitorous cossacks have used the instability in Vladivostok to break free from us, declaring their independence."
bry.51.a: "We should return Transbaikalia!"
bry.51.b: "We are too unstable now!"

bry.52.t: "Dealing With Banditry"
bry.52.d: "For several months, our country has been suffering from various criminals, river pirates and local corrupt officials who affect the stability of our state. With the establishment of the national police and active introduction into various criminal groups, we managed to achieve almost complete exposure and destruction of bandits. Of course, it will take more time to reduce the overall crime rate, but progress in this direction has already been made."
bry.52.a: "Splendid!"

bry.53.t: "Urzhin Garmaev Leaves For [BRY.GetName]"
bry.53.d: "With the establishment of a new state in Transbaikalia, our general, Urzhin Garmaev, an ethnic Buryat-Mongolian, has decided to return to his homeland and serve his people."
bry.53.a: "Well, off you go, then"

bry.54.t: "Urzhin Garmaev Returns!"
bry.54.d: "Urzhin Garmaev, a Buryat-Mongolian general, who was once the head of Ataman Semyenov's Buryat-Mongolian Cavalry Army has left to wild Mongolia with the end of Buryat-Mongolian independence to fight for Ungern-Sternberg. Now he's looking forward returning back to his homeland to serve it and his people."
bry.54.a: "Great!"

bry.100.t: "[FROM.GetName] Wishes To Join Us"
bry.100.d: "The government of [FROM.GetName] has approached us with a desire to join our country as its integral part. referring to the common history and centuries-old friendship of our peoples, [FROM.GetAdjective] government insists on joining us!"
bry.100.a: "Let them join then!"

bry.101.t: "Treaty of Friendship From [FROM.GetName]"
bry.101.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a treaty of friendship. While we share similar ideology, their ideas of Buddhist Socialism can seem rather... insane. We should decide what to do with this treaty."
bry.101.a: "We won't sign it."
bry.101.b: "International Cooperation is always good."

bry.102.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused Cooperation!"
bry.102.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to sign the treaty of friendship due to our religious undertone."
bry.102.a: "That's bad."

bry.103.t: "[FROM.GetName] Signs the Treaty!"
bry.103.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has accepted our treaty of friendship ensuring better relations between our countries."
bry.103.a: "Splendid!"

bry.104.t: "[FROM.GetName] Seized Our Land!"
bry.104.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has seized our lands in a sudden attack! We must quickly mobilize and teach them a lesson."
bry.104.a: "They should not have done this..."
bry.104.b: "We'll deal with them later."

BRY_Burnatskom_In_Power_desc: "With the awakening of the Buryat national consciousness, our people have raged against their old Russian masters, and we now found ourselves free from their yoke at last. The Central National Committee of the Buryat-Mongols of East Siberia, or Burnatskom, shall now organize a republican government so that some form of representation for the people can finally be established.

BRY_Fate_Of_Religion: "The Status of Religion"
BRY_Fate_Of_Religion_desc: "As Burnatskom rallies the Buryat people and establishes the foundations for our newly independent nation, the debate on religion and its place within our new society has nearly spiralled out of control. With the Militant Godless and Buddhist extremists at each other’s throats, and with the vast array of moderates caught in the middle, our council has been wracked by the inability to cooperate and agree on matters of the faith and faithless. We must rally the council and put this debate to an end, whatever the outcome might be."

BRY_Fate_Of_Land: "The Issue of Land"
BRY_Fate_Of_Land_desc: "In Transbaikalia, there is a significant difference in land allotments between Cossacks and Buryat-Mongols, on the one hand, and peasant settlers and Old Believers, on the other. According to the rules of 1898, the allotments of peasant settlers and Old Believers were to be equal and amount to 21 tithes of land of different lands per "male soul". The increase in peasant allotments was supposed to occur at the expense of pasture and hay lands of Buryats (primarily) and Cossacks. In fact, land relations before the Weltkrieg had not been settled, and the actual amount of land owned by Cossacks and foreigners differed significantly not only from the rules of 1898, but also from the regulations of 1869 on those notorious 30 tithes of the village. Thus, the Buryats and Cossacks, whose main occupation was also cattle breeding, had significantly more land than the peasants."

BRY_Fate_Of_Russians: "The Fate of the Russian Minority"
BRY_Fate_Of_Russians_desc: "For centuries, the Buryat people and our destiny has been tethered to that of Russia and its peoples. From the age of the old tsars to the rise of Transamur and the splitting of the old empire in the wake of the Weltkrieg, these Slavs have lorded over us as friends, as enemies, as oppressors, and as liberators. This unique and varied history has left our people with many mixed feelings about the sizable Russian minority that exists within new Buryatia. A stance towards these Westerners must be finally decided, for the good of all Buryats."

BRY_Reestablish_Burnarduma: "Restore Burnarduma"
BRY_Reestablish_Burnarduma_desc: "With the largest questions of the day settled and with the foundations of our newly independent state now finally cemented, it is time for the Buryats to reach for their new destiny. The Burnarduma - our local legislative assembly and main representational body - shall once again rise to answer the cries and calls of the Buryat people, and with this legislator lifting our new republic up, the provisional government will soon be able to yield and surrender to some semblance of democracy. Soon, the voices of the Buryats shall finally be heard and given their due power!"

BRY_SRs_In_Power: "PSR in Power"
BRY_SRs_In_Power_desc: "Led by Mikhail Bogdanov, the ‘Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov,’ or Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, is similar to the PSRs of Russia proper, but are fully dedicated to the Buryat common man and peasantry. Pushing for a ‘pink’ Buryatia with strong local government and true representation for our people. Under Bogdanov and the Buryat PSR, our newly independent nation shall finally build a noble and fair republic that both listens to and takes care of the lowest classes of our society without falling prey to the extremist ideas of radical Socialism."

BRY_Buddhist_Socialists_In_Power: "Buddhist Socialists in Power"
BRY_Buddhist_Socialists_In_Power_desc: "The ‘Soyuz Buddiyskikh Sotsialistov Obnovlentsev,’ or Union of Buddhist Socialist Renovationists, is led by Bazar Baradiyn and his devout allies. Combining Buddhist dogma with Socialist ideas pulled from Russia and Mongolia, the SBSO seeks to fuse faith and ideology into a syncretic and coherent set of ideas and policies that shall propel Buryatia into its crimson future without losing touch with our Buddhist heritage. Though traditionalism shall be shed and Westernization shall be pursued under the SBSO, we shall endeavor to never lose sight of what makes us Buryats."

BRY_National_Democrats_In_Power: "National Democrats in Power"
BRY_National_Democrats_In_Power_desc: "The ‘Buryatskaya Natsionalnaya Partiya,’ or Buryat National Party, is headed by Tsogto Badmazhapov. The BNP is a conervative nationalist party espousing anti-radicalism and capitalist economics as Badmazhapov seeks to drive Buryatia into our own form of modernity - one innately tied to our unique national identity as a Mongolic people. Having allies among the cossacks and within Mongolia itself, the BNP seeks to use these ties to propel the Buryat people into a bright new future."

BRY_Radical_Buddhists_In_Power: "Radical Buddhists in Power"
BRY_Radical_Buddhists_In_Power_desc: "Led by Bidia Dandaron, the radical Buddhists and Buryat nationalists of Khudanay Erhete Balgaahan push forward for their dream of the ‘Kodun State’ - a land wholly dominated by fervent Buddhist tradition and undiluted Buryat culture. Espousing ideas of ‘Neobuddhism’ while pushing for a pure theocratic state backed by a strong military and dreaming of great territorial ambition. With Dandaron as our shepherd, Buryatia shall be carried into its destiny while wrapped in the holy embrace of the Buddha."

BRY_Socialization_Of_Land: "Socialization of the Land"
BRY_Socialization_Of_Land_desc: "Following the example of the early Russian Revolutionaries, and in line with Narodnism thought, we shall move to enact the fundamental law of land socialization as outlined in SR Economic Programme. Private property shall be abolished in Buryatia, and the redistribution of the landed estates shall be distributed by the revolutionary government to the Buryat peasantry. The resources and mineral wealth of the nation shall be collectively owned by everyone in the nation, with control of its allocation going to the government. Large, successful, and modernized farmlands that already exist are to be converted into model farms and staffed by our best farmers. The right to use the newly nationalized land is to be guaranteed to all citizens, with many more clauses being listed in the full document. With this decree, the people - and the state - now finally control all of Buryatia."

BRY_Support_Buryat_Peasantry: "Support Buryat Peasantry"
BRY_Support_Buryat_Peasantry_desc: "The peasantry is the lifeblood of any nation, and Buryatia is no different! We must raise up these endless toilers, these hardy laborers, this solid and sturdy, yet downtrodden backbone of our very people and state, and we must do it immediately. No longer can the rough-hewn hands of the peasantry - the very peasantry that forms the largest foundation of our society - be left to support our entire nation without anything in return. Through new pro-worker and lower class legislations and policies, as well as a new campaign from the government aimed at improving the wider image of these ‘dirty’ laborers, we shall build a new Buryat man for all to aspire to - the humble but noble and ever important peasant with whom our entire destiny lies."

BRY_Power_To_Local_Zemstva: "Power to Local Zemstva"
BRY_Power_To_Local_Zemstva_desc: "The Zemstva are local semi-autonomous representative bodies bringing some semblance of local or community government to the masses. However, they have long been largely powerless, seen as a joke by many, and remain shackled to the national government like a useless bauble. This reality must be changed. The Zemstva shall be expanded and given far more power to dictate the policy of their local regions, bringing true local democracy to all within Buryatia."

BRY_Our_Friends_In_Mongolia: "Our Friends in Mongolia"
BRY_Our_Friends_In_Mongolia_desc: "To the South, into the Steppe and towards the Gobi, lies the wondrous prairies and rolling hills of Mongolia - the heartland of the Mongolic peoples and our closest brethren, both by blood and by culture. As a small and newly independent state, it would be ideal to reach out to the much larger and more developed Mongolians, so that we may ride their success towards successes of our own while also developing closer diplomatic and economic ties that will come in handy later as we strive towards greater supranational ambitions."

BRY_Support_Capitalists: "Support Buryat Capitalists"
BRY_Support_Capitalists_desc: "Within Buryatia exists a small but powerful class of rich elites and nobles who have made their fortunes off capitalistic endeavors and deals with various Mongolian, Russian, Japanese, and other foreign groups. These entrepreneurs and captains of industry, though small in number, would be vital to creating a stable market-based economy here in Buryatia. Our administration must reach out to these business moguls and win their aid and support so that we can use their financial successes as a springboard to national economic growth and prosperity."

BRY_Ties_With_Cossacks: "Ties With Cossacks"
BRY_Ties_With_Cossacks_desc: "Despite mixed views on the cossacks being common among our people, our party prides itself on using these rough riding nomads to our advantage. With a long martial tradition, they would be instrumental in military and peacekeeping operations, and their expertise at nomadic life and raiding for profit would be a possible boon for our infantile economy. Though they must be reined in with some token legislation, these cossacks will prove to be vital allies."

BRY_Our_Relations_With_Russia: "Our Relations With Russia"
BRY_Our_Relations_With_Russia_desc: "Our relationship with Russia has always been messy, for they have both uplifted and oppressed the Buryat people, and the wider Mongolic peoples as a whole, for centuries. Despite these mixed feelings and diverse, divisive history, they are also the largest nation on Earth and one of the most powerful. Though Moscow feels like a world away, Siberia is just a stone’s throw from our borders, and with their proximity and power, they could either prove to be a great ally or a nearly unbeatable enemy. We must decide our relationship with this great Northern Bear carefully if our new nation is to survive."

BRY_Buryat_Mongol_Autonomy: "Buryat-Mongol Autonomy"
BRY_Buryat_Mongol_Autonomy_desc: "As a Mongolic people ourselves, it is only right that we should work towards integration with the Mongolian homeland. We shall approach the current Mongolian regime and propose an autonomous union, eventually pushing for total integration as we strive for the prosperity of all Mongolians. If accepted, we shall join Mongolia as an autonomous district and slowly march towards total unity."

BRY_Buryat_Sovereignity: "Buryat Sovereignty"
BRY_Buryat_Sovereignity_desc: "Though we may be a Mongolic people, we have no desire to throw away our hard-earned sovereignty. To do so would only be a slap in the face to every soul who has fought and died for our new nation, and we shall not spit on their graves so soon. Buryat sovereignty shall be upheld at all costs, for our nations is by the Buryats, and for the Buryats."

BRY_Claim_Greater_Buryatia: "Claim Greater Buryatia"
BRY_Claim_Greater_Buryatia_desc: "With our sovereignty solidified, it is finally time to pursue the dream of a Greater Buryatia. We shall move to take the Mongolic-inhabited lands to the North, and our enemies shall falter before our might. Once and for all, each and every Buryat shall be freed from non-Mongolic rule. Towards a Greater Buryatia! Towards our greater destiny!"

BRY_Union_With_Mongolia: "Union With Mongolia"
BRY_Union_With_Mongolia_desc: "With the creation of our Buryat Autonomy going well, and with relations between our people and the wider Mongolia homeland only improving and deepening, it is finally time to push towards full integration. We shall become one with Mongolia proper, uniting our Mongolic peoples under one government and one state for the first time in centuries. Towards a united Mongolia! Towards our united destiny!"

BRY_Cooperate_With_Monasteries: "Cooperate with Monasteries"
BRY_Cooperate_With_Monasteries_desc: "With our governments push for total land reform and other radical policies, Bazar Baradiyn and his SBSO have gone to great lengths to protect the monasteries and the Buddhist clergy that would normally be cut down by revolutionary fervor had other groups like the Union of The Militant Godless taken the reins of power instead. By working closely with the monks and lamas of the largest monasteries like Tamchinsky datsan in order to protect Buddhists across the nation as we work to establish Buddhism - and by extension the clergy and the monasteries - as an integral part of our revolution."

BRY_Take_Best_From_Westerners: "Take the Best From the West"
BRY_Take_Best_From_Westerners_desc: "Though the West has many flaws, they are also the beacon of progress and innovation currently, and as such we should look to them for inspiration. From all aspect of society, whether it be socio-economics, science and technology, the military, or even the basis of our Socialist doctrine, we shall pull the best of what the West has to offer, stripping it of its weak points to create a new synthesis of Western thought for our Buryatia to emulate."

BRY_Form_Ulaan_Tsagda: "Form Ulaan Tsagdaa"
BRY_Form_Ulaan_Tsagda_desc: "In desperate need to protect our vast wilderness and our borders, the SBSO has moved to create the Ulaan Tsagdaa. Serving as a volunteer red cavalry army, this military force shall be used by the state as peacekeepers, as borderguards, and as national police. Though voluntary, all recruits shall be trained and drilled extensively, and with horse riding being such an integral part of Buryat society, we will surely have no shortage of able-riding recruits. This red wave shall be our first and last line of defense, protecting the people, the party, and the clergy above all other priorities."

BRY_Liquidate_Traditionalism: "Liquidate Traditionalism"
BRY_Liquidate_Traditionalism_desc: "Tradition and archaic customs only serve to hamstring our national rebirth. These roadblocks to modernization and progress must be sidelined or destroyed, paving the way for our pious and crimson future. No longer shall the sins and misguided beliefs of the past hamper the Buryat people’s ability to prosper."

BRY_Support_Panmongolism: "Support Panmongolism"
BRY_Support_Panmongolism_desc: "The Mongolic peoples are vast and varied, spread across the Steppe and the Far-East as their nomadic lifestyles carry them to distant lands and richer prairies. To the South lies Mongolia proper, the heartland of the Mongolic peoples and the homeland of our shared identity. We must foster ideas of ‘Panmongolism’ throughout the nation as we slowly move to unite the Mongolic peoples, one way or another, so that our people support such an idea when the time comes. Only together can the Mongolic peoples resist outside influence and reach prosperity, and we will show this fact to all Mongolic peoples."

BRY_Join_International_Community: "Join the International Community"
BRY_Join_International_Community_desc: "With the foundations of our new revolutionary state established, we must reach out to the wider international community to establish diplomatic, economic, and martial ties with the primary Socialist powers. Though we have gotten this far on our own, the Buryat people will need foregin allies if we are to survive this chaotic era."

BRY_Militant_Buddhism: "Militant Buddhism"
BRY_Militant_Buddhism_desc: "Though normally pacifism is a pillar of Buddhism, there exist many sects and schools that channel their zeal and dogma into martial prowess and a fine warrior tradition. We shall emphasize these traditions more, seeking to expand their popularity across Buryatia so that the veteran warriors at our disposal only grow in number and ferocity. With this martial tradition behind us, we shall defend our new holy state down to the last man."

BRY_Theocratic_State: "A True Theocratic State"
BRY_Theocratic_State_desc: "Emphasizing his Buddhist faith and dedication to the philosophy it entails, our national leader Bidia Dandaron has proclaimed that Buryatia is to be reforged into a true theocracy, with himself ascending to a position similar to the Bogd Khan of Mongolia. Rising to become the new religious, political, and military leader of this Kodun State, ‘Lama Dandaron’ shall guide every facet of our reforged and pious nation into a prosperous and pious future."

BRY_Fight_The_Cossacks: "Fight the Cossacks"
BRY_Fight_The_Cossacks_desc: "The cossacks have long pervaded this nation like a tumor, copying our nomadic lifestyle while living as disgraceful bandits. We must work to purify their ranks, converting the few that we can while fiercely combatting those we cannot in order to stop their vile influence from pervading throughout our society. Through faith and flame, sword and shot, these rough riders shall be purged from our new Buryatia so that we may prosper as a homogeneous and united people."

BRY_Empower_The_Monasteries: "Empower the Monasteries"
BRY_Empower_The_Monasteries_desc: "The various monasteries across Buryatia form a key facet of both our cultural society as well as our political administration. As our strongest allies and closest supporters, they shall be empowered and granted far greater autonomy and freedoms, both allowing them to function more as they see fit while also giving them greater sway within the government. With our ideals aligning more and more, this shouldn’t be an issue, and with larger monasteries such as Tamchinsky Datsan and Hambyn-Hire Datsan rising to become strongholds for our party, we have no worries about their loyalty."

BRY_Neobuddhism: "Neobuddhism"
BRY_Neobuddhism_desc: "Promoted by Bidia Dandaron, ‘Neobuddhism’ is a new strain of thought calling for a synthesis of Buddhist religious practice and tradition with the politics, economics, culture, and wider society of the nation itself. Essentially the complete opposite of Western Secularization programs, Neobuddhism seeks to fully integrate the Buddhist Church as not only an aspect of our society, but as the wider foundation of it that all other facets link back and relate to. Fiercely popular among much of the lower classes who view it as their ticket into a more pure, just, and pious society, the movement has already begun to spread like wildfire, and soon it shall hopefully come to consume all of Buryatia, furthering our transformation into a true theocracy."

BRY_Greater_Buryat_Mongolia: "Greater Buryat-Mongolia"
BRY_Greater_Buryat_Mongolia_desc: "Placing emphasis on our distinct Buryat heritage while pushing for Panmongol ideas is no easy task given the great influence of the Southern Mongolias in Ulaanbaatar, but it is our destiny. We shall be the ones to unite the Mongolic race. We shall be the ones to wrap the Mongolic peoples in the embrace of Neobuddhism as we uplift the Buryat-Mongols specifically as an exemplary people. Panmongolism will be achieved at all costs, and our Buryat identity shall finally get the recognition is so rightfully deserves!"

BRY_Buddhist_Brethren: "Join Our Buddhist Brethren"
BRY_Buddhist_Brethren_desc: "Though national unity is a great dream, it would only serve to  muddy our distinct yet linked identities as the varied and mighty Mongolic peoples. Instead, we shall pursue close diplomatic, martial, and economic ties with our Mongolian brethren instead, so that both of our nations may reach prosperity together without either of our specific peoples being trampled beneath the other."

BRY_Revive_Tsagan_Tsagdaa: "Revival of the Tsagan Tsagdaa"
BRY_Revive_Tsagan_Tsagdaa_desc: "The legacy of the Buryat Cossacks and warriors must be restored. By re-establishing our armed forces, we honor the traditions of our ancestors and prepare to defend our sovereignty. The dismissed by Kolchak Tsagan Tsagdaa (White Guard) shall rise again."
BRY_Cossack_Legacy: "The Buryat Cossack Legacy"
BRY_Cossack_Legacy_desc: "The Buryat Cossacks have a rich history, from defending the Russian-Chinese border to participating in the Russo-Japanese War. Reviving this traditional force will form the backbone of our modern military."
BRY_Buryat_Horse_Archers: "Buryat Horse Archers"
BRY_Buryat_Horse_Archers_desc: "The Buryat horse archers, often overlooked, are an essential part of our heritage. Reviving their skills and tactics will give us a distinct advantage in long-range engagements and harassment of enemy lines."
BRY_Mountain_Winter_Warfare: "Mountain and Winter Warfare"
BRY_Mountain_Winter_Warfare_desc: "Buryatia's terrain is not only vast but often harsh. We must develop troops capable of fighting in cold, mountainous regions, just as our ancestors did during their conflicts."

BRY_Use_The_Nomadic_Legacy: "Harken to Our Nomadic Legacy"
BRY_Use_The_Nomadic_Legacy_desc: "As Mongols, nomadism is in our blood. Though not conducive to modern urban living, nomadic traditions are useful for their military applications. With an intimate knowledge of the land around them and how to live off of it, nomads make ideal soldiers. They shall be taken in as teachers, as officers, and as veterans where they can put their knowledge to good use for the state."
BRY_Buryat_Officer_School: "Buryat Officer School"
BRY_Buryat_Officer_School_desc: "In order to train a new generation of native officers, a local officer academy shall be built in the capital. Here, we shall finally have a center of higher military education capable of training our own general staff, with our nation no longer forced to rely on foreign expertise."
BRY_Rally_The_Masses: "Rally the Masses"
BRY_Rally_The_Masses_desc: "For any war to be won, the masses must be behind the nation and the army lest the whole nation collapse. As we move to build up our military, we must also instill a deep sense of patriotism and respect within the populace towards our men in uniform. Who knows, this may even get more to volunteer for our ever hungry armed forces."

BRY_Improve_Artillery: "Buryat Field Artillery"
BRY_Improve_Artillery_desc: "Much of our heavy guns and canons are relics of the Weltkrieg or are museum pieces ransacked and pushed into service out of necessity. By studying more modern designs from Russia and Japan, we shall modernize our artillery corps so that we may rain down heavy ordinance upon any foe."
BRY_Adapt_To_The_Modern_Battlefield: "Adapting to the Modern Battlefield"
BRY_Adapt_To_The_Modern_Battlefield_desc: "In order to improve the combat effectiveness of our recruited cossack warriors, we shall replace many of their horses with mechanized and motorized vehicles. Though this might cut their speed and their flexibility on rough terrain or when without supply, they shall be far more effective at fighting in this modern style of warfare that has become the dominant form of combat."
BRY_Increase_Military_Spendings: "Increase Military Spendings"
BRY_Increase_Military_Spendings_desc: "Our military-industrial complex is an ever growing and ever hungry machine. In order to fuel this rampant growth, we must allocate more of the national budget towards the armed forces. Though other sectors of our society may take a slight hit, it is worth it for national security."
BRY_Siberian_Logistics: "Siberian Logistics"
BRY_Siberian_Logistics_desc: "The harsh conditions of Siberia demand a strong logistical base to keep our military forces supplied. We must build a robust system to support our troops in all corners of the country."
BRY_True_Heirs_Of_Gengis_Khan: "True Heirs of Genghis Khan"
BRY_True_Heirs_Of_Gengis_Khan_desc: "We are the sons of Temujin, the heirs of Genghis and his children. His martial talent, his traditions, and his successes flow through our veins as true heirs of the Mongol Empire. We shall tap into this martial spirit and tradition and channel the might of Temujin directly. We shall be his heirs, and we shall make our national hero proud."

BRY_Air: "Form the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Air Forces"
BRY_Air_desc: "We shall fill the skies with metal birds of prey in order to protect our newly-freed state. No longer shall the simple hawks, falcons, and songbirds of Buryatia inhabit our skies alone, for soon with the creation of our own airforce, we too shall take flight in order to preserve the nation and our sovereignty."

BRY_Buy_Japanese_Planes: "Purchase Japanese Planes"
BRY_Buy_Japanese_Planes_desc: "We lack much of the heavy industry and resources needed to develop our own planes from scratch. However, just next door is Japan who is always eager to sell their arms to fellow Eastern nations in need - especially when those nations oppose Japan’s many enemies. We shall reach out to Tokyo and buy as many aircraft as they’ll allow, giving our air programme a jumpstart."

BRY_Use_The_Russian_Knowledge: "Utilize Russian Knowledge"
BRY_Use_The_Russian_Knowledge_desc: "Though the Russians are largely reviled here, you cannot ignore their amazing aptitude for war. By pulling designs and ideas from the Russian air force, we shall further hone our own force into a far more effective arm of the military."

BRY_Buryat_Air_Academy: "[ROOT.GetAdjective] Air Academy"
BRY_Buryat_Air_Academy_desc: "In order to train our pilots natively without the need for help from foreign powers, we must construct our own air academy here in [ROOT.GetNameDef]. Serving as a flight school, an officer academy, and a research and development center all in one, this new academy shall become the centerpiece of our attempts to rule the skies."

BRY_Expand_The_Airfields: "Expand Our Airfields"
BRY_Expand_The_Airfields_desc: "The airfields in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] are few and far between, with those few paved ones built by the Russians being far outnumbered by simple stips of prairie cordoned off for take-off and landings. We must rectify this reality immediately and construct a new series of permanent airfields across [ROOT.GetNameDef]. Without these landingstrips and hangars, our air force shall remain largely grounded."

BRY_Air_Force_Investment: "Air Force Investments"
BRY_Air_Force_Investment_desc: "With the first developments coming along well, our administration has now found it agreeable to expand the air force further. The initial creation of this branch has gone well, but now it requires more funding to truly be effective. We shall grant out flyboys these funds, for they are the new swift riders of [ROOT.GetNameDef], and upon their wings they carry our future and security."

BRY_Improve_Air_Fleet: "Improve Our Air Fleet"
BRY_Improve_Air_Fleet_desc: "Though our imports from Russia and Japan have served us well, our air force needs to be expanded with domestically-produced aircraft. We must improve the air fleet with better, more innovative designs while building it all within our borders so that we can finally have total military independence and proficiency."

BRY_Seek_International_Recognition: "Seek International Recognition"
BRY_Seek_International_Recognition_desc: "We are a new and relatively illegitimate state in the eyes of the wider international community. With our army modernized and our state secured, we should push for closer diplomatic ties with the Great Powers so that all come to recognize and respect our hard-fought sovereignty."

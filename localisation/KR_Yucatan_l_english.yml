YUC_defense_of_yucatan:0 "The Yucatán Rebellion"
YUC_defense_of_yucatan_desc:0 "Breaking free from Mexican tyranny as they further encroached on our rights and our freedoms, our Yucatán now stands free, but with our backs against the sea and with the Mexican barbarians at the gate, our future is as uncertain as ever. With the hero of our rebellion - General Salvador Alvarado Rubio - at the helm of our provisional government leading a Syndicalist-aligned Junta, our nation and our people are ready to dig in and hold on against any threat as we attempt to solidify our new position and secure Yucatán’s independence. The horrors of the Caste War and Mexico’s atrocities following their Revolution shall be avenged, and the people of Yucatán will finally have their freedom!"
YUC_division:0 "An Infantile Nation Divided"
YUC_division_desc:0 "With General Alvarado guiding the nation and with independence figures like Francisco May Pech and Felipe Carrillo Puerto at his side, our new provisional regime is slowly attempting to achieve what no other government that has ruled over the Yucatán has been able to achieve - harmonious federalism. From our three constituent states of Quintana Roo, (North) Yucatán, and Campeche, the Alvarado regime is trying to establish our new Yucatec state as a semi-Federalist Republic that allows fair and free democratic elections and autonomy to its constituent states and varied minorities. However, this dream is still a long way off, for the various political forces within our nation each have their own views of how this union should look, and many more obstacles still stand in the way of Yucatán unity."
YUC_unclear_identity:0 "Nebulous National Identity"
YUC_unclear_identity_desc:0 "Not since the Maya state of Chan Santa Cruz that rose in Quintana Roo in 1849 and fell in 1915 has there existed an independent state on the Yucatán, and even that noble attempt at sovereignty was snuffed out before it could spread past our Southern coast. For centuries, the Hispanic Euro-Mexicans have eroded any sense of native identity and autonomism that they could, and as such, the varied peoples of our peninsula have only the loosest sense of a united ‘Yucateco’ identity. We must solidify what it means to be a true child of the Yucatán, whatever that may come to be in the future, for without a united national identity, we will surely be swallowed up by the Mexican hordes once again!"
YUC_unclear_economy:0 "Uncertain Economic Future"
YUC_unclear_economy_desc:0 "The various political forces within our nation all have competing and opposing views for how the new national economy should be organized. Our peninsula is largely dominated by agrarian pursuits, with only the most basic signs of industrialization being recognizable in large cities like Mérida and Cancun, though we do possess some safe ports ideal for trade. With bickering Socialists, Capitalists, Traditionalists, and Corporatists all having their own ‘perfect’ plan on how to put our economy on the right track, our economic future is at a crossroads, and a direction must be taken soon lest our economy collapse before it can even be truly built."
YUC_radicalism_idea:0 "Radical Political Scene"
YUC_radicalism_idea_desc:0 "From the Red Shirts of Tomás Garrido Canabal to the Maya fanatics and Cruzoob zealots of Francisco May Pech, many radical groups from across the spectrum vie for control over our Yucatán. With democratic elements and the masses caught in the middle, and with the Red General Alvarado trying to keep the peace under his populist, Socialist-influenced Junta, our Yucatán finds itself being torn apart from within by domestic extremism despite our perilous and precarious position isolated on this peninsula and in flippant disregard to the Mexican wolves prowling at our borders. It is only a matter of time before this unstable situation comes to head, and what Yucatán will look like in the aftermath is anyone’s guess, but that has not stopped every party, paramilitary, and radical group in the nation from preparing for their moment to strike."

### Opinions ###

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_ALVORADO_DESC:0 "The Red General of the Yucatán, Salvador Alvarado Rubio is the protector of the Yucatecos and the main instigator of our rebellion from Mexico. Born in 1880 in Sinaloa, Alvarado is no native to our peninsula, but he has come to be a true man of Yucatán all the same. After a childhood spent constantly moving around northern Mexico with his family, and after a short career as pharmacist, he entered politics. He joined the Partido Liberal Mexicano in 1906, and later the Anti-Reelectionist Party, to oppose the Porfiriato. Nearly getting caught by Díaz’s forces after breaking into a military camp and assaulting federal soldiers with a group of young firebrands, Alvarado fled to the Yanqui state of Arizona. He would eventually return to Mexico after joining up with a exile volunteer army in Texas that swore to help Madero topple Díaz’s regime, crossing the Rio Grande and aiding in overthrowing the tyrant. With Díaz ousted, others rose to challenge Madero, and the cascading events that would kick start the Mexican Revolution came to pass. With constantly shifting sides, the messy Revolution persisted for years, but Alvarado stuck through it all while his new allies and life-long interest in social justice, feminism, and Socialist thought drove him further towards the Left. As the Revolution came to a close, Alvarado found himself on the winning side, and in recognition of his talent, he was sent to the Yucatán Peninsula to serve as its new governor. It was here that the Red General was exposed to the plight of the locals, witnessing firsthand the terror that the Mexican government inflicted upon the Yucatecos. It was these experiences that would come to shift his loyalties, further driving him into the arms of Socialism, and slowly he fell in with various Yucatán seperatist groups. Spending many years in Yucatán well after his term as governor passed, Alvarado kept close ties with key independence figures, and after the rise of anti-Yucatec policies within the Mexican government once again, the Red General and his allies finally snapped. Organizing a new Yucatán Rebellion, Alvarado broke from the chains of Mexico and now attempts to secure Yucatec sovereignty. Commanding the nation as a benevolent strongman at the forefront of his military junta, this Crimson Caudillo is prepared to be the red velvet-handed autocrat the people of Yucatán both need and deserve."

YUC_high_command:0 "Yucatec High Command"
YUC_high_command_desc:0 "In Mérida's Municipal Palace, our highest-ranking officers have come together to plan a defense of our liberties. An eclectic mix of former revolutionaries, militias, Red Guardsman, and local volunteers give us a variety of experience to draw from."
YUC_barricades:0 "Mérida Barricades"
YUC_barricades_desc:0 "The first order is to barricade Mérida's wide avenues and block the main road. We cannot risk letting Cuidado traitors into our city in this time of national crisis."
YUC_national_joint_command:0 "National Joint Command"
YUC_national_joint_command_desc:0 "Within the city are posts for several Mexican combatant commands, including the Escuela Superior de Guerra. The President has ordered the Chief of Staff to unify those that remain into a new National Joint Command to best utilize our meager manpower."
YUC_reform_national_army:0 "Reform National Army"
YUC_reform_national_army_desc:0 "Our ramshackle organization is in dire need of reform. General Salvador Alvarado has suggested a set of drills that were employed by the Colegio Militar to rapidly prepare soldiers for service, which isn't too far away from their homes."
YUC_improve_equipment:0 "Improve Equipment"
YUC_improve_equipment_desc:0 "Our arsenal is mostly composed of leftover arms of the 1910 revolution, and whatever loyalists came to Yucatán with. It is worth it to purchase better gun designs, and prepare for a longer conflict after the emergency has ended."
YUC_reverse_engeneering:0 "Reverse Engineering"
YUC_reverse_engeneering_desc:0 "Where we cannot buy, we must steal. Small arms smuggled past the blockade are given to our machinists in an attempt to reverse engineer whatever works to our advantage."
YUC_army_infrastructure:0 "Army Infrastructure"
YUC_army_infrastructure_desc:0 "The Yucatán Army cannot be conducted from the Municipal Palace. We have relocated our headquarters to Casa de Montejo, where we can better organize an army supply chain to aid our sovereignty."
YUC_maya_expertise:0 "Maya Expertise"
YUC_maya_expertise_desc:0 "Centuries of eluding the Cuidado military must be brought forward if we are to ever cut off the enemy supply chain. The Chief of Staff has called in old Maya to assist in traveling the old Indian paths and helping units survive when their food supplies run low."
YUC_call_to_arms:0 "Call to Arms"
YUC_call_to_arms_desc:0 "While the population of Yucatán is enthusiastic and grateful to finally be free from the Cuidado, their commitment to the war could be better. We must leverage the cultural achievements of Yucatán's many poets recruited for the military."
YUC_war_of_resistance:0 "War of Resistance"
YUC_war_of_resistance_desc:0 "Winning this most significant war with the Cuidado government will require the loyalty of every village. Soldiers who love their homes will resist to their last breath against tyranny."
YUC_star_war:0 "Star War"
YUC_star_war_desc:0 "To our forebears, wars of great import often seemed as though a star had shed its vitality upon the earth. As we focus on acquiring new long-range, some think that one day their violent journeys across the sky will impart a similar superstition in our enemies."
YUC_foreign_legion:0 "Mayan Rangers"
YUC_foreign_legion_desc:0 "Our Mayan experts have organized themselves into special divisions suited for deep operations behind enemy lines. These Mayan Rangers will outmaneuver the more solid, slow enemies."
YUC_artillery_brigades:0 "Artillery Brigades"
YUC_artillery_brigades_desc:0 "Artillery brigades are a godsend when we heard them roll into Mérida. This will enable us to survive the long siege if the enemy makes it to our capital."
YUC_maya_code:0 "Maya Code"
YUC_maya_code_desc:0 "The Maya's traditional system of seasonal conflict has been broken over the last century by the Mexican government's incursions. The lessons learned about avoiding the valleys in the summer were lost to the Cuidado Army, which we still retain."
YUC_modern_division_structure:0 "Modern Division Structure"
YUC_modern_division_structure_desc:0 "Further optimism comes past the blockades in the form of manuals on military drilling. Our National Joint Command is prepared to reorganize our divisions to fight the future against combined arms enemies."
YUC_drill_the_natives:0 "Drill the Natives"
YUC_drill_the_natives_desc:0 "While the Mayan Rangers have worked swimmingly, the normal Mayan militias appear to treat the conflict with some indifference. We are a republic, and they are citizens, not a retinue. These soldiers should receive the same training as would a Mérida resident."
YUC_production_sites:0 "Production Sites"
YUC_production_sites_desc:0 "Clearing new land for production sites is a necessity, as usable land is at a premium in Yucatán."
YUC_naval_docks:0 "Naval Docks"
YUC_naval_docks_desc:0 "Our only access to the outside world, Progreso, has no modern naval facilities to speak of. A dockyard named after the remoteness of the city, Terminal Remota, has been constructed in order to break us out of the bubble."
YUC_protect_coasts:0 "Protecting Our Coast"
YUC_protect_coasts_desc:0 "This new dockyard is an obvious target for raiders. We must allocate some more industrial output to protect Terminal Remota."
YUC_the_navy:0 "Yucatán Navy"
YUC_the_navy_desc:0 "The banner of Yucatán now flies over a defensive navy, the first step towards projecting our power out of the peninsula."
YUC_air_force:0 "Yucatán Air Force"
YUC_air_force_desc:0 "Several modified crop dusters have made their way to a cleared field outside city limits. These first steps towards an air force will pay dividends as an independent nation."
YUC_airplane_aquistions:0 "Airplane Acquisitions"
YUC_airplane_aquistions_desc:0 "Further connections in Guatemala have secured us airplanes with some defensive capabilities. Nothing major, but a symbolic victory over the environment and the Cuidado."
YUC_aerial_drills:0 "Aerial Drills"

### Political Focuses ###
YUC_yucatec_democracy:0 "Yucatec Independence Secured"
YUC_yucatec_democracy_desc:0 "For the last seventy years, the Yucatec have fought for democratic representation by the Cuidado. The imposition of Hispanidad and La Raza policies by the Mexican government pushed us over the edge and sparked our fiery revolt that has now led to our own independent state. We shall never submit to foreign oppressors and dictators of any kind ever again, for the Yucatán is finally free!"

YUC_maya_victory:0 "Triumph of the Maya"
YUC_maya_victory_desc:0 "The rule of the Hispanic bastards has come to an end! The Maya people have rallied around General Francisco May Pech, and with a reinvigorated nativist spirit, they have pushed the Mexicans out of Yucatán and have declared that Maya civilization is not dead! Avenging the Caste War and calling for a new rebirth of Maya culture, language, society, Francisco May Pech shall punish the Spanish Colonizers and exact our revenge as we revive our repressed identity to old glories and beyond. "

YUC_ode_to_sacrafice:0 "Anti-Hispanicism"
YUC_ode_to_sacrafice_desc:0 "While many people in this great nation are of rightful Maya descent, others still speak the tongue of the Spaniards! This fact and the further existence of a distinct Spanish identity in our Yucatán is something that is simply unacceptable! Harsh laws against Spanish language and culture shall be implemented, for we shall reflect hundreds of years of oppression back at them."
YUC_remember_the_castle_war:0 "Remember the Caste War"
YUC_remember_the_castle_war_desc:0 "The Caste War of Yucatán officially lasted from 1847 to 1901, but our brave patriots and freedom fighters have kept the fight alive well into the 1930’s, never giving up the struggle and finally winning our Maya people their deserved independence after decades of fighting and centuries of oppression. Now, with our freedom secured and our new state being consolidated, it is time to honor the dead and remember their sacrifices, while also preparing for the inevitable return of war. War memorials and monuments shall be built around the nation, and funds will be created to compensate our fighters’ families and their widows, while simultaneously our state will build new bunkers at our borders and ammunition stores in our hinterlands to prepare for Europeans and their likely retaliation."
YUC_death_to_european_mexico:0 "Death to 'Latin' America"
YUC_death_to_european_mexico_desc:0 "The region we have lived in for millennia has come to be known as ‘Latin’ America - a stain on our land that both denies our existence and belittles our culture and impact on these lands. We must work to eradicate this foolish, Eurocentric label and restore our Mesoamerica to greatness. The era of a European-dominated Yucatán will come to an end, no matter the cost!"

YUC_chan_santa_cruz:0 "Chan Santa Cruz Avenged"
YUC_chan_santa_cruz_desc:0 "The old state of Chan Santa Cruz was the center of a syncretic religious movement that combined Maya culture with the Catholic faith while fighting for Maya independence on the Yucatán. Their short-lived fiefdom centered on our Eastern coast was the last independent indigenous Maya state to exist, finally dying out after the formal end of the Caste War in 1915. With the success of Francisco May Pech’s movement and with his formal proclamation upholding the ideas and tenets of the Cruzoobian state, it would seem that the fall of Chan Santa Cruz has finally been avenged. Long live the independent Maya people, long live Cruzoob!"
YUC_cruzoob_faith:0 "The Cruzoob Faith"
YUC_cruzoob_faith_desc:0 "The Cruzoob faith, also known as the Cult of the Talking Cross, is a syncretic religion mixing ancient Maya faith with Catholic tenets, forming a synthesis of European and Mesoamerican ideas entirely form-fitted to suit the spiritual needs of the modern Maya. Holding several old Maya texts, the Maya calendar, Maya chants and traditional music, herbalist tomes, and other aged facets of Maya spirituality in high regard, this faith revolves around the cosmic calendar, Christian morals, and a pantheon of Mesoamerican gods, with many being mixed with Christian figures and with the main god - K’u - being a mix of the Christian God and the old Maya god of creation. May Pech himself is an ardent believer in the faith, and now shall make all the Yucatán practice this one, true faith as well."
YUC_mayan_catholicism:0 "Total Maya-Catholic Syncretism"
YUC_mayan_catholicism_desc:0 "Taking the syncretism of the Cruzoob religion to a whole new level, May Pech has moved to fully combine the two faiths. Christian faith on its own has been banned, with only Cruzoob and other native faiths being allowed in the state. Furthermore, all Catholic Churches in the nation have been taken over and begun to be transformed into shrines for our many gods. More Christian tenets have been adopted and adapted to fit the needs and beliefs of our people, and the two religions have truly become one here in Yucatán. Under May Pech, this new fully unified faith shall be the glue that binds our nation and people together, and be the shield that protects us from the colonizers."
YUC_state_of_the_cross:0 "The State of the Talking Cross"
YUC_state_of_the_cross_desc:0 "Under Francisco May Pech, the Yucatán peninsula is finally safe. The Maya people and our culture have been safeguarded under our new syncretic faith, and the horrors of the Caste War and the fall of Chan Santa Cruz have been avenged. We are a state wholly dedicated to the Cult of the Talking Cross, and our devotion shall bring us salvation and prosperity. May Pech is our shepherd, and the Cruzoob faith is our guide. Forward now, into destiny!"

YUC_new_ajaw:0 "Elevating the New Ahau"
YUC_new_ajaw_desc:0 "The old Maya Civilization lasted for thousands of years, never centralizing but prospering until it finally collapsed under the Spanish in 1697 after centuries of decline, being lost to time as the Maya people were forced to integrate into Spanish-Mexican society. However, with the success of General Francisco May Pech, this late, great civilization can once again breathe life! A new noble class of lower ahau - or leaders - has been crowned, consisting of May Pech and his closest allies, as well as the most prominent figures in Yucatán that would swear loyalty to May Pech and this new state. These new ahau shall each lead a city or settlement, helping our new national father guide the nation on this path of total Maya restorationism."
YUC_mayan_pantheon:0 "Venerate the Maya Pantheon"
YUC_mayan_pantheon_desc:0 "The old gods of the Maya religion shall come to be re-venerated in our state, for we must prove we are the true children of Quetzalcoatl and the other gods. Our old pantheon shall rise, traditional offerings and sacrifices shall return, the old cosmic calendar shall be updated, and the old priesthood shall rise to lead our people. Many of our newly elevated Ahau shall be these new spiritual guides, with Francisco May Pech rising to become the high priest of the nation. We shall revive the faith of our ancestors and finally wipe away any and all European influence from our souls and from our identity."
YUC_revive_mayan_language:0 "Revive Maya Culture and Mayan Language"
YUC_revive_mayan_language_desc:0 "The original Maya Culture was thought to be lost for hundreds of years after our fall to the Spanish in the 1600s. For centuries before our resurgence, our culture and language rotted under Hispanicism. But now, as the Maya people rise from the mud and take the fate of their people and our Yucatán back into our grasp, our culture can flourish again! No longer shall the Spanish and the Mexicans and the fools of Central America sully the splendor of the Maya. Our culture shall be restored, our language proliferated, and our identity shall be reforged as May Pech guides us into a new golden age for the Maya!"
YUC_neo_maya:0 "A Restored Maya Civilization"
YUC_neo_maya_desc:0 "With Maya culture and religion spreading throughout Yucatán and with our restored Mayan language taking root, Maya civilization has truly returned to this Earth after being nearly eradicated by the Spanish. Now, Francisco May Pech has finally announced his ultimate ambition. Rising as the Kʼuhul Ahau - or ‘Divine Leader’ - and taking the regal name Kʼinich Janaab Pakal IV after the original Pakal the Great - the longest reigning monarch of the New World and the greatest Mayan Ahau and his descendents, Francisco May Pech is no more. Now, Pakal IV will reign as the Kʼuhul Ahau of our resurgent Maya state, hell bent on a path to create the first Maya Empire."

YUC_primitive_land:0 "Primitivist Land Usage"
YUC_primitive_land_desc:0 "Following principles started by our ancestors, we shall work the land just as they did - albeit using modern practices and technologies mixed with traditional methods and knowledge. Slash and burn agriculture, farming plot cycling, and jungle clearing for land development shall become key tools of the state to build up our new Maya civilization. Old Maya architecture will make a resurgence, and old crafts and practices utilized by the laborers and farmers among our ancestors will be utilized to their peak efficiency. We will perfect the methods of the past and build a new Maya state without losing sight of tradition."
YUC_agrarian_economics_natpop:0 "Maya Agrarianism"
YUC_agrarian_economics_natpop_desc:0 "Our resurgent Maya state will have an economy built around agriculture, for it is what we know best. By devoting large portions of the land to growing cash crops, we shall entice our friends across the Pacific and across the New World to buy our goods, and the rest of our arable land will go to food production and ranching to feed our growing populace. We will build a new, self-sufficient, and prosperous economy off the backs of our noble farmers, and we shall compensate and provide for these economic heroes, for our agricultural workers are the backbone of the nation."
YUC_anti_european_trade:0 "Anti-European Economics"
YUC_anti_european_trade_desc:0 "Though the West has opportune markets just begging for profit to be made, we cannot swallow our pride and trade with the colonizers. Instead, we shall look East across the Pacific and here on our own continent for trade partners and economic deals that truly put our needs first, or at least take our needs into account. By looking towards powers like Peru, Japan, Haiti, and others, we shall build our own stable and self-sufficient economy without having to turn tail and run back to the Spanish and their imperialist friends."

YUC_march_to_reclaim_our_people:0 "The March To Reclaim Our People"
YUC_march_to_reclaim_our_people_desc:0 "With Maya civilization restored and revitalized, the time has come to march to war. Across Mesoamerica, the various groups of Maya peoples wither under European and Hispanic oppression. We shall liberate these fellow children of Quetzalcoatl, bringing our empire one step closer to reality!"
YUC_reclaim_the_empire:0 "Unite the Maya People"
YUC_reclaim_the_empire_desc:0 "While Maya culture flourishes once more in our Yucatán, our brothers in the other lands across the former Maya civilization still chafe under the boot of European influence. We must rally our forces, and eventually move to strike at the Europeans and their lapdogs from Tabasco and Chiapas down to Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras, finally reclaiming the lost legacy of the Maya! However, for the first phase of our consolidation of the Maya people, we shall proceed to conquer the secondary homeland of our people - Guatemala and Belize! These territories hold the Quiché and Cakchiquel Maya and the Kekchi Maya respectively, and these long isolated splinters of the main Maya population must be liberated!"
YUC_reintergrate_the_empire:0 "Centralize the Old City States"
YUC_reintergrate_the_empire_desc:0 "Now that the old heartlands of the fallen Maya civilization of Yucatán have been reclaimed, we can begin the process of undoing the damages caused by the Europeans. The city states of our ancestors have finally been united under one banner for the first time in history, and now Francisco May Pech moves to centralize the power of these constituent city states away from their local appointed Ahau and into his own hands in order to build a strong and stable Maya state, and perhaps something more."
YUC_the_empire_breathes_again:0 "The Birth of the First Maya Empire"
YUC_the_empire_breathes_again_desc:0 "Our righteous and once-dead civilization has been reclaimed, with the old lands of the Maya from Mexico to Honduras and beyond within our grasp. For the first time in history, the Maya people have been united under one banner - a banner of their own, and not of some colonizing power. We have finally restored the legacy of Pakal the Great and the original Maya civilization, and now, under Kʼuhul Ahau Kʼinich Janaab Pakal IV, the first Maya Empire shall rise from the ashes of colonialism and imperialist oppression. Long live the Maya, long live Pakal IV!"
YUC_wipe_out_european_mexico:0 "Wipe Out European Mexico"
YUC_wipe_out_european_mexico_desc:0 "Mesoamerica has been struck by and infected with a virulent disease. The centerpiece of this European-derived plague is the foul wasteland that is Mexico, where these foul Hispanics lord over our Tzotzil and Tzeltal brothers who live in the highlands of Chiapas and Tabasco. From the time of the Mexica and Aztec Empire to the modern day, we have warred with the inhabitants of Mexico City. It is finally time to put this centuries-old struggle to an end. We march to Tenochtitlan to restore a truly native Mesoamerica!"
YUC_flower_wars:0 "The New Flower Wars"
YUC_flower_wars_desc:0 "To the South lies the lands of Central America - the old stomping ground of the Maya people. This blood bowl is where we used to wage our flower wars - wars fought between city states, settlements, and tribes in order to maintain the balance of power between Mesoamerican civilization while also gathering slaves for use in ritual sacrifices and for labor. We shall restart this tradition, marching into Central America in order to tame these wild lands and to bring about a new era of internal flower wars to expand our empire and to rejuvenate our culture."
YUC_join_co_prosperity_sphere:0 "Join the Co-Prosperity Sphere"
YUC_join_co_prosperity_sphere_desc:0 "Far to the East lies one of the greatest non-Western powers on Earth - the Empire of Japan. Fiercely anti-European and determined to build their own place in the sun free from Western entanglement, they would be the perfect ally for our fledgling state. We shall reach out to the Land of the Rising Sun with diplomatic overtures and gifts in order to win over the Emperor and his government so that we may be allowed into the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Together, we shall fight Western and European influence wherever it may spring up."

YUC_Purge_Red_Shirts:0 "Destroy the Red Shirts"
YUC_Purge_Red_Shirts_desc:0 "The vile Red Shirts of Canabal are a stain upon our Yucatán and a thorn in the side of our regime.

YUC_Fortify_Yucatan_desc:0 "Our Yucatán sits in an easily-defensible position, surrounded by natural barriers and pressed up against the Mexican Gulf behind thick jungles and rugged terrain. We shall use this to our advantage, turning Yucatán into a living fortress. From within this dense hive of bunkers, trenches, tunnels, and thicket, we shall hold out and defend our Yucatán against any and every foe. Our regime shall not fall to outside forces until they kill every last one of us and ground our expansive defenses to dust!"

YUC_authoritarian_democrats:0 "Alvarado at the Helm"
YUC_authoritarian_democrats_desc:0 "The man who led our nation to independence and who tried to shield us from Mexican aggression during his time as Governor, Salvador Alvarado secured his rule over the Yucatán.

YUC_Labor_Economics:0 "Laborist Economics"
YUC_Labor_Economics_desc:0 "Seeking to implement his long-supported reforms now that he no longer has to answer to Mexico City, President Alvarado has begun to enact these needed changes to our society. Organizing the Casa del Obrero Mundial, or House of the World Worker, to encourage unionization and political participation, Alvarado has also passed a slew of new legislation aimed to establish a welfare state, including minimum wages, maximum working hours, minimum working standards, accident compensation, child regulations, and the right to strike, as well as prohibiting employers from forcing their religious beliefs on workers. With these Laborist principles and more, we shall build a shining pink pearl here in Yucatán."
YUC_Agrarianism:0 "Yucatec Agrarianism"
YUC_Agrarianism_desc:0 "Embracing our rural realities and the Yucatec legacy of agrarianism and farming in this jungle paradise, Alvarado has pushed to expand the agricultural sector massively in order to become the foundation of our modernized industry and economy. Large estates shall be broken up and sold to independent farmers at reasonable prices to transfer the economic power from the elite landowners and to the people. With new farms, plantations, and even a few voluntary and experimental labor collectives, we will turn this verdant peninsula into the bread basket of Central America."
YUC_Education_Reform:0 "Bring Education to the Masses"
YUC_Education_Reform_desc:0 "With the economy largely situated and with the situation of the landowners resolved, Alvarado has turned his attention towards education reform. Passing laws making education mandatory, secular, and free for all citizens, Alvarado shall uplift the masses. School curriculums shall now be required to focus on literacy, reading, writing, arithmetic, and civic responsibility, with additional supplements and schools being built for studies in agriculture, the fine arts, and other various trades and skills. The crowning jewel of these new schools shall be the Escuela Libre de Derecho, a free academic institution for teaching law, economics, and political science to our nation’s best and brightest, although Alvarado’s darling is the new music conservatory built in the capital. By the end of this plan, we will have created more than 1000 new schools, some of them co-educational, as well as 300 libraries, all to bring the light of knowledge to our free peninsula."
YUC_Control_The_State:0 "Control Yucatán"
YUC_Control_The_State_desc:0 "Our Yucatán has always been a wild and unruly land, but now with Alvarado at the helm, all of that shall hopefully change. Seeking to bring order, discipline, law, and justice to our Peninsula, Alvarado has moved to instill his own martial-minded attitudes into the hearts and minds of the public. We shall temper this state and forge it into a stalwart and orderly realm based on the tenants of true justice and morality - a nation of steel supported by an egalitarian and populist cushion that is Alvarado’s welfare state and liberal reforms."
YUC_SocDem_Junta:0 "A Progressive Dictatorship"
YUC_SocDem_Junta_desc:0 "Long being a student of both European and United States Feminist theory and Socialism, Alavarado has moved to create a truly progressive dictatorship underneath his glove of iron and velvet. Soon, a series of laws aimed at freeing women from their traditional servitude shall be passed, as he had done to the Maya during his term as governor before our independence. Furthermore, the protections on labor will be extended to cover all domestic workers so that all may be protected by the state, while new old age pensions and a new Public Works Office shall also be created."
YUC_Curtail_Fanaticism:0 "Curtail Religious Fanaticism"
YUC_Curtail_Fanaticism_desc:0 "Believing that religious fanaticism and loyalty to the church, rather than the state, is harmful and hampered the development of a modern society, Alvarado has moved to close churches all around the state. Confiscating icons and relics and even removing all members of the Clergy from public offices, Alvarado seeks to bring Secularism to Yucatán by force."
YUC_Centralized_Yucatan:0 "A Yucatán Safe, Secure, and Centralized"
YUC_Centralized_Yucatan_desc:0 "Under General Alvarado, we have built a strong, populist, and progressive state centralized around the capital and the national government. Our Yucatán is one and indivisible, safe under Alvarado’s velvet fist. Now, we shall further progress along this world as we march dutifully towards our prosperous and Socialist-inspired egalitarian future."

YUC_Prohibition:0 "Break Free from Vice"
YUC_Prohibition_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from Alvarado’s old prohibition law, which was once one of the most restrictive in all of Mexico, we have passed a series of new Anti-Vice laws aimed at purifying our peninsula. In-line with the belief spread by Alvarado that vice was particularly hard on women and families, our President has even moved to pass a series of acts outlawing bullfights, drinking, gambling, lotteries, and raffles, even making drunkenness sufficient grounds for divorce. Curiously however, or maybe progressively, [root.getleader] has not moved to criminalize prostitution, but instead has required regular health inspections for prostitutes, with this being paired with new anti-vice legislation aimed to eliminate bordellos and pimps, even fining men who used illegal prostitutes or passed on venereal disease. Overall, we shall make our own view of a moral and sin-free nation under the new president’s undeniable will and direction."
YUC_Exert_Control:0 "An Strong and Moral Judiciary"
YUC_Exert_Control_desc:0 "There can be no peace and stability without a strong concept of the law. We must reform the judicial system of the nation, making it independent from the rest of the state and free to be able to spread true, moral justice without being bogged down by political competition and bias. Only then can we truly be free and secure."

YUC_social_conservatives:0 "Partido Rutinero Yucateco"
YUC_social_conservatives_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Temístocles Correa Gutiérrez, the varied conservatives within the Partido Rutinero Yucateco shall now lead our peninsula away from the liberalizing current pushed in previous administrations. We shall build a moral, protectionist, capitalist haven here in Yucatán, free from the dangerous ideas that have cost us dearly."
YUC_Economic_Protectionism:0 "Economic Protectionism"
YUC_Economic_Protectionism_desc:0 "Our infantile economy must be protected at all costs as we attempt to build our own independent financial systems and markets. We must pursue a policy of trade protectionism by raising tariffs, setting import quotas, and through other means in order to safeguard the value of our goods and the prosperity of our laborers."
YUC_Yucatec_Independence:0 "Entrench Yucatec Nationhood"
YUC_Yucatec_Independence_desc:0 "Our new republic is weak, barely recognized by most of the globe and weak to corrosive influences due to a lack of national cohesion. We must build a united identity for our people to rally behind in order to survive the coming storms. We shall always have our diverse cultures and backgrounds, but they shall be supported and coalesced into the larger Yucatán identity."
YUC_Defense_Against_Radicals:0 "No Room for Radicals"
YUC_Defense_Against_Radicals_desc:0 "Radicalism is a dangerous and corrosive cancer that cannot be allowed within our lands if our new republic is to survive. We must work to eliminate extremism and radicals in all forms, from nationalists and reactionaries  on the Far-Right to Syndicalist revolutionaries on the Far-Left, for only through embracing the center through compromise and cooperation with our fellow republicans can our democracy survive."
YUC_Shining_Democracy:0 "A Functioning Democracy"
YUC_Shining_Democracy_desc:0 "Building a free, fair, and functioning democratic system should be our first priority, for our people have endured enough autocracy and oppression at the hands of our old Mexican masters to last us all an eternity. With electoral safeguards, the elimination of any obstacles such as poll taxes and literacy tests, and the creation of more polling centers to name a few steps, we shall build a shining example of conservative democracy for all of Latin America to behold."
YUC_Reward_Fighters:0 "Reward Caste War Veterans"
YUC_Reward_Fighters_desc:0 "The Caste War - our noble rebellion against the vile Mexicans - has left behind many old veterans within our state, many of whom live in abject poverty as they are left to rot, forgotten by the state that they fought so hard to protect. We shall undo these injustices, and work to compensate these true heroes of Yucatán. With new pensions and benefits, healthcare, and more, we shall uplift these veterans from the dregs of society they have been left to wallow in and give them the hero’s welcome they all truly deserve!"
YUC_Support_Maya:0 "Support the Maya"
YUC_Support_Maya_desc:0 "The Maya peoples have long been the native force behind the Yucatán, living here for thousands of years and making up a large portion of our population. However, past regimes have treated them as animals, forcing them into cultures and systems they do not support against their own will at gunpoint. We shall rectify these mistakes, and move to support the Maya peoples, granting them new freedoms, rights, and autonomy, for we are all fellow children of the Yucatán now."
YUC_Decentralization:0 "A Moral and Decentralized Republic"
YUC_Decentralization_desc:0 "Building a decentralized republic that is safe from corruption and mismanagement is no easy task, but the PRY has managed to do such a feat. Our shining republic is a beacon of Latin American conservatism and moral, anti-Socialist populism for all to behold. The people are free to live as they please, and they rejoice as their voices are finally heard, free from the pressure of an oppressive and dominant national government. Let our Yucatán be free, moral, and safe from tyranny forever more!"

YUC_Staunch_Constitutionalism:0 "Staunch Constitutionalism"
YUC_Staunch_Constitutionalism_desc:0 "We must adhere to the Constitution over any other document or law, for this founding document forms the foundations of our very democratic system. We shall make amendments harder to pass in order to preserve its sanctity and original intent, preventing us from sliding away from the intentions of our founding fathers. The Constitution, modeled on the American and Mexican documents, shall be our guideline and framework for how to handle and build our republic going forward, and we shall always look back to it for guidance."
YUC_Church_Support:0 "Support the Catholic Church"
YUC_Church_Support_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has long been an ally of the people, and with their conservative outlooks lining up with many of our own policies, they are an obvious ally. We shall work with the Church while still supporting Secularism, getting the best of both worlds as we seek to build a moral and prosperous peninsula."

YUC_market_liberals:0 "Partido Liberal Yucateco"
YUC_market_liberals_desc:0 "The last decade has seen a growth in Liberal thought in Yucatán, thanks to the guidance of the revolutionary Salvador Alvarado and his large coalition of Liberals, Progressives, and moderate Socialists. These new democratic thinkers have impressed the people of Mérida with their commitment to liberal freedoms and self-expression, leading to the blossoming of a new market-orientated Liberal Party led by Bernardino Mena Brito. Now, the PLY shall lead our new republic towards the light of Liberal Democracy, supported by responsible Capitalism and the expansion of social freedoms!"
YUC_fair_and_free_market:0 "A Fair and Free Market"
YUC_fair_and_free_market_desc:0 "The Caste System and the Compensaros System are both repressive institutions that stop the free flow of goods and their fair value of human expertise from being realized, and as such they must be repealed. The Partido Liberal has cleared the way for a more democratic and free market, without resorting to dangerous Socialism as the Caudillo did. Now, let our people rejoice as the new profits roll in!"
YUC_Curtail_Alvarado:0 "Curtail Alvarado's Influence"
YUC_Curtail_Alvarado_desc:0 "Though General Alvarado saved our nation and secured our independence, he did so partially by allying with Socialists and other extremists, taking on some of their Red rhetoric as his own. We must work to combat the influence of both Alvarado and these Leftists, for their dangerous ideas cannot be allowed to infect our Liberal and Capitalist democracy."
YUC_business_grants:0 "Business Grants and Economic Injections"
YUC_business_grants_desc:0 "The Business Grant program has begun to run out of funds, and is at risk of defaulting. A solution presented by the President is to create a second administration to serve as an intermediary between investors and business owners. With this new bureau, we shall organize the economy and prevent it from collapsing with tactical buy-outs and stimulus packages along with new avenues for investment so that our economy can take the hits and keep on going to support our people and our markets."
YUC_fiscal_reform:0 "Sweeping Fiscal Reforms"
YUC_fiscal_reform_desc:0 "Our finances have been in shambles since the republic was declared, as our money supply is frozen and with many banks closing their doors. The President has authorized the creation of a centralized, unified Banco Nacional to handle the national money supply, and to restore confidence in the market. Furthermore, we shall restructure our financial system to be more responsible and less prone to inflation and tampering in order to build a stable bedrock for our economy to build off of."
YUC_responsible_budget:0 "A Responsible Budget"
YUC_responsible_budget_desc:0 "In order to ensure the national crisis resolves in our favor, the Banco Nacional has helped the President organize a new national budget. This new budget shall allocate funds to different programs and services that our population truly needs. We will trim the fat and only invest in what is necessary and what we can afford, for the first step towards building a strong and resilient economy is to build a balanced budget."
YUC_foreign_investment:0 "Open Our Doors to Foreign Capital"
YUC_foreign_investment_desc:0 "Just as soon as opportunity presents itself, the global market responds. Entrepreneurs from the North, Europe, and Latin America have already begun to arrive on our shores, requesting business grants and searching for investment opportunities within our newly-opened markets. An offshore account in America has been set up, and advertisements have been taken out in foreign newspapers to attract investment into our new republic. We shall fling open the doors of our economy and our nation to these foreign elites, for on their dollar we shall build a better Yucatán."
YUC_Decentralized_State:0 "The Free and Rich Yucatec Republic"
YUC_Decentralized_State_desc:0 "Under the guidance of Brito and the PLY, we have created a decentralized Capitalist utopia here in Yucatán, supported by sound economic strategies and a staunch dedication to the Free Market and to Liberalism. Now, we shall further ride into the future atop a wave of golden capital and greenback prosperity as we build a fair capitalist haven for all the world to envy."

YUC_press_freedom:0 "Exhaustive Press Freedoms"
YUC_press_freedom_desc:0 "It is important to leverage the artistic and intellectual capacity of the free press, even if it is staffed by one too many revolutionaries. We do not discriminate in that way, so the press of Yucatán shall be free to debate and report on the news and the facts, so long as they do not resort to spreading blatant propaganda and falsehoods."
YUC_liberty_or_death:0 "Libertad o Muerte"
YUC_liberty_or_death_desc:0 "We are committed as a party to the defense of Yucatán and to our hardfought liberties, willing to lay down our lives in order to preserve the paradise we have built. We shall not give up our independence or freedoms, no matter the cost, and shall pursue a policy of militarized liberalism to safeguard such views. Liberty or death forever!"

YUC_social_liberals:0 "Partido Sanjuanista Nacional"
YUC_social_liberals_desc:0 "A coalition of moderate Socialist Democrats, Liberal Republicans, and other like minded liberals in Yucatán have come together in a common goal of self-defense and economic liberalism. Reforming around the core of the Sanjuanista movement that fought for our independence from Mexico, this new Partido Sanjuanista Nacional under Miguel Alonzo Romero shall guide Yucatán towards true and unfettered Social Liberal democracy."
YUC_build_democracy:0 "Strengthen Yucatán’s Democratic Processes"
YUC_build_democracy_desc:0 "Yucatec governing bodies must be judged not on their adherence to tradition, but instead on their adherence to the democratic ideals of the Constitución Política del Estado de Yucatán. A democratic nation-wide Ayuntamiento, along with local organizations and elections, must be ensured so that each and every voice can be heard."
YUC_agricultural_aid:0 "The Agricultural Aid Fund"
YUC_agricultural_aid_desc:0 "Our ailing economy in the aftermath of Black Monday was never treated seriously by the Cuidado. Our cash crop-based economy has begun to collapse, and farmers - unable to adjust to more subsistence farming in a timely manner - have had to default to growing the same, devaluing crops to survive, leading to widespread hunger. An agricultural fund must be made so that we can bail-out farmers who have had bad harvests or suffered other maladies while simultaneously incentivizing the growth of subsistence crops to solve the hunger issue."
YUC_constitutional_review:0 "Constitutional Review"
YUC_constitutional_review_desc:0 "The old Constitution of Yucatan was last rewritten in 1862, and only guaranteed some aspects of the Libreal, Secular republic we envision. A second round of reforms, rewrites, and amendments is necessary to secure the right to culture, education, and prerogative along with the other freedoms and liberties we have come to embrace and espouse. The Constitution can be our guide, but that does not mean it is perfect, and so it must be able to be amended to fit our changing needs."
YUC_Yucatec_Square_Deal:0 "Yucatán's Own Square Deal"
YUC_Yucatec_Square_Deal_desc:0 "Modeled on similar programs practiced or theorized in America and Europe, we shall develop our own ‘Square Deal’ in order to bring a progressive and Liberal welfare system to our nation. Our state shall support those that need it, bringing relief, reform, and recovery to Yucatán as we pursue egalitarian, fair Capitalism."
YUC_New_Republicanism:0 "New Yucatec Republicanism"
YUC_New_Republicanism_desc:0 "We must embrace our own form of Republicanism here, one form-fit to our rural and semi-centralized nature. Separate and distinct from the Hispanisc-Chauvinist forms of republican democracy practiced by the Mexicans and many of our other neighbors, we shall build a republican system that respects the varied voices of all of our people, including the Maya, so that all people may have a say in our government and be proud for having such a freedom. We will become the bastion of cohesive and liberal democracy for all of Central America to behold and attempt to emulate."
YUC_Semi_Centralized_State:0 "The Liberal Torch of the Yucatán"
YUC_Semi_Centralized_State_desc:0 "Guiding the revitalized Sanjuanista movement, the new PSN under President Romero has built Yucatán into a shining liberal beacon for all to behold. Now, we must endeavor to keep these newfound rights and freedoms secure as we build a responsible capitalist democracy here on our isolated and pristine peninsula. "
YUC_maya_tax_breaks:0 "Tax Breaks for the Maya"
YUC_maya_tax_breaks_desc:0 "The heavily taxed Maya villages need relief from their old feudal burdens. Their rights to social prerogative means they also hold their right to a tax regime democratically voted by the Ayuntamiento. All members of the Maya communities shall be given tax breaks and other economic breaks, respecting the realities of their rural and sometimes archaic way of life."

YUC_industralization_import:0 "Imports for Industrialization"
YUC_industralization_import_desc:0 "Outside connections made by our people and business partners living abroad have come back to benefit us, with new industrial toolmaking and smelting equipment being sent over as 'gifts' and tokens of future cooperation. With these initial pieces of heavy machinery, our party can secure an industrial base faster and better than the Socialista ever could."
YUC_economic_interventionism:0 "Economic Interventionism"
YUC_economic_interventionism_desc:0 "It is unfortunate that our economic incentives have not taken to Yucatan as fast as we had hoped. It has been decided by the Ayuntamiento to set up a government administration to teach industrial foundry skills and business management, among other necessary courses, to better prepare the masses for our modernizing economy. Furthermore, we shall intervene in the economy as needed and if necessary in order to maintain an equal and fair playing field for competition. With simple moves, we shall keep the economy ever in check."

YUC_social_democrats:0 "Partido Socialista Obrero"
YUC_social_democrats_desc:0 "A compromise between revolution and evolution, the Partido Socialista Obrero has come out victorious. Led by prominent Leftist Democrat, social activist, and trained medical doctor Hircano Ayuso y O’Horibe, the PSO seeks to bring Socialism to our peninsula in a moderated form, restrained by fair democracy and non-predatory Labor-influenced Capitalism."
YUC_increase_public_spending:0 "Increase Public Spending"
YUC_increase_public_spending_desc:0 "The wealth our capital of Mérida has hoarded from the rest of the peninsula over the years must be put back into the wider economy to help us recover from the revolutionary chaos. We must increase public spending across the board, stimulating the economy and creating jobs along the way until we are back on our feet."
YUC_social_welfare:0 "A Yucateco Welfare State"
YUC_social_welfare_desc:0 "A welfare system like that which Zapata promised the country before he was overthrown will help all of Yucatán, but we shall not make the same mistakes as the Mexicans did. We will build our own welfare state here in order to give the masses a safety net to catch them when times get hard."
YUC_improve_rural_workers:0 "Improve Rural Working Conditions"
YUC_improve_rural_workers_desc:0 "Rural working conditions have been abysmal for decades, with worker injury and mortality rates at a staggeringly high level both within factories and out in the fields. We should evaluate farms and looms with poor living conditions and set standards for workplace safety, especially as we cannot pass laws to end the deeply entrenched system of child labor laws in the Ayuntamiento until we deal with our political obstacles."
YUC_rural_peace:0 "Peace in the Hinterlands"
YUC_rural_peace_desc:0 "Ending the feudal-era family and tribal rivalries that have caused much violence and stagnation in the hinterlands is a major goal of our term. We must ensure the people work towards a common liberation, and not for their own advantage in peonage. We shall achieve social harmony under our new egalitarian and populist system, for it is the only way we can all move forward together."
YUC_Seperate_From_Radicalism:0 "Distance the Party from Radicalism"
YUC_Seperate_From_Radicalism_desc:0 "Due to the fiery nature of our birth and the oppressive system we broke from, radicalism and extremism are alive and well in Yucatán. Though we incorporate some revolutionary ideas, we must distance the party from radicalism as much as possible, so both our reputation and our actual policy and rhetoric don’t become tainted beyond repair."
YUC_Labour_Economy:0 "A Laborite Economy"
YUC_Labour_Economy_desc:0 "Drawing from moderate Laborite principles from America and Europe, we shall build a worker-oriented economy that dances with Leftist thought without fully falling to dangerous Socialism. With strong protections and benefits for our workers, farmers, and laborers, we will build a stronger and more equal economy and industrial sector."
YUC_Centralization_Middle_Ground:0 "The Pink and Progressive Peninsula"
YUC_Centralization_Middle_Ground_desc:0 "Pursuing a policy of Labor economics, moderated Social Democracy, and middle-ground centralization policies with autonomy for our protected minorities, we have built a truly progressive and free Yucatán.

YUC_equal_republic:0 "A Shining Republic for All"
YUC_equal_republic_desc:0 "The citizenship debate that raged within the Ayuntamiento is finally over. All natural born citizens are to be afforded full legal and civil rights, and a easy path towards naturalization is to be established for immigrants wishing to live free in our shining and free peninsula, so long as they prove their loyalty to the state, dedication to our reforms, and work to the betterment of all in our Yucatán."
YUC_no_more_caste_war:0 "Never Another Caste War"
YUC_no_more_caste_war_desc:0 "The Caste System that outlasted the revolution could not survive the republic. We shall ensure that our people never take up arms against injustice within our own lands, creating an egalitarian, caste-less and class-less society for all to enjoy equally. This new Leftist democracy is intended for all citizens to enjoy and find their voice in, so let us make it true!"

YUC_radical_socialists:0 "Partido Socialista del Sureste"
YUC_radical_socialist_desc:0 "The revolution is reborn again in Yucatán under the Partido Socialista del Sureste, and freedom from all castes, including that of capitalism, has now been declared. Led by Felipe Carrillo Puerto, - himself a close associate and political contemporary of General Alvarado - the PSS is poised to bring Socialist egalitarianism and Leftist agrarianism to our peninsula, supported by populism, collectivism, and the expansion of civil freedoms and liberties."
YUC_collectivize_mexican_property:0 "Land Collectivisation"
YUC_collectivize_mexican_property_desc:0 "In order to phase the nation in a Socialist system while also modernizing our agricultural sector, the Feudalistic farming systems that have existed for centuries shall be eradicated. In the place of these estates, the land shall be nationalized and collectivized, hopefully relieving the unemployment issue while improving productivity and efficiency."
YUC_peoples_assemblies:0 "People's Assemblies"
YUC_peoples_assemblies_desc:0 "The Ayuntamiento of Mérida shall be replaced with a wholly democratic Assemblea Popular, no longer subjecting the masses of the nation to the champagne Socialists of the capital.

YUC_agricultural_unions:0 "Agricultural Unions"
YUC_agricultural_unions_desc:0 "We shall create a new bureau within the newly made Assemblea Popular - the new series of assemblies replacing the elitist Ayuntamiento - for Trade and Agricultural Unions.

YUC_memory_of_cruzoob:0 "Memories of Cruzoob"
YUC_memory_of_cruzoob_desc:0 "The Cruzoob Revolution has been disparaged by foolish romanticists and dangerous nationalists for decades.

YUC_Red_Apostle_desc:0 "Standing as the new, Red Apostle of our reforged Yucatán, President Puerto has brought a new wave of teachings and morals for all to follow as if he was one of the Twelve Apostles himself, preaching the good word of a new god - the ‘god’ of Socialist Theory. Detached from the Christian rhetoric that oppressed the bulk of our population for centuries, this new Red Apostle shall guide our Yucatán towards prosperity, morality, freedom, and equality without needing to resort to the venomous lies of religion and blind faith."
YUC_Full_Centralization:0 "Centralization Under Democratic Socialism"
YUC_Full_Centralization_desc:0 "In order to better administer this wild peninsula, a system of Socialist Centralism has been enacted, drawing more and more governmental and political responsibilities out of separate organizations and branches and into the hands of the central administration around the President and the Party. Though we shall not resort to tyranny and authoritarianism, we shall bring all political power within the nation to one organized source so that we may better administer Yucatán and meet the needs of each and every one of our people."

YUC_Secularization:0 "Total Secularism"
YUC_Secularization_desc:0 "Though the morals and teachings of the Catholic Church can be beneficial in some regards, it has no place in any modern government.

YUC_Purge_The_Red_Shirts_desc:0 "The Camisas Rojas of Canabal are a dangerous lot of extremists that masquerade as ‘True Leftists’ while espousing authoritarianism and violence against their political enemies and the Church.

YUC_syndicalists:0 "Partido Sindicalista Obrero Nacional"
YUC_syndicalists_desc:0 "Winning a surprising victory, the Partido Sindicalista Obrero Nacional under Bartolomé García Correa has risen to lead our new republic. The only organized Syndicalist group in Yucatán, the PSON is a splinter group from the larger PSS, and are expected to pursue Orthodox Syndicalist policies based around industrialization, urbanization, and unionism in order to free the proletariat of our peninsula."
YUC_Industrialization:0 "Rapid Industrialization"
YUC_Industrialization_desc:0 "The lands of Yucatán are hardly urbanized or industrialized, with the capital of Mérida and the port-city of Progreso being our only centers of any heavy industry. In order to truly create a Syndicalist system in this rural and jungle-filled peninsula, we are going to have to pursue a policy of rapid industrialization modeled on proposals leveraged by various European Socialist groups."
YUC_Expand_Urban_Centers:0 "Expand Urban Centers"
YUC_Expand_Urban_Centers_desc:0 "With only a few cities to our name, Yucatán is a largely rural nation of villages and communities - a setting unfit for the nourishment of true Syndicalism.

YUC_Yucatec_Unionism_desc:0 "Unions as a concept are largely foreign to our people, with the only unions existing in the capital and other centers of industry, or within the farming industry.

YUC_Start_Talks:0 "Start Peace Talks with Radicals"
YUC_Start_Talks_desc:0 "Though radicalism can be dangerous, it definitely has its uses, for it was radicalism that allowed our revolution to succeed and our republic to be born.

YUC_Red_Nation:0 "Our Red Peninsula"
YUC_Red_Nation_desc:0 "Supported by Syndicalist economics, Socialist politics, and broad Leftist democracy, we have transformed Yucatán into a utopian paradise of crimson and red. Though we still have much work to do in order to fully bring Syndicalism and all of its benefits to this rural land, we have begun to make great strides, with new unions, communes, and other Leftist organizations being erected across the nation both by our government and by our own, eager populace.

Under this system, we shall build our peninsula into the shining crimson jewel of Central America!"

YUC_Anti_Catholic_Laws:0 "Severe Anti-Catholic Laws" 
YUC_Anti_Catholic_Laws_desc:0 "Catholicism and the Church around it have been nothing but a plague upon our population. Catholic ideas drove the Hispanic menace to oppress our people and rob us of our native culture while their Clergy rose to become another powerful and corrupt group of influential elites.

YUC_State_Atheism:0 "Enforce State Atheism"

YUC_totalists_desc:0 "Rising to seize on the chaos after being allowed to work with the interim government, the Camisas Rojas - or Red Shirts - of Tomás Garrido Canabal Yucatán have consolidated their strength and now control the civilian government. Under Canabal, the republic is expected to take a drastically new direction towards authoritarian Yucatecos Totalism, Anti-Theism, and Socialist moralism under a new concept of freedom."

YUC_2_Year_Plan_desc:0 "In a series of consecutive Two Year Plans, we shall rapidly urbanize, industrialize, and militarize the Yucatecos State, bringing modernized prosperity and glory to the people of our peninsula.

YUC_State_Economy_desc:0 "The State and the Party shall come to dominate and dictate every facet of the national economy, down to the most minute details, in order maximize efficiency and productivity as we rocket towards modernity and true Socialism.

### Events ###

yucatan.1.t:0 "The Yucatán Constitution"
yucatan.1.d:0 "In Mérida, the new Yucatán Constitution was signed. While it was modeled on the 1917 Mexican Constitution along with the American Constitution, it also included quite a bit of Maya legal code as well. Moreover it is also a compromise between the various factions within the Yucatecos government to create a cohesive and comprehensive document that all can agree on as we attempt to build our own independent republic here out on our jungle-covered peninsula."
yucatan.1.a:0 "Viva Libre Yucatan!"

yucatan.2.t:0 "The Land Issue"
yucatan.2.d:0 "The issue of Land Reform has been brought up time and time again, but now it shall finally be resolved. Most of the conservatives and non-Leftist liberals suggest supporting small land owners, while the progressives, soft Liberals, and moderate Socialists think we should implement the Georgist idea of a land tax. Alternatively, many radical Leftists and revolutionaries believe that collectivizing the land is the right way to go. What should we do?"
yucatan.2.a:0 "Collectivize the land for the good of the Proletariat."
yucatan.2.b:0 "Implement a Georgist single-tax policy to appease as many as possible."
yucatan.2.c:0 "Support small landholders with the Conservatives."

yucatan.3.t:0 "Dealing with Mexican Spies"
yucatan.3.d:0 "We have recently caught a number of Mexican Spies that were trying to infiltrate our government. The question is what should we do with them. Most moderates believe that we should deport them, while the more brash among us believe that we should just execute the lot of them. Finally, the radicals within our ranks think we should try to turn them to our side, winning them over with shared Revolutionary rhetoric. What shall we decide?"
yucatan.3.a:0 "Execute them."
yucatan.3.b:0 "Deport them."
yucatan.3.c:0 "Try to turn them."

yucatan.5.t:0 "Ally with the Radicals?"
yucatan.5.d:0 "The Camisas Rojas of Tomás Garrido Canabal and the Movimiento Maya of General May Pech have come to command much political influence within the nation, as well as each controlling their own vast and veteran paramilitaries. Though we have long worked with the moderate Socialists to achieve our goals, some within our administration have begun to parrot the idea of aligning with one of these groups. However, with the influence of these radicals growing, we should be cautious lest they try to make a move to fulfill their own ambitions."
yucatan.5.a:0 "The Red Shirts seem like fine allies!"
yucatan.5.b:0 "The Movimiento Maya seem like fine allies!"
yucatan.5.c:0 "Ally with them both! What could possibly go wrong..."
yucatan.5.e:0 "Continue our alliance with the Socialists."

yucatan.6.t:0 "Redshirts Attempt a Coup"
yucatan.6.d:0 "With our decision to ally with the Red Shirts of Canabal, and with our own movement faltering as our moderate Socialist allies flake off to other movements or are mysteriously killed off, our administration has been left vulnerable. Sensing this weakness, General Canabal and his Camisas Rojos have attempted to seize control of the state, surrounding the capital and declaring their intention to topple the government to the wider nation. As our loyalist troops arrive on the scene to combat these extremists, we are unsure if it will be enough to stop the crimson tide."
yucatan.6.a:0 "Canabal seizes control of the State!"
yucatan.6.b:0 "The Red Shirts are beaten back!"

yucatan.7.t:0 "The Face of our New Nation"
yucatan.7.d:0 "With our war for independence finally won and with the dangerous radicals that accosted our liberal movement finally put to rest, the time has come to organize our state and proclaim our new government. It is heavily expected for General Alvarado - hero of the Revolution and Socialist activist in his own right - to be elected as our new President if he does not step down and retire before elections. However, there have been rumors circulating that Alvarado has no plans on keeping his democratic promises, for instead he plots to install his own Red-tinted Military Junta, or so these rumors claim. Whatever the truth may be, we will soon find out as General Alvarado rises to address the nation. "
yucatan.7.a:0 "Alvarado proclaims the republic and is sworn in as our first President."
yucatan.7.b:0 "Alvarado officializes his rule in a Socialist-inspired Military Junta."
yucatan.7.c:0 "Alvarado steps aside as Governor, allowing democratic elections."

yucatan.8.t:0 "The Movimiento Maya Attempts a Coup"
yucatan.8.d:0 "With our decision to ally with the Movimiento Maya of Francisco May Pech, and with our own movement faltering as our moderate Socialist allies flake off to other movements or are mysteriously killed off, our administration has been left vulnerable. Sensing this weakness, General May Pech and his Maya guerillas have attempted to seize control of the state, surrounding the capital and declaring their intention to topple the government to the wider nation. As our loyalist troops arrive on the scene to combat these extremists, we are unsure if it will be enough to stop the nativist tide."
yucatan.8.a:0 "May Pech seizes control of the State!"
yucatan.8.b:0 "The Maya are beaten back!"

yucatan.9.t:0 "The Nation Devolves into Political Infighting"
yucatan.9.d:0 "With our foolish decision to align with both the Red Shirts and the Maya nativists, all out pandemonium has broken out in the capital as Maya guerrillas combat Red Shirt paramilitaries in a fight for the soul of Yucatán. With our own loyalists and forces far too outnumbered to stand in the way, it would seem that the republican dream is well and truly dead. Now, all that is left to do is to sit and wait and see which group of violent extremists - the Totalist Camisas Rojos of Canabal or the nationalist Moveimiento Maya of General May Pech - will come out on top."
yucatan.9.a:0 "In the chaos, May Pech seizes power!"

Some fear that the Maya People could make stronger demands for representation, while others fear that the Maya people could begin an uprising against the Government. The Chan Santa Cruz war is still fresh in the minds of many Maya people, and some are suggesting that the Maya People of Yucatán engage in an uprising to take the oppressive government down and reclaim the legacy of their powerful ancestors. If they should succeed, then the Dream of Cruzoob will have finally come true. "

Many in the Yucatán thought that the Caste War had ended, but with the sudden rebellion, that hope is dashed. Now, without Mexico on our side, we are alone in this conflict. With the rebellion quickly spreading outwards from Quintana Roo, the Yucatecos Government and High Command have legitimate fears. If the Maya were to win, then they would have finally fulfilled their dream of having an independent Maya state for the first time in almost 500 years. "

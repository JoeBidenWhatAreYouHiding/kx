YUC_press_freedom:0 "Press Freedom"

Some fear that the Maya People could make stronger demands for representation, while others fear that the Maya people could begin an uprising against the Government. The Chan Santa Cruz war is still fresh in the minds of many Maya people, and some are suggesting that the Maya People of Yucatan engage in an uprising to take the oppressive government down and reclaim the legacy of the Mayan Empire. If they should succeed, then the Dream of Cruzoob will have finally come true. "

Many in the Yucatan thought that the Caste War had ended, but with the sudden rebellion, that hope is dashed. Now, without Mexico on our side, we are alone in this conflict. And with the rebellion quickly spreading outwards from Quintana Roo; the Yucatec Government and High Command have legitimate fears. If the Maya were to win, then they would have finally fulfilled their dream of having an independent Maya state for the first time in almost 500 years. "

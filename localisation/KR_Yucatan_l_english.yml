YUC_defense_of_yucatan:0 "The Yucatán Rebellion"
YUC_defense_of_yucatan_desc:0 "Breaking free from Mexican tyranny as they further encroached on our rights and our freedoms, our Yucatán now stands free, but with our backs against the sea and with the Mexican barbarians at the gate, our future is as uncertain as ever. With the hero of our rebellion - General Salvador Alvarado Rubio - at the helm of our provisional government leading a Syndicalist-aligned Junta, our nation and our people are ready to dig in and hold on against any threat as we attempt to solidify our new position and secure Yucatán’s independence. The horrors of the Caste War and Mexico’s atrocities following their Revolution shall be avenged, and the people of Yucatán will finally have their freedom!"
YUC_division:0 "An Infantile Nation Divided"
YUC_division_desc:0 "With General Alvarado guiding the nation and with independence figures like Francisco May Pech and Felipe Carrillo Puerto at his side, our new provisional regime is slowly attempting to achieve what no other government that has ruled over the Yucatán has been able to achieve - harmonious federalism. From our three constituent states of Quintana Roo, (North) Yucatán, and Campeche, the Alvarado regime is trying to establish our new Yucatec state as a semi-Federalist Republic that allows fair and free democratic elections and autonomy to its constituent states and varied minorities. However, this dream is still a long way off, for the various political forces within our nation each have their own views of how this union should look, and many more obstacles still stand in the way of Yucatán unity."
YUC_unclear_identity:0 "Nebulous National Identity"
YUC_unclear_identity_desc:0 "Not since the Maya state of Chan Santa Cruz that rose in Quintana Roo in 1849 and fell in 1915 has there existed an independent state on the Yucatán, and even that noble attempt at sovereignty was snuffed out before it could spread past our Southern coast. For centuries, the Hispanic Euro-Mexicans have eroded any sense of native identity and autonomism that they could, and as such, the varied peoples of our peninsula have only the loosest sense of a united ‘Yucateco’ identity. We must solidify what it means to be a true child of the Yucatán, whatever that may come to be in the future, for without a united national identity, we will surely be swallowed up by the Mexican hordes once again!"
YUC_unclear_economy:0 "Uncertain Economic Future"
YUC_unclear_economy_desc:0 "The various political forces within our nation all have competing and opposing views for how the new national economy should be organized. Our peninsula is largely dominated by agrarian pursuits, with only the most basic signs of industrialization being recognizable in large cities like Mérida and Cancun, though we do possess some safe ports ideal for trade. With bickering Socialists, Capitalists, Traditionalists, and Corporatists all having their own ‘perfect’ plan on how to put our economy on the right track, our economic future is at a crossroads, and a direction must be taken soon lest our economy collapse before it can even be truly built."
YUC_radicalism_idea:0 "Radical Political Scene"
YUC_radicalism_idea_desc:0 "From the Red Shirts of Tomás Garrido Canabal to the Maya fanatics and Cruzoob zealots of Francisco May Pech, many radical groups from across the spectrum vie for control over our Yucatán. With democratic elements and the masses caught in the middle, and with the Red General Alvarado trying to keep the peace under his populist, Socialist-influenced Junta, our Yucatán finds itself being torn apart from within by domestic extremism despite our perilous and precarious position isolated on this peninsula and in flippant disregard to the Mexican wolves prowling at our borders. It is only a matter of time before this unstable situation comes to head, and what Yucatán will look like in the aftermath is anyone’s guess, but that has not stopped every party, paramilitary, and radical group in the nation from preparing for their moment to strike."

### Opinions ###

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_ALVORADO_DESC:0 "The Red General of the Yucatán, Salvador Alvarado Rubio is the protector of the Yucatecos and the main instigator of our rebellion from Mexico. Born in 1880 in Sinaloa, Alvarado is no native to our peninsula, but he has come to be a true man of Yucatán all the same. After a childhood spent constantly moving around northern Mexico with his family, and after a short career as pharmacist, he entered politics. He joined the Partido Liberal Mexicano in 1906, and later the Anti-Reelectionist Party, to oppose the Porfiriato. Nearly getting caught by Díaz’s forces after breaking into a military camp and assaulting federal soldiers with a group of young firebrands, Alvarado fled to the Yanqui state of Arizona. He would eventually return to Mexico after joining up with a exile volunteer army in Texas that swore to help Madero topple Díaz’s regime, crossing the Rio Grande and aiding in overthrowing the tyrant. With Díaz ousted, others rose to challenge Madero, and the cascading events that would kick start the Mexican Revolution came to pass. With constantly shifting sides, the messy Revolution persisted for years, but Alvarado stuck through it all while his new allies and life-long interest in social justice, feminism, and Socialist thought drove him further towards the Left. As the Revolution came to a close, Alvarado found himself on the winning side, and in recognition of his talent, he was sent to the Yucatán Peninsula to serve as its new governor. It was here that the Red General was exposed to the plight of the locals, witnessing firsthand the terror that the Mexican government inflicted upon the Yucatecos. It was these experiences that would come to shift his loyalties, further driving him into the arms of Socialism, and slowly he fell in with various Yucatán seperatist groups. Spending many years in Yucatán well after his term as governor passed, Alvarado kept close ties with key independence figures, and after the rise of anti-Yucatec policies within the Mexican government once again, the Red General and his allies finally snapped. Organizing a new Yucatán Rebellion, Alvarado broke from the chains of Mexico and now attempts to secure Yucatec sovereignty. Commanding the nation as a benevolent strongman at the forefront of his military junta, this Crimson Caudillo is prepared to be the red velvet-handed autocrat the people of Yucatán both need and deserve."
POLITICS_ELVIA_PUERTO_DESC:0 "Sister to the slain President Felipe, Elvia Carrillo Puerto now leads the Third Yucatán Republic along much the same path that her brother planned to walk before being assassinated. A committed Socialist and Feminist like her brother, Elvia has a long history in Leftist politics in Yucatán, being one of the first three women representatives elected into the Yucatec Congress in 1923 as a member of the Partido Socialista del Sureste. Since then, she has fought to bring the Revolution to our peninsula, supporting Socialist Agrarianism, collectivization, egalitarianism, and other standard Socialist policies, while also greatly stressing the importance of the woman’s role in the Revolution. Plagued by death, she has lost both her brother to a Red Shirt assassin and her husband to Cristero rebels, but no matter what obstacles are raised in front of her, Elvia has smashed them down all the same. A sworn Yuecatec patriot and a wise, rational leader, Elvia Carrillo Puerto will bring an equal and fair paradise to this peninsula as she leads Yucatán as its first woman executive."
POLITICS_CANABAL_DESC:0 "Tomás Garrido Canabal, an outsider from the haciendas of Chiapas and born in 1891, came to Yucatan by way of the Revolution. Named interim governor of Tabasco, Cannibal’s rule was highlighted by heavy-handed enforcement of local laws and a vendetta against the Church. Many of the local clergy of Tabasco were either killed or forced to flee. His rule saw the complete ban of alcohol, corsets, and tombstones, amongst other things; Canabal also supported the social development of the state via agriculture and the right for women to vote. He quickly became one of the faces of anti-clericalism in the Revolution, siding with Plutarco Calles’s policies and campaigns against the Cristeros, and Canabal’s Camisas Rojas were founded on this basis of the terrorization of Roman Catholics. Now, with the whole Peninsula under his control, it’s clear that Canabal will continue his anti-cleric vendetta, just on a larger scale."
POLITICS_FELIPE_PUERTO_DESC:0 "Bona fide native of Yucatan, Felipe Puerto, was born in the town of Motul in 1874, located less than 50 kilometers from Merida. A native speaker of Mayathan, Puerto began his adulthood as a writer for El Heraldo de Motul, a paper which, under his influence, shifted to more socialist views. He championed land reform and indigenous rights, and El Heraldo was taken down briefly for criticizing public officials. Puerto participated in the Revista de Merida as a reporter until taking his seat as the Governor of Yucatan in 1922. With the authority of the Yucatan government, Puerto confiscated large estates to return to the Maya and undermined a large education overhaul, overseeing the opening of more than 400 schools in Yucatan. With the victory of the Yucatan revolt, Puerto no longer has to make overtures to the seat of power in the North – he can bring the future to Yucatan as he sees fit."
POLITICS_FRANSCISO_MAY_DESC:0 "Francisco May Pech, the last General of the Caste War, has avenged his late comrades and has restored the Yucatán peninsula to the rule of his Maya brethren. A proud warrior, May was born in 1884, and became a corporal of the Mayan rebels before he reached the age of eighteen, and upon the death of Felipe Yam, Pech declared himself the Supreme Chief of Mayan Armies. As the regime of Porfirio Díaz came to an end, Salvador Alvarado took control of Yucatec Armies, and ordered his soldiers to leave the Chan Santa Cruz and hand command over to the Maya, transferring complete control of the region to them once again. Upon the conclusion of the Mexican Revolution, May returned command of his territory; and in exchange was given important concessions including the right to exploit the Yucatán's valuable supply of gum trees.\n\n May's power begun to falter in the years to follow, as many Mayan Chiefs began to distrust him. Upon the Election of Zapata May was expelled from the region of Chan Santa Cruz, and was forced to settle in Oxkutzkab.\n\n May's second chance at power came at the Military overthrow of the Mexican State, where in the days to follow the coup May rallied his fellow Maya soldiers against the Military Regime and the Goldshirts, joining Alvarado as he declared Yucatán an independent territory; and eventually succeeding the Red General as he fell from grace. Now, with this aged Caste War veteran in firm control of the peninsula, a revival of Maya culture is expected, however the exact form of this revival is disputed. Will General May return to his roots of the Catholic-Mayan Chan Santa Cruz Rebellion, or will he embrace the true, pre-colonia roots of the Maya civilization?"

YUC_yucatec_democracy_desc:0 "For the last seventy years, the Yucatec have fought for democratic representation by the Cuidado. The imposition of Hispanidad and La Raza policies by the Mexican government pushed us over the edge and sparked our fiery revolt that has now led to our own independent state. We shall never submit to foreign oppressors and dictators of any kind ever again, for the Yucatán is finally free!"

YUC_maya_victory:0 "Triumph of the Maya"
YUC_maya_victory_desc:0 "The rule of the Hispanic bastards has come to an end! The Maya people have rallied around General Francisco May Pech, and with a reinvigorated nativist spirit, they have pushed the Mexicans out of Yucatán and have declared that Maya civilization is not dead! Avenging the Caste War and calling for a new rebirth of Maya culture, language, society, Francisco May Pech shall punish the Spanish Colonizers and exact our revenge as we revive our repressed identity to old glories and beyond. "

YUC_ode_to_sacrafice:0 "Anti-Hispanicism"
YUC_ode_to_sacrafice_desc:0 "While many people in this great nation are of rightful Maya descent, others still speak the tongue of the Spaniards! This fact and the further existence of a distinct Spanish identity in our Yucatán is something that is simply unacceptable! Harsh laws against Spanish language and culture shall be implemented, for we shall reflect hundreds of years of oppression back at them."
YUC_remember_the_castle_war:0 "Remember the Caste War"
YUC_remember_the_castle_war_desc:0 "The Caste War of Yucatán officially lasted from 1847 to 1901, but our brave patriots and freedom fighters have kept the fight alive well into the 1930’s, never giving up the struggle and finally winning our Maya people their deserved independence after decades of fighting and centuries of oppression. Now, with our freedom secured and our new state being consolidated, it is time to honor the dead and remember their sacrifices, as well as the sacrifices of other fighters in our history like us such as Jacinto Canek and Tecun Uman, while also preparing for the inevitable return of war. War memorials and monuments shall be built around the nation, and funds will be created to compensate our fighters’ families and their widows, while simultaneously our state will build new bunkers at our borders and ammunition stores in our hinterlands to prepare for Europeans and their likely retaliation."
YUC_death_to_european_mexico:0 "Death to 'Latin' America"
YUC_death_to_european_mexico_desc:0 "The region we have lived in for millennia has come to be known as ‘Latin’ America - a stain on our land that both denies our existence and belittles our culture and impact on these lands.

YUC_chan_santa_cruz:0 "Chan Santa Cruz Avenged"
YUC_chan_santa_cruz_desc:0 "The old state of Chan Santa Cruz was the center of a syncretic religious movement that combined Maya culture with the Catholic faith while fighting for Maya independence on the Yucatán. Their short-lived fiefdom centered on our Eastern coast was the last independent indigenous Maya state to exist, finally dying out after the formal end of the Caste War in 1915. With the success of Francisco May Pech’s movement and with his formal proclamation upholding the ideas and tenets of the Cruzoobian state, it would seem that the fall of Chan Santa Cruz has finally been avenged. Long live the independent Maya people, long live Cruzoob!"
YUC_cruzoob_faith:0 "The Cruzoob Faith"
YUC_cruzoob_faith_desc:0 "The Cruzoob faith, also known as the Cult of the Talking Cross, is a syncretic religion mixing ancient Maya faith with Catholic tenets, forming a synthesis of European and Mesoamerican ideas entirely form-fitted to suit the spiritual needs of the modern Maya. Holding several old Maya texts, the Maya calendar, Maya chants and traditional music, herbalist tomes, and other aged facets of Maya spirituality in high regard, this faith revolves around the cosmic calendar, Christian morals, and a pantheon of Mesoamerican gods, with many being mixed with Christian figures and with the main god - K’u - being a mix of the Christian God and the old Maya god of creation. May Pech himself is an ardent believer in the faith, and now shall make all the Yucatán practice this one, true faith as well."
YUC_mayan_catholicism:0 "Total Maya-Catholic Syncretism"
YUC_mayan_catholicism_desc:0 "Taking the syncretism of the Cruzoob religion to a whole new level, May Pech has moved to fully combine the two faiths. Christian faith on its own has been banned, with only Cruzoob and other native faiths being allowed in the state. Furthermore, all Catholic Churches in the nation have been taken over and begun to be transformed into shrines for our many gods. More Christian tenets have been adopted and adapted to fit the needs and beliefs of our people, and the two religions have truly become one here in Yucatán. Under May Pech, this new fully unified faith shall be the glue that binds our nation and people together, and be the shield that protects us from the colonizers."

YUC_new_ajaw_desc:0 "The old Maya Civilization lasted for thousands of years, never centralizing but prospering until it finally collapsed under the Spanish in 1697 after centuries of decline, being lost to time as the Maya people were forced to integrate into Spanish-Mexican society. However, with the success of General Francisco May Pech, this late, great civilization can once again breathe life! A new noble class of lower ahau - or leaders - has been crowned, consisting of May Pech and his closest allies, as well as the most prominent figures in Yucatán that would swear loyalty to May Pech and this new state. These new ahau shall each lead a city or settlement, helping our new national father guide the nation on this path of total Maya restorationism."

For centuries before our resurgence, our culture and language rotted under Hispanicism. But now, as the Maya people rise from the mud and take the fate of their people and our Yucatán back into our grasp, our culture can flourish again! No longer shall the Spanish and the Mexicans and the fools of Central America sully the splendor of the Maya.

YUC_neo_maya_desc:0 "With Maya culture and religion spreading throughout Yucatán and with our restored Mayan language taking root, Maya civilization has truly returned to this Earth after being nearly eradicated by the Spanish. Now, Francisco May Pech has finally announced his ultimate ambition. Rising as the K'uhul Ahau - or ‘Divine Leader’ - and taking the regal name K'inich Janaab Pakal IV after the original Pakal the Great - the longest reigning monarch of the New World and the greatest Mayan Ahau and his descendents, Francisco May Pech is no more. Now, Pakal IV will reign as the K'uhul Ahau of our resurgent Maya state, hell bent on a path to create the first Maya Empire."

YUC_primitive_land_desc:0 "Following principles started by our ancestors, we shall work the land just as they did - albeit using modern practices and technologies mixed with traditional methods and knowledge. Slash and burn agriculture, farming plot cycling, and jungle clearing for land development shall become key tools of the state to build up our new Maya civilization. Old Maya architecture will make a resurgence, and old crafts and practices utilized by the laborers and farmers among our ancestors will be utilized to their peak efficiency. We will perfect the methods of the past and build a new Maya state without losing sight of tradition."

By devoting large portions of the land to growing cash crops, we shall entice our friends across the Pacific and across the New World to buy our goods, and the rest of our arable land will go to food production and ranching to feed our growing populace. We will build a new, self-sufficient, and prosperous economy off the backs of our noble farmers, and we shall compensate and provide for these economic heroes, for our agricultural workers are the backbone of the nation."

However, for the first phase of our consolidation of the Maya people, we shall proceed to conquer the secondary homeland of our people - Guatemala and Belize!

YUC_reintergrate_the_empire_desc:0 "Now that the old heartlands of the fallen Maya civilization of Yucatán have been reclaimed, we can begin the process of undoing the damages caused by the Europeans. The city states of our ancestors have finally been united under one banner for the first time in history, and now Francisco May Pech moves to centralize the power of these constituent city states away from their local appointed Ahau and into his own hands in order to build a strong and stable Maya state, and perhaps something more."

YUC_the_empire_breathes_again_desc:0 "Our righteous and once-dead civilization has been reclaimed, with the old lands of the Maya from Mexico to Honduras and beyond within our grasp. For the first time in history, the Maya people have been united under one banner - a banner of their own, and not of some colonizing power. We have finally restored the legacy of Pakal the Great and the original Maya civilization, and now, under K'uhul Ahau K'inich Janaab Pakal IV, the first Maya Empire shall rise from the ashes of colonialism and imperialist oppression. Long live the Maya, long live Pakal IV!"

YUC_wipe_out_european_mexico_desc:0 "Mesoamerica has been struck by and infected with a virulent disease. The centerpiece of this European-derived plague is the foul wasteland that is Mexico, where these foul Hispanics lord over our Tzotzil and Tzeltal brothers who live in the highlands of Chiapas and Tabasco. From the time of the Mexica and Aztec Empire to the modern day, we have warred with the inhabitants of Mexico City. It is finally time to put this centuries-old struggle to an end. We march to Tenochtitlan to restore a truly native Mesoamerica!"
YUC_flower_wars:0 "The New Flower Wars"
YUC_flower_wars_desc:0 "To the South lies the lands of Central America - the old stomping ground of the Maya people. This blood bowl is where we used to wage our flower wars - wars fought between city states, settlements, and tribes in order to maintain the balance of power between Mesoamerican civilization while also gathering slaves for use in ritual sacrifices and for labor. We shall restart this tradition, marching into Central America in order to tame these wild lands and to bring about a new era of internal flower wars to expand our empire and to rejuvenate our culture."

YUC_join_co_prosperity_sphere_desc:0 "Far to the East lies one of the greatest non-Western powers on Earth - the Empire of Japan. Fiercely anti-European and determined to build their own place in the sun free from Western entanglement, they would be the perfect ally for our fledgling state. We shall reach out to the Land of the Rising Sun with diplomatic overtures and gifts in order to win over the Emperor and his government so that we may be allowed into the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Together, we shall fight Western and European influence wherever it may spring up."

YUC_Purge_Red_Shirts:0 "Destroy the Red Shirts"
YUC_Purge_Red_Shirts_desc:0 "The vile Red Shirts of Canabal are a stain upon our Yucatán and a thorn in the side of our regime. This obstacle to our total control and this vile source of Socialist influence must be eradicated in order to secure our new regime. We march into the jungles of Yucatán to eradicate these crimson guerillas once and for all!"
YUC_Fortify_Yucatan:0 "Fortify the Yucatán"
YUC_Fortify_Yucatan_desc:0 "Our Yucatán sits in an easily-defensible position, surrounded by natural barriers and pressed up against the Mexican Gulf behind thick jungles and rugged terrain. We shall use this to our advantage, turning Yucatán into a living fortress. From within this dense hive of bunkers, trenches, tunnels, and thicket, we shall hold out and defend our Yucatán against any and every foe. Our regime shall not fall to outside forces until they kill every last one of us and ground our expansive defenses to dust!"

YUC_authoritarian_democrats_desc:0 "The man who led our nation to independence and who tried to shield us from Mexican aggression during his time as Governor, Salvador Alvarado secured his rule over the Yucatán. Now, with our revolution successful, this Red-tinted and populist general shall lead our nation towards progressive humanism and Laborist principles under his velvet-lined iron fist."
YUC_Labor_Economics:0 "Laborist Economics"
YUC_Labor_Economics_desc:0 "Seeking to implement his long-supported reforms now that he no longer has to answer to Mexico City, President Alvarado has begun to enact these needed changes to our society. Organizing the Casa del Obrero Mundial, or House of the World Worker, to encourage unionization and political participation, Alvarado has also passed a slew of new legislation aimed to establish a welfare state, including minimum wages, maximum working hours, minimum working standards, accident compensation, child regulations, and the right to strike, as well as prohibiting employers from forcing their religious beliefs on workers. With these Laborist principles and more, we shall build a shining pink pearl here in Yucatán."
YUC_Agrarianism:0 "Yucatec Agrarianism"
YUC_Agrarianism_desc:0 "Embracing our rural realities and the Yucatec legacy of agrarianism and farming in this jungle paradise, Alvarado has pushed to expand the agricultural sector massively in order to become the foundation of our modernized industry and economy. Large estates shall be broken up and sold to independent farmers at reasonable prices to transfer the economic power from the elite landowners and to the people. With new farms, plantations, and even a few voluntary and experimental labor collectives, we will turn this verdant peninsula into the bread basket of Central America."
YUC_Education_Reform:0 "Bring Education to the Masses"
YUC_Education_Reform_desc:0 "With the economy largely situated and with the situation of the landowners resolved, Alvarado has turned his attention towards education reform. Passing laws making education mandatory, secular, and free for all citizens, Alvarado shall uplift the masses. School curriculums shall now be required to focus on literacy, reading, writing, arithmetic, and civic responsibility, with additional supplements and schools being built for studies in agriculture, the fine arts, and other various trades and skills. The crowning jewel of these new schools shall be the Escuela Libre de Derecho, a free academic institution for teaching law, economics, and political science to our nation’s best and brightest, although Alvarado’s darling is the new music conservatory built in the capital. By the end of this plan, we will have created more than 1000 new schools, some of them co-educational, as well as 300 libraries, all to bring the light of knowledge to our free peninsula."
YUC_Control_The_State:0 "Control Yucatán"
YUC_Control_The_State_desc:0 "Our Yucatán has always been a wild and unruly land, but now with Alvarado at the helm, all of that shall hopefully change. Seeking to bring order, discipline, law, and justice to our Peninsula, Alvarado has moved to instill his own martial-minded attitudes into the hearts and minds of the public. We shall temper this state and forge it into a stalwart and orderly realm based on the tenets of true justice and morality - a nation of steel supported by an egalitarian and populist cushion that is Alvarado’s welfare state and liberal reforms."
YUC_SocDem_Junta:0 "A Progressive Dictatorship"
YUC_SocDem_Junta_desc:0 "Long being a student of both European and United States Feminist theory and Socialism, Alavarado has moved to create a truly progressive dictatorship underneath his glove of iron and velvet. Soon, a series of laws aimed at freeing women from their traditional servitude shall be passed, as he had done to the Maya during his term as governor before our independence. Furthermore, the protections on labor will be extended to cover all domestic workers so that all may be protected by the state, while new old age pensions and a new Public Works Office shall also be created."
YUC_Curtail_Fanaticism:0 "Curtail Religious Fanaticism"
YUC_Curtail_Fanaticism_desc:0 "Believing that religious fanaticism and loyalty to the church, rather than the state, is harmful and hampered the development of a modern society, Alvarado has moved to close churches all around the state. Confiscating icons and relics and even removing all members of the Clergy from public offices, Alvarado seeks to bring Secularism to Yucatán by force."
YUC_Centralized_Yucatan:0 "A Yucatán Safe, Secure, and Centralized"
YUC_Centralized_Yucatan_desc:0 "Under General Alvarado, we have built a strong, populist, and progressive state centralized around the capital and the national government. Our Yucatán is one and indivisible, safe under Alvarado’s velvet fist. Now, we shall further progress along this world as we march dutifully towards our prosperous and Socialist-inspired egalitarian future."

YUC_Prohibition:0 "Break Free from Vice"
YUC_Prohibition_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from Alvarado’s old prohibition law, which was once one of the most restrictive in all of Mexico, we have passed a series of new Anti-Vice laws aimed at purifying our peninsula. In-line with the belief spread by Alvarado that vice was particularly hard on women and families, our President has even moved to pass a series of acts outlawing bullfights, drinking, gambling, lotteries, and raffles, even making drunkenness sufficient grounds for divorce. Curiously however, or maybe progressively, [root.getleader] has not moved to criminalize prostitution, but instead has required regular health inspections for prostitutes, with this being paired with new anti-vice legislation aimed to eliminate bordellos and pimps, even fining men who used illegal prostitutes or passed on venereal disease. Overall, we shall make our own view of a moral and sin-free nation under the new president’s undeniable will and direction."
YUC_Exert_Control:0 "An Strong and Moral Judiciary"
YUC_Exert_Control_desc:0 "There can be no peace and stability without a strong concept of the law.

Only then can we truly be free and secure."

YUC_social_conservatives:0 "Partido Rutinero Yucateco"
YUC_social_conservatives_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Temístocles Correa Gutiérrez, the varied conservatives within the Partido Rutinero Yucateco shall now lead our peninsula away from the liberalizing current pushed in previous administrations.

YUC_Economic_Protectionism:0 "Economic Protectionism"
YUC_Economic_Protectionism_desc:0 "Our infantile economy must be protected at all costs as we attempt to build our own independent financial systems and markets.

YUC_Yucatec_Independence:0 "Entrench Yucatec Nationhood"
YUC_Yucatec_Independence_desc:0 "Our new republic is weak, barely recognized by most of the globe and weak to corrosive influences due to a lack of national cohesion. We must build a united identity for our people to rally behind in order to survive the coming storms. We shall always have our diverse cultures and backgrounds, but they shall be supported and coalesced into the larger Yucatán identity."
YUC_Defense_Against_Radicals:0 "No Room for Radicals"
YUC_Defense_Against_Radicals_desc:0 "Radicalism is a dangerous and corrosive cancer that cannot be allowed within our lands if our new republic is to survive. We must work to eliminate extremism and radicals in all forms, from nationalists and reactionaries  on the Far-Right to Syndicalist revolutionaries on the Far-Left, for only through embracing the center through compromise and cooperation with our fellow republicans can our democracy survive."
YUC_Shining_Democracy:0 "A Functioning Democracy"
YUC_Shining_Democracy_desc:0 "Building a free, fair, and functioning democratic system should be our first priority, for our people have endured enough autocracy and oppression at the hands of our old Mexican masters to last us all an eternity. With electoral safeguards, the elimination of any obstacles such as poll taxes and literacy tests, and the creation of more polling centers to name a few steps, we shall build a shining example of conservative democracy for all of Latin America to behold."
YUC_Reward_Fighters:0 "Reward Caste War Veterans"
YUC_Reward_Fighters_desc:0 "The Caste War - our noble rebellion against the vile Mexicans - has left behind many old veterans within our state, many of whom live in abject poverty as they are left to rot, forgotten by the state that they fought so hard to protect. We shall undo these injustices, and work to compensate these true heroes of Yucatán. With new pensions and benefits, healthcare, and more, we shall uplift these veterans from the dregs of society they have been left to wallow in and give them the hero’s welcome they all truly deserve!"
YUC_Support_Maya:0 "Support the Maya"
YUC_Support_Maya_desc:0 "The Maya peoples have long been the native force behind the Yucatán, living here for thousands of years and making up a large portion of our population. However, past regimes have treated them as animals, forcing them into cultures and systems they do not support against their own will at gunpoint. We shall rectify these mistakes, and move to support the Maya peoples, granting them new freedoms, rights, and autonomy, for we are all fellow children of the Yucatán now."
YUC_Decentralization:0 "A Moral and Decentralized Republic"
YUC_Decentralization_desc:0 "Building a decentralized republic that is safe from corruption and mismanagement is no easy task, but the PRY has managed to do such a feat. Our shining republic is a beacon of Latin American conservatism and moral, anti-Socialist populism for all to behold. The people are free to live as they please, and they rejoice as their voices are finally heard, free from the pressure of an oppressive and dominant national government. Let our Yucatán be free, moral, and safe from tyranny forever more!"

YUC_Staunch_Constitutionalism:0 "Staunch Constitutionalism"
YUC_Staunch_Constitutionalism_desc:0 "We must adhere to the Constitution over any other document or law, for this founding document forms the foundations of our very democratic system. We shall make amendments harder to pass in order to preserve its sanctity and original intent, preventing us from sliding away from the intentions of our founding fathers. The Constitution, modeled on the American and Mexican documents, shall be our guideline and framework for how to handle and build our republic going forward, and we shall always look back to it for guidance."
YUC_Church_Support:0 "Support the Catholic Church"
YUC_Church_Support_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has long been an ally of the people, and with their conservative outlooks lining up with many of our own policies, they are an obvious ally.

YUC_market_liberals:0 "Partido Liberal Yucateco"
YUC_market_liberals_desc:0 "The last decade has seen a growth in Liberal thought in Yucatán, thanks to the guidance of the revolutionary Salvador Alvarado and his large coalition of Liberals, Progressives, and moderate Socialists. These new democratic thinkers have impressed the people of Mérida with their commitment to liberal freedoms and self-expression, leading to the blossoming of a new market-orientated Liberal Party led by Bernardino Mena Brito. Now, the PLY shall lead our new republic towards the light of Liberal Democracy, supported by responsible Capitalism and the expansion of social freedoms!"
YUC_fair_and_free_market:0 "A Fair and Free Market"
YUC_fair_and_free_market_desc:0 "The Caste System and the Compensaros System are both repressive institutions that stop the free flow of goods and their fair value of human expertise from being realized, and as such they must be repealed. The Partido Liberal has cleared the way for a more democratic and free market, without resorting to dangerous Socialism as the Caudillo did. Now, let our people rejoice as the new profits roll in!"
YUC_Curtail_Alvarado:0 "Curtail Alvarado's Influence"
YUC_Curtail_Alvarado_desc:0 "Though General Alvarado saved our nation and secured our independence, he did so partially by allying with Socialists and other extremists, taking on some of their Red rhetoric as his own. We must work to combat the influence of both Alvarado and these Leftists, for their dangerous ideas cannot be allowed to infect our Liberal and Capitalist democracy."
YUC_business_grants:0 "Business Grants and Economic Injections"
YUC_business_grants_desc:0 "The Business Grant program has begun to run out of funds, and is at risk of defaulting. A solution presented by the President is to create a second administration to serve as an intermediary between investors and business owners. With this new bureau, we shall organize the economy and prevent it from collapsing with tactical buy-outs and stimulus packages along with new avenues for investment so that our economy can take the hits and keep on going to support our people and our markets."
YUC_fiscal_reform:0 "Sweeping Fiscal Reforms"
YUC_fiscal_reform_desc:0 "Our finances have been in shambles since the republic was declared, as our money supply is frozen and with many banks closing their doors. The President has authorized the creation of a centralized, unified Banco Nacional to handle the national money supply, and to restore confidence in the market. Furthermore, we shall restructure our financial system to be more responsible and less prone to inflation and tampering in order to build a stable bedrock for our economy to build off of."
YUC_responsible_budget:0 "A Responsible Budget"
YUC_responsible_budget_desc:0 "In order to ensure the national crisis resolves in our favor, the Banco Nacional has helped the President organize a new national budget. This new budget shall allocate funds to different programs and services that our population truly needs. We will trim the fat and only invest in what is necessary and what we can afford, for the first step towards building a strong and resilient economy is to build a balanced budget."
YUC_foreign_investment:0 "Open Our Doors to Foreign Capital"
YUC_foreign_investment_desc:0 "Just as soon as opportunity presents itself, the global market responds. Entrepreneurs from the North, Europe, and Latin America have already begun to arrive on our shores, requesting business grants and searching for investment opportunities within our newly-opened markets. An offshore account in America has been set up, and advertisements have been taken out in foreign newspapers to attract investment into our new republic. We shall fling open the doors of our economy and our nation to these foreign elites, for on their dollar we shall build a better Yucatán."
YUC_Decentralized_State:0 "The Free and Rich Yucatec Republic"
YUC_Decentralized_State_desc:0 "Under the guidance of Brito and the PLY, we have created a decentralized Capitalist utopia here in Yucatán, supported by sound economic strategies and a staunch dedication to the Free Market and to Liberalism.

YUC_press_freedom:0 "Exhaustive Press Freedoms"
YUC_press_freedom_desc:0 "It is important to leverage the artistic and intellectual capacity of the free press, even if it is staffed by one too many revolutionaries.

YUC_liberty_or_death_desc:0 "We are committed as a party to the defense of Yucatán and to our hardfought liberties, willing to lay down our lives in order to preserve the paradise we have built.

YUC_build_democracy:0 "Strengthen Yucatán’s Democratic Processes"
YUC_build_democracy_desc:0 "Yucatec governing bodies must be judged not on their adherence to tradition, but instead on their adherence to the democratic ideals of the Constitución Política del Estado de Yucatán.

YUC_agricultural_aid:0 "The Agricultural Aid Fund"
YUC_agricultural_aid_desc:0 "Our ailing economy in the aftermath of Black Monday was never treated seriously by the Cuidado. Our cash crop-based economy has begun to collapse, and farmers - unable to adjust to more subsistence farming in a timely manner - have had to default to growing the same, devaluing crops to survive, leading to widespread hunger. An agricultural fund must be made so that we can bail-out farmers who have had bad harvests or suffered other maladies while simultaneously incentivizing the growth of subsistence crops to solve the hunger issue."
YUC_constitutional_review:0 "Constitutional Review"
YUC_constitutional_review_desc:0 "The old Constitution of Yucatan was last rewritten in 1862, and only guaranteed some aspects of the Libreal, Secular republic we envision. A second round of reforms, rewrites, and amendments is necessary to secure the right to culture, education, and prerogative along with the other freedoms and liberties we have come to embrace and espouse. The Constitution can be our guide, but that does not mean it is perfect, and so it must be able to be amended to fit our changing needs."
YUC_Yucatec_Square_Deal:0 "Yucatán's Own Square Deal"
YUC_Yucatec_Square_Deal_desc:0 "Modeled on similar programs practiced or theorized in America and Europe, we shall develop our own ‘Square Deal’ in order to bring a progressive and Liberal welfare system to our nation.

YUC_New_Republicanism:0 "New Yucatec Republicanism"
YUC_New_Republicanism_desc:0 "We must embrace our own form of Republicanism here, one form-fit to our rural and semi-centralized nature. Separate and distinct from the Hispanisc-Chauvinist forms of republican democracy practiced by the Mexicans and many of our other neighbors, we shall build a republican system that respects the varied voices of all of our people, including the Maya, so that all people may have a say in our government and be proud for having such a freedom.

YUC_Semi_Centralized_State:0 "The Liberal Torch of the Yucatán"
YUC_Semi_Centralized_State_desc:0 "Guiding the revitalized Sanjuanista movement, the new PSN under President Romero has built Yucatán into a shining liberal beacon for all to behold.

YUC_maya_tax_breaks_desc:0 "The heavily taxed Maya villages need relief from their old feudal burdens.

YUC_industralization_import_desc:0 "Outside connections made by our people and business partners living abroad have come back to benefit us, with new industrial toolmaking and smelting equipment being sent over as 'gifts' and tokens of future cooperation.

YUC_economic_interventionism:0 "Economic Interventionism"
YUC_economic_interventionism_desc:0 "It is unfortunate that our economic incentives have not taken to Yucatan as fast as we had hoped. It has been decided by the Ayuntamiento to set up a government administration to teach industrial foundry skills and business management, among other necessary courses, to better prepare the masses for our modernizing economy. Furthermore, we shall intervene in the economy as needed and if necessary in order to maintain an equal and fair playing field for competition. With simple moves, we shall keep the economy ever in check."

YUC_social_democrats:0 "Partido Socialista Obrero"
YUC_social_democrats_desc:0 "A compromise between revolution and evolution, the Partido Socialista Obrero has come out victorious. Led by prominent Leftist Democrat, social activist, and trained medical doctor Hircano Ayuso y O’Horibe, the PSO seeks to bring Socialism to our peninsula in a moderated form, restrained by fair democracy and non-predatory Labor-influenced Capitalism."

YUC_increase_public_spending_desc:0 "The wealth our capital of Mérida has hoarded from the rest of the peninsula over the years must be put back into the wider economy to help us recover from the revolutionary chaos.

YUC_social_welfare:0 "A Yucateco Welfare State"
YUC_social_welfare_desc:0 "A welfare system like that which Zapata promised the country before he was overthrown will help all of Yucatán, but we shall not make the same mistakes as the Mexicans did.

YUC_improve_rural_workers:0 "Improve Rural Working Conditions"
YUC_improve_rural_workers_desc:0 "Rural working conditions have been abysmal for decades, with worker injury and mortality rates at a staggeringly high level both within factories and out in the fields.

YUC_rural_peace:0 "Peace in the Hinterlands"
YUC_rural_peace_desc:0 "Ending the feudal-era family and tribal rivalries that have caused much violence and stagnation in the hinterlands is a major goal of our term.

YUC_Seperate_From_Radicalism:0 "Distance the Party from Radicalism"
YUC_Seperate_From_Radicalism_desc:0 "Due to the fiery nature of our birth and the oppressive system we broke from, radicalism and extremism are alive and well in Yucatán.

YUC_Labour_Economy:0 "A Laborite Economy"
YUC_Labour_Economy_desc:0 "Drawing from moderate Laborite principles from America and Europe, we shall build a worker-oriented economy that dances with Leftist thought without fully falling to dangerous Socialism.

YUC_equal_republic:0 "A Shining Republic for All"
YUC_equal_republic_desc:0 "The citizenship debate that raged within the Ayuntamiento is finally over.

YUC_peoples_assemblies:0 "People's Assemblies"
YUC_peoples_assemblies_desc:0 "The Ayuntamiento of Mérida shall be replaced with a wholly democratic Assemblea Popular, no longer subjecting the masses of the nation to the champagne Socialists of the capital.

YUC_Red_Apostle_desc:0 "Standing as the new, Red Apostle of our reforged Yucatán, President Puerto has brought a new wave of teachings and morals for all to follow as if he was one of the Twelve Apostles himself, preaching the good word of a new god - the ‘god’ of Socialist Theory. Detached from the Christian rhetoric that oppressed the bulk of our population for centuries, this new Red Apostle shall guide our Yucatán towards prosperity, morality, freedom, and equality without needing to resort to the venomous lies of religion and blind faith."
YUC_Full_Centralization:0 "Centralization Under Democratic Socialism"
YUC_Full_Centralization_desc:0 "In order to better administer this wild peninsula, a system of Socialist Centralism has been enacted, drawing more and more governmental and political responsibilities out of separate organizations and branches and into the hands of the central administration around the President and the Party.

YUC_Secularization:0 "Total Secularism"
YUC_Secularization_desc:0 "Although many within our movement are unwilling to admit it, it is clear that the moral teachings of the Catholic Church have grains of goodness that could benefit our communities in some regards. Obviously it does not mean that they should have any place in the halls of power, for only through total and uncompromising Secularization shall our Socialist dream come to bear fruit. What remains it the decision as how to go about establishing that distance, with mainline of the PSS under the Carrillo Puerto twins is content enough with promoting Socialist 'christenings' and community weddings, the splinters coalescing around Correa's PSON have a different idea. Influenced by the mainland PNR and Calles, often a political collaborator in recent years with their leader, the National Unionists are willing to put a lot more emphasis on the consequences that may befall the priesthood if it does not comply with Yucatán's new direction."
YUC_Purge_The_Red_Shirts:0 "Purge the Red Shirts"
YUC_Purge_The_Red_Shirts_desc:0 "The Camisas Rojas of Canabal are a dangerous lot of extremists that masquerade as ‘True Leftists’ while espousing authoritarianism and violence against their political enemies and the Church. We cannot let these Red Shirts continue to sully the name of Socialists in Yucatán, and so they must be stopped, no matter the cost."

YUC_syndicalists:0 "Partido Sindicalista Obrero Nacional"
YUC_syndicalists_desc:0 "Winning a surprising victory, the Partido Sindicalista Obrero Nacional under Bartolomé García Correa has risen to lead our new republic. The only organized Syndicalist group in Yucatán, the PSON is a splinter group from the larger PSS, and are expected to pursue Orthodox Syndicalist policies based around industrialization, urbanization, and unionism in order to free the proletariat of our peninsula."
YUC_Industrialization:0 "Rapid Industrialization"
YUC_Industrialization_desc:0 "The lands of Yucatán are hardly urbanized or industrialized, with the capital of Mérida and the port-city of Progreso being our only centers of any heavy industry. In order to truly create a Syndicalist system in this rural and jungle-filled peninsula, we are going to have to pursue a policy of rapid industrialization modeled on proposals leveraged by various European Socialist groups."
YUC_Expand_Urban_Centers:0 "Expand Urban Centers"
YUC_Expand_Urban_Centers_desc:0 "With only a few cities to our name, Yucatán is a largely rural nation of villages and communities - a setting unfit for the nourishment of true Syndicalism. We shall pursue a policy of expansive urbanization, paving over acres of jungle with concrete and steel in order to bring modernity and urbanized prosperity to our people."
YUC_Yucatec_Unionism:0 "Yucatecos Unionism"
YUC_Yucatec_Unionism_desc:0 "Unions as a concept are largely foreign to our people, with the only unions existing in the capital and other centers of industry, or within the farming industry. We must slowly introduce the idea of unions to the wider populace, showing them that they are only for their benefit."
YUC_Start_Talks:0 "Start Peace Talks with Radicals"
YUC_Start_Talks_desc:0 "Though radicalism can be dangerous, it definitely has its uses, for it was radicalism that allowed our revolution to succeed and our republic to be born. We must move towards peace talks and cooperation with like-minded Radicals across the Leftist spectrum so that we can build a strong and safe Socialist Yucatán."
YUC_Socialist_Unity:0 "Solidify Leftist Unity"
YUC_Socialist_Unity_desc:0 "Though we could not get all under our crimson banner, we have established a unified Leftist front which shall support our meager party and help us realize our Syndicalist dreams. Though we may have to compromise with our new allies and incorporate some of their own ideas, particularly stronger agricultural reforms and protections for the Maya, we shall be all the better for it as we are free to create proletarian paradise here on our peninsula."
YUC_Red_Nation:0 "Our Red Peninsula"
YUC_Red_Nation_desc:0 "Supported by Syndicalist economics, Socialist politics, and broad Leftist democracy, we have transformed Yucatán into a utopian paradise of crimson and red. Though we still have much work to do in order to fully bring Syndicalism and all of its benefits to this rural land, we have begun to make great strides, with new unions, communes, and other Leftist organizations being erected across the nation both by our government and by our own, eager populace. Together, we shall build a proletarian paradise for all in Latin America to behold."
YUC_Centralized_Syndicalist_Yucatan:0 "The Yucatecos Syndicalist Miracle"
YUC_Centralized_Syndicalist_Yucatan_desc:0 "All under Syndicalism, and all under the Trade Union Congress, we have built a strong, Socialist democracy that revolves around our spreading network of unions. Together, these decentralized unions name representatives to partake in our centralized national congress, fusing political ideas on governmental organization in order to best suit our needs and the dichotomy between our growing urban centers and our rural expanses. Under this system, we shall build our peninsula into the shining crimson jewel of Central America!"

YUC_Adapting_Orthodoxies_Charters:0 "Adapting Orthodoxies and the Charters" 
YUC_Adapting_Orthodoxies_Charters_desc:0 "While we are directly somewhat inspired by the success of the European workers, their grand revolts against the chains that bind, we cannot forget that Orthodox Syndicalism and its modification through the Totalist Charter are relatively new to our Peninsula. Only through careful consideration of what worked in Paris, London, and Turin, what can be employed to transform our urban lands properly, shall the Socialist mission in Yucatán be a fait accompli."
YUC_Yucateco_Dream_Sureste_Labor:0 "Yucateco Dream for the Sureste Labor"
YUC_Yucateco_Dream_Sureste_Labor_desc:0 "Despite the labor movement being a thing that unifies people stronger than any force in the world it still can fall victim to divisions. It is certainly true of the chasm created between the Southeastern unions that supported the independence of Yucatán, and the ones still clinging in desperation to the idea of a unitary Mexico. Let them cower no more, for every laborer shall find a place in the shared Yucateco dream of ours, they just need more convincing."

YUC_totalists:0 "Rise of the Camisas Rojas"
YUC_totalists_desc:0 "Rising to seize on the chaos after being allowed to work with the interim government, the Camisas Rojas - or Red Shirts - of Tomás Garrido Canabal Yucatán have consolidated their strength and now control the civilian government.

YUC_Anti_Catholic_Laws:0 "Severe Anti-Catholic Laws" 
YUC_Anti_Catholic_Laws_desc:0 "Catholicism and the Church around it have been nothing but a plague upon our population. Catholic ideas drove the Hispanic menace to oppress our people and rob us of our native culture while their Clergy rose to become another powerful and corrupt group of influential elites. We shall divorce Yucatán from religion entirely, persecuting all those who gained from this opportunistic system as we tear down the Church and seperate it not only from the government, but from the nation itself."
YUC_Persecute_Preists:0 "Persecute the Priesthood"
YUC_Persecute_Preists_desc:0 "Every man a rifle, and every priest a bullet. That shall be our policy as we work to cleanse Yucatán of the oppressive and predatory Church.

YUC_State_Atheism:0 "Enforce State Atheism"
YUC_State_Atheism_desc:0 "With the Church and the Clergy being delivered their deserved and violent justice, we must work to fully enforce not only Secularism, but total State Atheism. We shall be anti-theist, against all forms of religion as we work to finally eradicate the dreaded Opiate of the Masses. Religion shall have no place in our new and modern Yucatán!"
YUC_We_Are_All_Socialists:0 "We Are All Socialists!"
YUC_We_Are_All_Socialists_desc:0 "With Canabal being a Socialist, and with the ruling party and entire national government being Socialist, that must mean that all in the nation are Socialists as well! All loyal citizens of the state should already agree with all of our policies and ambitions, so there is no need for such inefficiencies as elections or democracy. We shall all work together, towards one goal, under one Party, for the good of all in our Yucatán."
YUC_Racism_Is_A_Crime:0 "Harsh Anti-Racist Legislation"
YUC_Racism_Is_A_Crime_desc:0 "To be racist or against such things as Feminism or Civil Rights is to be not only ignorant, but also a traitor, for discrimination against any of our fellow citizens is an act against the Party and the State. All racist or sexist offenders and perpetrators of hate crimes or prejudice shall be given swift and easy final judgment, for that is the only punishment fitting for such traitorous snakes."

YUC_All_Crimes_Have_the_Same_Punishment_desc:0 "The list of possible crimes one can commit is near endless, with dastardly villains dreaming up new ways to pervert law and order with each passing day. To expedite the judiciary process and to free up resources spent on prisons, we shall implement a policy of ‘Many Crimes, One Punishment.’ Under this system, any and all offenses against the State, the Party, or our people shall be handled the same way - with the offender getting a quick bullet through the back of the head."
YUC_Purge_Opposition:0 "Purge Any and All Opposition"
YUC_Purge_Opposition_desc:0 "Any and all opposition to the State and our plans are to be deemed as traitors and treated as such. Dangerous elements such as the Sanjuanistas and General Alvarado shall be given speedy trials for show and then sent on their way to the firing lines. We will preserve our new revolution and this new State, no matter the cost."
YUC_2_Year_Plan:0 "The Two Year Plan"
YUC_2_Year_Plan_desc:0 "In a series of consecutive Two Year Plans, we shall rapidly urbanize, industrialize, and militarize the Yucatecos State, bringing modernized prosperity and glory to the people of our peninsula. Though we have set harsh quotas, and although many will likely perish in this endeavor, the sacrifices of the masses shall never be forgotten as we blaze a path towards Proletarian Paradise regardless of how much it costs us in gold, blood, lead, or steel."
YUC_State_Economy:0 "Total Economic Nationalization"
YUC_State_Economy_desc:0 "The State and the Party shall come to dominate and dictate every facet of the national economy, down to the most minute details, in order maximize efficiency and productivity as we rocket towards modernity and true Socialism. All industries, as well as the land and all within it, shall be nationalized and controlled entirely by the Party in the name of the Proletariat masses. Only then can true Totalism and peak economic growth be achieved."
YUC_Prohibition_tot:0 "Free Society from Vice"
YUC_Prohibition_tot_desc:0 "Vices such as alcohol, gambling, prostiution, and more only serve to muddy the minds of the Proletariat. Taking one of the only things Alvarado got right - his harsh and strict prohibition bill - and taking it to its logical extreme, any and all vices shall be entirely banned by the state. We will build a good, clean, moral society free of vice and based entirely on our Totalist morals."
YUC_completely_destroy_religion:0 "An Anti-Clerical Cultural Revolution"
YUC_completely_destroy_religion_desc:0 "Taking our cultural and societal transformation further, Canabal and the Red Shirts have begun to promote a new cultural revolution for the peninsula, fusing Hispanic and Maya identities while breaking entirely from Christian morality and replacing it with our own Totalist ethics."

YUC_bunker_up_desc:0 "Our natural terrain is perfectly suited to guerilla warfare and hardpoint tactics. We shall move to build trench systems, bunkers, pillboxes, redoubts, and other various defensive structures all over our jungle-covered peninsula.

Under his ingenious, benevolent, and stern rule, we shall reach true Socialist perfection as we bring glory to our Yucatán."

YUC_take_over_CA_desc:0 "There is no point in trying to peacefully come to terms with our neighbors in Latin America. They shall only respect our views and our ambitions after a show of force, so let us ride across the Isthmus and spread our own form of Socialism for all to behold."

YUC_join_int:0 "Join the Internationale"
YUC_join_int_desc:0 "The Third Internationale is the largest Socialist organization on Earth, with member countries and parties all across the world. We must petition these masters of modern Socialism, asking if we may join in their alliance for the betterment of all."

YUC_black_spot_desc:0 "In our journey to create a perfected Yucateco variant of Totalism we have come to a simple realization, the links to the outside world must be completely severed. The Peninsula, once greedily exploited and colonized by foreign powers shall now free itself from such rot. It was Catholicism and Spanish racism which came from beyond the ocean and corrupted this land, hence nothing which could threaten our vision may be allowed to slither in again. Yucatán shall not only survive with no outside help, it shall thrive through our labor alone."
YUC_indepedence_secured:0 "Our Sovereignty Secured"

YUC_plummed_serpeant_desc:0 "The Plumed Serpent, or Kukulcan, was a primary Mayan god. The ancient Mayans believed that when he reappeared, good times were sure to come. Though there are precious few believers in the old gods now, it may be that mentioning his return will reignite our economy."

YUC_womens_rights_desc:0 "As part of the constitution, many parties agree that we should shoot far ahead of reactionary Mexico in our pursuit of better rights for the women of Yucatan.

### Events ###

yucatan.1.t:0 "The Yucatán Constitution"
yucatan.1.d:0 "In Mérida, the new Yucatán Constitution was signed. While it was modeled on the 1917 Mexican Constitution along with the American Constitution, it also included quite a bit of Maya legal code as well. Moreover it is also a compromise between the various factions within the Yucatecos government to create a cohesive and comprehensive document that all can agree on as we attempt to build our own independent republic here out on our jungle-covered peninsula."
yucatan.1.a:0 "Viva Libre Yucatan!"

yucatan.2.t:0 "The Land Issue"
yucatan.2.d:0 "The issue of Land Reform has been brought up time and time again, but now it shall finally be resolved. Most of the conservatives and non-Leftist liberals suggest supporting small land owners, while the progressives, soft Liberals, and moderate Socialists think we should implement the Georgist idea of a land tax. Alternatively, many radical Leftists and revolutionaries believe that collectivizing the land is the right way to go. What should we do?"
yucatan.2.a:0 "Collectivize the land for the good of the Proletariat."
yucatan.2.b:0 "Implement a Georgist single-tax policy to appease as many as possible."
yucatan.2.c:0 "Support small landholders with the Conservatives."

yucatan.3.t:0 "Dealing with Mexican Spies"
yucatan.3.d:0 "We have recently caught a number of Mexican Spies that were trying to infiltrate our government. The question is what should we do with them. Most moderates believe that we should deport them, while the more brash among us believe that we should just execute the lot of them. Finally, the radicals within our ranks think we should try to turn them to our side, winning them over with shared Revolutionary rhetoric. What shall we decide?"
yucatan.3.a:0 "Execute them."
yucatan.3.b:0 "Deport them."
yucatan.3.c:0 "Try to turn them."

yucatan.5.d:0 "The Camisas Rojas of Tomás Garrido Canabal and the Movimiento Maya of General May Pech have come to command much political influence within the nation, as well as each controlling their own vast and veteran paramilitaries. Though we have long worked with the moderate Socialists to achieve our goals, some within our administration have begun to parrot the idea of aligning with one of these groups. However, with the influence of these radicals growing, we should be cautious lest they try to make a move to fulfill their own ambitions."
yucatan.5.a:0 "The Red Shirts seem like fine allies!"
yucatan.5.b:0 "The Movimiento Maya seem like fine allies!"

yucatan.5.e:0 "Continue our alliance with the Socialists."

yucatan.6.t:0 "Redshirts Attempt a Coup"
yucatan.6.d:0 "With our decision to ally with the Red Shirts of Canabal, and with our own movement faltering as our moderate Socialist allies flake off to other movements or are mysteriously killed off, our administration has been left vulnerable. Sensing this weakness, General Canabal and his Camisas Rojos have attempted to seize control of the state, surrounding the capital and declaring their intention to topple the government to the wider nation. As our loyalist troops arrive on the scene to combat these extremists, we are unsure if it will be enough to stop the crimson tide."
yucatan.6.a:0 "Canabal seizes control of the State!"
yucatan.6.b:0 "The Red Shirts are beaten back!"

yucatan.7.t:0 "The Face of our New Nation"
yucatan.7.d:0 "With our war for independence finally won and with the dangerous radicals that accosted our liberal movement finally put to rest, the time has come to organize our state and proclaim our new government. It is heavily expected for General Alvarado - hero of the Revolution and Socialist activist in his own right - to be elected as our new President if he does not step down and retire before elections. However, there have been rumors circulating that Alvarado has no plans on keeping his democratic promises, for instead he plots to install his own Red-tinted Military Junta, or so these rumors claim. Whatever the truth may be, we will soon find out as General Alvarado rises to address the nation. "
yucatan.7.a:0 "Alvarado proclaims the republic and is sworn in as our first President."
yucatan.7.b:0 "Alvarado officializes his rule in a Socialist-inspired Military Junta."
yucatan.7.c:0 "Alvarado steps aside as Governor, allowing democratic elections."

yucatan.8.d:0 "With our decision to ally with the Movimiento Maya of Francisco May Pech, and with our own movement faltering as our moderate Socialist allies flake off to other movements or are mysteriously killed off, our administration has been left vulnerable. Sensing this weakness, General May Pech and his Maya guerillas have attempted to seize control of the state, surrounding the capital and declaring their intention to topple the government to the wider nation. As our loyalist troops arrive on the scene to combat these extremists, we are unsure if it will be enough to stop the nativist tide."
yucatan.8.a:0 "May Pech seizes control of the State!"
yucatan.8.b:0 "The Maya are beaten back!"

yucatan.9.t:0 "The Nation Devolves into Political Infighting"
yucatan.9.d:0 "With our foolish decision to align with both the Red Shirts and the Maya nativists, all out pandemonium has broken out in the capital as Maya guerrillas combat Red Shirt paramilitaries in a fight for the soul of Yucatán. With our own loyalists and forces far too outnumbered to stand in the way, it would seem that the republican dream is well and truly dead. Now, all that is left to do is to sit and wait and see which group of violent extremists - the Totalist Camisas Rojos of Canabal or the nationalist Moveimiento Maya of General May Pech - will come out on top."
yucatan.9.a:0 "In the chaos, May Pech seizes power!"

The Chan Santa Cruz war is still fresh in the minds of many Maya people, and some are suggesting that the Maya People of Yucatán engage in an uprising to take the oppressive government down and reclaim the legacy of their powerful ancestors.

With the rebellion quickly spreading outwards from Quintana Roo, the Yucatecos Government and High Command have legitimate fears.

yuc_flavor.1.d:0 "Taking the throne at just twelve years old, K’inich Janaab’ Pakal - better known as Pakal I or Pakal the Great - was the greatest of all the ancient Maya ahaus. Though not a full emperor like Pakal IV now reigns, Pakal the Great commanded the great city of Palenque in what would become not only one of the greatest monarchical reigns in history, but also the third longest verifiable regnal period in human history. Ruling Palenque for over 68 years, Pakal the Great ushered in a golden age unlike any in Yucatán had ever seen, supported by scientific and cultural advancements hitherto unrivaled, and it is this legacy that Franciso May Pech now seeks to emulate. \n\nForced onto the throne by his loyal clique of Maya extremists, Pakal IV as he now rules wishes to rise to the same heights as his forebears, and shall attempt to usher in his very own golden age to benefit his people. Commanding a cultural and societal revolution that aims to turn back the clock thousands of years while also utilizing the modernized concepts and lessons learned along the way, Pakal IV shall lead Yucatán on the path of total cultural revolution, societal upheaval, and complete metamorphosis as we attempt to build the first, true Maya Empire."

yuc_flavor.2.d:0 "Màayapáan, called Mayapán by our Hispanic conquerors, was once the cultural and political capital of the old Maya civilization - an advanced metropolis supported by good science, rational thought and philosophy, fine art, and high culture. This ancient city was tragically brought to ruin by both the mismanagement of the old Maya civilization and by Hispanic meddling, with the ancient stone walls of this ruined-city now lying abandoned and overgrown by jungle thicket. With the original site of this great city now revealed to us after expeditions in Northern Yucatán, Pakal IV has moved to rebuild this long-dead urban paradise, with the old temple complexes such as the great Temple of K’uk’ulkan being rebuilt and renovated along with the rest of the city, and with Pakal himself being named the lesser Ahua - or lord - of the city in addition to his title of K’uhul Ahau - or High King - of our new empire. Using modernized forms of Maya architecture, a new Màayapáan shall rise to once again be the crown-jewel of our reborn Maya civilization."

yuc_flavor.3.t:0 "The Great Pyramid Reborn"
yuc_flavor.3.d:0 "Continuing the revitalization efforts started in the construction of the new Màayapáan, Pakal IV and his loyal followers have moved to revive another site from our ancient civilization - the great city of Chichen Itza. Once the most diverse city in Mesoamerica, decorated with dozens of different architectural and artistic styles, Chichen Itza once served as the melting pot of Maya civilization - a cosmopolitan metropolis at the heart of our homeland, serving as a crossroads and major hub to the dozens of ethnic groups and distinct tribes that made up the old Maya confederacy, the Luub Màayapáan or League of Mayapan. \n\nHowever, despite the city’s great legacy, its multiculturalism is not what grants the city its fame, for that honor belongs to the Chichen Itza’s crowning feature - the Great Pyramid Temple of K’uk’ulkan, and the ancient cult that surrounds it. \n\nThough many other temples, shrines, and pyramids are dedicated to the Maya serpent deity of war and life related to the Aztec Quetzalcoatl, none reach the splendor or grandeur of the Great Temple at Chichen Itza. Adorned with serpent decorations, accompanied by the Great Ballcourt where Maya Ballgame was once played for the Ahaus, and featuring an unique architectural quirk that allows the sound of clapping hands to reverberate and amplify throughout the structure’s angled staircases into a haunting, bird-like sound, the Great Temple is a marvel of ancient engineering still standing to this very day. Also serving as the center of the old cult of K’uk’ulkan, this holy city - one of the lost Tollans - also holds great religious and cultural significance for our people, and as such it must be preserved. The Great Temple, along with the rest of this ancient city, the Great Ballcourt, and the Cult of K’uk’ulkan, shall be revived, renovated, and rebuilt as Màayapáan was, further restoring our former glories as we aspire to new heights."

From the Mayan language being De-Hispanicized to the old Maya polytheistic pantheon being revived and spread throughout our peninsula, nearly all aspects of our old culture and society shall be revived, modernized, and put back into national practice. Maya Ballgame and ballcourts are being popularized once more as the Cult of K’uk’ulkan rises to be one of the dominant religions in the state as the masses give their souls over to the feathered serpent god. Scientific advancements and modernized slash-and-burn agriculture once again takes root, and the ancient practice of holding Flower Wars has also begun to reemerge. \n\nMore interestingly, however, has been the total return of the old Maya calendar systems, including both the cosmic calendar for regular timekeeping and the sacrificial calendar that details when and what must be sacrificed to which specific gods in the pantheon on which specific day. Like our Aztec counterparts, sacrifice was a large part of our old religion, although human sacrifice was much rarer and reserved only for the most important ceremonies. The rare human sacrifices were also of high social standing or powerful prisoners of war, while most other captives and prisoners were instead forced to do labor - yet another aspect of our old society revived as well. Instead, most sacrifices were of animals or organs, or even gold and other treasures, all given up to the Gods and to Xibalba - the Maya underworld meaning ‘place of fright.’ These sacrifices, along with all other aspects of our old culture as outlined in historic texts like the Popol Vuh, shall be revived, revitalized, and modernized to fit our new empire as we seek to bring the Maya civilization back from the brink of death."

yuc_flavor.5.d:0 "With our hold on Yucatán only continuing to tighten as the nation is further consolidated under our grip, the question on what to do with our former allies in the Cruzoobe movement has arisen. The ‘Cruzoobians’ are Maya, just like us, but have been led astray by their ideas of syncretic Catholicism fused with Maya religious beliefs; their minds poisoned by the vile Hispanics. Though even May Pech himself once included himself among their numbers, we have since moved past their half-way measures, but that still does not change the fact that these fanatics have proven ever loyal to our movement and our shared people, even if they do not fully agree with our new direction. With Pakal IV even feeling sympathy for these heretics, many have pushed for us to pardon them, letting them live peacefully in our new empire so long as they keep their syncretic views to themselves. However, the diehard Maya revivalists that forced May Pech to even take the direction we now travel have different ideas. These firebrands and extremists demand that the followers of the Cruzoob faith that refuse to convert to our new, or old, ways should be shot on the spot as Hispanic traitors. However, the final choice lies in the hands of the K’uhul Ahau."

With Flower Wars - smaller, preplanned, and heavily organized ritual wars performed by both the Maya and Aztecs for sacrificial and diplomatic purposes - already being revived, and with the ancient Maya practice of only using honorable warriors as human sacrifices being well understood, these radicals wish to use our new Socialist captives in these revived conflicts. With no other use for these dangerous veterans, being far too stubborn to use in hard labor as we do with other prisoners, utilizing them in our Flower Wars is the obvious move. In line with old traditions, these veterans shall be stripped and released to do battle with nothing but honorable melee weapons against our trained cabal of elite ceremonial guard. In these planned battles, these Totalist vermind shall be cut down noblely on the field of battle; their blood and entrails spilling into the soils as payment to the great gods of our pantheon. Only then, will these animals finally have a real use and a shot at redemption before the might of our pantheon."

Without our direction or order, the people - openly embracing this faith that had been suppressed for so long - have begun to adapt their lifestyles, cultural attitudes, and traditions to these new syncretic norms. Religious ceremonies and masses utilizing aspects of both halves of our religion have begun to spread all over Yucatán as people work the new faith into their daily lives. Furthermore, new architecture, art, and music that pulls from both our New World and Old World influences have begun to spread, creating a new shared culture for our newly freed people to rally around. By fusing the past with the present, the traditions of the Maya and the native Catholics shall be preserved, while leaving the more barbaric aspects of both cultures to the pages of history."

From the rebellion of Chan Santa Cruz to the Caste War to our own fiery fight for independence, war has become a reality for our people. As we now drift towards peacetime and the hard nation-building work that comes with it, General Francisco May Pech wishes to pay respects to all those we have lost. Building a massive victory pillar at the site of the original Chan Santa Cruz rebellion, we shall maintain a beautiful memorial that serves to show generations to come how valiantly and bravely those that died for our independence fought. Furthermore, the original shrine at the site is also to be repaired and renovated, with a massive pyramid-cathedral being erected, fusing imagery and architectural designs from traditional Catholic chapels here in Mexico with the imposing stone-hewn might of the ancient Maya temple complexes. With these monuments to those we have lost and to our new pantheon, let us all rejoice and build the utopia our forefathers died to create."

We cannot let these misguided sons of God and K’uk’ulkan lead the reputation of our movement to ruin.

However, our pro-Maya movement has become split on what to do with the large Hispanic population in our Yucatán. Our leader - the brave and respected General May Pech - along with his loyalist clique advocates that we show these lost and misinformed souls the error of their ways, welcoming them into our new faith, and letting old grudges lie as we progress towards our shared paradise. However, the Maya radicals instead have pushed for a less forgiving option, advocating that each and every full-blooded Catholic Hispanic in Yucatán be expelled from the nation or worse. Such a move would rapidly purify our state and accelerate our pro-Maya ambitions, but would alienate us from large swathes of the population while muddying our reputation with the international community.

However, creating an agrarian economy that is sustainable, profitable, and efficient is a whole other story - especially when much of the nation still lives a semi-feudal lifestyle. We have moved to correct these issues, taking notes from our ancestors who once used cut and burn agriculture over large swathes of the Yucatán peninsula in order to sustain our confederation of city states. However, in the past, the methods used led to soil erosion, nutrient deficiencies as minerals leached into the jungle, problems with parasites, and other obstacles to achieving efficient farming. We shall rectify these old mistakes by implementing new technologies, practices, tools, and knowledge learned in the modern age in order to create an agrarian paradise that is both efficient and profitable while also keeping in touch with our old customs."

Espousing radical Feminism, Anti-Clericalism, Anti-Racism, and Civil Rights for all loyal children of Yucatán, he is wildly devoted to defending and spreading these views, even if he must resort to violence - which he frequently does. Wether he be shooting another whiskey priest caught embezzling donation funds, or gunning down a would-be rapist or racist lynch mob, Canabal does not care who he must blow away in order to achieve his egalitarian dream free from the vices and sins of Yucatán’s past.

Nestled in Yucatán near the border with Mexico, this multi-hundred acre strip of pasture is a pristine, idyllic example of quaint ranchero life. Here, Canabal lives with his wife, along with his two children Lenin and Zoila Libertad, named to show his devotion to his ideals. He even has his own menagerie of barnyard animals to go along with this ranch, with a bull named God, an ox and a hog both named Pope, a heffer named Mary, and a donkey named Christ - all in clear jest and mockery of the Christian Theism that he so loathed. Using this ranch as both his retreat away from the stress of ruling the nation as well as a learning center for local youths to be taught in the ways of the true Marxist-Bolshevik influenced Revolution, Canabal’s estate is surely an interesting sight to behold."

Gambling has been made illegal, while alcohol has been banned and alcoholism has been made grounds for divorce to save trapped women from abusive marriages. Uniquely, prositution has also been legalized, with women protected by law and subject to routine health and safety checkups to ensure it remains an honest business. Socialist liberalism and civil rights have been spread far and wide to all, creating an egalitarian society and culture under the velvet fist of General Alvarado.

Statues of this hero, and those that aided him in our struggle such as Felipe Carrillo Puerto, have been erected all around the nation while museums and art galleries display pieces that capture the grandeur and heroics of Alvarado and his allies.

Professing his commitment to ideas such as Civil Rights, Feminism, and the inclusion of the Maya people in the Revolution, Puerto was spouting rhetoric like a true firebrand when the shot finally rang out. Puerto collapsed to the stage as the lone gunman tried to escape through the crowd before being shot dead himself by local Red militiamen. As Puerto lay in a growing pool of his own blood, his sister Evita - herself a devoted Socialist sharing most of the same ideas as her brother - ran to his side to put pressure on his wound.

As one would expect, this summit quickly devolved into infighting as radicals of all different viewpoints argued and brawled over which interpretation of Socialism was the correct way forward. The meeting ended abruptly and rather violently as one of the Red Shirt delegates pulled out his revolver and shot one of the few Liberals in attendance dead, claiming him to be a reactionary spy. As the summit dissolved into chaos, Correa’s motorcade quickly made their leave with the few Socialist leaders he was able to make some progress with, including Filipe Puerto and General Alvarado.

Using his own practice as a testbed, he shall implement a plan of free, universal healthcare in his hometown. If it proves successful, he plans to extend it to all of Yucatán while building new hospitals and free clinics in order to drag our nation’s medical network out of the 18th Century. Under Dr. and President O’Horibe, all in Yucatán shall be able to get the healthcare and medicine they need in order to live long, happy, and fulfilling lives in our new Social Democratic paradise."
yuc_flavor.30.a:0 "We shall make Yucatán’s healthcare system the envy of Central America."

yuc_flavor.31.d:0 "In response to our anti-radical push, the Camisas Rojo of General Canabal have begun to riot in the capitol, spreading terror and bloodshed as they reap a path of havoc through Merida. Moving quickly to contain the situation, President O’Horibe immediately ordered the army to the city, but even the prowess of General Alavarado proved to not be enough to stop Canabal’s rampage. However, the tide began to finally turn against the Red Shirts as General Francisco May Pech and his Maya Moviemiento rode into the city to aid in the conflict. With the forces of O’Horibe and May Pech working in unison, the Red Shirts were finally defeated and Canabal and the rest of the Red Shirt leadership were sentenced to life in prison or execution. However, with Canabal gone, we have only indebted ourselves to May Pech and his men, who have now pushed for greater Maya autonomy and freedoms. It would seem that no matter what we do, we cannot escape radicalism."

yuc_flavor.32.t:0 "The Society of Creole Characters"
yuc_flavor.32.d:0 "The original Sanjuanistas were a group of Merida-based Yucatecos rebels who distanced themselves from the Spanish Crown while embracing the ideas of the French Enlightenment. Their Liberal and Libertarian ideas are not only what form the basis of our party’s platform, for they also form the foundations of the Yucatán independence movement in general. We have moved to honor these original heroes of our peninsula, building new statues and naming new buildings and plazas in their honor. Furthermore, President Romero has tried to revive and re-popularize much of their ideas, spreading his own translations of various Enlightenment novels by famous authors like Voltaire. Hopefully, with Romero’s efforts, true Liberalism free from the taint of Socialist thought can finally flourish here in Yucatán once again."
yuc_flavor.32.a:0 "We honor these heroes of Yucatecos liberalism."

yuc_flavor.33.t:0 "President Romero’s Agenda"
yuc_flavor.33.d:0 "As he attempts to usher in his own form of radically progressive societal transformation in the Square Deal, President Romero has also begun to dabble in many of his old interests for the good of the state. Reopening trade and diplomatic ties with Japan utilizing connections he made during his time in the foreign ministry and overseas, Romero has secured vital new and lucrative trade deals that help make our large spending possible. Furthermore, utilizing his knowledge from his career as a pediatrician, Romero has begun to implement a series of healthcare and public health reforms aimed at making medicine and medical care more affordable and easy to obtain, while forcing most jobs to provide a basic health plan and building new clinics across the nation. A Liberal jack-of-all-trades, Romero’s numerous outlets and interests have begun to pay great dividends for the republic."

yuc_flavor.34.t:0 "On the Status of the Wrigley Company"
yuc_flavor.34.d:0 "For the last few decades, the American-based Wrigley Company has operated within our lands, harvesting the wild chicle gum that excretes from trees in the Manilkara genus. These Yanquis use this gum - collected by people called ‘chicle hunters’ - to manufacture their famous chewing gum, and had an agreeable deal with the Mexican government before our revolt. With our revolt now successful, and with the Third Yucatán Republic proclaimed, we must now decide what to do with this foreign company."
yuc_flavor.34.a:0 "Ban the company and nationalize all assets."
yuc_flavor.34.b:0 "Ban the company and sell its parts to the public."

yuc_flavor.35.d:0 "A soldier of fortune and veteran mercenary with few equals, the Indian-born Welshman Caryl ap Rhys Pryce is one of the greatest assets we have under our command. A full officer and general within our military staff, this internationally renowned veteran of the Boer Wars, Villa’s raids into America, the 1911 Magonista Rebellion in Baja, the Porfirio Regime, the Matabele Rebellion, and more has decided to serve with our independence movement following his exit from the Mexican Foreign Legion and subsequent few decades on the lamb. Even a direct descendant of the medieval Welsh freedom fighter Owain Glyndŵr and the younger brother of British-Indian general Sir Henry ap Ryhs Pryce, Caryl has noble martial-mindedness and an aptitude for military command in his blood, and is sworn to using this innate and war-honed expertise in guerilla warfare, artillery tactics, and sabotage in order to bring our state towards freedom and greatness."

yuc_flavor.36.t:0 "Revenge Against the Gum Stealers"
yuc_flavor.36.d:0 "The jungles of our verdant peninsula have long been prized for the Manilkara genus of plants, which are coveted for their ability to produce a sticky chicle gum vital in chewing gum production. Nearly all chicle gum in the world is harvested from trees here in Yucatán or in neighboring Guatemala and Belize by chicleros, and as such, companies from around the world have harvesting operations in our jungles. With big names such as the Wrigley Gum Company wreaking havoc on our land and forests, something must be done. No longer shall these foreigners be allowed to molest our ecosystem, and no longer shall they enslave our people to do their dirty, hard labors. \n\nWith [root.getleader] having a personal grudge against these parasites, for it was largely the invasionary and oppressive gum harvesters that pushed him into radicalism and revolt against all foreign invaders of Yucatán in general, he has announced a war against these insects. All across our peninsula, their assets and resources shall be seized, their harvesting operations will be dismantled or taken over by the state, and the parasites themselves shall all be exterminated if they do not flee. We will cleanse our forests and let them heal as we finally move to secure our eden."
yuc_flavor.36.a:0 "These foreign thieves shall rue the day they ever stole from our Yucatán."

yuc_flavor.37.t:0 "A Question in Leadership"
yuc_flavor.37.d:0 "Seeking to return to his own medical practice and wishing to hide away once again from the public spotlight, President O’Horibe has pushed for the Party to be ruled by his right-hand man and ally Álvaro Torre Díaz. Twice the Governor of Yucatán before this current moment, Díaz is one of the few men who truly knows the ins and outs of this chaotic peninsula, and would be a perfect fit as the successor to O’Horibe, especially considering his ties and past friendship with national hero General Alvarado and his deep connection to the Socialist, Progressive, and Democratic movements of our isolated jungle home. Though many still swear fealty and loyalty to President O’Horibe, many more still support him in his wish to retire to a private and peaceful life, and now the choice lies with him himself."
yuc_flavor.37.a:0 "Stick with President O’Horibe. He has served the nation well."
yuc_flavor.37.b:0 "Go with Álvaro Torre Díaz. His new ideas shall lead us to prosperity."

yuc_flavor.38.t:0 "A True Maya Heir?"
yuc_flavor.38.d:0 "Although Francisco May Pech has served valiantly as the last of the original Maya commanders that have rebelled against Hispanic dominance for decades if not centuries in Chan Santa Cruz and beyond, he is not of true royal stock, for despite his Maya ancestry May Pech is only a commoner, although a committed one at that. However, we have come into contact with a gentleman of noble Maya blood, opening up the possibility of recreating a dynastic link to the original Ahau. Named Don Nemesio Xiu Pérez, he is a direct descendent of the Royal Family of Xiu - also called Tutul-Xiu/Tutul Xiu or even Mani - and through this family line, his ancestors include King (or Ahau) Ah Suytok Tutul Xiu - who created the dynasty within the famed temple-city of Uxmal - first founded by his early ancestor Hun Uitzil Chac Tutul-Xiu - that worked alongside Mayapan and Chichen Itza to create a stable coalition of city-states in the north of Yucatan know as the League of Mayapan - and Ah Xiu Xupan, the last king of Uxmal that caused mass infighting within the League due to his rivalry with the Cocom dynasty of Tibolón at the behest of the leaders of Mayapan themselves, leading to its eventual downfall. \n\nA divisive regal history to say the least, Don Nemesio still holds the purple blood of Maya royalty in his veins despite his chosen lifestyle as a peasant farmer living outside the city of Ticul, and although many are actively resisting the idea of his coronation and the full evolution of our movement into native monarchism as they cite Nemesio’s meddlesome ancestors, many more uphold Nemesio’s legacy as the heir of Ah Suytok Xiu the Founder and Nemesio’s supposed similarities to the Catholic-Maya syncretic folk saint/deity Maximón aka San Simón (at least in the eyes of the Cruzoobists), giving the idea much purchase within our movement. Should Commander May Pech step down from his position as the face of our administration to become the Halach Uinik (Overlord) and a lesser Ahau once more beneath this new high king, yielding to a monarchist facade as he runs things from behind the scenes while cultivating a hereditary and noble figurehead post in the form of the reborn Xiu Dynasty, or should we take a more moderate approach to this development?"
yuc_flavor.38.a:0 "Crown him at once as K’uhul Ahau Ah Suytok Nemesio Tutul-Xiu the Second!"

yuc_flavor.39.t: "Mayan Ambitions in Central America"
yuc_flavor.39.d: "Though we have united the old lands of the Maya, Francisco May Pech has seen it likely that we will come to blows with the regimes of Central America, including the Guatemalans who already reside under our rule. And so the question comes of how we should look to the subjugation of their lands once the time comes, with some in our movement advocating for spreading our reborn state into their lands directly, bringing to them the rule of our new empire, to protect these lands from would be dangers, and spreading our principles beyond the traditional Mayan lands"

POLITICS_SHX_QIAO_JIACAI_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! April 3rd, 1906, in Yiwang, Shanxi Province, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! From a young age, Qiao Jiacai was an energetic, brilliant student and a patriot. At age 18, shortly after enrolling in Taiyuan Civilian Middle School, he was inspired by many activists from Beijing who taught him about Sun Yat-sen and his Three Principles of the People. Together, he and other students formed the Jiaocheng County branch of the Kuomintang in 1925. Within a year, he ran away from home to attend Whampoa academy. As the Northern Expedition raged, he secretly returned home to Shanxi to organise his comrades in preparation for the eventual KMT takeover. That takeover never came - at least not in 1927. Instead, Jiacai went underground with his closest associates - forming a secretive intelligence cell based in Jiaocheng. An associate of the BIS and rumoured to be the long-time head of the entire North China branch, the Kuomintang's recent resurgence has seen Qiao installed as the Governor of Shanxi. For Qiao, this is a vindication of a decades-long struggle and proof that China's rejuvenation is inevitable."
POLITICS_SHX_BO_YIBO_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! §gFebruary 17th, 1908, in Jiang Village, Dingxiang County, Shanxi, Qing Empire§!\n§YAlignment:§! §gGuominjun§!\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gFrom his youth, Bo Yibo witnessed nothing more than the injustice of national trauma and humiliation that had befallen China. Born to a poor family in Taiyuan, Bo's family was so poor that they were forced to drown one of his newborn brothers because the family was too poor to feed him. Such injustices propelled Bo to radicalism and upon hearing the news of Sun Yat-sen's national revolution in Guangzhou followed by the Syndicalist revolutions across the great ocean - Bo became a dedicated socialist, a man with a dream of a truly utopian and communalistic Shanxi. While he is not a direct affiliate of the Chinese Kuomintang, Bo finds himself the leader of a vanguard of a growing movement of dissatisfied students, workers, and peasants from across Shanxi. Only time will tell - whether or not their mission will succeed.§!\n\n§YNotes: A student radical and socialist agitator, Bo Yibo has tied his fate with the Guominjun.§!"

#Parties
SHX_totalist_party: "KMT-ZhongTeJu (Jiaocheng)"
SHX_totalist_party_long: "Kuomintang - Central Bureau for Intelligence and Special Methods - Jiaocheng County Cell\n§gIt is well known that Dai Chunfeng's reach extends to the farthest corners of China, piercing even the high mountains that protect the Shanxi Clique. Qiao Jiacai is a Shanxi native who enthusiastically organised the Jiaocheng County branch of the KMT in 1925 before running away from home to attend Whampoa on the eve of the Northern Expedition. During the expedition, he managed to secretly return home to Shanxi and built a cell around his former Jiaocheng comrades to prepare for the ultimate KMT takeover. They never got their chance, and about a decade later this secretive group remains in hiding. Qiao, it would appear, has established some contact with a broader network of KMT informants around the country, but with who and how many he keeps close to his chest. His agents rarely cooperate with other KMT groups in the area, sticking to themselves and the shadows. Away from the prying eyes of Shanxi's bickering strongmen, this underground network operates from Luliang - awaiting the day that the KMT returns.§!"
SHX_syndicalist_party: "Syndicalist Sympathisers"
SHX_syndicalist_party_long: "Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Syndicalist Youth League\n§gOfficially organised into the 'Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Syndicalist Youth League', Syndicalism has found little traction in the mostly conservative Shanxi. Their only success has been their partial sway over the Taiyuan Municipal Labour Union, under the shadow of more elder Kuomintang activists aligned with the Reorganised faction. Pan Zili was a student radical growing up in the chaos of the 1920s, joining an artillery battalion before attempting to organise student protests against Yan's rule. He fled to France in 1925 to study at the Sun Yat-sen University in Paris, before returning home in 1933. Little more than an offshoot of the already fringe KMT remnant in Shanxi, this CSP branch represents the manifestation of the extreme of student radicalism in the province. Indeed, it finds itself more of a political boogeyman for Yan's screeds against societal disorder than a practical revolutionary movement.§!"

SHX_social_democrat_party_long: "Kuomintang (Farmer's Association)\n§gGiven the appalling conditions of Shanxi's farmers, it is no surprise that what little KMT popular support in Shanxi congregates around the more agrarian wing of the party. Operating under the front organisation of the 'Xi'an County Farmers' Association', Wei Yechou has long been the de facto leader of the KMT in Shaanxi. He has mentored many socialist activists from Shaanxi as a middle school teacher and was invited to participate in the 1926 KMT National Congress, a distinction he remains proud of to this day. Although largely suppressed, Wei Yechou's farmers' associations and militias serve as some buffer against the exploitation of the gentry. Loosely affiliated with Song Qingling's faction of the KMT, Wei hopes that all the sacrifices his men have made will be for something.§!"

#Events
shx.0.t: "The Shanxi Clique"
shx.0.d: "The Shanxi Clique is a Chinese warlord state led by Yan Xishan. Following their loss of territory to the Zhili Clique, and later the restored Qing Dynasty, the clique became even more isolated than it already was. They have absolutely no intention, barring territorial incursions, to enter into another Chinese conflict. However, Yan Xishan and many people in the government want to see the return of their rightful lands in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, currently occupied by the Qing. Yan is known for his opportunism, and it is highly unlikely that he will pass an opportunity for those lands up, should it present itself."
shx.0.a: "The Neutral Clique Prospers!"

shx.1.t: "Yan Xishan Thought"
shx.1.d: "Yan Xishan has long been employing many aspects of different ideologies and religions in his administration. Known as Yan Xishan Thought, it has thus far managed to fall onto deaf ears. Yan Xishan yearns to change this, although whether this will actually succeed is currently unknown."
shx.1.a: "Yan is a wise man."

shx.2.t: "Yan and Feng Meet in Taiyuan to Discuss Funding"
shx.2.d: "In the usual weekly meeting between Yan and Feng in Shanxi's capital, the discussion of funding for both Yan's and Feng's numerous projects has lead to several ideas being put forward with the betterment of Shanxi in mind. Both agreed that Shanxi and China as a whole require "Western"  influence to move forward as a modern nation, though they decided that further conversation on the matter should be postponed to a later date, due to a more pressing issue: German mining companies and their "incursions" into Shanxi."
shx.2.a: "A meeting among friends!"

shx.3.t: "Feng Suggests Larger Funding for the Guominjun"
shx.3.d: "Feng has suggested to Yan that in order for Shanxi to survive, it must have a strong military, and his Guominjun should fill this role. Yan advised Feng that Shanxi does not currently have additional funds for Feng's Guominjun. Feng gracefully accepted this answer and the discussion moved on to other matters in Shanxi."
shx.3.a: "The price is too high."

shx.4.t: "A Friendly Dinner"
shx.4.d: "In addition to the usual weekly meeting between Feng and Yan, today the two also shared a meal together. The discussion was light, with Feng making mention of his fondness for Frank Houghton, an Anglican missionary who had praised Feng's efforts in bringing Christianity to China. Yan politely listened to Feng, then the subject changed to Yan's latest "Thought". They continued long into the night, and both retired a little wiser of each other's plans."
shx.4.a: "A fun night was had by all!"

shx.5.t: "Feng Ignores Yan's Authority and Secures Extra Money for the Guominjun"
shx.5.d: "In a shocking move, Feng has secured extra funding for his Guominjun. The method is unknown to Yan, though many believe it is via his new connections to the missionaries that some say are "plaguing" Shanxi. Yan has decided to simply accept the situation, concluding that Feng is ultimately working for the good of Shanxi, and while he may have ulterior motives, there is currently little cause for concern."
shx.5.a: "He might need a talking to."

shx.6.t: "Yan Holds Economic Meeting"
shx.6.d: "In a meeting held by Yan, discussion revolved around the event known as "Black Monday" and its effects on Shanxi's economy. Thus far, the effects of Black Monday have been minimal, due to Shanxi's "underdeveloped" economy.\n\nDespite Shanxi's insulation from this global crisis, Yan has nonetheless diverted funds towards Shanxi's agriculture sector."
shx.6.a: "Our economy should be our primary focus."

shx.7.t: "Feng Travels Through Yulin, Recruiting for the Military"
shx.7.d: "Feng has embarked on what he has dubbed a "Good Will Tour", travelling through Yulin with his Guominjun and a band of missionaries. Along the way, he has recruited into the Guominjun anyone wishing to be baptised into the Christian faith and has continued to spread his ideas. This has brought some stability to the region, though its effects will be temporary at best, as its main goal appears to be to strengthen Feng's powerbase within the military."
shx.7.a: "Is our army not large enough?"

shx.8.t: "Yan Speaks to Feng about the Military"
shx.8.d: "Yan, growing concerned about Feng's political ambitions, has spoken to him in private. The two became involved in a heated argument, with Yan demanding that the Guominjun swear loyalty to him as well as to Feng. Feng conceded, swearing that his Guominjun is loyal to Yan and to Shanxi, and then excused himself."
shx.8.a: "There are always cracks in a friendship."

shx.9.t: "Yan Plans Agriculture Modernisation"
shx.9.d: "Yan has consulted the limited number of European advisors he could gather and has drawn up plans to modernise Shanxi's agricultural sector. It is Yan's hope that these methods will allow Shanxi to become more self-sustaining and to improve the conditions of those who plow Shanxi's soil."
shx.9.a: "He is a busy man."

shx.10.t: "Feng Holds Meeting with Government Officials"
shx.10.d: "Feng has recently been seen speaking to members of the local government in Taiyuan. It seems he has been trying to gather support for some of his more radical ideas, and although most have ignored him, a small number are agreeing with his ideas."
shx.10.a: "He should stick to military matters."

shx.11.t: "German-owned Mining Companies Expand into Eastern Shanxi"
shx.11.d: "German-owned mining companies operating though agents from the League of Eight Provinces have begun to expand in Eastern Shanxi (Jinxi). Villagers located near the mine have been forced to flee because of the environmental damages caused by the tunneling and digging operations."
shx.11.a: "Outrageous... those are OUR resources they are exploiting!"

shx.12.t: "Peasants Outraged by German Exploitation"
shx.12.d: "The extremely disruptive methods of the German mining companies have led to clashes with local peasants. While so far the protests have been minor, there are fears that tensions could boil over and disrupt the flow of resources."
shx.12.a: "Damn."

shx.13.t: "Northwestern Shanxi Peasants Protest Against German Encroachment"
shx.13.d: "German companies have attempted to expand mining operations in Northwestern Shanxi and, as expected, have been met with local hostility. Unlike those in the south, the resistance in the north has been more fierce and has managed to halt most attempted operations. Peasants have denounced Yan and his government for his lack of intervention, and angry mobs have begun to form."
shx.13.a: "We may need to assemble a peacekeeping force..."

shx.14.t: "Feng Wants to Handle Western Shanxi Protests"
shx.14.d: "Civil disorder continues amongst peasants in the western districts of Shanxi due to the recent expansion of League of Eight Provinces-backed companies (who are ultimately backed by the Germans). Feng has announced that he and his cohorts will quell the protests and will do so without the need for bloodshed. Those within Yan's inner circle have cautioned him that this is a ploy by Feng to garner further support, and they recommend sending someone more trustworthy to deal with the disorder."
shx.14.a: "Good luck to him."
shx.14.b: "No, send Lt. Wu instead."

shx.15.t: "Feng's Northwestern Shanxi operation"
shx.15.d: "Tensions were high when Feng and his soldiers arrived. Feng conferred with his officers and his priest, and decided to open a dialogue with the miners. After a many long, tense hours of negotiations, the miners agreed to end their protest after securing concessions from Feng. He promised to address their grievances and secure improved working conditions, as well as some other details that were not made public. Before he left, Feng lead an open prayer service with some of the peasants even joining in."
shx.15.a: "A diplomatic success through his new Christian hobby?"

shx.16.t: "Opium Trade in Shanxi"
shx.16.d: "Opium, the scourge of China, is been traded and smuggled though Shanxi. Extreme measures have been enacted to ensure that those caught abusing this wretched substance are punished, with no exceptions given, neither for title nor rank. All opium smugglers will find the warm embrace of the hangman's noose."
shx.16.a: "Damn."

shx.17.t: "Financing Our Modernisation"
shx.17.d: "The modernisation of Shanxi will be a very expensive endeavour, and there are few options available to the government. After intense debate amongst those close to him, Yan has been presented three options:"
shx.17.a: "We will fund it ourselves!"
shx.17.b: "Taxes must be raised!"
shx.17.c: "Cut funding to the Army!"

shx.18.t: "The Modernisation Shall Begin!"
shx.18.d: "After much toil and hardship, Shanxi is financially prepared to take its first step towards modernising the state."
shx.18.a: "At long last!"

shx.19.t: "Corruption in Shanxi"
shx.19.d: "Widespread corruption is beginning to rear its ugly head within Shanxi. Reports of people from all levels of government accepting bribes or being linked to the spread of opium are arriving with unsettling frequency. This must cease if Shanxi is to truly prosper."
shx.19.a: "They will be dealt with."

shx.20.t: "Corrupt Officials Removed"
shx.20.d: "After thorough investigation and interrogation, several members of the government have been found guilty of corruption. The punishments for these crimes range from harsh fines to incarceration for the more extreme cases."
shx.20.a: "Justice prevails."

shx.21.t: "Feng Hosts a Dinner"
shx.21.d: "Feng has hosted a dinner and seems to have invited everyone except Yan. Word has reached Yan that during the festivities, Feng was discussing the future of Shanxi, and there was also much discussion about Christianity."
shx.21.a: "Our invite must've been lost in the mail..."

shx.22.t: "German Mining Company Offer"
shx.22.d: "A German mining company has approached us with a proposal that we assist them in their operations within Shanxi. They have offered Yan 30% of the profits from the mines. This move would be highly unpopular with the peasants, but it would benefit our economy."
shx.22.a: "Take the deal."
shx.22.b: "We refuse."

shx.23.t: "Outrage over German Mining in Western Shanxi"
shx.23.d: "Western Shanxi is becoming engulfed in civil strife as German mining companies have continued their relentless expansion in the area. Some in the government had predicted this outcome, as it was impossible to conceal the fact that Yan Xishan has allowed these operations to continue.\nIt appears the only political persona to benefit from these events is Feng Yuxiang, as the local peasants have aligned themselves with his ideology after denouncing Yan for allowing foreign companies to exploit Shanxi's resources."
shx.23.a: "Damn."

shx.24.t: "Feng Yuxiang Denounces German Company"
shx.24.d: "In statements echoing the anti-concessionist rhetoric heard elsewhere in China, Feng Yuxiang has delivered a passionate speech denouncing the foreign mining companies operating in Shanxi. More and more people are attending his rallies and popular support for his ideology is on the rise."
shx.24.a: "This will damage our relations with the Germans..."

shx.25.t: "Opium Den Bust"
shx.25.d: "During a recent opium den raid, several officers loyal to Yan have been caught red-handed with the vile drug, with one being Lt. Wu, a well-entrenched officer within Yan's government. As the news reached Yan, some of his advisors have suggested that the officers and officials who were arrested in the raid be given a lighter sentence, in light of their rank and position."
shx.25.a: "No one is above the law!"
shx.25.b: "Maybe house arrest will be sufficient..."

shx.26.t: "Lieutenant Wu Controversy Spreads"
shx.26.d: "The news that Yan Xishan has only given Lt. Wu and several other officers sentences of house arrest, as opposed to prison time or even hard labour, has swept across Shanxi like wildfire. Feng has taken the opportunity both to denounce the use of opium as a tool of the Devil to pacify the Chinese, and to condemn Wu and his fellow officers for their use of the drug. One thing is certain, public support for Feng is increasing more and more, while the opinion of Yan and his leadership of Shanxi is at an all-time low."
shx.26.a: "Damn you Wu, damn you."

shx.27.t: "Feng Brings Aid to Poor Rural Villages"
shx.27.d: "Feng and his numerous missionaries have visited many of the poorer villages in Shanxi to give them much-needed aid. These visits have increased Feng's popularity in the rural areas, with many peasants saying they consider him to be the spiritual leader of Shanxi, rather than Yan. Furthermore, he has established several new churches, and Christianity has spread considerably.\nYan's advisors have strongly suggested that such excursions be stopped, as it is clear that Feng is manipulating the peasants in order to increase his popularity. Perhaps Feng's missionaries should be escorted by trustworthy government bodyguards, for their own protection of course. While in all likelihood, few people would believe this, and our move to tighten the leash on Feng would be evident to all, it would undoubtedly hinder Feng's political machinations."
shx.27.a: "We must stop him brainwashing the masses."
shx.27.b: "Let him do as he wants."

shx.28.t: "Feng Meets with the Governor of Yulin"
shx.28.d: "Feng, during his travels, has met with the Governor of Yulin. Thanks to his previous Good Will Tour, Feng is an extremely popular character in Yulin. Worryingly, details of the discussion between Feng and the governor have not yet reached Yan Xishan and his trusted ministers. This suggests that Feng and his Guominjun have been able to increase their internal security and thwart our attempts to spy on their activities."
shx.28.a: "Damn his political manoeuvring."

shx.29.t: "Yang Hucheng Discusses Military Policy"
shx.29.d: "Yang Hucheng has proposed some changes to Shanxi's military policy. His proposed alterations, though small, would put Shanxi on a more aggressive footing. Feng Yuxiang has supported this change, stating that Shanxi should not remain passive as the myriad turmoils of China continue to unfold around us."
shx.29.a: "Keep it the same."
shx.29.b: "Increase it."

shx.31.t: "Shanxi Moves Troops into Gansu"
shx.31.d: "With all our troops on the frontlines, our local garrisons and peacekeeping forces have been severely depleted. Fighting desperately to reverse our numerous military defeats at the hands of the foreigners, we have been unable to maintain public order in our territories. In the meantime, troops from our neighbors in the Shanxi Clique have crossed the border into Lanzhou, ostensibly to safeguard the population against banditry or reprisals by foreign troops. As our military cohesion is tenuous, we can ill afford to risk opening yet another front against Shanxi."
shx.31.a: "We cannot afford another war."
shx.31.b: "Resist those traitors!"

shx.32.t: "The Mas Surrender"
shx.32.d: "Our troops have swiftly and efficiently occupied Lanzhou, with the few remaining local garrison troops yielding peacefully to our forces. It seems that, given their current situation, the Ma leadership has chosen to allow our occupation to proceed."
shx.32.a: "Excellent!"

shx.33.t: "The Mas Resist"
shx.33.d: "The local garrisons and remaining reserves in Lanzhou have resisted our incursion into Gansu province, and we have received a defiant message from the Ma leadership: they demand that we remove our troops from the region immediately, or else it will be seen as an act of war. It seems that our hopes of a peaceful occupation have been dashed, and despite their precarious military position, the Ma clan is prepared to fight us in order to defend their territory."
shx.33.a: "We are already committed, war it shall be!"
shx.33.b: "Back down, we cannot afford this war."

shx.50.t: "Miners Put Down"
shx.50.d: "In an unfortunate turn of events, the forces under Lieutenant Wu were unable to resolve the conflict peacefully, and had to use force to suppress the riots. Feng has responded with a fiery speech denouncing what he calls the "Jinxi Massacre". "Such conduct by military officers is unacceptable," Feng claims, "for these men were sent to protect these people, not slaughter them." Feng's speech has rallied miners and laborers across the province, and he has promised that those officers responsible for the massacre will be held accountable for their actions."
shx.50.a: "What is he up to?"

shx.60.t: "Feng's Popularity on the Rise within the Military"
shx.60.d: "Feng's popularity within the military is becoming worrisome for those who are aligned with Yan. Some fear that if this continues to happen then Feng will have complete loyalty of the military and may ask his dear friend Yan to "step aside". Only time will tell..."
shx.60.a: "Disturbing..."

shx.61.t: "Feng's Popularity on the Rise within Shanxi"
shx.61.d: "Feng's recent political programs and initiatives have begun to bear fruit, with numerous groups from peasants to official magistrates beginning to show their support for Feng. If this trend continues, Feng will secure control of the government, effectively removing his dear friend Yan from his position."
shx.61.a: "Distressing..."

shx.63.t: "Feng's Bloodless Coup"
shx.63.d: "Feng has secured the support of both the government and the military, and has taken control of Shanxi in a bloodless coup. Yan Xishan has decided to gracefully step aside, given that he considers Feng's vision for the future of Shanxi as sufficiently similar to his own (despite Feng's zealous Christianity). Feng has allowed Yan to remain in an advisory post, as Yan's insights may well be required in the challenges that are sure to come in the future.\n\n Christian missionaries are holding special services, with hundreds coming forth to be baptised across Shanxi, further cementing Feng's Christian powerbase among the population of Shanxi. In one peculiar incident, due to the high volumes of those seeking to be baptised, Feng – ever the pragmatist – suggested using a fire hose to "Baptise the Masses". This was frowned upon by his missionaries, although it did have its desired effect. Time will tell how Feng, his Christianity, and his "Pragmatism" will continue to shape Shanxi and even China as a whole."
shx.63.a: "Pragmatic indeed..."

shx.64.t: "Feng Yuxiang Desires an Alliance"
shx.64.d: "Feng Yuxiang, the leader of the Guominjun in Shanxi, has approached us with a request for a formal military alliance. While he could be a very useful ally, he is also extremely zealous in his spiritual pursuits and may hold ulterior ambitions for the future of China."
shx.64.a: "We shall accept."
shx.64.b: "Feng cannot be trusted."

shx.65.t.accept: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Alliance"
shx.65.d.accept: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted an alliance with Feng."
shx.65.a: "Excellent."

shx.65.t.refuse: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Alliance"
shx.65.d.refuse: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused an alliance with Feng."
shx.65.b: "Their loss."

shx.300.t: "The Question of Workers' Rights"
shx.300.d: "There are two schools of thought in Shanxi about workers' rights: The first is allowing bureaucrats to introduce reforms that will more or less favour employers and businesses in Shanxi. The second is ensuring that workers' rights are protected, despite the disadvantages this presents to business owners and foreign investors."
shx.300.a: "The bureaucrats will introduce reforms. Foreign capital is a must."
shx.300.b: "Ensure that all citizens in Shanxi are protected. The foreigners must abide by our laws."

shx.301.t: "The Question of Landowners"
shx.301.d: "China is a nation in which, like many nations in the west, a few individuals own vast swaths of land, with indentured peasants working the land. New reforms could abolish these practices, with land reforms allowing the peasants to become owners of their own lands, the former landowners being forced to sell these lands to the government. \n\nAnother option is to compromise with the landowners, setting caps on their taxation of peasants, which could eventually lead to the peasants being able to afford their freedom. This option is favoured by Yan's advisors, as it would allow gradual change as opposed to radical land reforms."
shx.301.a: "China will reform gradually, we must compromise with landowners."
shx.301.b: "We require radical land reforms, force the landowners to sell."

shx.302.t: "Successful Land Reform"
shx.302.d: "Our efforts at land reform are beginning to pay serious dividents. Opium fields have been eradicated, and production of food crops has increased. Furthermore, now that some farmers are starting to own their own land, there are serious incentives to increasing efficiency, and new techniques to improve yields and reduce soil erosion are being implemented."
shx.302.a: "Excellent news!"

shx.401.t: "Shanxi Petitions Germany for Weapons"
shx.401.d: "Our diplomats have prepared a formal request for German aid in the form of arms shipments. If they accept, they will demonstrate that they are committed to sensible government and good relations in China."

shx.409.a: "Great!"

shxforeign.1.t: "A Hand in the Northwest War"
shxforeign.1.d: "With the imminent ourbreak of war between the Ma Clique and Mongolia, a golden opportunity to expand the base for Yan's ambitions has made itself apparent. With the great power of the Mongolian state poised to overrun the Hui state, the Mas find themselves wanting greatly for support, and could be persuaded to grant us control over Periphery territories in Inner Mongolia. While of course challenging the Mongolians could be an all or nothing gambit, this would also paint us as heroes coming to the defense of the nation while strengthening ourselves at the same time"
shxforeign.1.a: "Send forth the offer."
shxforeign.1.b: "The defense of the nation demands no recompense, send volunteers."
shxforeign.1.c: "The Ma clique is doomed, we look out for ourselves"

shxforeign.2.t: "Shanxi offers interventon in Suiyuan"
shxforeign.2.d: "With the threat of the Baron's invasion, their armies will soon march to our door, seeking to overrun the our lines. Seeing this opportunity, Yan Xishan has sent a communique offering to take up arms against our nomadic foe in exchange for military control Suiyuan province. While refusing could stand to bring us to our knees at the hands of our enemies, we must also consider the possibility of Shanxi's growing power, and that such a bargain may merely be burning tommorow in exchange for today"
shxforeign.2.a: "All Chinas unite against foreign intruders"
shxforeign.2.b: "A Warlord we may be, but we are not fool enough to be caught in their net"

shxforeign.3.t: "The Mas Relinquish Suiyuan"
shxforeign.3.d: "Either seeing the sense in allowing us to take up arms against the Mongol invader or perhaps simply desperate to preserve their own hides, the Ma clique has allowed us control over Suiyuan. Accordingly, we have begun hostilities with the Mongol state, whom still desire the province. The following battles will prove whether Yan's gambit was wise or foolish, may we be victorious."
shxforeign.3.a: "To War!"

shxforeign.4.t: "The Mas Relinquish Suiyuan"
shxforeign.4.d: "Banding together like cornered rats, the Shanxi Clique has fallen in with the Hui foe, seizing outer mongolia, they promised to join their now allies against us. They will find the consequences of defying our might to be terrible indeed, we shall bring fire to Taiyuan!."
shxforeign.4.a: "They hope to make up for numbers what they lack in bravery"

shxforeign.5.t: "The Mas reject our request"
shxforeign.5.d: "Surprisingly, the Ma clique has deemed that even in their darkest hour, that they would refuse the aid of their countrymen, putting their pride and territory over the defense of the nation. While it might have been tempting to use this as pretense to march our forces west regardless, such a move would be poltiically disastrous in the extreme, and thus is out of the question."
shxforeign.5.a: "If they do not want help, they can boil their heads"   
#shxforeign.5.b: "If we will not be granted this claim by cooperation, we must resort to force"

#shxforeign.6.t: "Shanxi prepares to invade!"
#shxforeign.6.d: "While the lack of compassion our "fellow" warlords possessed was hardly ever in question, few imagined that they would so openly party with foreign invaders as how the Shanxi clique intend to now, their troops have begun a naked display of aggression as they mobilize on our borders, thinking us distracted with the Mongol Menace."
#shxforeign.6.a: "Rotten Devils, the lot of them!"

#shxforeign.7.t: "Shanxi joins the fray!"
#shxforeign.7.d: "In a surprising turn of events, in a dispute over Inner Mongolia, the Shanxi Clique has seen fit not only to opportunistically involve itself in our war with the Mas, but turn on their fellow Chinese! While we are hardly ones to object, this does bring us onto a collision course with them."
#shxforeign.7.a: "Further evidence of their ignobility"

SHX_neutrality: "Shanxi Neutrality"
SHX_neutrality_desc: "The Shanxi Clique has become known for its neutrality, after it's humbling at the hands of other warlords, and now is considered less than a mere spectator in the chaos of the warlord era, beneath Republicans, Zhili, the Fengtian and even Regionalist powers. However this is not without it's advantages, not only does tis make Shanxi an appealing destination for refugees and light investment, owing to it's percieved stability but being underestimated may prove Shanxi to be a Hidden Dragon to decide the fate of China."

While this means their army is more prestigious and has combat experience, any efforts to purge Feng's influence in the clique could spell disaster."

SHX_militarism: "Dubious Militarism"
SHX_militarism_desc: "Having learnt greatly from his time in the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, Yan Xishan has found himself instilled with a firm belief in militarism, which has only been affirmed by the victory of the German war machine in the Weltkrieg, however between bitter defeats, continued neutrality and difficulty integrating his Guominjun allies into his Clique, his militarist policies have long since begun to chafe under the realities of his situation."

SHX_yan_xishan_thought: "Yan Xishan Thought"
SHX_yan_xishan_thought_desc: "Since his rise to prominence Yan Xishan has long been attempting to formulate an ideology with which to command and guide the Chinese nation. And to this end he has looked to every source which has even briefly passed his notice, a myriad influences, many of which would at first glance seem to be contradictory!\n\n§RSocialism§! is one of the many creeds Yan has considered, and not without good reason. The Chinese people have bitter memories indeed of foreign greed, hunger and poverty. To this end he has identified 3 schools of thought that pique his interest the most, first and foremost  §MNarodism§!, an Agrarian idea of Socialism focused on the peasantry rather than the urban worker, transmitted into China via Red Emigres fleeing the failure of the October Revolution. Second is the Internationale led idea of Syndycalism, a union focused form of Socialism which has ingratiated itself to Yan in the enourmous success the Sociallist Republic of Italy has had in forcing the industrialization of the formerly backwards and rural south of Italy."

However, over the years, Xishan has known that he must be wary of Yuxiang's influence in the Clique. Although Xishan holds strong control over the government of Shanxi, his power directly over the military is lacking. Yuxiang, on the other hand, has always held strong influence in the military, due to his leadership of the Guominjun, but has never held much influence in the broader government.

###Reuse in new Feng tree
#"The Guominjun was founded out of desperation. When popular liberation had so nearly been secured, its leaders were betrayed. Finding sanctuary in Shanxi, they have grown stronger and the people have now become desperate. With enthusiasm the people have brought the men of the Guominjun to power. Here we shall build a land like no other, where no man shall hunger in body or soul."
#"God so loved humanity that He sent His only Son to die for us. Yet almost two millennia later so many in China know not of The Son or his message of progress. Through sweeping principled education reform perhaps that can be addressed."
#"Heaven rewards those who work hard. Indeed, it was a particular cultural affinity for this religious value which allowed the west, and particularly protestant nations, to develop rapidly. We must promote such an ethos."
#"Shanxi has always been under threat, and with the radical ideas of the Guominjun now being implemented, the danger of conquest has increased further. The entire state bureaucracy must be reorganized and physically relocated to operate from defensible positions."
#"With their expulsion from Gansu, the Guominjun's organisational structures were fractured. With control of Shanxi, we should begin to reconstruct the Guominjin itself, separate from, but intimately intertwined with the apparatus of the state."
#"Beyond agriculture, cottage industries dominate the economy of Shanxi. Perhaps with state provision of certain traditional sectors and incentivization, some may truly embrace industry of the modern kind from their own homes. As The Lord was a carpenter, artisans and craftsmen the masses shall be."
#"The production of sufficient small arms to suit the needs of not only the army but the masses as well is essential for our defense. We must encourage new cottage industrialists to take up gunsmithing in particular."
#"We have transformed the foundations of society and we must now make clear in ideological terms the necessity of the coming struggle. The final fate of Shanxi, and all China, hangs in the balance."

### Decisions
HEJ_resist_arab_invasion:0 "Defence of Mecca"
HEJ_resist_arab_invasion_desc:0 "Surrounded by enemies on all sides, it seems unlikely the Hejazi state can survive. If it were to prove its worth in battle however, it could persuade Egypt to intervene on their behalf."

### Events
## Hejaz Revolt
hejrev.1.t:0 "Second Hejazi Revolt" 
hejrev.1.d:0 "Even though Ottoman control over the Hejaz was reestablished during the closing stages of the Weltkrieg, the prestige of the region and the martial deeds performed by its population during the 'Arab Revolt' have kept a certain romanticised image of the event alive. With Ottoman troops stuck fighting in Kurdistan and Anatolia itself against a rising tide of conservative opposition, many in Jeddah and Mecca see in this an opportunity to rekindle the old conflict and to dust off the Hashemite banner.\n\nThe presence of Ottoman garrisons in the region and the presence of the Hejaz railway however greatly complicate this new attempt at independence as a limited supply of both arms and manpower can only temporarily keep Ottoman reinforcements at bay."
hejrev.1.a:0 "Black, White, Red and Green fly once more! (Play as Hejaz)"
hejrev.1.b:0 "We've beaten them once before, we can do so again."

hejrev.2.t:0 "Medina joins the Hejazi Revolt"
hejrev.2.d:0 "Unrest has reached a breaking point in Medina as well today after a group of Arabs hoisted the Black, White, Red and Green flag above the office of the Ottoman governor. Shops owned by Turks and Jews have been destroyed in a burst of outrage against the Ottoman government as more and more Arabs see their future linked to the new Arab nationalist movement instead of the ancient Turkish relic."
hejrev.2.a:0 "Damn!"

hejrev.3.t:0 "The Hashemite Revolt"
hejrev.3.d:0 "Although soundly defeated during the Weltkrieg, our former rivals in the Hejaz have seen a return to power. Rallying behind [HEJ.GetLeader], the new Hejazi state has joined forces with Cairo and has sworn to assist in bringing down the Turkish regime. This is an unfortunate event for us however as in exchange for our support in the Egyptian war effort, a tacit understanding was reached in relation to the Red Sea land.\n\nWith the Hashemites torpedoing these plans, a revision of our previous plans seems to be in order. Some are suggesting we pursue peace with the Ottoman regime and form a neutral bloc in the war. Others are less convinced and furthermore also don't believe that our nation will have any power without the much richer and important coastline. They suggest an immediate strike on the Holy Cities to shut down the Hashemites and lock the region down. Egypt will likely offer protest but if we do so before the Hashemite state can really organise itself, they will have no choice but to accept the situation."
hejrev.3.a:0 "Send a delegation to the Sublime Porte."
hejrev.3.b:0 "Strike the Hashemites!"

hejrev.4.t:0 "Peace Offer from the Peninsula"
hejrev.4.d:0 "It seems that unity in the Arab front has already suffered its first setback as the Arabs of the inner Peninsula refuse to fight together with the Hejazis. Therefore they propose a settlement in which they would withdraw their forces from all fronts in exchange for a recognition of their independence. Furthermore they also want confirmation from the Ottoman State that the Trucial States and the Al-Hasa coastal strip are forever Arab land."
hejrev.4.a:0 "Divide et Impera."
hejrev.4.b:0 "There is no reason for peace."

hejrev.5.t:0 "Ottomans refuse our offer"
hejrev.5.d:0 "Citing their clear military superiority and their plans to finally rid themselves of the Arab issue, the Ottoman government has rebuked our offers and announced it will not stop until Riyadh is forced to surrender and the red-white flag is hoisted above its ramparts."
hejrev.5.a:0 "Most unfortunate."

hejrev.6.t:0 "The Invasion of Hejaz"
hejrev.6.d:0 "Benefitting from our current weakness, the Arabs of the inner peninsula have decided to strike Hejaz and take us out before we can reorganise ourselves. They hope that with a quick strike on Mecca and Jeddah, they can take control over the entire coastline and prevent Egyptian intervention on our behalf. With our forces stretched thin and most tribes still debating whether to even join the anti-Ottoman revolt, our odds are looking quite bad."
hejrev.6.a:0 "Hopefully Egypt will intervene on our behalf."

hejrev.7.t:0 "The Invasion of Hejaz"
hejrev.7.d:0 "Benefitting from the Hashemite weakness, the Arabs of the inner peninsula have decided to strike Hejaz and take us out before they can reorganise themselves. They hope that with a quick strike on Mecca and Jeddah, they can take control over the entire coastline and prevent an intervention by our army on behalf of the Hejazi state. As our troops are tied up fighting against the Turks further North and West, most in the Egyptian command believe that it would be best to stall for now and see whether the Arabs can make true on their threats. Should they not be able to, we shall take Hejaz under our wing but if they are then it would be wisest not to break ties with our allies."
hejrev.7.a:0 "Wait and see."
hejrev.7.b:0 "Intervene on behalf of the Hashemites!"

hejrev.8.t:0 "Fall of Mecca"
hejrev.8.d:0 "With the fall of Mecca earlier today, it seems the Hejazi revolt was only short-lived. From Abu Dhabi to Medina, the Arab peninsula is now solidly under the control of the Arabs of the hinterland. As conflict continues to rage in other parts of the Ottoman territories, we have little choice but to recognise this victory and abandon all hope of a Hashemite peninsula."
hejrev.8.a:0 "We recognise the victor."

hejrev.9.t:0 "Egypt recognises our territory"
hejrev.9.d:0 "Despite holding out hope for a different turn of events, the Egyptian government has recognised our conquest of the Holy Cities and has extended us the offer to rejoin their military alliance. Whilst many of the Pan-Arabic voices in our court are happy to accept this, the less naive men recognise that further loss of life won't net us more influence in the new Middle East and that it may be wiser to shift our attention elsewhere."
hejrev.9.a:0 "Accept their offer."
hejrev.9.b:0 "We don't need allies."

hejrev.10.t:0 "Arabia abandons the cause"
hejrev.10.d:0 "Seeing no further need for conflict now that their territorial claims have been fulfilled, the Arabs of the peninsula have refused to rejoin the Cairo Axis."
hejrev.10.a:0 "Most unfortunate."

hejrev.11.t:0 "Mecca holds strong"
hejrev.11.d:0 "Despite the odds, it seems that the Hashemite bastion has held on and can now be seen as the victor in the skirmish. With it now almost entirely certain that the Hashemite forces won't budge, the time has come to formally demand the inland Arab stand down."
hejrev.11.a:0 "We don't need further distractions."

hejrev.12.t:0 "Egypt demands an end to hostilities"
hejrev.12.d:0 "Our failed offensive in the Hejaz has now sparked the attention of the Egyptian government. Demanding that we immediately stand down and threatening us with full military support for the Hashemites, it seems we have no choice but to comply."
hejrev.12.a:0 "We fight till the end!"
hejrev.12.b:0 "We must fall back."

### Ideas 
HEJ_urban_disputes1_idea:0 "Unruly Urban Nobility"
HEJ_urban_disputes1_idea_desc:0 "Contrary to the less developed interior, the great cities of Hejaz are home to a strong and well established urban elite who participate in the world economy. These individuals, often former members of the Ottoman bureaucracy, army and institutions have opinions of their own and have grown accustomed to the ideas of democracy and republicanism which were widespread in the former Ottoman state. "
HEJ_urban_disputes2_idea:0 "Unruly Urban Nobility"
HEJ_home_islam_idea:0 "Guardians of the Hajj"
HEJ_home_islam_idea_desc:0 "Home to the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina, it is the sworn duty of our Sharif to protect and guide the faithful on their pilgrimage or Hajj to the Hejaz. Accompanying this duty however there are also significant benefits as our economy flourishes due to its connection to the Hajj. Shipping, caravan and motor companies have set up shop in the port city of Jeddah whilst a pilgrim tax is raised on every Muslim coming to visit our sacred places."

HEJ_ottoman_civil_service_idea_desc:0 "Even though we may have been opposed to the Turkish nature of their regime, we can not deny that the Ottoman Turks have left in their wake a fully functional and extensive bureaucratic machine, unrivalled elsewhere on the peninsula. As we merely took over their system during the war for independence, many of the high level functions are still held by Turks whilst almost the entire administration of the former vilayet retains the Turkish language for communication and registration."

HEJ_directorate_for_motor_transport:0 "The Directorate of Motor Transport"
HEJ_directorate_for_motor_transport_desc:0 "Motor vehicles are a new Western innovation and are becoming more prevalent in Hejaz, especially among Hajj pilgrims.

HEJ_decentralized_command_desc:0 "If the overthrowal of the Turks has taught us anything it is that a decentralised force is optimal in fighting our enemies. Rigid hierarchies will serve the military no benefit over locally coordinated troops."

HEJ_standardised_weapons_desc:0 "The Hejazi military forces lack any form of standardisation using anywhere from British, French, Ottoman and even domestically made mystery weapons in combat.

### Events ###
kyr.1.t:0 "Stronghold of Central Asian Democracy"
kyr.1.d:0 "While it is hard to say that the Republic of Kokand is a real stronghold of Central Asian Democracy, its regime is far more liberal than its neighbour, the Emirate of Bukhara. After the February Revolution in Russia, party 'Shura-i-Islam' was founded by liberal and democratic elements and adherents to the Jadidist movement. Soon after, the party split into two, with the other wing representing the conservative movement of Islamic traditionalists - 'Shura-i-Ulema'. The Jadidists won the first elections in the summer of 1917 and have pursued their agenda ever since. After the Bolshevist putsch in Russia, the republic supported the Whites and proclaimed the Kokand Autonomy, though never becoming dependent on Russia due to the lack of initiative from President Kerensky, who had his own problems in his country. Mustafa Shokay became a prime-minister of the new country and was later elected president in 1918.\n\nPerhaps, the main problem of the Kokand Republic is the confrontation between liberal Jadidists and conservative Kadimists. Shura-i-Ulema rejected to cooperate with the government of Kokand, and since then they have been in opposition with Shura-i-Islam gaining a slight majority at the elections.\n\nThe upcoming elections of 1936 will probably become the most uncertain in Kokand history as the population is tired of the presidency of Shokay."
kyr.1.a:0 "Interesting."

kyr.2.t:0 "The Upcoming Elections"
kyr.2.d:0 "The upcoming presidential elections of 1936 are going to be one of the most uncertain in the history of the Kokand Republic. On the one hand, incumbent president Mustafa Shokay, who has been in office since 1917, is the representative of the Jadidist party, Shura-i-Islam. He's a kazakh and seeks further cooperation with the Alash Autonomy, a position that has garnered him much hate among the common Kyrgyz population of the region; he is seen as a Russian lapdog and an Alash puppet. On the other hand, there is the candidate from the Kadimist party, Shura-i-Ulema, Sherali Lapin. He is a supporter of traditional values, and seeks cooperation with Mujahideen and the Emirate of Bukhara. He also relies on German support and wishes to make Kokand a part of a pan-Islamic state."
kyr.2.a:0 "Challenging."

kyr.3.t:0 "President's Speech"
kyr.3.d:0 "Mustafa Shokay, incumbent president, has delivered a speech just before the elections. He promised further cooperation with Russia and the Alash Autonomy, increasing representation of other nations in the parliament and openly denouncing the Kadimists, who, as he said, want to destroy the Republic and democracy and integrate our state into the Emirate of Bukhara. He added that the citizens of the Kokand Republic should do everything they can to preserve the independence of the country."
kyr.3.a:0 "He's promising the same thing every time."

kyr.4.t:0 "Political Crisis in Russia"
kyr.4.d:0 "The assassination of Kerensky appeared to be a surprise for Mustafa Shokay. Now he cannot count on Russian assistance, and one of his main promises during his presidency cannot be implemented. This is a serious shock for his campaign and it seems that nothing can stop Shura-i-Ulema from finally winning the elections."
kyr.4.a:0 "What will he do now?"

kyr.5.t:0 "Young Khiva Victory"
kyr.5.d:0 "There have been reports about the liberalisation of Khiva's regime. It seems that Mujahideen have lost their power in Khiva, becoming a serious threat to Mujahideen and Kadimist influence. It seems that now Shura-i-Ulema can only rely on Bukhara."
kyr.5.a:0 "The Khanate has fallen."

kyr.6.t:0 "The Regime Changed in Bukhara"
kyr.6.d:0 "We have just received reports that our neighbor and rival in the Emirate of Bukhara have undergone a dramatic shift in their political climate. The Emir seems to finally given up and the rule of Mujahideen in Bukhara has ended."
kyr.6.a:0 "Finally, a friendly regime in Bukhara."
kyr.6.b:0 "We're the last true political force of the Steppes."

kyr.7.t:0 "1936 Presidential Elections"
kyr.7.d:0 "Finally, today the citizens of Kokand Republic will vote for their leader. Polling sites across the nation are packed with long lines and media crews as the nation is abuzz with election fever. As day turns to night and polling stations close, the votes are counted. With their final tally coming within the next few days, the final count has declared..."
kyr.7.a:0 "...Mustafa Shokay and the Jadidists secure their dynasty."
kyr.7.b:0 "...Sherali Lapin and the Kadimists have seized the day."

kyr.8.t:0 "Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov Enters Kokand"
kyr.8.d:0 "The [TRK.GetNameDef] has recently had to deal with socialist insurgency in the Karakum region. Luckily for them, the uprising was crushed, but unfortunately for us, Mukhitdinov has crossed the border and is now hiding somewhere in Kokand. Even now as we speak, that marxist devil snakes his way through our lands, untethered by morals or law."
kyr.8.a:0 "Find him and arrest him!"
kyr.8.b:0 "Leave him alone - it's unlikely he will rebel."

kyr.9.t:0 "Socialist Insurgency in Ak-Mechet"
kyr.9.d:0 "It was stupid to think that the socialist movement in Kokand was weak. Formally, the Union of Muslim Workers is represented by Nazir Torekulov in Kokand, but he's unlikely to be a big threat. However, with the arrival of Mukhitdinov, he has managed to raise an uprising in the industrial region of Tashkent."
kyr.9.a:0 "Send there troops."

kyr.10.t:0 "Mukhitdinov Proclaims Workers' Republic in Tashkent"
kyr.10.d:0 "Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov has proclaimed a socialist republic in Tashkent. While the idea is seemingly nonsensical and absurd, it has still occurred nonetheless. He's still a threat and he's supported by many proletarians in both Tashkent and our borders, we must remain vigilant."
kyr.10.a:0 "Liquidate the unrest at any cost."
kyr.10.b:0 "Ask Bukhara for help."

kyr.11.t:0 "Kokand Asks for Help"
kyr.11.d:0 "The government of Kokand has asked us to intervene in Tashkent and help to liquidate the socialist unrest in the border region. If we were to help, we could finally remove this marxist taint once and for all, or we can let the rebels be and have them sow discord in our historic enemies."
kyr.11.a:0 "Sure, we will send a force to aid in crushing the rebels."
kyr.11.b:0 "A destabilized Kokand is better for us."

kyr.12.t:0 "Bukhara Intervenes in Tashkent."
kyr.12.d:0 "The government of [TRK.GetNameDef] has agreed to intervene in Tashkent. Our joint forces have liquidated the unrest with their joint strength. Luckily, Mukhitdinov was also murdered in the crossfire and the uprising was finally suppressed."
kyr.12.a:0 "Victory!"

kyr.13.t:0 "Bukhara Refused to Intervene."
kyr.13.d:0 "Bukhara’s administration has refused to intervene and help us to liquidate the socialist rebels. Left alone, it will be harder for us to suppress the uprising, but we must try lest our brave and proud democracy succumb to chaos."
kyr.13.a:0 "At least we tried, we march alone."

kyr.14.t:0 "Socialists Crushed"
kyr.14.d:0 "We managed to crush socialist rabble rousers once and for all. Instigator of the uprising, Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov, has been slain by our forces in the fighting and it seems nothing can stop us now from achieving our goals."
kyr.14.a:0 "Victory!"

kyr.15.t:0 "Mukhitdinov Overthrows the Government."
kyr.15.d:0 "The protesters not only managed to repulse our forces, but many of our soldiers refused to fire on the protesters, instead joining their ranks. The uprising was supported in Pishkek as well, and it became too much for our regime to bear. The revolutionaries, spewing forth from Tashkent, seized administrative buildings in Pishkek and Osh, and Mukhitdinov arrived in the capital. Later that day he proclaimed the People's Republic of Turkestan."
kyr.15.a:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"

hawaii.16.c:0 "Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole Kawānanakoa shall be crowned King."
hawaii.16.b:0 "Lydia Liliuokalani shall be crowned Queen."

hawaii.17.t:0 "The Royal Hawaiian Tour"
hawaii.17.d:0 "The Royal Family of Hawaii, despite being present and politically active for centuries, have yet to attract the respect of other monarchies around the world. This oversight obviously being due to the imperial yoke of America, only now corrected. The House of Kawānanakoa now prepares to reintroduce Hawaii to the world, in particular to the Yamoto and the Hohenzollerns. They may even pass by Brazil, as news of their royal family reviving brings us much comfort in our returned glory."

hawaii.22.t:0 "Hawaiian Renaissance"
hawaii.22.d:0 "The first Hawaiian renaissance occurred during the reign of Kamehameha V in the mid-1800s. It brought a revival of Hawaiian culture as well as spurring on construction projects including renovating Iolani Palace. However the Americans would come and overthrow the monarchy and much of the energy from this moment died then.\n\nHowever, now that the monarchy has been restored to the throne, [HAW.getleader] is pushing for a renewal of the same ideals that occurred during the first renaissance. For the first time in decades there is a revival and interest in all aspects of Hawaiian culture from the native language, traditional arts, hula, music and more. Similar to the first renaissance, the new renaissance has brought about energy into renovating buildings and improving the various buildings throughout the country."
hawaii.22.a:0 "A new day for Hawaii."

Now that the Monarchy has been restored again, these orders and the other medals the Kingdom gives out can resume having the proper prestige that they deserve."
hawaii.23.a:0 "Shiny."

hawaii.24.t:0 "Samoa and other Polynesian monarchies"
hawaii.24.d:0 "While the Monarchy of Hawaii is the largest of the islands, there are others in the pacific with their own monarchies, notably Samoa. To that end [HAW.getleader] has been presented with a proposal to revive the ideas of the Kalākaua who wished to create a Polynesian Confederation. This would support the rights of the various islands outside of the Hawaiian chain and their monarchies and work to form bonds of friendship between the various kings and queens."
hawaii.24.a:0 "Give support to the Monarchies."

hawaii.25.t:0 "Church of Hawaii"
hawaii.25.d:0 "In the old kingdom of Hawaii, the monarchy converted to the Anglican church and established the church of Hawaii, part of the Anglican communion, as the state religion of the Kingdom. When the monarchy was overthrown, the church of Hawaii was disestablished and made part of the American Episcopalian church and it lost its bishopric. Now that Hawaii is independent, the Church of Hawaii is gaining influence again and even had its stolen bishopric returned to it. The question though is should the Church be given state support again or should that be a personal matter for the royal family?"

### Republic Path ###

hawaii.31.t:0 "Introducing Miss Dolcinea"
hawaii.31.d:0 "The competition with the United Fruit Company has entered into the mass media era with UFC's introduction of Miss Chiquita, a new mascots designed by Dik Browne. In response to this and in order to reach the young customers that UFC is targeting, James Dole has created a Mascot for Dole Fruit. Dolecinea, a Spanish woman who serves as a vehicle for Dole to criticize UFC's treatment of Latin Americans, as well as distract from their own hold in Hawaii. Ads are beginning to show up in children's' media of Dolecinea's adventures, enticing customers to buy "cruelty free" pineapples over bananas."
hawaii.31.a:0 "This'll help with sales."

hawaii.32.t:0 "Status of Japanese Hawaiians"
hawaii.32.d:0 "There are approximately 150 thousand Japanese immigrants living in Hawaii today, a third of the total population, most of whom are first or second generation American citizens. The collapse of Federal authority on the islands has precipitated a new eminent influence from the Japanese Empire, which complicates future classification of Japanese residents. More liberal elements of the Hawaiian Republic wish to officially enfranchise Japanese residents as full citizens. The military elements, still attached to their exclusively white origins, have stated their position against Japanese citizenship. Thirdly the Japanese Empire itself has surprised us by asserting in telegrams that Japanese residents are still legally Japanese citizens. How do we respond?"
hawaii.32.a:0 "The Japanese here are citizens."
hawaii.32.b:0 "The Japanese here are merely resident aliens."

hawaii.33.t:0 "Dealing with the Hawaiian Militias"
hawaii.33.d:0 "The militias that have kept Hawaii free from invaders are in need of fresh blood. They traditionally only recruit white Hawaiians and only have access to military surplus weapons. While the weapon situation is easy to remedy, the recruitment is still stifled. Governor Dole has come to the militias to propose that they face the political realities of the territory and drop their racial requirement. The militia leaders continue to refuse the advice, and the Governor has come to consider an alternative solution. Fire the leaders of the militias and appoint yes-men. This would reflect negatively on the status of white Hawaiians in general however."
hawaii.33.a:0 "Give up on reforms."
hawaii.33.b:0 "Replace the militia leaders."

hawaii.34.t:0 "Presidential Elections of [GetYear]"
hawaii.34.d:0 "It is time for another general election. The winner of the election will determine which party's leader shall be elected President. Who shall the people of the Republic of Hawaii vote for?"

hawaii.34.b:0 "Republican Party."
hawaii.34.c:0 "Hui Aloha Aina."

### Commune ###

hawaii.62.t:0 "Radical art in Honolulu"
hawaii.62.d:0 "The Honolulu Museum of Art is a testament to the growing wealth and prestige of the Island under American rule. However, it's use as a centre for art creation and promotion has been stifled but it's overreliance on formalistic mainlander art. There exists no promotion of native art, nor any of the revolutionary art that other Communards across the world have created. We must rectify this with what little funds are available. We have cleared space for a new wing of the Honolulu Art Museum dedicated to...."
hawaii.62.a:0 "Modern Art."
hawaii.62.b:0 "Native Hawaiian Art."

hawaii.63.t:0 "Integrating American Communards"
hawaii.63.d:0 "The Commune of Hawaii itself has origins in the planning halls of California between Longshoremen and Unionists for Dole Fruit. This important tie to mainland United States has allowed for us to import bureaucrats and labor organizers to Hawaii in order to better achieve socialism. However, these last few months have shown some disunity between the longtime resident organizers and the newer arrivals. The new ministers are less than knowledgeable about agriculture and shipbuilding, and use their wages to import increasingly expensive goods from the mainland. This issue would be ignorable, if not for a growing resentment in the more egalitarian society we all are building. Several men and women have anonymously met to ask for "cozy desk jobs" as a reward for their months of patience in the new Commune. How do we respond?"
hawaii.63.a:0 "No! You knew what you signed up for."
hawaii.63.b:0 "Fine! Take a seat."

hawaii.64.t:0 "General Election of [GetYear]"
hawaii.64.d:0 "It is time for another general election to decide the makeup of the People's council of Hawaii. The party or faction with the most seats shall have their leader be elected as General Secretary. Who shall the people vote for?"

hawaii.64.b:0 "Hawaiian Federation of Labor."

#Army General Descriptions By Drozdovite#
#########################################

HAW_DELOS_EMMONS_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W January 17, 1889, in Huntington, West Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Delos Carleton Emmons graduated from the United States Military Academy in June 1909 as a second lieutenant. He was assigned as the CO of the Company B of the 30th Infantry Regiment, and would follow the 30th until July 1916, where he was promoted to first lieutenant and joined the Signal Corps to become an aviator. He became a Captain by July 1917, a Major in June 1918 and a Colonel in August 1918. He'd transfer to the US Army Air Service in 1920, and in 1921 he completed the Air Service Course at Harvard University. He'd hold several influential posts in the US Army Air Service during the twenties, and would graduate from the Air Corps Tactical School and the Command and General Staff School before 1930. He was assigned to Hawaii in March 1934 as the CO of the 18th Composite Wing and he has held that post until the outbreak of the American Civil War. With the local tensions high, and seeing the writing on the wall, Delos decided to join the revolt against the Federal Government which helped proclaim an independent Hawaii. This has granted him the promotion to Brigadier General, but it is uncertain if he's actually prepared for the job.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He is known to have made racist displays against Japanese-Americans in the island, citing the possibility of a Japanese attack on the island."
HAW_BARNEY_HAJIRO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 16, 1916, in Hawaii, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Barney Fushimi Hajiro was born from a Japanese immigrant family residing in Hawaii, and he enlisted in the army in 1934. Since then, he has performed remarkably well in the officer courses, and the outbreak of the Civil War has made the lack of capable officers in Hawaii a dire issue, prompting a premature promotion for Hajiro to the status of General. While he is a capable officer, he's been granted too much power and responsibility for a man of his experience, and it's uncertain if he'll be able to keep up...\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Holds a deep grudge against Emmons due to Emmons discrimination of Japanese-American Citizens."
HAW_ROBERT_RICHARDSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 27, 1882, in Charleston, South Carolina\n§YMilitary Career:§W Robert Charlwood Richardson Jr. graduated from West Point as a second lieutenant in 1904, and was a member of the 14th Cavalry Regiment during the Philippine War guerrilla insurrections, where he personally fought against hostile Moros tribesmen. During one skirmish against the tribesmen, he was wounded in combat, for which he was awarded the Purple heart and the Silver Star. He'd continue to fight with his regiment until October 1905, where he returned to San Francisco. He led the 14th Cavalry during the 1906 earthquake as a part of the government response to the disaster. In October 1906, he rejoined West Point as an Assistant Instructor in Foreign Languages until 1911, where he rejoined the 14th Cavalry for a second tour in the Philippines. He'd return again to the US in 1914, and served as Assistant Professor of English in West Point until 1917, where he was sent to France as an observer for the dying Entente. His observations in France were quite valuable for the US Military Academy, and once the defeat of France became imminent, he was recalled back to the US. He was ascended to Captain in 1920, and after signing up for a third tour in the Philippines, he became a Major. He was later sent to the Republic of Italy as a military attaché during the conflicts that shaped the region and would return as a lieutenant colonel in 1928, where he'd rejoin his beloved 13th Cavalry once more at Fort Riley in Kansas. He'd be rotated as commanding officer throughout many regions of the United States, until he promoted and assigned to Hawaii in early 1936. While he's one of the most experienced members of the staff, his loyalty to Hawaii itself isn't really solid as there seems to have been a struck of luck for Richardson to be spared the chaos that now ravages the mainland when he actually has no connections to the island."
HAW_JOSEPH_MCNARNEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 28, 1893, in Emporium, Pennsylvannia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joseph Taggart McNarney graduated from the United States Military Academy in June 1915, having attended lessons with great officers like Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower. McNarney served with the 21st Infantry Regiment at Vancouver Barracks, Washington, and with the 37th Infantry Regiment at Yuma, Arizona. He became one of the first first lieutenants to begin flight training when he signed up to the Signal Corps Aviation School in 1916, from where he'd graduate a year later as a Junior Military Aviator. He was promoted to Captain in May 1917 and posted in New Mexico. He'd later take charge of the flying school at Gerstner Field, in Luisiana. He'd move in late 1920 to Langley Field, where he became a student of the Air Service Field Officers School and remained in Langley as an instructor. He'd graduate with honors from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth in 1926, and he completed the Army War College course in 1930. He succeded Major Spaatz in the 7th Bomb group after Spaatz promotion. McNarney then became an instructor at the Army War College in Washington, serving from August 1933 to March 1935, where he was redeployed as an attaché to Canada. With the outbreak of the Civil War, McNarney decided that it was best to leave to a place where his particular skills were in short supply, and the Hawaian staff was more than happy to welcome him from Canada."

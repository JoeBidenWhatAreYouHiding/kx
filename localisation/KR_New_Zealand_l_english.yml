NZL_first_labour_victory:0 "First Labour Government"
NZL_first_labour_victory_desc:0 "Prime Minister Savage has ridden the waves of his popularity to the fruits of victory this election season, as it appears that New Zealand has put it's faith in the man who promises to give forth a caring hand in this time of economic rut."
NZL_legislate_compulsory_unionism:0 "Legislate Compulsory Unionism"
NZL_legislate_compulsory_unionism_desc:0 "New Zealand will not be taken for a fool by conniving monopolists like so many other countries have, thus we shall mandate our work force to be in a union so our working men can be educated in their basic rights and entitlement for the sweat they expend in our country's service."
NZL_establish_proper_unemployment_relief:0 "Establish a Proper Unemployment Relief"
NZL_establish_proper_unemployment_relief_desc:0 "New Zealand workers have been left to their own devices to survive after the stock market crash, and having a permanent state of soup kitchens just will not do. The Labour party will grant monetary relief to these downtrodden men in these times, giving them a raft in this rocky sea."
NZL_raise_education_support:0 "Raise Support for Universal Education"
NZL_raise_education_support_desc:0 "What cruel world is it that a man shall not be given the ability to raise himself up just because of his placement in the societal and economic ladder. All men of Aotearoa shall be given the chance to go to a university and advance themselves into higher fields."
NZL_massive_social_housing_expansion:0 "Expand Housing Projects"
NZL_massive_social_housing_expansion_desc:0 "From the homeless in Wellington, to even our Maori brothers forced to live upon the prairie without more than a tent, we must provide shelter to all of our isle. Let not a single New Zealander go without a home he can call his own!"
NZL_pass_worker_compensation:0 "Workers Compensation Ensured"
NZL_pass_worker_compensation_desc:0 "If a man who is helping build our nation injures himself in the process, what would it seem for us to leave him helpless? If they shed blood and bone for our nation, we shall ensure they are paid back with compensation for the workman's injuries."
NZL_worker_based_arbitration:0 "End the Arbitration Betrayal"
NZL_worker_based_arbitration_desc:0 "The previously practiced method of Arbitration was abandoned by uncaring governance decades ago, betraying our workers and preventing them appealing to their fellow man when the boss upstairs was cruel. We must give them a say once more, by allowing Arbitration to make a long awaited return."
NZL_industrial_efficacy_bill:0 "Industrial Efficiency Bill"
NZL_industrial_efficacy_bill_desc:0 "New Zealand is still blighted with grimy factories, less than spectacular conditions on the work floor, and the ensuing lack of product this archaic and blast to the Victorian past this system produces. We must overhaul our factories into a more modern and flat out human grid."

### Labour 2

NZL_second_labour_victory:0 "Second Labour Government"
NZL_second_labour_victory_desc:0 "Labour has once more earned the popular mandate to govern this isle, and as such, we begin the effort of moving into the Premier Residence and establishing our office for governance once more."
NZL_universal_super:0 "Implement Universal Superannuation"
NZL_universal_super_desc:0 "To prevent such a woeful market crash like the banks failing ever again, we should turn from them, and instead look to having people guard their own retirement by putting funds into a government operated superannuation, where the people can rest knowing that we would never let their future's collapse on them."
NZL_expand_taxes_war:0 "Expand War Taxes"
NZL_expand_taxes_war_desc:0 "New Zealand's industry takes tremendous effort to convert towards producing for prolonged military endeavors, thus we must request from the people, just as much effort funding such transition and production for the war effort."
NZL_maori_social_and_economic_act:0 "The Maori Social and Economic Advancement Act"
NZL_maori_social_and_economic_act_desc:0 "Our Maori allies in Labour and related organizations are still feeling under-represented, even by our party promises and united front representation. We must give them a practical win, by pushing towards a bill that will fund their advancement in society."
NZL_backbench_revolt:0 "Pass Party Reforms"
NZL_backbench_revolt_desc:0 "The backbench revolt is resulting in our party unable to properly pass legislation, as we cannot even vote as a unified bloc. We will have to look into giving them some concessions for their demands, in order to unify the party before the coalition out votes us."
NZL_conscription:0 "Justified Conscription"
NZL_conscription_desc:0 "Some government's cruelly send off their sons to die in an unpopular war, fought by elites. We look down upon such dull bloodshed of one's own countrymen, however the need of our army for men is dire, so we will have to bite back our worry and draft the best and most fit to outfit our army."
NZL_create_the_minimum_wage:0 "Create a Minimum Wage"
NZL_create_the_minimum_wage_desc:0 "How can any citizen hope to buy a better home, or even feed and clothe themself if they are not given proper wages? We will have to push forth a minimum wage to ensure all workers are given compensation for their labour, even if the owners swear upon us."

### Labour 3

NZL_third_labour_victory:0 "Third Labour Government"
NZL_third_labour_victory_desc:0 "Our continued domination of New Zealand politics shows that it pays to care for the people, and in return, the people will care for us. We once more move into our office's and parliament spots, and this time we must fight to keep our reign secure."
NZL_seize_party_reins:0 "Party Room Schemes"
NZL_seize_party_reins_desc:0 "With dominance over all other parties in the parliament, we must ensure our great gains in progress are not tossed to the wind by other parties' growth. Thus we must plan amongst ourselves on how we can take the seats of each MP into Labour's control, and keep out coalition votes from ever reaching the floor"
NZL_debt_free_currancy:0 "Left Social Credit Theory"
NZL_debt_free_currancy_desc:0 "It was always an ideal to distribute necessities and perhaps even luxury to those who cannot afford such goods. But this was propped up by radicals who let their own vision leave out the truly downtrodden peoples that might not fit with their values. Here in New Zealand, we will make the dream a reality, fixing the wrongs done by such programs before."
NZL_abolish_the_country_quota:0 "Abolish the Country Quota"
NZL_abolish_the_country_quota_desc:0 "The Country Quota has always violated the ideal of one person holding one vote, instead it was always a prize given to the rural communities that voted for the coalition, giving them unwarranted power for smaller representation. Labour shall do away with this blatant spoils system, and move toward true democracy manifest."
NZL_repeal_head_tax:0 "Repeal the Head Tax"
NZL_repeal_head_tax_desc:0 "We have been separated from Australasia for nearly a decade now, yet some of it's archaic laws still linger on us, including a Head Tax on any Chinese immigrants coming to our land, even those who offer up working for a home. We shall repeal such unjust taxation that keeps out asylum seekers."
NZL_peace_time_conscription:0 "Peacetime Conscription"
NZL_peace_time_conscription_desc:0 "We dread sending our boys into fights that they may not come back from, and thankfully the risk to life and limb has decreased in the world somewhat. However, we have such a small manpower pool, we will need to keep conscription in place just to ensure our isle is guarded in peacetime."

### legion 1

NZL_the_legion_takes_hold:0 "The Legion Takes Hold"
NZL_the_legion_takes_hold_desc:0 "Disillusioned by the lack of effort on part of the Coalition parties, the people of New Zealand have turned towards the Legion and Begg to carry them forth from this depressive rut. Despite being given their mandate, our party is heavily divided between Keynesians, Non-Interventionists and Social Creditors on how our economy should be run. We will have to find a path forward with such differing opinions in our big tent."
NZL_divide_the_country_into_shires:0 "Divide into Regional Shires"
NZL_divide_the_country_into_shires_desc:0 "In order to diffuse the burning fuse that is ignited within our tent party, we should fully endorse giving power to the people that elected us in, thus allowing them to make their own decisions. Down all the way to the individual shire will they decide their own hand and thus the people who elect their officials, shall also be the ones who thereby elect how their economy is run in that region."
NZL_expand_membership:0 "Mass Party Expansion"
NZL_expand_membership_desc:0 "Begg has turned an organization of nothing into something of near grandeur in its size alone, even if it blurred the lines of unity of purpose. That strive will not end here, for with our victory, we shall extend a velvet hand to those acceptable Labour and Coalition members who can join the Legion, and democratically lead their shire power bases in a similar fashion to the rest of the legion's individualist thought."
NZL_lazefair_faction_victory:0 "Laissez-Faire Economics Embedded"
NZL_lazefair_faction_victory_desc:0 "How can a man born in Auckland know what's best for a man in Queensland? Only a fool of a chair would try and put a steel reign over regions he has never entered, and thus, our government shall take a hands off approach to how separate shire's direct themselves. Even a good hearted shepard can lead the pack into a wolf's den if it does not know it's herd."
NZL_social_credit:0 "Social Credit Solutions"
NZL_social_credit_desc:0 "All across the Anglo rooted countries on this fair earth, many academics discuss how best to care for the nation's populace when all are hurting in this modern market. Here in New Zealand, our members discuss how best to care for the downtrodden, and distributism has propped its head as a solution to this crisis. Those forgotten and left in the dirt shall be propelled forth into the middle class by our hand."
NZL_kaynesian_faction:0 "Keynesian Interventionism"
NZL_kaynesian_faction_desc:0 "Evan Perry, our economic minister, has recently taken up a stance that has certainly made him no friends in the mainstream party. He proposes introducing a new deal to the economy, where the government will have an iron grip over matters, so as to both create projects for jobs, and to ensure we never fall into this economic mire ever again."
NZL_end_state_paternalism:0 "End State Paternalism"
NZL_end_state_paternalism_desc:0 "The government shall no longer have a say in forcing action's upon its sovereigns. The only thing that has resulted as an attempt of such archaic policies is anger on half of the citizens, and incompetency on our part. We shall leave destiny in our citizen's hands."
NZL_conservitive_outreach:0 "Conservative Outreach"
NZL_conservitive_outreach_desc:0 "Our success is becoming apparent over the united and national party, to the point we are siphoning voters and even MP's from them. And even with those too stubborn to jump ship, we can approach them and reach deals with them, for our similarities are more than our differences. We shall unite the right."
NZL_begg_plan:0 "Implement the Begg Plan"
NZL_begg_plan_desc:0 "Begg has introduced a radical, and similarly controversial, plan to the Legion, one where we shall pay off our vast debt caused by the great war, black monday, and ensuing split from Australasia, back to Ottawa in one fell swoop. We do this not by monetary means, but by taking in their unemployed workers, bringing them to our isle, and giving them the jobs they so desperately need."
NZL_oppisition_to_tooley_street:0 "Fight against Tooley Street Bankers"
NZL_oppisition_to_tooley_street_desc:0 "Our attempts to march into better days have continually been impeded by a conglomerate of whining British Exiles, those who have taken residence and headquartered in Tooley Street. These bankers put their own monetary hold over our nation's attempts to safeguard New Zealand prosperity."
NZL_implement_radical_democracy:0 "Implement Radical Democracy"
NZL_implement_radical_democracy_desc:0 "The grubby hands of Labour and the Tories have gerrymandered our fair nation past the point of redemption, taking power from the hands of equal constituents and putting them towards their own use. We must move toward democracy in it's basest form, where the majority decide who shall be Prime Minister of this country.

### legion 2

NZL_legion_two:0 "The Legion Marches Further"
NZL_legion_two_desc:0 "Our vast reforms that we implemented last election cycle have proven immensely popular, and thus carried our populist wave into yet another term in office here in Wellington. And thankfully after getting our organization's teething problems out of the way, we should hopefully move as a more unified bloc this time around."
NZL_convert_patlitable_form:0 "Move to the center"
NZL_convert_patlitable_form_desc:0 "We have for far too long been a fairly gray organization, hard to describe as we have had differing identities all over, depending on which sect you came across. Now with our populist wave riding on the popularity of a truly democratic movement for the middle class, we shall fill the vacuum the desolate coalition has consistently failed to, that of a right wing New Zealand they can call home."
NZL_absorb_conservitive_intrests:0 "Absorb Conservative Interests"
NZL_absorb_conservitive_intrests_desc:0 "Our efforts to make good with conservative voices across the table has not been unsuccessful, as our rightist populism has attracted many a soul from the coalition to become all but officially, one with the legion. We now make a play to absorb Reform into our legion, with Sidney Holland being keen on such a vast unity that our two power blocs would bring to the table."
NZL_legion_is_yours:0 "Fight Against Bankers and Dole Bludgers"
NZL_legion_is_yours_desc:0 "The radicals of our legion have gained enough popularity to seize the chair of our organization, and thus the leadership as a whole. They have already begun a blitz to fulfill an agenda that would see those who have wronged our legion and New Zealand as a whole called out and targeted until they no longer can leech on our fair land and people. "
NZL_cambel_inspiration:0 "Inspiration from Campbell"
NZL_cambel_inspiration_desc:0 "Despite what Labour agitators would try to describe as a despicable force, the New Guard of Campbell back in Australia had the right mindset to bring a nation out of the gutter. The Legion here must take notes if they seek to bring pride and purpose back to this nation. "
NZL_democracy_with_a_strong_helmsmen:0 "Democracy with a Strong Helmsman"
NZL_democracy_with_a_strong_helmsmen_desc:0 "While democracy shall remain a part of New Zealander life, we must put our faith in a strong executive to guide our vessel through storm currents wherever they may come. What is the point of a parliament leading us when their own petty squabbles can gridlock our governance for months at a time? Only the strong may lead us."
NZL_conservitivism_without_weakness:0 "Conservatism Without Weakness"
NZL_conservitivism_without_weakness_desc:0 "We have managed to safeguard our middle class, and even create a prosperity amongst our citizenry that hasn't been seen since before the depression hit. And yet despite all that, we stayed firm and dedicated to keeping our way of life intact, without drastic changes or sacrifices from the standard New Zealander way of life. We do not seek to stray from the path that has been walked before, as we know it's reliable."
NZL_reduce_goverment_beuraccy:0 "Reduce Government Bureaucracy"
NZL_reduce_goverment_beuraccy_desc:0 "War, Cancer, Paperwork. The world and humanity would all be better off without such occurrences and problems, and while the former two may be unavoidable, we can certainly curb the latter. Needless government eyes and hands in every way of life shall be cut down to the necessities only, as we do not require a vast office complex to question the way of our citizen's lives."
NZL_remove_problamatic_members:0 "Remove Problematic members"
NZL_remove_problamatic_members_desc:0 "Our achieved unity between all those who love democracy yet wish to see a prosperous New Zealand has been a project that we had to sweat for. Yet it was almost all for naught with the radicals whose rhetoric almost scared away the merger with Reform. We must take a firm hand and push away those who spread division here."
NZL_strong_hand_aganist_syndicalism:0 "A Strong Hand against Syndicalism"
NZL_strong_hand_aganist_syndicalism_desc:0 "Fair maiden England, Workhorse America, even our own union with Australia. All sullied and undermined by those red parasites who agitate and carve out discord amongst a populace to hate each other. In order to protect what little we have left on these islands of ours, we must strangle all socialist sentiment in the cradle."

###united 1
NZL_united_reform_victory:0 "1st Coalition Victory"
NZL_united_reform_victory_desc:0 "After Billy Hughes signed the Consolidation of Resources Act, and democracy in our confederation was suspended, the Reform and United parties worked together as the Kiwi's interests in the Australasian experiment. Although that failed, the coalition remained intact to prevent Labour from benefitting from a conservative split, which leads us to today, where our coalition has won, but remains on unsteady ground due to the two differing parties."
NZL_toe_the_canadian_line:0 "Toe the Canadian Line"
NZL_toe_the_canadian_line_desc:0 "We continue to remain inspired by Canadian ideals, not only for they represent the long dead Commonwealth dream in the Entente, but also because politically we are in a quite similar situation to them. We must tread carefully and entertain the spirits of Reform, for if our coalition splits now, the red menace will take advantage of it."
NZL_balance_the_budget:0 "Balance the Budget"
NZL_balance_the_budget_desc:0 "Besides Labour terms, the way a PM and his cabinet were to propose a budget and toe according to that has remained a status quo, an established orthodoxy in our country's economics. Let's return to that, by keeping to the plan and not raising taxes anymore than needed, to keep the citizen's satisfaction up."
NZL_relif_work_for_unemployed:0 "Relief Work For Unemployed"
NZL_relif_work_for_unemployed_desc:0 "Our nation's labor pool has been in dire straits since Black Monday hit, and we desperately need to get them back to work if they can have any hope of coming home with wages again. We must find any work we can pay them to get about doing in order to help mitigate this unemployment crisis."
NZL_anti_tammyism:0 "Anti-Tammanyism"
NZL_anti_tammyism_desc:0 "Ever since our nation has restored it's individual independence, we have been plagued by blood sucking political elites, who control small little fiefdoms in counties and municipalities, and create unconquerable machines by appointing allies to seats. Let us combat this with a simple first step, by removing their ability to appoint 'servants' to seats."
NZL_remove_housing_controls:0 "Remove Housing Controls"
NZL_remove_housing_controls_desc:0 "The inability for companies and entrepreneurs to build housing that shall shelter our population is the very reason that we have downtrodden men sleeping in boxes on the street. Let us put power in the hands of those who can make a difference on the ground."
NZL_end_upper_house:0 "End Upper House Red Tape"
NZL_end_upper_house_desc:0 "Modeled after the House of Lords of deceased England, the Legislative Council is a long gone glory of it being intended as a check and balance in our democracy, serving as red tape in finalizing bills and wasting taxpayer money. The National Party will appoint new members to this council. Their purpose? To abolish the council from within."
NZL_absorb_country_party:0 "Absorb the Country Party"
NZL_absorb_country_party_desc:0 "Long lost brothers in arms, the Country party was formed when a farmer's union, which felt that we had lost touch with our rural roots, packed up and ran with their electors. Now with them finally calming down as that controlling union has been dying out, we can bring them back into our fold in good grace."
NZL_limited_abitration:0 "Limited Arbitration"
NZL_limited_abitration_desc:0 "Although we commonly see Labour and their legion of unions as enemies, we must not let this partisan stance turn into hatred of the working man. To earn their satisfaction, and prevent them from moving towards syndicalism, we shall ensure they still have a say with our government, via keeping the arbitration channels open."
NZL_war_preperations:0 "War Preparations"
NZL_war_preperations_desc:0 "The Entente moves as a unified force, preparing to move out to get vengeance for the wrongs done unto us by socialist forces. We must prepare ourselves as well for this grand struggle coming up, for Fair New Zealand would never leave her oaths un-fulfilled."
NZL_union_busting:0 "Union Busting"
NZL_union_busting_desc:0 "We cannot afford to have our country's industry and workforce continuously halted by agitators and hostile workers. We must break these forces that refuse to adapt to what is expected of them, in order for wider New Zealand to bring itself out of this hard time."
NZL_strengthen_country_quota:0 "Strengthen the Country Quota"
NZL_strengthen_country_quota_desc:0 "The country is what makes up Reform's history, mass and its legacy of serving. We cannot fail those who have propelled us forth by leaving them behind to be torn apart by the vultures of Labour and Legion majorities. Let us ensure the Country Quota safeguard never fails, not in this century."

NZL_two_partys_united_desc:0 "Although the two head's of Reform and United constantly tried to nip each other in the neck, it was loss that ironically brought us closer into a unified faction. Now, National shall carry the spirits of conservatives all across New Zealand, into brighter days."
NZL_coats_off_with_coates:0 "Coats off with Coates"
NZL_coats_off_with_coates_desc:0 "The slogan that the Reform party has been championing has become one that is chanted and taken to heart across the nation. That of a PM willing to take his coat off, pull his sleeves up, and get down in the dirt with the common man in order to fix this nation. Government shall toil alongside the farmer in pulling our nation into a hopeful future."

NZL_Liberal_Roots_desc:0 "The Liberal Party forms the foundation of United's roots, where many of our current politicians remember the days where the Liberal party emerged and solved the crisis of the day with pragmatic thinking, and New Zealand emerged as a modern nation in it's political thinking. Let us appeal with nostalgia to the old, and historical lessons to the young."
NZL_loyal_briton_party:0 "Apirana Ngata's Maori Reforms"
NZL_loyal_briton_party_desc:0 "Sir Apirana Ngata has been the foremost Maori politician in our party and his legacy has stayed with us. Whilst Labour has joined alongside Ratana, and thus many Maori flock to them, we will not abandon our own efforts to gain their vote. Thus, we shall invite Ngata back to the cabinet, this time ensuring his reforms for Maori land go through with a watchful and honest eye."
NZL_conservitive_intervention:0 "Conservative Intervention"
NZL_true_party_buisness_desc:0 "Whilst those cretins in United may complain about our actions, Reform has no qualms with using the government as the frontline tool in fighting for the working man, all to ensure he doesn't fall to socialist seduction. Improvements to the welfare system, industry regulation, and measures for farmers will mean that our citizens feel stood up for."
NZL_double_superannuation:0 "Double Superannuation"
NZL_double_superannuation_desc:0 "When Labour passed through the social security act, we decried it as applied lunacy, with the taxes it required being harmful to business in the nation. And whilst our predictions about the cost were correct, it has proven to be successful. So, taking this into account, we must bite our tongue, adapt, and choose to double down on it."
NZL_modify_council_housing:0 "Modify Council Housing"
NZL_modify_council_housing_desc:0 "Council Housing, which was passed by Labour, is reviled for its clear crypto-syndicalist nature, with direct government ownership of housing. However, it has been so popular with our citizens that we can't directly oppose it. So instead, we shall seek a middle ground, with building of it continuing at the possibility for citizens to buy it themselves and own it, so as to oppose government nationalization of it all."
NZL_limited_union_communication:0 "Limited Union Consultation"
NZL_limited_union_communication_desc:0 "Our party founds itself on the idea of being the connection between the working class, and business class. But to do this, we must ensure equal treatment, so we shall budge and allow the adoption of strengthened unions, anti-busting measures, and arbitration to the national level."
NZL_farmer_union_support:0 "Court the Farmer Union"
NZL_farmer_union_support_desc:0 "The legion has been allowed to run rampant through the countryside, all but unopposed.

NZL_true_centre:0 "New Zealand's Centre"
NZL_true_centre_desc:0 "United shall stand as an undeniable bastion against the approaches of radicalism to New Zealand's shores.

Just as any good conservative shall, we must conserve our values and nationhood against all enemies, domestic and foreign."
NZL_steady_as_she_goes:0 "Steady as She Goes"
NZL_steady_as_she_goes_desc:0 "National may have a conservative lean, but we are not reactionaries. And as such, if the popular mandate is to keep the reforms of the century that have been adopted, then that is the mandate we shall carry forth with us as well, for too much in any direction, backwards or forwards, will violently rock our ship."
NZL_saftey_stability_progression:0 "Keep Moving Forward"
NZL_saftey_stability_progression_desc:0 "Reform has warded off the growing rise of socialist calls and action, for they can only rise in strength if we do nothing to prevent desperation. Thus, with the only thing we fear being fear itself, we can combat that and march forwards into better light, as the depression becomes a bitter memory instead."

### united 3

NZL_united_reform_3_desc:0 "The Coalition, originally formed from desperation to survive the encroaching radicalism and desperation that was coming ashore to New Zealand, has won its third term, cementing it for these past decades that this is the change yearned for due to its success. However, now we must question what the point of a coalition between parties is anymore when we keep winning."
NZL_true_nightwatchmen:0 "A True Night Watchman State"
NZL_true_nightwatchmen_desc:0 "The involvement of the state in all things concerning business is a good way to kill an economy by strangling it in the crib. Now, we shall only intervene to help out the poorest of the poor, and to ensure that unions have some form of organization to defend themselves with. Otherwise, the competition between working and business class shall be utilized for the profit it brings to all in the land."
NZL_seize_control_colilition:0 "Seize Control of the Coalition"
NZL_seize_control_colilition_desc:0 "The Coalition is increasingly becoming archaic, as our victories have always been the work of our own party, with the other involved parties being the weight that drags us. It might once have carried us to electoral victory, but now we are the undisputed masters in a no longer necessary partnership."
NZL_land_tax_reduction:0 "Land Tax Reduction"
NZL_land_tax_reduction_desc:0 "Taxes are commonly looked to as the force which stifles the growth of an individual's wealth, and even used as argument of how it keeps the poor, well poor. We shall cut down the taxes on land ownership, in order to give the working class the opportunity to buy segments of land and build a home. Let our citizenry spread out and be the seedlings of a better livelihood."
NZL_legislate_for_all_classes:0 "Working for all classes"
NZL_legislate_for_all_classes_desc:0 "Our championing of all segments of New Zealand life and society has resulted in the improvement of all, for we shall not bicker and let one be a parasite in the relationship between all functions of the wider hive. Our government shall maintain our hard won status, as the sentinels of a properly functioning society."
NZL_saftey_stability_progress:0 "Safety Stability Progress"
NZL_saftey_stability_progress_desc:0 "No longer is the campaign slogan of 'Safety, Stability, Progress' just a jest, but the reality on the ground of our governance. Safety and stability provided to the working men of the nation as they have grown in rights, and progress in ensuring New Zealand's inequalities have been properly addressed, never to return."

NZL_Kingitanga_desc:0 "Seizing control of the apparatus of state, the Māori King Movement, or the Kīngitanga in the native Māori tongue, New Zealand and its various islands and varied peoples are now beholden to the whims of the Māori iwi, or tribes, of this archipelago. United under a monarch, or 'Te Kīngi', that is elected into the dynastic house of Wherowhero by the leaders of the constituent tribes of this union, the Māori King Movement and their king now control the fate of the nation. In this new age, the Kīngitanga has taken up the modern Pan-Māori torch, seeking to unite the various iwi of our archipelago under one unified state and syncretic culture. In pursuit of this dream, Te Kīngi Korokī Mahuta Te Wherowhero shall carry the burden of leadership and bring our enlightened form of elective and enlightened monarchism to all Māori in Aotearoa."
NZL_iwi_people_base:0 "Expand the Iwi Network"
NZL_iwi_people_base_desc:0 "Though our grip on the nation only continues to grow, our powerbase is still largely centered around the dominant iwi of the North Island's interior - a reality that must soon change by our hand. Under direction of Te Kīngi, the various Māori tribes across Aotearoa shall be brought into the fold, using diplomacy when possible and force when necessary to bring the various iwi across both the North and South Islands, uplifting and granting autonomy to the White population while influencing them with our ideas along the way, in order to solidify our dominance over the state. Only then shall the Pan-Māori dream be realized, and only then can we truly begin to build a paradise here for our Polynesian people."
NZL_treaty_now:0 "The Treaty of Waitangi Fully Enforced"
NZL_treaty_now_desc:0 "The Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840 between the dominant Māori chiefs of the era and the British Crown that solidified and formalized the friendly working relationship between the Māori people and Anglo settlers. Though its usage and adherence has fluctuated over the years since its creation, it has always remained important to New Zealand, and we are here today to affirm its existence and message in totality. Though we shall work towards the Pan-Māori dream and the uplifting of the Māori people, we shall not leave our fellow New Zealanders behind, regardless of their race or background. Hand in hand with our Anglo allies and the other foreign settlers of Aotearoa, we shall build a better nation for all on our islands."
NZL_northern_investment:0 "Invest in Our Marae Communities"
NZL_northern_investment_desc:0 "Our local communities and iwi organize themselves around a vast series of marae that serve as administrative sectors and communal centers of social, cultural, and spiritual significance. Though we shall work to improve conditions throughout New Zealand, we shall start by improving those iwi and marae that have long been loyal to our cause in the central regions of Te Ika-a-Māui, or the North Island. Once these specific communities are prosperous and appeased, then we shall turn our attention towards uplifting and investing into the futures of the rest of Aotearoa's many iwis and population centers across the islands."

NZL_kings_three_parliments_desc:0 "The Kauhanganui Parliament, also called the Te Whakakitenga o Waikato Waikato Tainui Parliament or just the Whakakitenga for short, is the Māori parliament established in 1889 by the second Te Kīngi of the Kīngitanga, the great Matutaera Tāwhiao. Composed of elected members serving terms lasting three years, with two representatives being elected from each marae - or administrative region organized around a central holy place shared by iwi local to a particular region utilized as districts in the parliament - the Kauhanganui Parliament shall now be empowered to become the dominant legislative body in Aotearoa, creating a strong and just governmental body loyal to our cause and sensitive to the plight of our people. With the Whakakitenga enshrined as the dominant governing body alongside the paramount chiefs and the judicial system under the Crown of Te Kīngi, our people shall finally live under a united government that can meet their needs."

NZL_build_pakeha_legitimcy_desc:0 "The Pākehā, or White/non-Māori citizens of New Zealand, have only been here a few hundred years (admittedly not much longer than we have, with the first White settlers arriving in 1642 while the first Māori settlers arrived in the 1200s), and as such, their customs and ways are still alien to many Māori citizens, and somewhat antithetical to traditional Māori way of life. We must foster closer relations between the Māori and Pākehā of New Zealand, showing each other our different cultures and worldviews while proving that the Kīngitanga government can and will take care of their needs and wants despite our Pan-Māori goals and focus. Together, the Māori and Pākehā of Aotearoa shall build a true paradise here in the tropics."
NZL_english_connections:0 "An Equal Seat at England's Table"
NZL_english_connections_desc:0 "Though we may have been colonized by the Pākehā, that does not mean we are inferior to them. The proud Māori people must work with the Anglos, despite their exile and our isolation, for it shall serve to benefit both of our interests in the long run. We shall sit at the table with the Anglos and their Entente allies, but we shall only do so as true equals. No longer will the Māori play second fiddle to the rest of the world, for we shall use the British to find our own place in the sun."
NZL_solve_social_ills:0 "Booze Bans and Welfare Reform"
NZL_solve_social_ills_desc:0 "Alcoholism and other plagues of poverty have decimated the Māori people for far too long. By latching onto New Zealand's wide array of prohibitionist forces and populist progressives, we shall create a dry and clean Aotearoa free from vice while nursing the afflicted and the downtrodden back to good health with a new and modern welfare system inspired by the Labour and Liberal movements in Canada and Australia. Replacing the bottle with a true and equal chance at a good life should bring wider happiness, healthiness, and prosperity to the Māori people and our Pākehā allies along the way."
NZL_empower_parimount_cheifs:0 "Empower the Paramount Chiefs"
NZL_empower_parimount_cheifs_desc:0 "The paramount chiefs are a lineage of political leaders chosen by the British colonizers from among their allied iwis that swore loyalty to the British Crown. In return, they were granted greater freedoms, privileges, powers, and opportunities under the colonial government. Although some more radical Māori think of these aging relics as collaborators, most see their worth and their attempt at trying to improve the harsh reality of colonialism for their people from within the system. We sympathize with these champions of the Māori people during the colonial era, and shall empower these chiefs once again in order to aid the Kīngitanga and Te Kīngi as a new nobility in service of the state."
NZL_ratana:0 "Enshrine Our Democratic Legitimacy"
NZL_ratana_desc:0 "Democracy is at the very core of the Kīngitanga and our wider ideology. Representatives in our parliament are elected from among the masses by their fellow man, democratic elections and referendums are still held under our parliamentary system and among the local iwi and marae, and even our king himself is elected into his position by the paramount chiefs and traditional iwi leaders, taking into account some advice given by our Anglo allies. This democratic heritage must be enshrined, and a new constitution shall be drafted that solidifies our government as one of the People, by the People, and for the People of Aotearoa, for all mankind is created equal, and these truths shall be held as self evident, engraved into the foundations of our modern monarchy."
NZL_land_back:0 "Recompensation for Land Confiscations"
NZL_land_back_desc:0 "Though relations between the Māori and Pākehā populations have improved over the years, one sore issue that still remains a source of conflict and contention is that of the land confiscations that first occurred during the rise of the former colonial system. In order to rectify the mistake made in the past by our Pākehā allies without disrupting society, we shall compensate the Māori people affected by these past transgressions using tax funds and finances sourced from the wealthy Pākehā population and our British benefactors themselves. With these reparations being paid back to the people most in need of it, our people shall be given the justice they need and deserve, righting a wrong of the past while securing a road to a brighter and more unified tomorrow."
NZL_kia_mau_ki_te_whakapono:0 "Kia Mau Ki Te Ture, Te Whakapono, Te Aroha"
NZL_kia_mau_ki_te_whakapono_desc:0 "Keeping true to the words of the first Te Kīngi and founder of the Kīngitanga movement Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, we must 'Keep the Law, the Faith, and the Love' pure and strong in our hearts as we pursue the Pan-Māori ideal. Under the guidance of Te Kīngi and the Kīngitanga government, we have created a utopia under our enlightened democratic monarchy unlike the world has ever seen in a syncretic society that proves that different cultures and fuse and work together to create paradise. Working as equals alongside the Anglos and other non-Māori allies on our islands, we shall never rest as we endeavor to create a true utopia under the Crown here on our new Aotearoa."

nzl.350.t:0 "The Transformation of the Marae Network"
nzl.350.d:0 "Marae generally consist of an area of cleared land roughly rectangular in shape, bordered by stones or wooden posts and sometimes terraces called paepae that are used in certain ceremonies. In the center is usually a large ahu stone that serves as the central object of focus in the square, and in contemporary Māori life these marae serve a vital daily significance. With rituals, local meetings, public forums, religious services, and more being held in these stone plazas, they have become fundamentally important not only to our people, but to the government itself. The new administrative divisions created by the state to be used by the Kauhanganui Parliament for elective purposes are each centered on specific marae, with the names now even being shared between these plazas and the administrative districts of our new Aotearoa. By the will of Te Kīngi and the Kīngitanga government, a new breed of monarchist bureaucracy and modern administrative organization structure has been created in our archipelago off the back of a preexisting and wholly unique apparatus used by our people alone; one that fuses functionality, spirituality, cultural impact, community input, and pragmatic practicality all into one useful package for the Crown to use to our advantage."

NZL_legislate_compulsory_unionism_desc:0 "[NZL.GetName] will not be taken for a fool by conniving monopolists like so many other countries have, thus we shall mandate our work force to be in a union so our working men can be educated in their basic rights and entitlement for the sweat they expend in our country's service."
NZL_establish_proper_unemployment_relief:0 "Establish a Proper Unemployment Relief"
NZL_establish_proper_unemployment_relief_desc:0 "[NZL.GetName] workers have been left to their own devices to survive after the stock market crash, and having a permanent state of soup kitchens just will not do. The Labour party will grant monetary relief to these downtrodden men in these times, giving them a raft in this rocky sea."
NZL_raise_education_support:0 "Raise Support for Universal Education"
NZL_raise_education_support_desc:0 "What cruel world is it that a man shall not be given the ability to raise himself up just because of his placement in the societal and economic ladder. All men of Aotearoa shall be given the chance to go to a university and advance themselves into higher fields."
NZL_massive_social_housing_expansion:0 "Expand Housing Projects"
NZL_massive_social_housing_expansion_desc:0 "From the homeless in Wellington, to even our Maori brothers forced to live upon the prairie without more than a tent, we must provide shelter to all of our isle. Let not a single New Zealander go without a home he can call his own!"
NZL_pass_worker_compensation:0 "Workers Compensation Ensured"
NZL_pass_worker_compensation_desc:0 "If a man who is helping build our nation injures himself in the process, what would it seem for us to leave him helpless? If they shed blood and bone for our nation, we shall ensure they are paid back with compensation for the workman's injuries."
NZL_worker_based_arbitration:0 "End the Arbitration Betrayal"
NZL_worker_based_arbitration_desc:0 "The previously practiced method of Arbitration was abandoned by uncaring governance decades ago, betraying our workers and preventing them appealing to their fellow man when the boss upstairs was cruel. We must give them a say once more, by allowing Arbitration to make a long awaited return."
NZL_industrial_efficacy_bill:0 "Industrial Efficiency Bill"
NZL_industrial_efficacy_bill_desc:0 "[NZL.GetName] is still blighted with grimy factories, less than spectacular conditions on the work floor, and the ensuing lack of product this archaic and blast to the Victorian past this system produces. We must overhaul our factories into a more modern and flat out human grid."

### Labour 2

NZL_second_labour_victory:0 "Second Labour Government"
NZL_second_labour_victory_desc:0 "Labour has once more earned the popular mandate to govern this isle, and as such, we begin the effort of moving into the Premier Residence and establishing our office for governance once more."
NZL_universal_super:0 "Implement Universal Superannuation"
NZL_universal_super_desc:0 "To prevent such a woeful market crash like the banks failing ever again, we should turn from them, and instead look to having people guard their own retirement by putting funds into a government operated superannuation, where the people can rest knowing that we would never let their future's collapse on them."
NZL_expand_taxes_war:0 "Expand War Taxes"
NZL_expand_taxes_war_desc:0 "[NZL.GetName]'s industry takes tremendous effort to convert towards producing for prolonged military endeavors, thus we must request from the people, just as much effort funding such transition and production for the war effort."

NZL_maori_social_and_economic_act_desc:0 "Our Maori allies in Labour and related organizations are still feeling under-represented, even by our party promises and united front representation. We must give them a practical win, by pushing towards a bill that will fund their advancement in society."
NZL_backbench_revolt:0 "Pass Party Reforms"
NZL_backbench_revolt_desc:0 "The backbench revolt is resulting in our party unable to properly pass legislation, as we cannot even vote as a unified bloc. We will have to look into giving them some concessions for their demands, in order to unify the party before the coalition out votes us."
NZL_conscription:0 "Conscription of Man and Wealth"
NZL_conscription_desc:0 "Some government's cruelly send off their sons to die in an unpopular war, fought by elites.

NZL_create_the_minimum_wage:0 "Create a Minimum Wage"
NZL_create_the_minimum_wage_desc:0 "How can any citizen hope to buy a better home, or even feed and clothe themself if they are not given proper wages? We will have to push forth a minimum wage to ensure all workers are given compensation for their labour, even if the owners swear upon us."

### Labour 3

NZL_third_labour_victory:0 "Third Labour Government"
NZL_third_labour_victory_desc:0 "Our continued domination of [NZL.GetName] politics shows that it pays to care for the people, and in return, the people will care for us. We once more move into our office's and parliament spots, and this time we must fight to keep our reign secure."
NZL_seize_party_reins:0 "John Lee at the Helm"
NZL_seize_party_reins_desc:0 "With dominance over all other parties in the parliament, we must ensure our great gains in progress are not tossed to the wind by other parties' growth. Thus we must plan amongst ourselves on how we can take the seats of each MP into Labour's control, and keep out coalition votes from ever reaching the floor"
NZL_debt_free_currancy:0 "Towards a Debt Free Currancy"
NZL_debt_free_currancy_desc:0 "It was always an ideal to distribute necessities and perhaps even luxury to those who cannot afford such goods. But this was propped up by radicals who let their own vision leave out the truly downtrodden peoples that might not fit with their values. Here in [NZL.GetName], we will make the dream a reality, fixing the wrongs done by such programs before."
NZL_abolish_the_country_quota:0 "Abolish the Country Quota"
NZL_abolish_the_country_quota_desc:0 "The Country Quota has always violated the ideal of one person holding one vote, instead it was always a prize given to the rural communities that voted for the coalition, giving them unwarranted power for smaller representation. Labour shall do away with this blatant spoils system, and move toward true democracy manifest."
NZL_repeal_head_tax:0 "Repeal the Head Tax"
NZL_repeal_head_tax_desc:0 "We have been separated from Australasia for nearly a decade now, yet some of it's archaic laws still linger on us, including a Head Tax on any Chinese immigrants coming to our land, even those who offer up working for a home. We shall repeal such unjust taxation that keeps out asylum seekers."
NZL_peace_time_conscription:0 "Peacetime Conscription"
NZL_peace_time_conscription_desc:0 "We dread sending our boys into fights that they may not come back from, and thankfully the risk to life and limb has decreased in the world somewhat.

### legion 1

NZL_the_legion_takes_hold:0 "The Legion Takes Hold"
NZL_the_legion_takes_hold_desc:0 "Disillusioned by the lack of effort on part of the Coalition parties, the people of [NZL.GetName] have turned towards the Legion and Begg to carry them forth from this depressive rut. Despite being given their mandate, our party is heavily divided between Keynesians, Non-Interventionists and Social Creditors on how our economy should be run. We will have to find a path forward with such differing opinions in our big tent."
NZL_divide_the_country_into_shires:0 "Divide into Regional Shires"
NZL_divide_the_country_into_shires_desc:0 "In order to diffuse the burning fuse that is ignited within our tent party, we should fully endorse giving power to the people that elected us in, thus allowing them to make their own decisions. Down all the way to the individual shire will they decide their own hand and thus the people who elect their officials, shall also be the ones who thereby elect how their economy is run in that region."
NZL_expand_membership:0 "Mass Party Expansion"
NZL_expand_membership_desc:0 "Begg has turned an organization of nothing into something of near grandeur in its size alone, even if it blurred the lines of unity of purpose. That strive will not end here, for with our victory, we shall extend a velvet hand to those acceptable Labour and Coalition members who can join the Legion, and democratically lead their shire power bases in a similar fashion to the rest of the legion's individualist thought."
NZL_lazefair_faction_victory:0 "Laissez-Faire Economics Embedded"
NZL_lazefair_faction_victory_desc:0 "How can a man born in Auckland know what's best for a man in Queensland? Only a fool of a chair would try and put a steel reign over regions he has never entered, and thus, our government shall take a hands off approach to how separate shire's direct themselves. Even a good hearted shepard can lead the pack into a wolf's den if it does not know it's herd."
NZL_social_credit:0 "Social Credit Solutions"
NZL_social_credit_desc:0 "All across the Anglo rooted countries on this fair earth, many academics discuss how best to care for the nation's populace when all are hurting in this modern market. Here in [NZL.GetName], our members discuss how best to care for the downtrodden, and distributism has propped its head as a solution to this crisis. Those forgotten and left in the dirt shall be propelled forth into the middle class by our hand."
NZL_kaynesian_faction:0 "Keynesian Interventionism"
NZL_kaynesian_faction_desc:0 "Evan Perry, our economic minister, has recently taken up a stance that has certainly made him no friends in the mainstream party. He proposes introducing a new deal to the economy, where the government will have an iron grip over matters, so as to both create projects for jobs, and to ensure we never fall into this economic mire ever again."
NZL_end_state_paternalism:0 "End State Paternalism"
NZL_end_state_paternalism_desc:0 "The government shall no longer have a say in forcing action's upon its sovereigns. The only thing that has resulted as an attempt of such archaic policies is anger on half of the citizens, and incompetency on our part. We shall leave destiny in our citizen's hands."
NZL_conservitive_outreach:0 "Conservative Outreach"
NZL_conservitive_outreach_desc:0 "Our success is becoming apparent over the united and national party, to the point we are siphoning voters and even MP's from them. And even with those too stubborn to jump ship, we can approach them and reach deals with them, for our similarities are more than our differences. We shall unite the right."
NZL_begg_plan:0 "Implement the Begg Plan"
NZL_begg_plan_desc:0 "Begg has introduced a radical, and similarly controversial, plan to the Legion, one where we shall pay off our vast debt caused by the great war, black monday, and ensuing split from Australasia, back to Ottawa in one fell swoop. We do this not by monetary means, but by taking in their unemployed workers, bringing them to our isle, and giving them the jobs they so desperately need."
NZL_oppisition_to_tooley_street:0 "Fight against Tooley Street Bankers"
NZL_oppisition_to_tooley_street_desc:0 "Our attempts to march into better days have continually been impeded by a conglomerate of whining British Exiles, those who have taken residence and headquartered in Tooley Street. These bankers put their own monetary hold over our nation's attempts to safeguard [NZL.GetName] prosperity."
NZL_implement_radical_democracy:0 "Implement Radical Democracy"
NZL_implement_radical_democracy_desc:0 "The grubby hands of Labour and the Tories have gerrymandered our fair nation past the point of redemption, taking power from the hands of equal constituents and putting them towards their own use. We must move toward democracy in its basest form, where the majority decides who shall be Prime Minister of this country."

### legion 2

NZL_legion_two:0 "The Legion Marches Further"
NZL_legion_two_desc:0 "Our vast reforms that we implemented last election cycle have proven immensely popular, and thus carried our populist wave into yet another term in office here in Wellington. And thankfully after getting our organization's teething problems out of the way, we should hopefully move as a more unified bloc this time around."
NZL_convert_patlitable_form:0 "Move to the Center"
NZL_convert_patlitable_form_desc:0 "We have for far too long been a fairly gray organization, hard to describe as we have had differing identities all over, depending on which sect you came across. Now with our populist wave riding on the popularity of a truly democratic movement for the middle class, we shall fill the vacuum the desolate coalition has consistently failed to, that of a right wing [NZL.GetName] they can call home."
NZL_absorb_conservitive_intrests:0 "Absorb Conservative Interests"
NZL_absorb_conservitive_intrests_desc:0 "Our efforts to make good with conservative voices across the table has not been unsuccessful, as our rightist populism has attracted many a soul from the coalition to become all but officially, one with the legion. We now make a play to absorb Reform into our legion, with Sidney Holland being keen on such a vast unity that our two power blocs would bring to the table."
NZL_legion_is_yours:0 "Fight Against Bankers and Dole Bludgers"
NZL_legion_is_yours_desc:0 "The radicals of our legion have gained enough popularity to seize the chair of our organization, and thus the leadership as a whole. They have already begun a blitz to fulfill an agenda that would see those who have wronged our legion and [NZL.GetName] as a whole called out and targeted until they no longer can leech on our fair land and people. "
NZL_cambel_inspiration:0 "Inspiration from Campbell"
NZL_cambel_inspiration_desc:0 "Despite what Labour agitators would try to describe as a despicable force, the New Guard of Campbell back in Australia had the right mindset to bring a nation out of the gutter. The Legion here must take notes if they seek to bring pride and purpose back to this nation. "
NZL_democracy_with_a_strong_helmsmen:0 "Democracy with a Strong Helmsman"
NZL_democracy_with_a_strong_helmsmen_desc:0 "While democracy shall remain a part of [NZL.GetName]er life, we must put our faith in a strong executive to guide our vessel through storm currents wherever they may come. What is the point of a parliament leading us when their own petty squabbles can gridlock our governance for months at a time? Only the strong may lead us."
NZL_conservitivism_without_weakness:0 "Conservatism Without Weakness"
NZL_conservitivism_without_weakness_desc:0 "We have managed to safeguard our middle class, and even create a prosperity amongst our citizenry that hasn't been seen since before the depression hit. And yet despite all that, we stayed firm and dedicated to keeping our way of life intact, without drastic changes or sacrifices from the standard [NZL.GetName]er way of life. We do not seek to stray from the path that has been walked before, as we know it's reliable."
NZL_reduce_goverment_beuraccy:0 "Reduce Government Bureaucracy"
NZL_reduce_goverment_beuraccy_desc:0 "War, Cancer, Paperwork. The world and humanity would all be better off without such occurrences and problems, and while the former two may be unavoidable, we can certainly curb the latter. Needless government eyes and hands in every way of life shall be cut down to the necessities only, as we do not require a vast office complex to question the way of our citizen's lives."
NZL_remove_problamatic_members:0 "Remove Problematic Members"
NZL_remove_problamatic_members_desc:0 "Our achieved unity between all those who love democracy yet wish to see a prosperous [NZL.GetName] has been a project that we had to sweat for. Yet it was almost all for naught with the radicals whose rhetoric almost scared away the merger with Reform. We must take a firm hand and push away those who spread division here."
NZL_strong_hand_aganist_syndicalism:0 "A Strong Hand against Syndicalism"
NZL_strong_hand_aganist_syndicalism_desc:0 "Fair maiden England, Workhorse America, even our own union with Australia. All sullied and undermined by those red parasites who agitate and carve out discord amongst a populace to hate each other. In order to protect what little we have left on these islands of ours, we must strangle all socialist sentiment in the cradle."

NZL_united_reform_victory:0 "First Coalition Victory"
NZL_united_reform_victory_desc:0 "After Billy Hughes signed the Consolidation of Resources Act, and democracy in our confederation was suspended, the Reform and United parties worked together as the Kiwi's interests in the Australasian experiment. Although that failed, the coalition remained intact to prevent Labour from benefitting from a conservative split, which leads us to today, where our coalition has won, but remains on unsteady ground due to the two differing parties."
NZL_toe_the_canadian_line:0 "Toe the Canadian Line"
NZL_toe_the_canadian_line_desc:0 "We continue to remain inspired by Canadian ideals, not only for they represent the long dead Commonwealth dream in the Entente, but also because politically we are in a quite similar situation to them. We must tread carefully and entertain the spirits of Reform, for if our coalition splits now, the red menace will take advantage of it."
NZL_balance_the_budget:0 "Balance the Budget"
NZL_balance_the_budget_desc:0 "Besides Labour terms, the way a PM and his cabinet were to propose a budget and toe according to that has remained a status quo, an established orthodoxy in our country's economics. Let's return to that, by keeping to the plan and not raising taxes anymore than needed, to keep the citizen's satisfaction up."
NZL_relif_work_for_unemployed:0 "Relief Work For Unemployed"
NZL_relif_work_for_unemployed_desc:0 "Our nation's labor pool has been in dire straits since Black Monday hit, and we desperately need to get them back to work if they can have any hope of coming home with wages again. We must find any work we can pay them to get about doing in order to help mitigate this unemployment crisis."
NZL_anti_tammyism:0 "Anti-Tammanyism"
NZL_anti_tammyism_desc:0 "Ever since our nation has restored its individual independence, we have been plagued by blood sucking political elites, who control small little fiefdoms in counties and municipalities, and create unconquerable machines by appointing allies to seats. Let us combat this with a simple first step, by removing their ability to appoint 'servants' to seats."
NZL_remove_housing_controls:0 "Remove Housing Controls"
NZL_remove_housing_controls_desc:0 "The inability for companies and entrepreneurs to build housing that shall shelter our population is the very reason that we have downtrodden men sleeping in boxes on the street. Let us put power in the hands of those who can make a difference on the ground."
NZL_end_upper_house:0 "End Upper House Red Tape"
NZL_end_upper_house_desc:0 "Modeled after the House of Lords of deceased England, the Legislative Council is a long gone glory of it being intended as a check and balance in our democracy, serving as red tape in finalizing bills and wasting taxpayer money. The National Party will appoint new members to this council. Their purpose? To abolish the council from within."
NZL_absorb_country_party:0 "Absorb the Country Party"
NZL_absorb_country_party_desc:0 "Long lost brothers in arms, the Country party was formed when a farmer's union, which felt that we had lost touch with our rural roots, packed up and ran with their electors. Now with them finally calming down as that controlling union has been dying out, we can bring them back into our fold in good grace."
NZL_limited_abitration:0 "Limited Arbitration"
NZL_limited_abitration_desc:0 "Although we commonly see Labour and their legion of unions as enemies, we must not let this partisan stance turn into hatred of the working man. To earn their satisfaction, and prevent them from moving towards syndicalism, we shall ensure they still have a say with our government, via keeping the arbitration channels open."
NZL_war_preperations:0 "War Preparations"
NZL_war_preperations_desc:0 "The Entente moves as a unified force, preparing to move out to get vengeance for the wrongs done unto us by socialist forces. We must prepare ourselves as well for this grand struggle coming up, for Fair [NZL.GetName] would never leave her oaths un-fulfilled."
NZL_union_busting:0 "Union Busting"
NZL_union_busting_desc:0 "We cannot afford to have our country's industry and workforce continuously halted by agitators and hostile workers. We must break these forces that refuse to adapt to what is expected of them, in order for wider [NZL.GetName] to bring itself out of this hard time."
NZL_strengthen_country_quota:0 "Strengthen the Country Quota"
NZL_strengthen_country_quota_desc:0 "The country is what makes up Reform's history, mass and its legacy of serving. We cannot fail those who have propelled us forth by leaving them behind to be torn apart by the vultures of Labour and Legion majorities. Let us ensure the Country Quota safeguard never fails, not in this century."
NZL_true_financhial_orthadoxy:0 "Finance Orthodoxy"
NZL_true_financhial_orthadoxy_desc:0 "Although Black Monday is devastating, we cannot let radicals propel the idea that it was caused by the traditions here at home.

NZL_two_partys_united:0 "Two Parties United"
NZL_two_partys_united_desc:0 "Although the two head's of Reform and United constantly tried to nip each other in the neck, it was loss that ironically brought us closer into a unified faction. Now, National shall carry the spirits of conservatives all across [NZL.GetName], into brighter days."

NZL_coats_off_with_coates_desc:0 "The slogan that the Reform party has been championing has become one that is chanted and taken to heart across the nation. That of a PM willing to take his coat off, pull his sleeves up, and get down in the dirt with the common man in order to fix this nation. Government shall toil alongside the farmer in pulling our nation into a hopeful future."

NZL_use_liberal_party_roots_desc:0 "The Liberal Party forms the foundation of United's roots, where many of our current politicians remember the days where the Liberal party emerged and solved the crisis of the day with pragmatic thinking, and [NZL.GetName] emerged as a modern nation in it's political thinking. Let us appeal with nostalgia to the old, and historical lessons to the young."
NZL_loyal_briton_party:0 "Apirana Ngata's Maori Reforms"
NZL_loyal_briton_party_desc:0 "Sir Apirana Ngata has been the foremost Maori politician in our party and his legacy has stayed with us. Whilst Labour has joined alongside Ratana, and thus many Maori flock to them, we will not abandon our own efforts to gain their vote. Thus, we shall invite Ngata back to the cabinet, this time ensuring his reforms for Maori land go through with a watchful and honest eye."
NZL_conservitive_intervention:0 "Conservative Intervention"
NZL_conservitive_intervention_desc:0 "Whilst those cretins in United may complain about our actions, Reform has no qualms with using the government as the frontline tool in fighting for the working man, all to ensure he doesn't fall to socialist seduction. Improvements to the welfare system, industry regulation, and measures for farmers will mean that our citizens feel stood up for."
NZL_double_superannuation:0 "Double Superannuation"
NZL_double_superannuation_desc:0 "When Labour passed through the social security act, we decried it as applied lunacy, with the taxes it required being harmful to business in the nation. And whilst our predictions about the cost were correct, it has proven to be successful. So, taking this into account, we must bite our tongue, adapt, and choose to double down on it."
NZL_modify_council_housing:0 "Modify Council Housing"
NZL_modify_council_housing_desc:0 "Council Housing, which was passed by Labour, is reviled for its clear crypto-syndicalist nature, with direct government ownership of housing. However, it has been so popular with our citizens that we can't directly oppose it. So instead, we shall seek a middle ground, with building of it continuing at the possibility for citizens to buy it themselves and own it, so as to oppose government nationalization of it all."
NZL_limited_union_communication:0 "Limited Union Consultation"
NZL_limited_union_communication_desc:0 "Our party founds itself on the idea of being the connection between the working class, and business class. But to do this, we must ensure equal treatment, so we shall budge and allow the adoption of strengthened unions, anti-busting measures, and arbitration to the national level."
NZL_farmer_union_support:0 "Court the Farmer Union"
NZL_farmer_union_support_desc:0 "The legion has been allowed to run rampant through the countryside, all but unopposed. To give our coalition an entrance back into the rural parts of our country, we shall approach the Farmer's unions with cordiality once more, showing them we can work together, and that Reform is a friend."
NZL_true_centre:0 "[NZL.GetName]'s Centre"
NZL_true_centre_desc:0 "United shall stand as an undeniable bastion against the approaches of radicalism to [NZL.GetName]'s shores. Facing off against the crypto-socialists of Labour, while also helping prevent the pendulum-like swing towards authoritarianism that the Legion has taken in response to red encroachment. Just as any good conservative shall, we must conserve our values and nationhood against all enemies, domestic and foreign."
NZL_steady_as_she_goes:0 "Steady as She Goes"
NZL_steady_as_she_goes_desc:0 "National may have a conservative lean, but we are not reactionaries. And as such, if the popular mandate is to keep the reforms of the century that have been adopted, then that is the mandate we shall carry forth with us as well, for too much in any direction, backwards or forwards, will violently rock our ship."
NZL_saftey_stability_progression:0 "Keep Moving Forward"
NZL_saftey_stability_progression_desc:0 "Reform has warded off the growing rise of socialist calls and action, for they can only rise in strength if we do nothing to prevent desperation. Thus, with the only thing we fear being fear itself, we can combat that and march forwards into better light, as the depression becomes a bitter memory instead."

NZL_united_reform_3:0 "Third Coalition Victory"
NZL_united_reform_3_desc:0 "The Coalition, originally formed from desperation to survive the encroaching radicalism and desperation that was coming ashore to [NZL.GetName], has won its third term, cementing it for these past decades that this is the change yearned for due to its success. However, now we must question what the point of a coalition between parties is anymore when we keep winning."
NZL_true_nightwatchmen:0 "A True Night Watchman State"
NZL_true_nightwatchmen_desc:0 "The involvement of the state in all things concerning business is a good way to kill an economy by strangling it in the crib. Now, we shall only intervene to help out the poorest of the poor, and to ensure that unions have some form of organization to defend themselves with. Otherwise, the competition between working and business class shall be utilized for the profit it brings to all in the land."
NZL_seize_control_colilition:0 "Seize Control of the Coalition"
NZL_seize_control_colilition_desc:0 "The Coalition is increasingly becoming archaic, as our victories have always been the work of our own party, with the other involved parties being the weight that drags us. It might once have carried us to electoral victory, but now we are the undisputed masters in a no longer necessary partnership."
NZL_land_tax_reduction:0 "Land Tax Reduction"
NZL_land_tax_reduction_desc:0 "Taxes are commonly looked to as the force which stifles the growth of an individual's wealth, and even used as argument of how it keeps the poor, well poor. We shall cut down the taxes on land ownership, in order to give the working class the opportunity to buy segments of land and build a home. Let our citizenry spread out and be the seedlings of a better livelihood."
NZL_legislate_for_all_classes:0 "Working for All Classes"
NZL_legislate_for_all_classes_desc:0 "Our championing of all segments of [NZL.GetName] life and society has resulted in the improvement of all, for we shall not bicker and let one be a parasite in the relationship between all functions of the wider hive. Our government shall maintain our hard won status, as the sentinels of a properly functioning society."
NZL_saftey_stability_progress:0 "Safety Stability Progress"
NZL_saftey_stability_progress_desc:0 "No longer is the campaign slogan of 'Safety, Stability, Progress' just a jest, but the reality on the ground of our governance. Safety and stability provided to the working men of the nation as they have grown in rights, and progress in ensuring [NZL.GetName]'s inequalities have been properly addressed, never to return."

NZL_CWNZ_desc:0 "Having rode to power on the backs of the unions, the Communist Party has its chance of breathing new life into Lenin's dream. In a small yet radical clique led by a veteran of the cause, Alexander Galbirth, many questions remain about the specifics of the party line as factional vultures look to seize the party."
NZL_red_fed:0 "The NZFoL Unites Labour"
NZL_red_fed_desc:0 "The [NZL.GetName] Federation of Labour is not a radical union but it was forced into radical action. Most of its infrastructure is made up of regular working-class people who were driven to action by the junta's brazen actions. However, with this shift in power, those syndicalists previously sidelined in the IWW have become more active and sought to end this moderate cause."
NZL_vanguard:0 "Vanguard Against Infiltration"
NZL_vanguard_desc:0 "With our position secure, we can quickly socialize society. Freeholders and farmers have had their land seized, breaking the farmers union's reactionary force. Factories and wharves no longer are held by capital's claws and instead are redistributed to the workers whose labor they rely on. As Lenin tried to give Russia peace, land, and bread, so shall we do the same.""
NZL_maori_reforms:0 "Red Maori Reforms"
NZL_maori_reforms_desc:0 "For too long the Maori have lacked any power over the nation they lived in for years before the English arrived. To better fix this issue our government has begun working closely with union representative Bob Tūtaki, the only Maori delegate at the NZFoL founding. Through this partnership, Maori representation and membership have steadily increased from a demographic sidelined in our struggle. The quality of life in Maori settlements has improved dramatically and those living in cramped and poorly maintained housing have had their fortunes turned. While the road to equality is long, these steps have been crucial to bettering the nation."
NZL_newspaper_propaganda:0 "Strengthen Propaganda Output"
NZL_newspaper_propaganda_desc:0 "The voice of the proletariat once divided across many different newspapers all with different agendas will be centralised. Our slogans and achievements will be spread throughout [NZL.GetName] with one proud and united voice. Whether it be the Federation of Labour, the Maoriland Worker, or The Communist, the message will be that the working class is now in control!"
NZL_federalised_syndicalism:0 "Relaxed British Syndicalism"
NZL_federalised_syndicalism_desc:0 "[NZL.GetName] stands firm in its own political system of worker-dominated capitalism that while heavily inspired by the current system in England has a clear liberal separation. Despite this difference between our two nations, their path through history informs our own. This gives us the chance to improve from their experiment in our own material circumstances."
NZL_worker_intrests_first:0 "The Union Question"
NZL_worker_intrests_first_desc:0 "The party is beginning to seem like it was built on a house of cards that are the unions to the point any more pressure could bring us down. Whether it's reactionary thinking or moderates who immobilize industry when they feel we overstep, there is tension among these workers. The reality is that the unions are both the party's greatest enemy and its only friend. To deal with this deadlock we have two choices: keep the unions autonomous or intervene to put them in check."
NZL_class_comprimise:0 "The Class Question"
NZL_class_comprimise_desc:0 "The idea of compromise between the classes separates syndicalism from capitalism. While French intellectuals can find such a clear distinction so easy to find we have no such luxury. Most of our union is moderate, lacking the belief that hardline thought will result in anything but blood spilled. With the belief that capitalism kept in check by our unions is good enough, it's time to decide how the classes should be dealt with."
NZL_english_connection:0 "Gain England's Favour"
NZL_english_connection_desc:0 "Our union traditions that built [NZL.GetName] were born in England's factories. Before the first English explorers reached our shores this struggle was in our blood. With both our nations finally reunited through syndicalism can we work together again with the shared soul of our nations."
NZL_crush_capitalist_reformer:0 "Crush Capitalist Reformism"
NZL_crush_capitalist_reformer_desc:0 "Labour and their reformist dribble have poisoned our nation for too long. We live in a world of class conflict with a central dialectic of proletarian vs bourgeoisie so compromise is impossible. As such Savage and his Ilk will be publicly disparaged and their party crushed. Their failure will no longer be tolerated."
NZL_littles_leningrad:0 "Marching Forward with Industry"
NZL_littles_leningrad_desc:0 "[NZL.GetName]'s agricultural industry has been relied upon too often. With the international economic crisis, the chaos caused our economic strength to collapse with mass unemployment with the agricultural industry doing little to support. To solve this problem, we must industrialize as soon as possible. Massive centrally planned projects to transform these fertile lands into industrial powerhouses will be established to drag us into the future."
NZL_rember_great_strike:0 "Remember the Great Strike"
NZL_rember_great_strike_desc:0 "The first Federation of Labour stood as the strongest power representing the working class in 1913 and with the promise of the capitalist arbitration system becoming clear as nothing more than a mirage they struck. It was this strike that made the names of many Labour Party and IWW unionists. It was this strike that also broke these unions' strength to face the absorption into Australasia. The strike's legacy of a true syndicalist revolt before those of England and France has given us a prime propaganda opportunity. We have spread the idea that it was our syndicalist system that was a true homegrown ideology."
NZL_unite_labolur:0 "Unite with Labour"
NZL_unite_labolur_desc:0 "It was Labour's arrest that finally woke us out of the docile state loyal to Canada. It was these leaders in the original Federation of Labour that fought for the same goal we have now. Though they moderated since then, they all fought hard for the working class. In order to consolidate our position and build us on national peace their political experience will be invaluable, even if it upsets the IWW."
NZL_communism_with_aotearoan_characterstics:0 "Communism with Aotearoan Characteristics"
NZL_communism_with_aotearoan_characterstics_desc:0 "The rest of the party shut their eyes as the world passed by. They stood motionless as if Lenin wanted us to never adapt. Only our faction looked out to the many experiments across the world and saw the many adaptations that evolved under Lenin's line. Through this act, we learned how to change our socialism to our material conditions so that we are not lost in dogma."
NZL_old_bolshevism:0 "Old Bolshevism"
NZL_old_bolshevism_desc:0 "Our opponents complain that we are stuck in the past as if it was an insult. They describe us as top-heavy, bureaucratic, and dogmatic as if having a strong dogma is inherently evil. Let them wail. It's this system that will keep us on the road toward socialism that so many others have fallen from."
NZL_hold_lenins_line_strong:0 "Hold Lenin's Line Strong"
NZL_hold_lenins_line_strong_desc:0 "Revisionism has taken over the globe. In the imperial palaces of France or in Lenin's birthplace, all abuse Lenin's great works for their own ends. [NZL.GetName] is the only true inheritor of Lenin's legacy and as such falls upon us the burden to bring the world revolution to reality!"
NZL_reverse_arbitration:0 "Reverse Arbitration"
NZL_reverse_arbitration_desc:0 "Without the cancer of radical syndicalism leaching from our honest unionist cause can we finally bridge the divide between the working class and business. Such a system has eluded France and England for years but a flawed version has always been here. Arbitration, while a cancer we fought against when it was governed as a capitalist system, under the watchful eyes of the NZFoL will be able to cross the valley of class conflict to unite [NZL.GetName] hand in hand, worker and capitalist."
NZL_abolition_of_the_wage_system:0 "Abolition of the Wage System"
NZL_abolition_of_the_wage_system_desc:0 "The NZFoL has violated the worker for too long. Ruled by fat union bosses who put themselves above their fellow men in allowing capital to flourish after they took control. While they created a system of arbitrational \"syndicalism\" our union stood by our principles. By creating cooperatives, we took control of the means of production from those with whom the NZFoL shook hands. With our victory a true syndicalism system takes root and from it a true working class tomorrow."
NZL_Socialist_aotearoa:0 "Defending our Independent Paradise"
NZL_Socialist_aotearoa_desc:0 "The Internationale stands halfway across the world lacking neither the will nor the strength to help us here. Why should we entangle ourselves with them as they are hellbent on conflict with the Entente and the Hun?"
NZL_international_entry:0 "Ascendance to the Internationale"
NZL_international_entry_desc:0 "Distance and ideology be damned, the working class's struggle is above all. While our land may stand alone surrounded by imperial ambition our struggle will uplift all of Oceania. To Paris with our application!"
NZL_long_red_cloud:0 "The Long Red Cloud"
NZL_long_red_cloud_desc:0 "After massive reforms swept the nation an era has dawned, one entangled solely with the working class. What once was the nation that pioneered the working struggle and suffrage now pioneers it as the southern paradise for toilers."

### economy

NZL_seperate_economy_desc:0 "With our separation from Australia, our economy has gone into a tailspin. Extremely reliant on the Australian market and with the turmoil in Europe and America making it difficult to sell our goods our economic situation is dire. By quickly seizing assets owned by Australian businesses now defunct and supporting local businesses we can hopefully slow this recession down though we're far from solving it."
NZL_indepednt_financhial_infulsytructure:0 "Newly Independent Finance"
NZL_indepednt_financhial_infulsytructure_desc:0 "Most of [NZL.GetName] finance has focused on Australian businesses, starving our own of investment. This foul state of affairs allowed many Australian companies to take advantage of us and our workers, holding on to key centers of industry on our island. Finance will wake up to reality. Our businesses need investment and our businesses are the future. To do so, certain targeted subsidies will be used to grow confidence in our market."
NZL_power_of_the_water:0 "Hydraulic Power"
NZL_power_of_the_water_desc:0 "One of the greatest failings of the Australian government was the squandering of our natural resources, one of them being our massive amount of rivers that are fit for hydropower. While we started building hydropower plants in large numbers during the first world war many were left to rot after. To help power our ongoing growth these dams along with the development of a national transmission grid will be key to our economic recovery. "
NZL_our_own_reserve_bank:0 "Our Own Reserve Bank"
NZL_our_own_reserve_bank_desc:0 "[NZL.GetName] has never had its own reserve bank even before our absorption into Australia. Up to this point, most banks issued their own bank notes and most of them were already controlled by Australia. With the economic slump we find ourselves in, this policy has had an exacerbating effect on our economy, with inflation rising by banks over issuing notes and others collapsing with our economic separation. One reserve bank to control the distribution of our currency is needed so we can truly solve this issue."
NZL_new_markets:0 "Reach into New Markets"
NZL_new_markets_desc:0 "England was [NZL.GetName]'s chief importer and through its loss in the revolution, the first step to our national collapse was taken. To truly rebuild our economy we must rebuild these economic ties that were lost with other nations. The only question is, who should we seek out?"
NZL_move_manpower_war:0 "Move Manpower to War Industries"
NZL_move_manpower_war_desc:0 "It's undeniable that war is on the horizon and if it does we might leave it in a more dire state than after the Great War. Much of our military infrastructure was taken care of by England and Australia but without either of them, it now falls to us. With a mass of unemployed workers these industries may not turn a profit but will both help turn the tide against poverty and build our ability to defend ourselves."
NZL_public_housing:0 "Public Housing for the Poor"
NZL_public_housing_desc:0 "Many continue to live destitute and without support in shanty towns and slums across the nation; we must intervene to put them on their feet again. Whether it be Maori families living in slums while searching for work or white workers who lost their jobs because their Australian factory fell apart. The situation seems to be only deteriorating, to the point that no matter how anti-intervention a person may be, support is clear for a renewed effort for mass housing. "
NZL_air_power_building:0 "Nation Airway Corporation"
NZL_air_power_building_desc:0 "Our government has formed an official state organ to take air travel seriously. In the past, air travel was like a wild west with poor safety regulations and unaffordable for the average [NZL.GetName]er. Now a system will be implemented so that [NZL.GetName]ers can travel from one island to the other along with government-supported flights into provincial towns. This system is the single domestic airline – the National Airways Corporation (NAC) which now at its founding sets [NZL.GetName] on a path to join other Commonwealth countries in having state airlines."
NZL_the_sheep:0 "Expand our Agricultural Base"
NZL_the_sheep_desc:0 "Our nation's economy is reliant on our agriculture foundations and as such we need to ensure that these freeholders and the average Kiwi battler can thrive. In doing so, we need to expand our efforts into mechanization and improve our agricultural standards which have stagnated. Through buying better equipment and subsiding expansion can new life come to the industry."
NZL_exile_economy:0 "The Exiled Economy"
NZL_exile_economy_desc:0 "English exiles strive hard to retake their homeland and luckily for us, they are rich and hardworking. Bringing our government closer to the Entente and aligning itself with these aristocratic circles could do wonders for our economy. By positioning ourselves as essential for the reclamation of England and her Empire we can attract investment that would do wonders for our fledgling businesses."
NZL_international_solidarity:0 "Solidarity with Internationale Workers"
NZL_international_solidarity_desc:0 "The Internationale workers are the key to your survival. It is their solidarity that will rebuild our nation that pioneered women's suffering, union power, and worker representation before their establishment. With our socialist government, this support will breathe new life into the economy."
NZL_icac_propped_up:0 "IEDC Economic Intervention"
NZL_icac_propped_up_desc:0 "In order to better support the Entente and ensure mutual growth, the Canadian government has formed the IDEC to use our shared resources to grow the economy. This mutual support has been a godsend for our economy allowing our weak economy a strong foundation to build on. In this shared market, we will flow free from syndicalism and corruption."
NZL_research_deals:0 "New Research Investment"
NZL_research_deals_desc:0 "Without the support of the broader empire [NZL.GetName] is forced to rely on its own scientific fields. By further expanding our research investment in the scientific field and the students of the nation, we can catch up. By increasing research institute funding and establishing market confidence these issues can be solved by slowly building brick by brick towards a modern nation."
NZL_return_of_england:0 "Return of the English Market"
NZL_return_of_england_desc:0 "England's success in seizing its future for the working class had the unintended and unfortunate side effect of damning the [NZL.GetName] economy due to its reliance on its support. With us now united through socialism this market has returned to us, revitalizing those industries that for so long lacked a patron."
NZL_tooley_street:0 "The Power of Tooley Street Investment"
NZL_tooley_street_desc:0 "After emerging from a strong economic base, Tooley Street economists can breathe fresh life into our economy with their investment supported by a strong base. With new businesses forming and invitations coming out across the country, it seems the slump is over. Whether it be in the homes of our poorest or our richest a new mood has filled the nation, one of progress."
NZL_coal_gold_mining:0 "Our Land's Natural Riches"
NZL_coal_gold_mining_desc:0 "Our land is rich in two crucial resources, coal, and gold. The [NZL.GetName] economy is built on exports and foreign economies thirst for them. Expanding the mining operations of these two minerals, we can use them as a strong tool in building our relationships with other nations."
NZL_crack_ironsand_mystery:0 "The Ironsand Mystery"
NZL_crack_ironsand_mystery_desc:0 "[NZL.GetName] does not have much iron ore in rocks, but it has plenty of beaches with iron sands. The beaches that stretch down the North Island's west coast from Kaipara Harbour to Wanganui contain a dark mineral called titanomagnetite containing iron-rich titanium. While it alludes to the ability to truly break down these iron sands into a usable material to use in our foundry, many rumors abound that an electric arc furnace could be key."
NZL_university_aukland_funding:0 "Invest in our Future"
NZL_university_aukland_funding_desc:0 "The University of Auckland has fallen so far that many [NZL.GetName] students have left us to study in Australia. Our great minds were stolen from us and the effects are seen in our lack of innervation. The only solution is a massive injection into higher education along with support for our younger students. Hopefully, by doing this, our future will be brighter than it is now."

Composed of elected members serving terms lasting three years, with two representatives being elected from each marae - or administrative region organized around a central holy place shared by iwi local to a particular region utilized as districts in the parliament - the Kauhanganui Parliament shall now be empowered to become the dominant legislative body in Aotearoa, creating a strong and just governmental body loyal to our cause and sensitive to the plight of our people.

We must foster closer relations between the Māori and Pākehā of [NZL.GetName], showing each other our different cultures and worldviews while proving that the Kīngitanga government can and will take care of their needs and wants despite our Pan-Māori goals and focus.

### Events

nzl.1.t:0 "The Divorce From Australasia"
nzl.1.d:0 "New Zealand has distanced itself from Australasia's collapse, forging its own path. With the support of Canadian loyalists, there remains a chance of a truly democratic and locally governed nation. While Australia succumbs to radicalism, we remain resilient. We have endured years of disillusionment with Australasia's failed national experiment, suffering from unequal development and poor governance. Under the leadership of the esteemed General Bernard Freyberg, loyalists to the King in Ottawa, both men and women, have taken up arms to restore peace to our island. They have also prepared for Australia's response. Farmers' union-organized special constables, known as "Cossacks," strive to help the army restore order on the streets. The local military units have forcefully disbanded Labour Party branch meetings, which had ties to discontent on the mainland. This resulted in the arrests of Michael Savage, Bob Semple, and Walter Nash. However, peace remains elusive as the New Zealand Federation of Labor emerges, comprising the country's strongest trade unions. In an unexpected appointment, Fintan Walsh leads the Federation. They receive support from both syndicalists and reformists, and the country echoes the cries for strikes in workplaces nationwide. Though the fringe communist faction calls for the junta's overthrow, their limited numbers hinder their success. Amidst the chaos across New Zealand, the North Island suffers the greatest impact. Taking advantage of the turmoil, farmers seize Maori land en masse to compensate for their losses in the collapsing economy. In response, disenchanted Maori gather around the Kingitanaga movement, centered in the mountainous "King Country" on the island's western side. They organize their own defense, known as Maree, to protect against these land seizures. The nation now teeters on the edge, facing the critical challenge of confronting radicals from within and on the mainland. The preservation of our republic hangs in the balance, requiring our resolute resistance to these threats."

nzl.2.t:0 "NZFoL Declares a Second Great Strike"
nzl.2.d:0 "After hours of loud arguments and brawls, the New Zealand Federation of Labour has declared a national strike. The arrest of the Labour leadership was a bridge too far for the Freyberg government. Now both syndicalists and mainline unionists have joined together. Fintan Walsh, despite his own reservations about going militant, especially with the outbreak of war with Australia, has effectively organized his unionists to hold fast against any attempts to break their picket lines. This has already stopped the war industry as workers leave the assembly line to strike. Further, an IWW leader named Tom Barker, has smuggled himself back from America and assumed control of the syndicalist factions. Despite this, the Council of Trade Unions has stayed neutral, not crossing any picket lines established by the NZFoL. However, they are still working independently of the NZFoL, and continue their own initiatives. It is unsure how long the strike will last as machines grind to a halt inside factories. The government has announced that it will not negotiate with the strikers and is determined to break the strike. The country braces for a tumultuous week ahead."

The locals and strikers have been outraged by the military presence in the area and have protested to demand their removal. The police and military have refused to leave, however, leading to deepening tensions between the two sides. One thousand special constables were also stationed at Mount Cook, receiving catering and supplies from the army. They have also been trained in cavalry maneuvers to disperse strikers should the strike blow. All these preparations have been made, yet the strikers refuse to budge. There is a precarious situation, as the homefront lacks troops to spare for the strike to hold off Australian invasions. The strike is stuck with both sides in a deadlock, neither willing to back down. It is unclear how long this will last, but the government is determined to see the strike through by any means necessary."

With undercover agents, they have identified union leaders and their subordinates. Union members have also been monitored to ensure no risk of an armed uprising or mass flight from their current hideouts. The police commissioner has suggested meeting to create clear demands to end the strike to then suggest to the government to act upon. However, during this meeting, the police will establish a perimeter around the location and several plainclothes officers. This will enable them to cut the head off the Syndicalist snake and destroy the organization of these striking workers."

With many communists holding power at lower levels, such as hardline red Victor Wilcox and Alexander Galbraith. The loss of their mainstream leaders has only led to radicals taking control - mostly communists. With the support of the major feminist councils set up by Elsie Farley, even more riots have broken out. Believed to have lost all power with Lenin's fall from grace and the rise of syndicalism, communism may return. The nation's people are now unsure of what the future holds - will communism take over or will the current system prevail?

Now all workers have walked off site and begun rioting across the nation, many fear we won't be able to put them down. The government is now considering taking emergency measures to restore order.

Their organizers have begun directing the enraged populace to raid police stations, government stockpiles, and army warehouses. The riots have been met with harsh resistance from the government, resulting in injuries and casualties. The communist party has been accused of using the riots to control the country. The nation's future remains uncertain as Freyberg's loss of faith reaches an all-time high. Several divisions have revolted, and citizens have taken to the streets to protest against the government's oppressive tactics. The situation is volatile and could lead to further unrest and violence. However, following several short skirmishes and a large march led by workers, mutineers, and civilians in the capital, the Freyberg government resigned. In its place, communists have seized control, and New Zealand has fallen victim to the red tide. The new government has focused on restoring people's rights and bringing an end to violence. With loyalists to the Entente leaving in droves, the balance of power has shifted dramatically. The establishment of a true Leninist republic has begun."

nzl.10.d:0 "With the decision to finally come to the table with the NZFoL and their fellow strikers, it's been decided that anything short of surrender and syndicalism is off the table. Due to the unions' harsh demands, it is possible that these sentiments have been leaked. First of all, the union has demanded the pardon of the Labour party leadership. They also requested the opportunity to run in elections after independence for New Zealand is secured. In addition, the strikers demand a complete apology for declaring them traitors. Further pardoning of strikes and unions have also been sought, which was expected. However, this demand also includes IWW syndicalists. Ultimately, most worrying are the demands to bring back the arbitration system, implement collective bargaining agreements, and further labour reforms. These reforms have been described as a return to the status of New Zealand's labour agreements before Australasia. However, there are clear fears that this would push the power of unions too far and allow syndicalist taint to seep into a newborn nation. In the end it was decided that..."

Once it became clear that the military government would not yield to reason, the working people of our beloved nation rose up. Under the direction of the major unions, a concerted effort was made to end this chaos. It's finally dawned on these autocrats in the Freyburg government that they have squandered their chance and have begun evacuating to Canada. Workers rejoiced, knowing the oppressive military government was gone. The long struggle had been won, and the nation could finally look forward to an era of stability with the unions leading the charge. With the dismantling of the remnants of Freyburg's government, it's been decided that to ensure that the power the workers have today is maintained by replicating a similar system to the English revolution. However, it is critical that this system is created without their excesses, loyal to our love of democracy and freedom."

No celebrations were held and no seconds were spared, with the state of war bringing workers back to work and only long hours to look forward to. With the economy in shambles, workers had no choice but to accept the agreement. It was the only way to ensure their livelihoods for their loved ones. Not even the released Labour party leadership spent much time relaxing. Instead, they immediately started working with the government organizing ongoing efforts, driving further military recruitment and helping create a complete national effort to ensure our national independence. It seems now with this revised agreement the focus has returned to the war and the effectiveness of our efforts has increased more quickly than expected."

nzl.13.d:0 "Amidst the economic collapse, freeholders have sought to augment their income by expanding their land holdings. As the police have been enlisted in the war effort, they offer no resistance to land seizures. However, as more land is taken from Maori tribes, chaos ensues. Cossack brigades, redirected from the cities, support the freeholders in their assault on the Maori, aiming to halt their resistance. Consequently, peace on the North Island has been disrupted. In response to these circumstances, the Maori King Movement has opened its borders to offer refuge to those who have lost their land. Their power in the king's country remains intact, separate from the freeholder influence. Nonetheless, there are rumors circulating that the Maori are accumulating large quantities of arms without accountability. This has raised concerns that they may challenge our government. In light of these developments, some have suggested intervening in this matter in order to prevent further deterioration, lest we see an open uprising."

nzl.14.d:0 "The Kingitanga has reacted to recent land seizures with war. Both Maori women and men have been armed en masse and kill anyone attempting to enforce land seizures. Tragically, this has resulted in the loss of Cossacks, who play a crucial role in maintaining peace, on the streets. The escalating violence has led to severe unrest between Maori and settlers, causing tensions to reach dangerous levels. Consequently, our government has been urged to take action against these subversive elements by force, prompting the declaration of a state of emergency. In response, Freyberg announced an expedition comprising of his most capable men. The mission is to venture into King Country and quell the Kingites, ultimately restoring peace and stability. The situation remains highly volatile and unpredictable as the Maori continue launching ambushes and conducting hit-and-run attacks on troop convoys and rural settlements in the countryside. The expedition's challenge remains significant and dangerous."

The recent expedition sent to confront the Maori has encountered a ruthless guerrilla war, with fierce fighting unfolding across every inch of King Country. Nonetheless, with the larger force of New Zealand led by Bernard Freyberg, many see a Pakeha victory as inevitable. Upon reaching Rangiriri, the site of the pivotal battle in the previous war, the expedition faced no immediate resistance and decided to establish a camp. However, reconnaissance teams soon noticed earthworks further down the river. Surprisingly, these earthworks flew the white flag, signaling a call for peace between the Maori and the expedition. Viewing this as an opportunity to swiftly conclude the battle and return to the frontlines against Australia, Freyberg chose to meet with the Maori. Accompanied by a sizable detachment and with the camp on high alert, the marshal approached the Maori lines, seemingly in an atmosphere of peace. However, smoke suddenly billowed from the camp behind Freyberg. In a tactic reminiscent of the English book, it appeared that the Maori had employed a similar strategy used in the previous battle. This was done by staging a fake surrender to lead Freyburg to a poorly defended position. In addition, they set the camp ablaze behind him. With their plan in full effect to end the war, the battle's outcome was..."

While the army's standing orders only focused on New Zealand's defense, they stayed put while the Kingitanga forces seized power. Those who failed to pick up arms failed against Maori guerrillas, with both police and cossack forces collapsing. If this momentum continues, the Kingites may be able to achieve a full coup soon. The government must act quickly to stop the Kingitanga from taking over, or else the country may face a new era of Maori rule. It is important to remember that the Maori guerrillas are still very much a threat and must be dealt with firmly and swiftly. The government must take immediate action if it is to prevent the Kingitanga from seizing power."

Maori soldiers, who were previously conscripted during our initial independence struggle, have played a pivotal role in this development. Their decision to withdraw from defending New Zealand presented significant challenges to the national army. As a consequence, the parliament has been seized, and another government, led by Maori King Koroki, has been declared by the Kingite forces. Their objective is to establish a truly sovereign nation, asserting Maori self-governance and independence. The situation remains fluid, with uncertainty surrounding the country's future and power balance. The Kingitanga have been joined by other Maori groups, as well as some European settlers, as loyalists to the original government evacuate. It appears New Zealand iis now again under Maori rule."

While we can forgo a governor general and embrace unlimited democracy, this ceremonial position holds significance for many. Therefore, we could consider appointing Bernard Freyberg, who staunchly defended our nation both on the battlefield and in the political arena. Alternatively, George Vere Arundell Monckton-Arundell Galway, a symbol of the nobility, who also served as an artillery officer for our nation during the Weltkrieg, could be a viable choice.

While many feared that being labeled as traitors may have destroyed the party's election chances, our nation's abysmal economic state has left many seeing Labour as the only solution. To ensure a strong image, the party, behind closed doors, has decided to rally around one figure with no competition in the preselections. This figure is Michel Joseph Savage who has risen as the party's strongest leader in years. With a long history in the union movement and an icon of the nation despite 2 stints in jail for treason, he's a powerful contender for the top job. Now all that's left for the party faithful is to campaign harder than ever for victory."
nzl.32.db:0 "With Savage's condition the Labour party's centralisation has weakened in power with different party lines forming in the chaos. The first of these newcomers is the black sheep and opponent of the party is John A Lee. He supports a strong socialist line reminiscent of the old Labour independents supported by his own social credit ideas. Next sits Semple, an icon of the early unionist movement who earned his stripes fighting in the coal mines of the nation, while never polite enough for parliament dignity, he is unmatched as a symbol of Labour. Next is Peter Fraser who was the clear successor to Savage's line. A moderate and dignified member of parliament, he's a strong contender. Lastly, we have Walter Nash, a more fiscal conservative member, who may gain us both business and union support. All are strong candidates and after hours of disagreement a result has finally been found."

To do so, the party has been divided into factions, with the leftmost being Bill Veitch. A mixture of Laissez-faire economics and a lifelong supporter of arbitration Bill began as an independent Labourite, however, broke from the mainstream due to his anti-interventional views that aligned more with the original alliance of Labour and Liberals in the early days of our democracy. George Forbes stands next to him, a free market supporter who rejected reform because it was too interventionist. Adam Hamilton stands in the middle, balancing his anti-socialist worldview with his roots in a reform party. Next is Sidney Holland, who is a new face to politics without the stain of economic depression marring him. As such he's also seen as a compromise, even if he is more welcoming and accepting of Labour policy. Finally, Gordon Coates, whose long political career contrasts strongly with many in the party, is openly pro-intervention in the interest of helping the market and business thrive. With all the candidates standing ready for the election, it's still unclear who may take the top job."

Coming into being after the Māori-born Christian convert Tāmihana Te Rauparaha was presented to Queen Victoria in 1851, Tāmihana soon returned to our archipelago espousing his new idea of uniting all iwi under a Māori monarchy supported by the rūnanga (or tribal council) of the North Island chiefs, and what would become known as the Kīngitanga movement was thus born with its earliest roots planted firmly within the concept of peaceful Anglo-Māori cooperation. With Tāmihana Te Rauparaha and his growing group of supporters among the North Island chiefs believed that having a Māori monarch who could claim a similar status to that of the British Crown would allow the Māori to deal with Pākehā (or White colonists) on equal footing at long last, the Kīngitanga movement eventually officially came to be in the shadow of British Imperialism, though our movement and many other Māori groups would resist that shadow in various forms over the following decades in the search for true equality. \n\nHowever, with that shadow no longer blocking out the sun and with our own independence movement blossoming in the nurturing glow of destiny's sun, we have been able to enjoy the bounties of both Māori monarchism and complete sovereignty from the Australasian concept and the British Empire as a whole without our old Anglo allies, leading many to question if we ever need to crawl back to them again. Should we spark up mutually-beneficial trade contracts and friendly relations with the British Crown while staunchly standing by our newly beloved idea of total sovereignty, or should we rejoin the Entente and walk hand in hand with our old allies once again despite our spotty past as new equals forevermore?

On the other hand, the IWW syndicalists have advocated for complete nationalization, aligning themselves with the international line of thought. In essence, the core question revolves around whether we envision our nation as exclusively for workers or whether we should maintain a cordial relationship with the business sector.

Representing the radical leftist position of the party, Lee has been able to gain the support of most of the caucus for major party reform. Seeking to put the ability to appoint cabinet positions at the head of the caucus rather than the prime minister arguing that as the caucus was elected by the nation rather than just the prime minister it should hold this power. This reform passed the caucus, voted in after long days of backstabbing and scheming. Now it remains the prime minister's choice to accept this reform. This position may appear inert and justifiable, but it would completely throw the party into chaos since it would decentralize party decision-making and give it to local power brokers and factional groups instead.

Due in part to his consistent overarching ambition and selfishness outstripping his competency. In turn, Lee announced the formation of his own party. Taking as many loyalists as he could, though retaining only a small amount of the most discontent, the Democratic Labour Party has formed. The party angles itself to be free from the top-down autocratic approach that Lee claims infests the old party room and to truly represent Labour though it's doubtful much will result from the split. One of the most notable members to support and run for the DLP is Colin Scrimgeour, otherwise known as Uncle Scrim the radio host. He is hoping to take the seat of the incumbent Labour leader themself. Despite not necessarily changing the makeup of parliament this shift has led to a shakeup of the party faithful that may see Labour fall to increased factionalism."

Lee had attempted to take a cabinet seat for years before Savage's condition became serious. Now that Savage is close to death, Lee has come to collect on this old conflict. Not long after releasing the Lee letter which contained a litany of critiques against both Walter Nash's caution and labored financial orthodoxy, a lot of controversy erupted within the party, cracking the facade of the party machine to the public of New Zealand, even if Lee claims that it was only for inter-party reference. The result of this letter was only a warning from the Labour national executive however with Savage's cancer going public an article has been released.\n\n A bitter letter titled \"Psycho-pathology in politics\" now claims that Savage is mentally and physically ill! An excerpt reads:\n\n  \"An odd politician becomes physically and mentally sick ... sycophants pour flattery on him ... He becomes vain of mind and short of temper. Whatever this problem of what I call pathology in politics occurred, except that the party managed to cut off the diseased limb, it went down to crushing defeat.\" \n\n The reaction across the entire public has been complete shock and aghast with such an important member being so publicly insulted to a man so debilitatingly ill."

With the leftist faction breaking the center a more hardline approach has been taken with massive social housing along with increased welfare support. To ensure we never hit a recession again, measures to control the nation's financial system have been put forward. Bank autonomy has been greatly undermined and worker protections strengthened. The nationals have had a field day with these decisions with Lee being declared the greatest threat to New Zealand's liberty and liberal traditions though their whinging means little. Despite the massive move left by the party Lee's charisma has held the party together though many have whispered that he seems to be growing more ambitious than even the seat of Prime Minister."

After the last election, the number of reshuffles and expulsions has increased as political opponents of the prime minister have been removed from the party due to their centrist and reactionary stances. This has culminated in the undoing of previous party reforms that allowed the caucus to decide on the ministry. Further, it has increased the prime minister's ability to appoint loyalists to certain positions in the party and veto local party appointments. This control has been seen as a betrayal by some of Lee's own supporters, specifically Bill Barnard but with no clear internal opposition this state of affairs seems to be the new normal."

He has structured the Legion to ensure participation. These new reforms define that now democracy is held as such; there are Centres consisting of approximately a hundred individuals from the same suburb; these Centres were then organized into 18 divisions across the country. To facilitate decision-making, Divisional Councils were established, comprising elected Chairpersons from each Center. The division presidents form a National Council, which convenes quarterly in Wellington. Additionally, Begg has appointed a National Executive of six individuals to handle the Legion's day-to-day operations. At a policy level, a center-like institution has been created to surpass a suburban organization, enabling all members to engage in rigorous discussions on economic and political matters. These local reforms allow people to recommend ideas to their respective divisions. National division presidents collate these proposals and present them to the National Council for consideration. Ideas deemed worthy of consideration would be shared with the Centers. If approved by all Centers, they would become official national policies. If successful, this system will ensure the complete mobilization of society in governance, making everyone an integral part of the larger societal structure."

The first option is to yield to the radicals, those who believe that the nation will be best off led by a strong and proud helmsman. In this case, it would be the radicals who will act as the main decision makers for the nation, while allowing democracy on a local level.

It was also attended by 232 delegates from around the country, representatives of women's and youth organizations, and most of the re-elected anti-Labour MPs. The party was named the New Zealand National Party to signal a clean break with United and Reform. These parties had been discredited by their loss to the Labour party and neither party wished to fall under the other.

Giving our movement some legitimacy while bringing even more iwi to our side, King Pōtatau acted with the Kingmaker, our founder, and the rest of the movement to declare our autonomy from the Auckland-based colonial government on the North Island, leading to a long history of friction and conflict that only continued after Pōtatau's death to influenza in 1860 and the following reign of his son Matutaera Tāwhiao. \n\nElected to take the throne instead of his sister Te Paea Tiaho or the Kingmaker who would both instead stay on as his advisors, King Tāwhiao would rule over a rather turbulent period of armed conflict against the Pākehā based in Auckland, partially fueled by the Kingmaker Wiremu's own ambitions and designs for the movement, that would eventually lead to the disastrous loss of our own forces that forced the Kīngitanga underground, the 20-year exile of King Tāwhiao who became a wandering Christian and self-proclaimed prophet before his brief return to the throne and subsequent death in 1894, and the erosion of Māori rights despite attempts from subsequent kings and Māori parliamentarians or activists that resisted the tide - until now. With our movement brought back from the brink of death under King Korokī Te Rata Mahuta Tāwhiao Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, we shall hopefully never have to tread these dangerous waters again, for the stars and the heavens themselves now guide us to our destiny."

In a two pronged approach aimed at completely overhauling Aotearoa me Te Waipounamu's educational system to better meet the needs of the masses rather than just the desires of a few elitist colonials while simultaneously embarking on a nationwide bilingual literacy campaign aimed at both teaching English to the masses while also reviving 'te reo Māori' or the native Māori language in public, private, and governmental use, we shall finally give each and every soul in the nation the gift of learning and the keys to a better, brighter life while supporting both halves of our fused culture. Every iwi, tribal settlement, and settler town shall have at least one well-funded school, new universities shall open up in our largest cities, and all children - Māori or Pākehā - will be able to walk the path to higher education and achievement if they so desire with support and aid from our administration; with even a new scholarship program being created named after the first Māori king.

This tension is felt all across the densely-populated North Island, especially among old rivals to the constituent iwi of the Kingitanga, but also among the far more isolated and spread out iwi of the South Island. In order to appease these fellow Māori in the name of unity and peace, King Korokī has personally made visits to the chiefs and leaders of these dissenters in order to hash out deals and make concessions in the interest of pan-iwi unity. Smooth-talking his way through these diplomatic proceedings with different tribal leaders and elders while indulging in their local customs like bird hunting with the isolated Rakiura Māori of Stewart Island to the far south beyond even the South Island or sailing with the great stargazers of the North through the pristine waves of the Tasman Sea while handing out deals for autonomy, cultural recognition, and other services in exchange for loyalty, we shall unite the iwi one by one the peaceful way, even if it is the hard way."

nzl.85.d:0 "As it stands in current New Zealand politics, there are what is colloquially known as four Māori seats within Parliament, or rather four Māori electorate zones that give reserved positions to representatives of the iwi in the government. Created in 1867 with the Maori Representation Act drafted by Donald McLean, the act was only passed after lengthy debate as most conservatives of the era felt that Māori were unfit to participate in any organized government. Creating three electorates across the North Island and one large one for the entire South Island, this move was a major step forward for Māori rights and equality at the time, but has since led to a system where the rest of the settler government merely works around the Māori seats to pass whatever legislation they so desire while the existing seats dominate those Māori voices not fully represented. \n\nIn order to create a more fair government for both Māori and Pākehā, this old system shall be done away with, instead reformed and replaced by a more fair and universal system where both our people's voices are heard. Together, our nation will be a choir that combines both our human histories to reach a shared goal of improving the nation. With this new form of egalitarian mass representation, we shall ensure each and every voice in New Zealand is heard regardless of their race, ethnicity, or location."

Striving for reconciliation and Maori sovereignty recognition, the delicate task of balancing the interests of the majority Pakeha and the first nation peoples has been challenging. Nevertheless, a decision has been reached. \n\n Labour and the Ratana parties have joined forces, combining working-class interests with Ratana Church activism. This merger is now led by Eruera Tirikatene, the first Ratana member ever elected. Her consistent advocacy for social welfare aligns with the Labour party's principles. \n\n In 1918, the Ratana Church was founded by T. W. Ratana. He, after receiving divine visions, was called upon to preach God's word and provide spiritual and physical healing for his people. The party was formed to advocate for the ratification of the Treaty of Waitangi. It pushed for Maori representation and equal Maori voices across the nation. Although it existed during the Australasian era, its chances of significant political power were previously limited to four seats. Despite this, with the rise of the Kingitanga movement, the party now sees a real chance to wield influence on a broader scale. \n\n On the other hand, the Nationals have emerged from the merging of remnants from the Reform and United parties, united under Apirana Ngata. He served as a mentor on Maori rights for many party members. An esteemed figure, Ngata is recognized as an icon of the Maori struggle, even before Ratana was formed. \n\n However, Ngata's reputation has been marred by controversy, stemming from his previous disgrace as Minister of Native Affairs. Accusations of overspending on Maori social projects and literacy efforts during an economic crisis led to his resignation. Furthermore, his department was plagued by misappropriation of funds, particularly benefiting the tribe he was part of. Despite these issues, many still view him as a hero. There is hope that he can rise above adversity, akin to Lazarus, and reclaim a prominent position in the political arena once more."

He spends the majority of his spare time helping in community gardens, working as a mechanic, and helping solve the state of illiteracy that plagues many adult Maori today. These actions have further deepened support for the king in his Iwi lands. In addition, with the use of newly acquired state media, it has further popularized him among the population as a whole. The king has used his platform to speak out against the injustices of the colonization of the homeland by Europeans, and to advocate for Maori rights.

During his captivity, Te Kooti faced immense hardship and injustice. However, he escaped in 1868 and formed a group of loyal followers known as the Ringatu faith. With his newfound spiritual beliefs, Te Kooti embarked on a journey of resistance and seeking justice for his people. Te Kooti led a guerrilla campaign against British forces, evading capture numerous times. He became renowned for his strategic prowess and ability to rally Maori tribes to join his cause. Te Kooti's actions and leadership during this time became a symbol of Maori resistance to colonization and oppression. Eventually, in 1883, Te Kooti was granted amnesty by the New Zealand government, acknowledging his influential position and desire for peace. After his release, he continued to promote Maori rights and worked towards reconciliation between Maori and European settlers. Te Kooti's life testifies to his unwavering determination, spiritual strength, and commitment to his people's well-being.

On the platform for discontent conservatives against the united-reform coalition. The Legion positions itself as a truly democratic movement of individual members who, through their local chapters, set a national agenda. This is unlike a traditional party structure with an open regionalist goal to appeal to each local New Zealand conservative brand. Formed at the start of the massive economic crisis the Legion ballooned in membership as an alternative for those conservatives who were disillusioned by the New Zealand economic slump. While at one point reaching the size of the Labour Party in the movement, due to an unclear stance on a policy differing from chapter to chapter, the party has been in a slump for the past year only reinvigorated through their participation in the war effort. Binging together social creditors, Kayensianists, Lazzefair democrats, and hardline nationalists the party has positioned itself as the big tent that would truly bring an anti-syndicalist democratic-conservative New Zealand to life even if the specifics of that vision aren't clear to anyone."

Through those three years, it was no secret to anyone the open factional infighting at every level of the legion. With its major economic position finally decided, the legion could no longer stand as a big tent losing many members. However, it is still unclear what will be the form of the next legionary government. Two major blocks have formed from those who remain, namely the Democrats and the Radicals. While for the election the infighting has stopped, the two-party positions can be seen with a review of election material from 2 different chapters that would otherwise suggest that two different parties were running under one name. The Democrats stand as the faction arguing to reform the movement into a true party unified in purpose while still maintaining its hardline commitment to local democracy and alternative conservatism. This faction is made up of A.V. Davey supporters and former reform supporters. Instead of maintaining regional structures, radicals seek to unite under a powerful figurehead to guide the chapters. This faction is made up of nationalists and hardliners. While this divide has alienated many Legion supporters, regional changes to the election map have improved the Legion's election chances through local chapter organizing."
nzl.93.dd:0 "After the major reforms in the last three years the Legion now stands united as the nation's hardline conservative party. While New Zealand's future may still be uncertain the destruction of factionalism has ended much of the party's inner disagreement and in doing so has absorbed the reform party. Renamed the New Zealand Democrats they are now unrecognizable from the previous legion, causing many to wonder if the party will continue winning elections. No longer as young and naive as the party was when it first won, political experience and cunning mark the local organizing of the party."

Once a hardline democratic movement the legion now stands united under one vision and through political will alone that vision has seized the nation.

A long-time rival to the Māori King Movement, largely over his personal animosity towards Princess Te Puea Hērangi who was the grandniece to our third king Mahuta, Rātana hopes to use the Labour platform to discredit the Kīngitanga while pursuing his own similar goals of pan-iwi unity and the betterment of our shared peoples. Though his own religious movement is involved, spouting their semi-Christian semi-Māori principles they call the Ture Wairua or spiritual laws that upholds Rātana as the Piri Wiri Tua and a living prophet, this political push has largely been handled by non-theistic and secular members of the Rātana church, primarily centered around the Ture Tangata, or physical laws, and the Koata - or his named political disciples who would run for the 'cuts' or each of the Four Quarters. These politicians include rising Māori stars like Eruera Tirikatene, Maui Pomare, Pita Moko, Paraire Karaka Paikea, Tiaki Omana, and even Rātana's own eldest son Haami Tokouru Rātana, and all hold great chances at earning seats for Labour, much to our dismay.

In this way, collective bargaining powers were greatly enhanced against a dictatorship led by Freyberg that had moved to arrest the Labour Party in connection with Australiasia's collapse. With the complete chaos following the national divorce, Fintan Walsh was elected emergency-wise in Wellington. This was when 212 delegates representing 170,800 trade unionists met for the Industrial Unity Conference. The CSU and Labour Councils' Federation backed out of the conference and did not participate due to not supporting the war effort's damaging effects. However, they recently rejoined the NZFoL. The International Workers of the World is the Federation's unlikely but fastest-growing member. It was tiny and leaderless before the strike but now leads several co-ops and soldiers councils as the main supporter of orthodox syndicalism. The main non-IWW syndicalist unions that make up the Federation of Labour are those from the previous Labour alliance led by James Edwards who succeeded the original Red Feds. With this bizarre mix of union organizations taken under the umbrella of the NZFoL, Walsh has a lot of work in uniting the working class."

nzl.97.d:0 "As a co-founder of the small party, Fintan Walsh has initiated efforts to forge an alliance with the communists, aiming to unite socialists under a single banner. After weeks of negotiations, the federation has reached an agreement with the communists to allocate positions for their members within the union. The most significant role has been bestowed upon their leader, Alexander Galbraith, through a promotion within the union, ensuring his loyalty. The objective behind this decision is to end the insidious infiltration and manipulation of union infrastructure by the Communist Party. Such interference has caused internal divisions and hindered party unity. Unlike the English government, which is heavily influenced by unions, our government is shaped by locally elected members who are overseen by the unions. Consequently, these appointments will be subject to better control and oversight."

nzl.98.d:0 "New Zealander unionism may have been more inspired by American literature than that of England, but we must still reflect on the importance of our home country. With our own Syndicalist revolution the question of what form we should take has become a burning question, with many pushing for adopting the English model completely despite it being clear that it would not work. Simply taking from England's far off radical revolt would spell doom for our nation especially with our vastly different form of union organization. Instead of just copying Mother England, a New English form of syndicalism must be created, built on our liberal economy and democracy. Under the NZFoL's, a truly moderate form of syndicalism will bind the nation together."

While many have celebrated their return, the question has arisen as to how they should operate within our national government. Although more radical than the mainstream NZFoL and drawing inspiration from American radicalism, the two unions have gradually merged with only minor conflicts. While this integration is a positive development, some have noted that IWW members have been assuming significant positions within the NZFoL, hinting at potential higher ambitions."

Well known for a turbulent and chaotic marriage, it also dragged itself into party politics. The marriage lasted two years before dissolving during Elsie's pregnancy. Three years later today, the divorce became official as Elsie took full responsibility for their child Donald Farrelly. While there have been whispers in the party of the shameful disgrace this affair has left on the party, this has not stopped Elsie from resuming her feminist and communist efforts and activities, continuing to write for their newspaper while also becoming the sole caregiver for her child."

She is now with John Gibson (Jack) Locke, another major party member from England. Meeting while working on Elsie's major Red Feminist magazine, Working Women, on an article about female farmworker exploitation, they quickly became close and married soon after. The wedding was held in a small ceremony in Christchurch with close friends and family. The couple is reportedly very happy and looking forward to the future. While both come from different factions of the party, Jack being a hardliner supporting Victor Wilcox while Elsie a moderate, it seems both have agreed to keep party politics out of their marriage so it doesn't end up like her last. They have promised to make their relationship their priority and are now looking forward to starting a family."

Mainly written by Elsie Farrelly and supported by both political and apolitical women's committees, the magazine went on hiatus during Billy Hughes' anti-red crackdowns. It is a hit, despite its clear political message based on influential feminist socialists. Despite this, there have been mumblings in the Communist Party that supports it from its male members criticizing its feminist message. However, Elsise has not given up on her crusade, hitchhiking city to city to promote the magazine. Along with this a sister magazine has begun printing named Women Today that, while lacking the communist politicization, has been appealing to a broader audience."

These recent changes differ considerably from Galbirth's traditional Leninist line. Incorporating traditional New Zealand characteristics, such as those of the old socialists that made up the early Labour movement, as well as modern labourite and Maori work. These proposed policies will fit our nation's material conditions. In collaboration with the Maori people for both the liberation of workers and the nation, a renewed effort for Maori sovereignty has begun. Such an effort is spearheaded by dialogue with leaders like Te Puea, Ratana and others. New Zealand writers have also adapted early de-Leonist inspiration into feminist and pro-union works. Finally, increased democracy and local participation using transparent and free elections will allow for more freedom in our ongoing experiment. This is done while never compromising on communist party rule."

Co-founded by Elsie, the society was started with only 37 women due to New Zealand doctors failing to supply decent contraception when asked. The nation is filled with natalism and eugenics. It is obsessed with the idea that women exist to raise children and that if they practice contraception the unfit will surpass them. A society that is truly equal must end these cancerous ideologies and their effects. Our government will support ensuring that contraceptive education is spread and that stronger contraceptive availability is available. Further, the government will report on septic abortion among married women. This will enable it to understand the effects previous policies had on the population. The most significant aspect is establishing clinics so that proper support for the nation's women will exist. This is for assistance with sterility, gynecological ailments, and marital difficulties along with contraception."

With the massive differences in ideology between the exiled Bolsheviks and a lack of truly revolutionary work not lost to revisionism, a clear demand for revolutionary thought emerged from the party. A party member who had visited Albania to visit his extended family in 1935 before New Zealand's separation brought home what was a local syndicalist leader named Enver Hoxha's work. While largely overlooked, Wilcox recently decided to read the work when faced with a lack of inspiration. He found unusual ideas from what had been seen as a loyal dog of France. Many mirrored Wilcox's and drew interesting conclusions that could drive New Zealand's Marxism further. While this is fascinating, the fear of adopting syndicalist writings and poisoning our revolutionary party exists. Is it worth it?"

No longer would Elsie's line drag us down in cowardly humanism and Browderite revisionism nor would Galbraith's failures keep us stagnant. We have gained strength in our orthodox path forward, free of adventurism and opportunism, even as our vicious line struggle has left our numbers even smaller. At this point, even Wilcox himself is not above suspicion. No one breaks our line!"

nzl.108.t:0 "Old Bolshevik"
nzl.108.d:0 "While Galbraith is an icon of New Zealand communism separate from the Australian interpretation he has never been the finest we have to offer. A stale and old form of communism lacking both the motivation to move forward and the motivation to plant its roots, it has become increasingly difficult for us to hold our ground. While we continue to grow in membership the stagnation of our ideology has left many cynical, solely careerists working through the bureaucracy. While the unions stay loyal they have also been infected with this lack of inspiration. While we are still loyal to the working class there are fears we may soon grow alienated from it."

A man by the name of Stanley Graham embarked on a shooting spree, killing and wounding several, including police officers. The events leading up to the massacre can be traced back to Graham's strained relationships with his neighbors and local authorities. Graham had been involved in a series of disputes over land and property, which escalated over time. Feeling aggrieved and isolated, he harbored deep resentment towards those who wronged him. Graham's anger boiled over. A rifle was pointed at Anker Madsen as he rode his bike by Graham. He then shot at five Volunteer Defence Corps officers who had arrived at the scene in response to the initial incident. As news of the situation spread, additional police officers were dispatched to Kōwhai Flat. The nation's largest manhunt was underway. Graham was confronted only a few weeks later and shot dead in a firefight between him and the Volunteer Defence Corps. Graham claimed 14 lives during the search. While it is unknown what exactly caused Graham's disturbed nature, police reports show he had a history of threats and violence. In the aftermath of these shootings, the Graham household was burned down. The government has now relocated his wife and children across the country. As a tribute to those who died, plans are in the works to build a memorial on the former site of Mr Graham's house."

This organization serves as an additional and formal structure alongside our existing Maori regiments. The country has been divided into 21 zones and 315 tribal committees. These committees assist with recruitment and primary production, as well as collaborate on Maori manpower. The entire process is overseen by Colonel H.C. Hemphill. He leads the organization and maintains direct communication with Paraire Paikea, the Member of Parliament for Northern Maori in charge of the Māori war effort. Moreover, Maori women have been included in these regiments to provide support, resulting in the complete mobilization of families in support of the nation. While there is opposition from some, including Kingitanga Te Puea, who express concerns about the potential permanent loss of Maori lives, the organization stands as a formidable force in the defense of the nation and Maori sovereignty."

Further celebrations were held throughout the country with hundreds dressed up in colonial costumes and parading in the streets. Christchurch's 6 April procession was two miles long. The nation has celebrated its pioneering spirit with massive sculptures to show how far the nation has moved. One significant detail is the commemoration of women's rights as the first Commonwealth nation to grant women the vote. Despite all this celebration, there has been controversy among Maori participants. This is due to the colonialist aesthetic often othering Maori as the enemy and their involvement as an afterthought. Further while many saw the event as a way to enrich our national identity, Britishness infested many events, plants, and the United Kingdom Court supporting the idea of a return to the British Isles was erected. Despite all the controversy the display of the current state of New Zealand has been honest and shows how far we have moved from the original colonial state we were birthed from."

The hospital, a substantial and remote establishment inaugurated in 1884, was constructed using stone. However, Ward 5, where the 'difficult' women patients were housed, was a two-storey wooden addition. This particular ward was consistently locked during the night, with nearly all windows secured and shuttered. Unfortunately, due to staffing shortages, the ward was only checked every hour. By the time the fire was noticed, it had already gained significant momentum. Within an hour, the entire building had been reduced to ashes. Out of the 39 female patients in Ward 5, only two escaped the inferno. In light of this devastating tragedy, a commission has been appointed to investigate patient safety, fire safety, and staff requirements. The objective is to prevent such a tragedy in the future."

nzl.118.d:0 "Today, New Zealand witnessed its most devastating railway disaster in history, resulting in the tragic loss of 21 lives and leaving 47 people injured. The incident occurred at 1:45 pm when an express train failed to navigate a 183-meter radius curve in a deep cutting known locally as the Straw Cutting. This happened shortly after crossing Six Mile Creek, between Hyde and the Rock and Pillar Range. Therefore, the train derailed. The locomotive stopped on the side of the Cutting, approximately 60 meters from the derailment point. The impact caused the boiler to burst, extinguishing the fire in the firebox and causing severe scalding to the fireman. The carriages were mangled around the locomotive; all seven passenger carriages veered off the tracks. The second carriage overturned and ended up in front of the locomotive, while four other carriages telescoped into one another. Due to the remote location, rescuers took 90 minutes to reach the scene. Initial reports from Middlemarch mentioned a possible accident with a few injuries, and medical personnel did not rush to the disaster site. However, upon catching sight of the devastation from a rise on the road half a mile away, they swiftly proceeded to the scene. Some passengers remained trapped in the wreckage for several hours. Medical personnel, assisted by railway maintenance staff, worked tirelessly until darkness made it impossible to continue. There are suspicions that the driver may have been intoxicated at the time of the accident. Constables are still investigating the scene."

nzl.119.d:0 "After its initial proposal in 1861 to connect Christchurch to Picton along the east coast of the South Island, the long-awaited railway project completion has finally been achieved. This endeavor stands as the most extensive railway construction project in history. The planning stage faced challenges such as route indecision, conflicting interests, disruptions caused by the Weltkrieg, economic recession, and ineptitude from their Australasian counterparts. These obstacles caused significant delays in the construction process. As a symbolic representation of New Zealand's struggles in recent years, hindering progress, the successful completion of this railway line brings hope for the upcoming era of advancement. Prior to its full completion, the railway was partially operational, running commuter trains three times a week and facilitating major freight movements. The incomplete state of the rail system allowed for 8-hour trips, serving as a vital transportation link. With its finalization, the railway is expected to provide even broader accessibility and opportunities for transportation. This will foster economic growth and improved connectivity throughout the region."

nzl.121.t:0 "History of the Communist Party within New Zealand"
nzl.121.d:0 "At the turn of the century, New Zealand was perceived as a testing ground for social democracy. This was evident through the widespread presence of unions and the use of arbitration. While class conflict persisted, it was alleviated, aiming to eradicate inequalities among the population. However, this idyllic vision was shattered due to the Weltkrieg and the nation's absorption into Australasia. Those who once embraced this vision underwent radicalization, resulting in two distinct paths. Some aligned with the mainstream union movement and found inspiration in the revolutions in England and France. On the other hand, the hardline socialists, constituting the left wing of various parties that would eventually form the Labour Party, admired the failed Leninist revolution in Russia. These radicals embraced Bolshevik writings but also immersed themselves in American SPA and French Jacobin literature. From these study groups, the Communist Party of New Zealand was born. It established a centralized party infrastructure, consisting of a small yet active group of students. In addition to establishing a newspaper, the party's primary objective was to disseminate communist ideology regardless of its nation of origin. Additionally, the party sought to infiltrate key positions within New Zealand's unions. However, the crackdowns on subversive activities that followed the English and French revolutions escalated with New Zealand's incorporation into Australasia. As a result, many members were arrested across the country, forcing the party to go underground. This led to the party becoming the New Zealand wing of the Communist Party of Australasia. Despite its small size, around 100 members, the party's influence over unions continued to grow. In this context, Alexander Galbraith assumed the position of New Zealand's executive and general secretary of the party. This was despite lacking charisma and having a previous prison record. He devoted himself wholeheartedly to party growth. Now separated from the Australian communists, and with reduced influence from the unions, the party rose to power, although it was built on shaky foundations. As the nation stands in this delicate state, the question looms whether they can uphold an agenda that would make Lenin proud. The future of New Zealand's communist movement is uncertain. However, its leaders are determined to pursue their vision and shape the nation's political landscape."

Although this attack was quite popular in the run-up to the recent elections, it appears to be losing its potency with the electorate as more of our policies are put into action. Many citizens benefit from increased spending and social support, growing weary of opposition name-calling. It is rumored that this tactic is meant to entice Canadians to interfere with our democracy. However, so far, this strategy has not yielded significant results. As we engage in conversations with Canadians, initial hostility seems to have diminished. This suggests that this attack may simply reflect a lingering attachment to past practices and approaches. Ultimately, as the government focuses on implementing beneficial policies and addressing the nation's challenges, it is essential to maintain a forward-looking perspective and prioritize the well-being of the people. Rather than dwelling on the confrontations of the past, the nation can progress towards a brighter future by working together and finding common ground."

Labour had never formed a government before the recent election and functioned as a third party. However, the party's hardline platform has now made it a formidable opponent. Embracing certain aspects of Labour's platform, the Nationals acknowledge the significance of the superannuation system in providing for our aging population. They advocated for doubling its rate. Additionally, they support compulsory unionism and backed recent welfare state reforms.

The government is keen on fulfilling election promises while providing essential social services, avoiding leaving vulnerable citizens in the dark. To achieve this, the government has implemented higher taxes across the board. While this measure may limit ordinary people's wealth growth, it is a crucial step towards preventing a widespread recession and averting a surge in poverty rates. However, this budget has faced severe criticism from both the National Party and Fintan Walsh. They argue that it denies the working class access to basic luxuries like tobacco, alcohol, and cars. In these challenging times, the government is navigating a delicate balancing act, striving to safeguard the nation's well-being while maintaining fiscal responsibility.

Nash's party management talent breathed new life into our unionist base. Massive fundraising efforts by the man have meant all party debts have been cleared. With 5000 additional members in one month, the party's fortune has turned around. In addition, in the early 1920s, he helped centralize the party at its current headquarters.

The secondary education proficiency exam has been repealed, allowing all students to pursue high school in the standardized curriculum for secondary schooling. To further support this the leaving age has been raised to 15. Finally, a 3-year plan has been put in place to rebuild New Zealand's education system after the nation's economic downturn. This is done by increasing education funding, building schools, and raising teacher salaries.

This has been of significant use to our party as during the Australasian years he made numerous trips to Canada to meet with exiles. As a result, we legitimized our party so we were not treated as syndicalists and banned outright. While he served time in jail like many of the Labour party during the Great War due to conscription he avoided it during our separation from New Zealand, being friends with Bernard Freyberg and as such was key to the union negotiations to get us out. It is this moderation that has meant his place in the party has been more broad in his support from workers to businesses.

This fact, however, has caused problems among parliamentarians. A recent description of Semple in parliament was made by the Maoriland Worker. He was described as the 'rabid declamator using wild and whirling words and windmill gesticulations.'

While many on the right see this position as inconsistent with his hardline politics, to us it's clear. There is no inconsistency; syndicalism endangers the free world. Syndicalism has to be confronted internationally and its advocates are rooted out of the New Zealand trade union movement as here they have a far wider influence than their numbers warrant. He has denounced syndicalist union officials and fellow travelers as 'wreckers', and clashed openly with them. A recent strike with hydro workers at Mangakino occurred after the alleged victimization of a syndicalist tunneller. However, let's not be fooled, this is an exercise in strength between syndicalism and the government. It should be clear to all in New Zealand that unionism does not equate to syndicalism."

An energetic and driven member with a clear doctrine of political thinking has not yet outclassed him as a powerful figure in our government. This figure has empowered the nation through massive infrastructure improvements across the nation to drag us out of the economic slump we are in. This style has been a complete 180 turn in the public perception of the department in the past. This is due to years of Australasian failure leaving the department seen as massive waste. In the face of this new attention, there has been a share of controversy, especially from the anti-interventionists from the now defunct United Party. Semple has been declared an authoritarian in his measures, overriding officials and dignitaries declaring all workers - including Maori - who help build this nation to be paid a standard rate. In the war preparations, he derided any criticism of the defense build-up as subversive and dealt with it accordingly.

nzl.134.d:0 "With our victory, ministerial positions have been dealt to our most competent and trustworthy members but it left one rather loud, rowdy, and unluckily popular member of our government without one. John A Lee, an ambitious and hardline MP who became a popular symbol of discontent during the Great War for his railing against conscription is giving quite a show. With open clashes in the party room, everyone knows Lee needs a position to shut him up. Consequently, Savage and Nash have appointed him as under-secretary for housing, a position that is extremely critical due to previous social housing underfunding and massive demand. To everyone's relief, this position seems to have delighted Lee. As such, the sound levels of the party room have significantly reduced with the man completely enraptured by creating his vision of a socialist housing scheme. Finally, his energy and incisiveness seem to now be directed in the correct direction as he's done wonders in this position. A newly formed department has been built from the ground up with the support of great public servant Arthur Tyndall, town planner R. B. Hammond and architect F. Gordon Wilson that oversees all the details of a large-scale program of state-house construction.\n\n Already major policy has been passed, important foreign expert engineers and new subdivisions are centered on parks and gardens, with schools, halls, and shopping centers also provided. At this point, 3,440 houses have been built and new subdivisions focus on parks and gardens. Schools, malls, and shopping centers are also provided. This department's exemplary success has been an enormous boon for our government. Let's just hope Lee doesn't grow too big for his britches."

While no clear answer has been given, with several individuals citing overwork, those close to Labour leaders now know he is facing a colon cancer diagnosis. The doctors have declared that immediate surgery is needed. However, such an action would put Savage out for two months, which cannot be afforded due to his political career. Despite being urged by numerous friends, such as the Anglican bishop of Wellington, who described it as 'signing his own death warrant,' Savage has decided to push the surgery back until after the next election. With the threat of renewed conflict across the world, along with the campaigns for a new social security scheme, Savage's decision has been made. He believes he is the only one who can help New Zealand to progress through this difficult period. His health is secondary to his mission of creating a better future for the country."

The first is a potato, symbolizing the sustenance Maori communities lack, the second is a broken watch, owned by Ratana Ngahina representing the broken treaty of Waitangi, the third is a pounamu, representing the mana and spirit of the Maori people, and finally a huia feather. This final gift was the most significant. If Savage could restore all three he would be entitled to wear them and signify his chiefly status. These gifts cannot be underestimated.

With the nickname Uncle Scrim, his Christian socialist views have become widespread after years of economic hardship especially supported by the Labour Party. Michael Joseph Savage and John Lee are close friends despite personal differences. This popularity has also been answered by challenges by the coalition, however.

nzl.138.d:0 "With the upcoming election, the battle between different radio stations over which party should succeed has hit a fever pitch with a recent controversy. A recent pro-labor broadcast on private station 1ZB was jammed by the Post And Telegraph Department. The Methodist minister, Labour sympathizer, and radio host Colin Scrimgeor's regular Saturday program was interrupted by a loud distortion that ensured none of the reverend's speech could be heard. Described as if 'the forces of Satan had tuned in on the station and pandemonium reigned' by a listener this broadcast drew significant attention as many expected Scrim to detail which party Scrim would endorse. \n\n The next morning the coalition government denied any involvement in the event dismissing it as \"a childish rag\" to discredit the government. However, Scrim's next broadcast announced otherwise. \n\n 'We were today informed by an anonymous informant that a portable transmitter had been unloaded on the site of the old Newmarket railway station on Friday. We approached various officers of the Post and Telegraph Department and all denied any knowledge of the fact that there was a transmitter there.' \n\n Further he announced that 1ZB had noticed a shed with a large aerial sticking out of the top and after gaining access to the shed found a massive radio jammer the owner claimed was used to 'tap into the British football results. Colin Scrimgeor repeated what was meant to be broadcast the day before. Instead of calling for support for one party or another urged a fair and balanced view built on common sense. /n/n After an investigation, it has been established that the postmaster-general issued instructions to take the radio off the air, and the Police commissioner sent a telegram to the Auckland police superintendent to not initially investigate the jamming until it was requested for in parliament. Adam Hamilton has taken most of the blame for the whole event however after it was revealed that he had called for a plan of action against 1ZB in vague terms. Despite this plan he has defended himself claiming to not know what the term 'jamming' meant at the time despite being the minister of telegraphs."

Recent developments however have shocked even the most loyal to the old party lines watching the two both undermine and overrule the other. Both bicker incessantly over party positions of minor officials and turn short meetings of coalition positions into hour-long tugs-of-war. Forbes has seen depression bouts allowing Coates to often step over his head and run his ministry in his stead. This situation seems to have no end.

nzl.141.d:0 "During the Australian government, Gordon Coates served as minister for New Zealand's native affairs. Australian indigenous peoples had no such post in the Australasian government. As such it was considered a major compromise in the merging of the two nations. During Coates's tenure, he was lauded as a competent and loud voice in the government. He fought against land confiscations that spiked with the underfunding of New Zealand services after the Great War. Close friends with Apirana Ngata, speaking some Maori, and having some children with a past Maori wife, Coates was an icon of possible reconciliation between Maori and Pakeha, working hard in solving land grievances and pushing the national government of Billy Hughes to adopt the Maori arts and crafts act and with the support of kingitanga's Te Puea Herangi of Waikato created a commission into land seizures in the wars of the 1860s. It's these experiences that have been brought into his current government tenure. He is no longer held back by Billy Hughes' government which has led to a large investment in Maori communities. While Ratana has criticized our government and continues to support Labour due to the lack of consultation with local leaders in policy decisions, they applauded Coate's work as greatly improving the situation."

This has been magnified by the loss of Australian support, causing prices to skyrocket. Despite the United Party's dislike of government intervention, it's clear that farmers must be supported. As such a set of bills have been passed to turn this around. Investment in small farms has increased and unemployed workers have been sent to work for relief payments on these farms. Further banks have been pushed to reduce interest rates for farmers along with reducing overheads for these farmers. While massively popular with the producing base of New Zealand society many conservatives have become outraged, with Forbes blasting it in speeches and former friend A. V.

Rather than allow the syndicalist terror to choke us, the 27th of the army has been sent to load and unload ships. The government has unveiled a set of further policies that would mean that these wharfies would be put in their place have proved controversial.

While Holland is not a theorist, he acknowledges the practical bond British identity created between the New Zealand people and their fellow men inside and outside of the country. Further, he stressed the independent and sturdy New Zealand philosophies of independence and self-reliance that had defended it from imported ideologies such as syndicalism that had captured England in its snare.

Since his return, he has garnered support from the New Zealand Far Right, promoting anti-Semitic literature, criticizing Maori obstructionism, and denouncing syndicalist interference. This support comes primarily from Empire loyalists and the Australian Centre Party. One of Field's notable works, "The Truth about the Slump," which delves into our nation's economic collapse during the Australasian period, has gained significant traction and recognition, with even Canadian SocCreds referencing it. It is this very book that led the social creditors within our movement to invite him to join the legion. He is now hailed as an icon of their faction.

This fact has become ever more obvious to the movement as we have served in government with a lack of clarity on hierarchy and party position. While the general points are defined he often fails to point out specifics and while an active and motivated organizer he fails to truly define the party structure. This has led to other popular figures taking charge of many key aspects of the legion. Factions have formed behind key power players to unite the legion under their interpretation of Begg's line. This has led to massive bouts of legionnaire infighting giving the press a field day to criticize.

One chapter on the north island may be more open to Maori reforms while a southern chapter may completely oppose any intervention in their circumstances. These differences have led to complete confusion along party lines. Even when agreements have been made at the top by all representatives, many at local levels have both misinterpreted, railed against or even left the party in disagreement. This variation has slowed any party agreement to a crawl and has meant that the most fundamental of our party platform has become unclear.

nzl.157.d:0 "Arthur Nelson Field, a prominent writer associated with the far-right movement in the country and connected to the radical wing of the Legion, has recently published his latest book. Following the success of his previous works, "The Truth About The Slump" (1934) and "The Truth About New Zealand" (1939), Nelson has now shifted his focus to the education system in New Zealand. The book argues that school boards employ evolutionary theory to indoctrinate the younger generation to foment revolution. Nelson calls for intervention to cease the teaching of this theory to protect our nation from aesthetic-satanic motivations. Throughout the book, the author vehemently contests the authenticity of evolutionary theory. He launches attacks against its creators and discredits the evidence supporting it as fraudulent. While these arguments may not be entirely novel, as they echo common talking points found in similar books that the author often references, the conclusions he draws present a fresh perspective. He traces the theory's origins back to French revolutionary thought, positing that its sole purpose was to replace religion. Expanding upon this notion, the author further claims that the French Revolution was merely a contrived spectacle orchestrated by the same hidden forces responsible for the communist and syndicalist uprisings of the modern age. Nelson says anyone promoting evolutionary theory aids and abets these covert forces. \n\n Many critics of this book find it laughably flawed. Many point to the author's blending of opinion with fact, selective ignorance of inconvenient evidence, flawed assumptions, misinterpretation of quotes taken out of context, and non sequitur arguments. These are clear indications that the book was not written in good faith to present a valid argument against evolution. Instead, they argue that it was crafted with a clear agenda to link New Zealand's far-right figures to a conspiracy. Furthermore, critics are concerned about the author's well-known anti-Semitic views. They argue that the constant references to "hidden forces" and "puppet masters" provide no significant leap in logic to suggest that the book's claim of "hidden forces behind the French Revolution and other revolutions" is merely a covert insinuation of a Jewish conspiracy."

nzl.158.d:0 "Today, the far-right author and social credit theorist Arthur Nelson Field has released a new book, in which he claims to expose how "New Zealand came to jump from the frying-pan of capitalism into the fire of socialism." Building on the success of his previous book, "The Truth of the Slump," which aimed to reveal the orchestrators of debt, syndicalist wreckers, and bureaucrats working in unison to undermine New Zealand's economy during its integration into Australasia, his latest work, "The Truth of New Zealand," seeks to uncover the present forces impeding the newly independent economy. Unsurprisingly, the author asserts that the same causes are behind these challenges. The book's main critique revolves around the system that emerged after a coup, which heavily relies on speculative investment and socialist intervention. Field says this system serves a select few elites at the expense of most Entente loyalists. Although popular within the social credit movement, many economists criticized the book for oversimplifying complex issues. They have also attempted to attribute all of the country's hardships to a single elite group. The author employs a populist appeal, presenting his system as the only solution, while pretending to provide a fair and balanced explanation of the facts. Furthermore, Field's well-documented belief in a Jewish conspiracy to subjugate the capitalist and Christian world, originating from syndicalist movements in England and France, as well as its alleged connection to the collapse of the British presence in Australia, has led many to view this as the root cause of the problems highlighted in the book."

One man seems to have come to our rescue, Bob Semple!\n\n A hero of the Labour movement and the Labour party, this titan of New Zealand is proposing a set of tanks to defend ourselves. Having limited capacity to produce tanks, the man has taken advantage of the industry we have on hand and developed a design to meet the needs. As we can produce and use a lot of Caterpillar D8 tractors, the design would utilize its chassis and build a tankette with corrugated and non-corrugated manganese. This armor deflects small arms fire and outputs enough firepower to target enemy infantry with its six Bren light machine guns. Only costing roughly 5,900 pounds, and with no formal plans for its usage in any offensive role, it has been proposed only as a last line of desperate defense. While many across the nation have ridiculed the idea, especially those opposed to Labour, some have acknowledged the worth of such preparations.

For now, there is no clear stance in the armed forces on whether we should negotiate a cease-fire or carry on with the conflict. Those advocating for a continued conflict cite that now is the most favorable chance we have to end this threat, New Zealand's economy is extremely weak, their naval strength is negligible and they lack any major world power support. They argue that if we cease this conflict early then the island can solve these issues and if the conflict resumes our advantage in this war would be lost. The other camp acknowledges this fact but claims that this war has driven our economy into free fall. The length of this war has only derailed society which could lead to complete chaos breaking out.

However, radicals view it as a half measure, with Tom Baker's International Workers of the World condemning it even louder. This has all come to a head with our recent cooperation with the Labour Party to further unite New Zealand society. In response to the announcement, IWW cooperatives voted to revolt against alleged counterrevolutionary forces. With rioting in the streets, militia, and soldier councils deserting to the IWW's cause, they have begun a clear attempt to seize power. After hours pass the revolts result in..."

nzl.352.d:0 "Fintan Walsh was arrested during the strikes that allowed the communist party to sweep into power on the backs of the unions. It was his absence and moderating voice that made it so easy to rile the working class into revolution in those days that shook the nation. On the day of our success, he was freed and given a token position as head of the Wellington Seafarers Union. At first, rumors circulated that the man harbored doubts about the party. According to Wilcox's anti-revisionists, he was a credible threat that should be purged. After the removal of opportunistic party factions, Galbraith has worked hard to rehabilitate Walsh. With the chairman's old age, he needs allies. As a co-founder of the party before moderating his position, Fintan Walsh has embraced the radicalism of his youth. As a powerful union organizer, he has been key to driving support back to the party after the factional collapse of the past. He has been so successful some have suggested that Walsh be elected chairman of the government instead of Galbraith who has become sickly and slow in his age. Walsh has strong connections with the unions and as they hold much of the power the party relies on it would greatly improve the nation's efficiency."

nzl.353.t:0 "Maori Housing Reform"
nzl.353.d:0 "After the First World War, Māori people migrated from the country to the cities seeking work and a better life. Many have faced discrimination from landlords and had little option than to settle in the so-called slum districts of cities, where landlords were more open to Māori as tenants, but where the houses were often old and run-down. With the ascendance of the Kingitanga such squalor conditions will not be tolerated. Support will be given through social housing along with returning the land stripped from Maori hands by the landlords back to the tenants. This will be an important step towards achieving equality and justice for Māori. The government must act to ensure that Māori are given the same rights and access to housing as other citizens. All New Zealanders should be able to live in safe and secure homes."

nzl.354.t:0 "Reviving Te Reo"
nzl.354.d:0 "Te Reo, has been in mass decline for years. This was due to a number of factors, including the influx of European settlers and the cultural assimilation of Maori people. Additionally, the Maori language has been discouraged in its use, which has negatively affected its continued use. These issues have been further highlighted at universities, in prominent social circles, and in a recent petition to our government from New Zealanders with over 30,000 signatures. The nation faces calls for an increased effort to promote the Maori language and ensure Maori cultural identity remains alive for generations to come. In response to this call, classes have been opened across primary and secondary schools. Te Reo has been recognised by law as the official language of New Zealand. Signs in public have been altered to include place names in Te Reo, along with the English version. The government has also set up initiatives to ensure the language is passed down to the next generation by providing language classes for children and adults."

nzl.355.d:0 "One of the most important figures of the modern Kīngitanga is that of Te Puea Hērangi, who through her tireless work has basically been the sole person responsible for legitimizing the movement before our separation from Australasia. Grandniece to the third king Mahuta, a lifelong rival to Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana and his Labour-backed anti-traditionalist church, the most widely-respected public advocate for the Māori King Movement, an anti-conscription activist on the behalf of the iwi during the Great War, a believer in mana and its influence on the masses through spiritual and metaphysical forces, a humanist reformer supportive of women's rights, the continuation of modernized tohunga cultural practices, and other liberal assurances, and a true believer in the pan-iwi philosophy whose torch is now carried by her Kīngitanga, there are few people as dedicated to the betterment of daily Māori life as Te Puea, and as such she must be honored!"

nzl.356.d:0 "Prophet. Faith Healer. Activist. Rua Kēnana Hepetipa was a man of many titles and accolades, and he shall always be remembered as a true hero of the Māori, even by those that did not follow his specific faith. Calling himself Te Mihaia Hou or the New Messiah, and claiming to be the prophesied successor of guerilla fighter and religious leader Te Kooti Arikirangi who founded the Ringatū Church, Rua was first born in 1869 at Maungapōhatu that has since become his own holy town and center of his own splinter faith. Fusing Old and New Testaments together with a mix of Māori spiritualism and cultural symbolism, Rua hoped to create a new form of the Ringatū faith centered around himself and free from the violent history that plagued Te Kooti Arikirangi's past as an armed rebel in order to uplift and enlighten the Māori while protecting them from Pākehā interests. Creating a utopian commune called New Jerusalem for his followers complete with farming cooperatives and savings bank, Rua and his flock were eventually targeted by the Native Land Court and the Auckland government, forcing him into prison for resisting arrest after dodging false sedition charges and later forcing his commune into decline in Rua's absence. With his legacy being untarnished and with Rua himself being posthumously pardoned following his recent death and apparent inability to reincarnate as he promised, we shall always remember the good-natured yet divisive prophet."

Being honored with the Order of New Zealand for her work as founder and president of the Māori Women's Welfare League or Te Rōpū Wāhine Māori Toko I te Ora, focusing on uplifting Māori women and children and the wider official aim of promoting 'fellowship and understanding between Māori and European women and to cooperate with other women's organizations, Departments of State, and local bodies for the furtherance of these objects.', Cooper is also known for her private career as a devout Catholic advocate and humanitarian, for her small business work, for her refusal of arranged marriage that led her to become an icon for anti-traditionalism and women's rights, and for her pro-Labour and allegedly pro-Anglo political stances. A true daughter of Aotearoa and one of New Zealand's leading ladies, Whina Cooper shall surely be honored as a living hero for decades to come."

nzl.358.d:0 "Passing away at the age of 66, the Mangai - or Mouthpiece of God - Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana leaves behind an interesting legacy. A member of the Ngati Pa and Ngā Wairiki iwi born in 1873, little is known about his life before 1918, where he rose to national prominence rapidly as a faith healer and spiritual icon during the influenza epidemic that killed millions worldwide after allegedly receiving a call to do good works from God - who took the form of a glowing cloud that broke open to reveal an overwhelming perfect radiance - just three days before the end of the Great War. He was told the Holy Spirit was looking for a people through whom God could be truly known and accepted, and because the Māori people had not forgotten Jehovah, they had been chosen to become an example to the world - but only they would turn from their dependence on 'tohungaism', manipulative witchcraft, and the old Maori gods. Rātana was told to unite the Māori and turn them to 'Ihoa o nga Mano' or Jehovah of the Multitude, and so he did by dedicating his life's work to the creation of this religion alongside the nation's largest faith healing ministry while working towards the enlightenment and upliftment of his people, and later also enjoying a brief stint in politics as an ally of Labour. \n\nA longtime rival of the Māori King Movement that instead has worked for the Māori to live as equals within the settler system, T. W. Rātana lived his life championing the idea that Māori-Christian religious synthesis, Labour politics, and ratification of the Treaty of Waitangi in full would solve all of the issues that plague the Māori. Whether he was right or wrong cannot be said, but the impact he had on New Zealand shall always be felt both spiritually and politically as his growing mass of disciples continue his work as he passes into the next life."

nzl.359.d:0 "Giving up the ghost after a multi-year long battle with sickness that saw him traveling between New Zealand and San Francisco, California for his health after a bout with tuberculosis left his lungs impaired, the Honourable Sir Māui Wiremu Pita Naera Pōmare leaves behind an honorable legacy mired by a bit of controversy not large enough to displace his position as one of the most prominent Maori politicians of our age. Born in 1875, or possibly 1876, in a pā - or hillfort settlement - near Urenui in Taranaki of Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Toa descent, his maternal grandmother Kahe Te Rau-o-te-rangi was one of the signers of the original Treaty of Waitangi, and he too tried to live up to his greatness in his dual career as both a medical doctor and a politician. Long working as an activist and public advocate for his people, Sir Māui Pōmare was particularly known for his work to improve health and living conditions for his people, though his career has long been marred by the black mark that is known as the 'Final Disaster' for his people, where he negotiated the effective removal of the last of the Taranaki Māori people from their land - some 18,000 acres - due to the enacting of freehold policies in a move that virtually eradicated the ability to own land and hopes of future survival for his iwi, all in a failed hope to save them from the growing settler government. Despite this controversy, he was still an honored government figure, serving as the Minister of Health while also being appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) in 1920 and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1922 due to his great work at his post. A divisive figure with a dotted but still honorable past, Sir Māui Pōmare shall still be honored regardless, for he did his best to save his people."

nzl.360.t:0 "Enshrining 'Tohungaism'"
nzl.360.d:0 "Working to undo the cultural damage caused by the Tohunga Suppression Act of 1907 which aimed to replace many tohunga faith healers and traditional health ideas with modern western medicine in a bid to limit preventable and premature Māori mortality rates, the Māori Crown has moved to enshrine certain protections for what has been dubbed 'Tohungaism.' Tohunga alone, or tohuka in the southern dialect, are expert practitioners of any skill, craft, or art - religious or otherwise - and includes the likes of priests, navigators, carvers, builders, teachers, advisors, and more all central to traditional Māori society, similar to the kahuna of Hawaiian culture or the tahu'a of Tahiti. From the Tohunga tā moko - experts in the ancient art of tattooing - to the Tohunga tātai arorangi - the expert star readers - to other disciplines like linguistics, foretellers of the future, canoe builders, totem carvers, and more, all shall have a protected and everlasting place in New Zealand's society, with even our faith healers having a larger role once again working alongside trained western-style doctors as equal partners administering two halves - spiritual and physical - of the healing whole. \n\nHowever, one major source of debate on this move has risen up on the role of Tapu in this tohunga revival. Tapu is one of the most deeply ingrained beliefs and religious customs of Māori, being a set of taboos, customs, laws, and prohibitions similar to Muslim haram or Jewish tumah/kosher laws, and has always been linked to the tohunga priesthood especially. The debate has arisen over whether these restrictive, seemingly-archaic restrictions, prohibitions, and quarantines have any place in modern New Zealand society, especially one so dominated by a White majority despite our native-led government. As we revive Tohungaism and our own native culture, we must also decide if Tapu has any place in modern law as well, or if it should be kept a private thing that the iwis enforce, or don't, in their own mara and hapu at their own leisure?"
nzl.360.a:0 "Keep it to a cultural, artistic, and spiritual lens only."

nzl.361.t:0 "The Maori Candidate"
nzl.361.d:0 "As the first democratic elections of this newly independent New Zealand draw near, the Labour party has been met with an interesting proposal. The famed Māori faith healer, religious leader, and humanist activist T. W. Rātana, in his bid to win all four of the Māori Seats in Parliament in order to ensure the prosperity of his people and the expansion of the Rātana Church, has offered to work with the Labour Party by having his coalition of various Māori politicians run on a Labour ticket, expanding Labour control into the three main Māori electorates on the North Island and the larger unified one on the South Island while uplifting Māori across New Zealand and gaining their electoral support for years to come, all in exchange for greater rights, privileges, autonomy, and benefits for all Māori. With many Māori politicians like Eruera Tirikatene, Maui Pomare, Pita Moko, Paraire Karaka Paikea, Tiaki Omana, and even Rātana's own eldest son Haami Tokouru Rātana all offering to run on a Labour ticket, the prospect of near-total political support from the Māori is tempting, despite the likely concessions Labour will likely need to make with the  Rātana Church, with even major party figures like Michael Joseph Savage supporting the initiative.

Hailing from Havai'i - a semi-mythical island allegedly within the Society Islands that is known for being the original birthplace of the Māori, or proto-Māori, before they sailed to Aotearoa me Te Waipoanamu - the North and South Island aka the Land of the Long White Cloud - and across Polynesia - Kupe is seen as a pseudo-demigod and patriarch to Polynesia as a whole, and for this he is honored throughout New Zealand and the wider Pacific. Sailing to our new home between 40 and 23 generations ago (roughly 1000-1300 CE) depending on the specific oral myth and iwi telling it, Kupe left Havai'i with his wife Kuramarotini, the great warrior Ngahue, and a large crew aboard the great canoe, or catamaran in some stories, called Matawhourua in search of Kupe's great rival Muturangi - a high priest protected by a kaitiaki - or familiar or guardian spirit - named Te Wheke-a-Muturangi that took the shape of a massive octopus or kraken - but instead were unknowingly guided by the beast to New Zealand. Keeping this history and the great legacy of Kupe the hero forever in our hearts, we shall once again take to the seas in search of glory, adventure, and prosperity in a grand shipbuilding and shipyard expansion scheme modeled after our catamaran-riding ancestors of old. With the true location of Havai'i still unknown, with new riches and mysteries just over every other wave or on every tiny stip of sand or coral, and with the stars guiding us as they did for Kupe before us, we shall make the seas our own once more, for who knows what might be out there!"

Our support for Māori living in urban areas has meant that as more and more move for work, we were able to better utilize their labour for the economy. Further, the loss of manpower from our crucial sheep shearing industry has been dealt with through our delegate's management of local resources. Whether it be the stark increase in unionized Maori or the social changes in historical and cultural support, the increase in quality of life can only be attributed to our collaboration with Robert \"Bob\" Tūtaki. \n\nHe was originally our only delegate at the founding of the NZFoL, born in 1887 at Hawkes Bay, and a head delegate for sheep shearers in the New Zealand Workers' Union. Bob has spent most of his life fighting for the rights of working men and from his original station he has risen up the ranks. With his integral role in building a new base of support in the Maori people and his connections in the Labour Party, with the upcoming union elections, Bob seems to be a strong competitor to Walsh. Neither representing any major change in government ideology and only running for vice president, some have recommended that Walsh step down to further advance the progress taken to unite both the English and Maori people of our nation.

MON_claims_of_greatness:0 "Claims of Greatness"
MON_claims_of_greatness_desc:0 "Baron Roman Nicolaus von Ungern-Sternberg is the enigmatic and brutal leader of Mongolia. His fearsome reputation is such that it has led some Buddhists to claim that he is both an avatar of the God of War and the reincarnation of Genghis Khan himself.

Some may see this as a good thing, however, there are rumors of a new contender to the leadership of Mongolia. Gada Meiren, a man famous for fighting against autocrats, has been spotted inciting people to violence within the tribal communities of Mongolia.

Born as Agvaanl Uvsanchoijinyam Danzan Vanchüg, this reincarnation of the spiritual head of Gelug Tibetan Buddhism stands as both the spiritual and, in theory, political leader of Mongolia, but reality is often different from theory. \n\nIn truth, the Bogd Khan’s domain is run by the Bloody Baron Ungern-Sternberg, but this has not reduced the Bogdo Lama to be a mere puppet. Given their similar goals and dreams of a strong and free Mongolia, the two have grown quite close as they endeavor to restore the former glories of the Mongolia people to this sad, run-down state they now found themselves lording over. This relationship has drawn the ire of the other Lamas, as well as the various democratic and zealous Buddhist groups in our nation, who view this cooperation between the ‘False Khan’ and the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as a perversion of Buddhist traditions and practices. \n\nRegardless, the ageing Bogd Khan still nominally rules as the monarch and patriarch of Mongolia and the Father of Mongolian Buddhism, and now only time will tell if he strengthens his own positions or lets himself and his nation drift off as puppets of other, more ambitious actors."

Born as Agvaanl Uvsanchoijinyam Danzan Vanchüg, this reincarnation of the spiritual head of Gelug Tibetan Buddhism stands as both the spiritual and political head of Mongolia - a true monarch for his people to rally around. Though his past relationship and cooperation with the Bloody Baron has soured his view in the eyes of some of his citizens, most still view him as a divine figure and the only true rule of Mongolia. \n\nRegardless of some doubters, the ageing Bogd Khan still nominally rules as the monarch and patriarch of Mongolia and the Father of Mongolian Buddhism, and now only time will tell if he strengthens his own positions or lets himself and his nation drift off as puppets of other, more ambitious actors."

MON_warrior_society_desc:0 "For centuries, the Mongolian peoples have been living in a very nomadic society, moving across the Mongolian steppes every year, never settling down. The experiences of traversing the harsh steppes and constant conflict from being situated between the Russian Civil War and warring Chinese Warlords has carved out a populace of fierce fighters. Spurred on by Sternberg’s glorification of victory and sacrifice, the nomadic hunters of the land have been transformed into a vicious cavalry of killers."

MON_DH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mongolia was ruled by the Qing Dynasty for centuries, until the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. Yet, Mongolia did not gain full independence until Baron Roman Nicolaus von Ungern-Sternberg and his Asiatic Cavalry Division invaded Mongolia in 1920 and delivered it from the Russian protectorate. Having then captured a significant section of the resource-rich region of Tuva from the Russians, he was free to consolidate his rule. Sternberg began promoting his political authority in the country, developing a powerful military apparatus too entrenched for anyone to dislodge from his position while he works to make his claims and desires a reality..."

MON_totalist_party_long:0 "Mongol Ardyn Nam (Ündsen Jigüür)\n§LMongolian People's Party (Radical Wing)§!\n§gThe Mongol Ardyn Nam, or Mongolian People’s Party, is a wide coalition of various Mongolian Marxists, Syndicalists, Totalists, Anarchists, and other general far-left groups all banded together to pursue a Socialist Mongolian state. As the oldest organized political party in the nation, it long dominated Mongolian politics until Ungern-Sternberg’s rise. Heavily influenced by the Bolsheviks, by the LKMT and the smaller CPC, many of its members have lived in exile abroad since the rise of the Mad Baron and the failure of the 1922 Revolution during the Russian Civil War. More authoritarian and militant than their moderate MAN counterparts, this Totalist-inspired wing of the party seeks to bring about a true Communist Revolution guided by the ides of Lenin, creating a worker's paradise for the Mongolian Proletariat. However, the faction is split between those who wish to drift back towards the Bolsheviks, and those that wish to drift instead towards Chinese Socialism, but given their weakened position, their hope of doing so without an outside force aiding them is slim.§!"

As the oldest organized political party in the nation, it long dominated Mongolian politics until Ungern-Sternberg’s rise. Drawing large influences and inspirations from the successful revolutions in France and Britain and in the rising Syndicalist movements in Indochina and Indian, these Mongolian Syndicates seek to create their own Council of Trade Unions here in Mongolia to help uplift the worker’s of our growing nation while rapidly pushing for industrialization at all costs.

Behind him stand thousands of militiamen and tribal volunteers willing to die for his righteous cause - to oust the infective Chinese and other foreign parasites from Mongolia. Though some of his ideas the West would describe as socialist or progressive, he is also a militant nationalist and more of a storied figure of legend than any true political ideologue, herding his hordes of nomadic followers to steal back the rightful land of the Mongols from nobles, lamas, and foreigners who seek to sully this great Steppe.§!"

As the oldest organized political party in the nation, it long dominated Mongolian politics until Ungern-Sternberg’s rise. The main wing of the party, and by far the largest and most influential, is the democratic wing. Primarily composed of social democrats, democratic socialists, mild anarchists, L-KMT exiles, and numerous other smaller groups, this diverse group perseveres together in the pursuit of a truly progressive, Red democracy for Mongolia. As the largest Socialist force in the nation, their only real competition for support comes from the exploits of Gada Meiren, or would have if it were not for Gada Merien’s forces and the MAN hammering out a deal of cooperation and coalition for the good of Mongolia.

Taking inspiration from the less radical wings of the Chinese KMT as well as heavily from the Qing’s Chinese Youth Party, MZN fuses Mongolian nationalism with secularist, liberial, and progressive ideologies to create a truly Mongolian strain of liberalism. Advocating heavily for free speech, self-determination, and a total abolition of the current feudal system, MZN are enticing to many in Mongolia who seek a less radical alternative to the Mongol Ardyn Nam.§!"

Seeing themselves as the true liberal party of Mongolia, these ‘national liberals’ as they like to fashion themselves as are heavily influenced by various liberal movements and parties in China and Russia, as well as from the numerous Buryat exiles that have poured into Mongolia from Russia and Transamur. Seeking to industrialize and modernize Mongolia without losing touch with their unique national culture and identity, as well as their deep reverence to nature - a belief they share with their new Buryat friends - MÜK shall drag Mongolia into a modern and liberal future, if they can get enough votes that is.§!"

Accusing their contemporaries and former allies of corruption and greed, this group of primarily younger nobles will have a hard time of supplanting their superiors as the dominant monarchical faction in Mongolia, but their calls for a constitutional monarchy and a separation of church and state powers resonants with many more liberal elements in the nation that might just earn them the support they need to win an election and establish their dream.§!"

Their primary goal is to establish a true monarchy within Mongolia, with the princes and nobles filling out the hierarchy and serving as aides, advisors, and supplemental leaders to the King. However, where ideas in the party differ is on who should be crowned as the first new King of Mongolia. The two main camps are the traditionalists, who seek to keep Church and State matters unified with the Bogd Khan reigning as both spiritual and political leader of the nation, and the secularists, who instead seek to separate these institutions and let the Bogd Khan continue his reign as the spiritual leader of the nation. However, this faction seeks to crown either the leading Prince in their coalition, Demchugdongrub, or even the Khan of Kumul as their new King and political leader.

Since then, Ungern has ruled as the official Baron under this 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, with the Bogd Khan technically ruling as a monarch. However, reality has played out differently than this intended plan, and though the two are close, the Baron Ungern-Sternberg has increasingly seized more of the power in the nation for himself, pushing his old friend and suzerain more and more into the position of a glorified puppet. As his grip on total power further coalesces, he has begun to cultivate a cult of personality around himself, and has filled his military and government with his Russian allies and Mongolians who remain loyal to him.

Their main aim is to establish a Russian nationalist state in Mongolia, seeking to invite as many Russians to our borders to build up our economy and military before ultimately retaking the lands Russia lost in China during the Russo-Japanese War.

With most of Central Asia in his hands, Ungern Khan rules all Mongolic peoples and everyone living in a yurt swears allegiance to him alone. A man beyond the capabilities of other mortals, Ungern is thought of by many Mongolians as an avatar of the God of War or in the very least – as a reincarnation of the great Genghis Khan and with his newest victories those doubting these claims have been reduced to a mere handful. Fuelled by the sweet fruits of victory Ungern Khan has convened a grand assembly in Urga to manifest the triumph of Mongolia's recent conquests. The question, however, remains whether or not the Mad Baron will satisfy himself with the establishment of a Greater Mongolia or take his faithful tribal forces and his hardened Savage Division further on the path of ambition, madness and glory?"

However, his officers and generals always waited for the right moment to overthrow him, as they considered him an out-of-control warmonger who had no mercy even for his trusted lieutenants. Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern's demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling. The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government. Commanders loyal to the Khan were arrested without any warning and all major sites in Urga occupied by the putschists. As the rebels stormed the Baron's residence, Ungern viciously defended himself shooting several leading conspirators in a desperate firefight. However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself. Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan came to an end."

mongolia.35.d:0 "Today newspapers around the world has been filled with the news of the assassination of the Russian president, Alexander Kerensky. Due to the assassination, Russia has fallen into domestic chaos and will thus not be interested nor capable of intervening in domestic Mongolian politics. Roman von Ungern-Sternberg understands that this is the right time to make Mongolia as great as it once was, but he needs a skilled second in command to succeed. Will he choose his loyal general from the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Boris Rezukhin? Or maybe the current head of government, the Mongolian aristocrat Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren to further consolidate his popularity with the Mongol people? Finally the religious leader, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, could be chosen to guarantee Ungern's divine status and prove his direct reincarnation as the God of War?"

mongolia.38.d:0 "Tibet always enjoyed cordial relations with Mongolia, but once they heard about the restoration of our Great Empire, the cowardly government in Lhasa turned their back upon Ungern. The union of the two peoples and the consolidation of Buddhism's two great centres would cement Ungern's claim to a new Mongolian Empire. We should liberate Tibet from the heretical traitors who care more about their moneybags than about their people. Our armies are ready to bring peace and prosperity to Tibet - Genghis Khan II has to unite all Mongolic peoples into one nation. It's our destiny."
mongolia.38.a:0 "Ungern Khan shall unite ALL Buddhists! Onward!"
mongolia.38.b:0 "We have enough Lamas in Urga."

mongolia.40.t:0 "Tribal Revolt!"
mongolia.40.d:0 "The Mongols always held von Ungern-Sternberg in high regards and called him 'Ak Bagatur' – 'The White Warrior'. It was generally believed that he was a reincarnation of Genghis Khan and as such didn't care much about his original Russian upbringing. But when Ungern was overthrown and his generals took power, the Mongol population was deeply disappointed with the successor's behaviour. The former commanders of Ungern's army considered themselves Russians and ruled Mongolia as if were a colony and not their motherland. This oppression combined with the strictness of a military regime caused a wave of riots in the Mongolian army, which consisted of various tribesmen under command of steppe nobility. Leaders of the Mongol tribes under the command of the aristocratic 'noyan' Amagaiin Bajudai started a massive anti-government revolt under the slogan of "Mongolian tribes against the Russian oppressors". Soon a wave of terror covered the steppes..."

mongolia.48.d:0 "It's been hundreds of years since Macau became a Portuguese holding in 1557 by purchasing it from the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Now that the South lies in the hands of the Mongolians once more, the khan is considering whether to claim the port of Macau from the Portuguese or to not interfere with the ownership of the city sold before the rise of the Mongols."

mongolia.48.b:0 "Let the idea slide."

mongolia.49.t:0 "Mongol Demands"

Though we have lost many of our countrymen and allies along the way, we have triumphed under the leadership and guidance of Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, and now all of Russia is our prize. For the second time in history, a force has ridden out from the Eastern Steppe to conquer all of Russia, but this time it was not a mere Mongol leading the charge, but a true son of Russia himself! \n\nNow, the Baron shall rule this prize as regent until an official government can be formed and the true Tsar found. In Mongolia, his old ally and friend the Bogd Khan shall rule in his stead, serving as an ally to Sternberg’s Russia while simultaneously granting the Mongolian people independence and self-rule."

Sternberg, along with his elite Russian guard entered the camp of Ja Lama while being tracked with the beady eyes of the Lama’s battle hardened forces and made their way towards the central yurt. There, the Lama sat playing cards with his generals, old and wise and yet completely drunk and surrounded by a horde of plunder and weapons. One such weapon in the Ja Lama’s illustrious collection was a Russian Fedorov, a weapon Sternberg had once also used in a shared struggle with Ja Lama.  As the Baron began to speak, he was swiftly shushed and pushed back by Ja Lama’s guard, not wanting their game to be disturbed or their master to be angered and roused from his drunken stupor. In direct response, the Baron’s men drew their weapons and awaited his orders... \n\nThe Baron thought to himself for a moment. He had two options. He could either strike this arrogant fool down where he sat right now, ending his reign of terror and securing the city of Khovd for ourselves. However, none can deny that despite his eccentricities and barbarism, Ja Lama is a great warrior and would serve the state well, and brings with him a horde of military experts like Khorloogiin Choibalson and Gonchigiin Bumstend, among others.

mongolia.106.d:0 "The infamous peasant bandit leader Gada Meiren and his forces have seized a major bridge on the Trans-Mongolian railway, persuading the local garrison to join him in their occupation as they attempt to bring the vital line to a complete halt. Being observed by Sternberg and his men from a ridge, Gada Meiren has fortified his position and he will only further entrench his position with time. Sternberg does not have enough men in his scouting party to overcome Meiren’s forces decisively, meaning a bloody and exceedingly risky conflict would ensue. However, Sternberg does also have his artillery battalion at his disposal, and with their guns in range, he has the ability to destroy Gada Meiren's forces. However, such a barrage would greatly risk the bridge as a result, leaving the Mad Baron with a tough decision to make."

As the structure began to collapse, Gada Meiren and his men attempted to make a hasty withdrawal. However, Sternberg, fueled with vengeance and a desire to slay this bandit lord, ordered for his artillery attachment to loose another volley, hoping to wipe Gada Meiren and his army from the map. \n\nThe second barrage hit heavier than the last, their guns now finding the perfect firing solution and arc after ranging with the first barrage. Hitting with deadly accuracy, this second wave further decimated the bridge's foundation and support beams, but frustratingly missed the bulk of Gada Meiren’s forces. \n\n Enraged, Ungern ordered salvo after salvo until the barrels of his howitzers glowed red hot and his ammunition was largely spent. As the smoke began to clear, the bridge lay in absolute ruins, severing a vital connector of the Trans-Siberian Railway, while Gada Meiren and the last of his surviving forces had long since fled into the countryside in the cacophony. Absolutely enraged, Ungern drew his service revolver and quickly executed the closest artillery officer near him before mounting his horse and riding off back towards Urga, with both the bridge he needed to defend now destroyed and his nemesis once again slipping away."

Gada Meiren had anticipated the Bloody Baron’s attack however, and set explosives on the ridge preemptively. With a massive explosion, the mountain face began to fall onto Ungern’s forces, which crushed the majority of Sternberg’s men in rubble and debris. Blinded by rage, Sternberg stormed Gada Meiren’s fortification with his surviving forces, sacrificing more men in order to get even near Gada Meiren. However, the avalanche had provided Gada with enough time to escape with the main body of his forces, leaving the local garrison to buy him time to escape into the countryside wounded and without an army. Enraged, Sternberg slaughtered all those left, realizing he had been humiliated by Gada Meiren with thousands of his men now left dead for nothing."

However, with this victory secured, the more conservative members of our camp are debating if our Great Khan's place can truly be filled by his daughter? We could simply set up a new regency council composed of all influential members within the loyalist clique to lead the nation in the Khatun’s stead. With Russian generals, Mongolian tulkus, and various other nobles and military figures all having equal say, it would at least ensure no one group rose to dominance and sullied the Khan’s legacy. Alternatively, we could crown one of the more notable standouts within the clique as the political leader of the nation. Of men that fit this bill, we could either go with the honored noble Navaanneren, a true direct descendant of Ghenghis Khan himself, or the Bogd Gegen, our spiritual leader, regranting him the title of Bogd Khan. Finally, we could simply allow Genghis Khan II's child to take her rightful throne and hopefully lead the state to such glories like her father did. Who shall we choose?"

The two most likely candidates are his son, who he has named after Amursana, the famed Oirat hero, and his faithful ally and top military general Khorloogiin Choibalsan. Either would make a fine leader for Mongolia to carry on his vision. Amursana is far more spiritual of the two, having fallen in the White Faith movement, while Choibalsan is a hard, cold-blooded military man with pseudo-Socialist populist beliefs leftover from his time in the MAN and with a love for light hedonism and strong patriotism.

Currently, our regime espouses much anti-Chinese rhetoric and propaganda, with much of it going so far as to fully dehumanize the Chinese people.

This honor rightfully belongs to but one man: the esteemed Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, youngest brother to Nicholas II, the last ruling Tsar of Russia. However, though he is of royal blood and noble birth, there is but one issue with the Grand Duke’s viability as a candidate for the throne - he has not been seen since 1917. \n\nDuring the chaos and calamity of the Russian Civil War, Nicholas abdicated and Michael was named as his official successor, but his coronation never came and he went missing shortly after, and has not been seen since. Not all hope is lost however, for numerous reports have come in across the nation of possible sightings of the Grand Duke over the years, and the Imperial Regent Ungern seeks to investigate them all. If all else fails, Michael was fortunate enough to sire a legitimate son before his disappearance, the Duke George Mikhailovich, though he was born to a commoner mother along morganatic lines. Ungern will stop at nothing in his attempt to revive a true monarchy here in Russia once more, and so he shall go to the ends of the Earth itself to look for this divinely-ordained heir, for only he can lead Russia to its destiny. To begin the search for the missing Tsar, officers have told the Regent of an old widow in Yekaterinburg, said to know the location of our missing Sovereign."

Today, however, was different - flocks of soldiers ran around bearing shovels instead of guns, and a dozen or so piles of snow and dirt surrounded the village. This was a division sent out by the baron-turned-warlord-turned Regent of Russia, Roman Sternberg.\n\nIt was only on the whim of a rumour that Sternberg had heard from his officers; an elderly woman, cloaked in a mystic black robe, proclaimed in Yekantinburg that she knew where the dear Grand Duke Michael Romanov was buried. There was nothing to attest that her ramblings were true; yet there was nothing that disproved them either in the eyes of the Regent, even if he was dared to believe that the man he was searching for was dead all along.\n\n‘’Idiots, idiots! You work from dawn to dusk in the snow for a man in Hell!’’\n\nIt did not take long afterwards for the entire division to disperse, with a sour look on every man’s face.

With the vastness of Russia being what it is, these men have been given top level access to what little we do about the Grand Duke's movements during the course of the civil war.\n\nWhile this method will no doubt take much longer then hoped, it may just be the one way we can know for certain the fate of Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich."

Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was never meant to be the permanent leader of these lands, always planning to yield upon the return of his sworn liege, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, but with it being all too likely that this true royal was slain at the hands of the vile Bolsheviks during the civil war, we have been left with few options. \n\nFor all our bad luck in this matter, we have been graced with one blessing, and that is in the form of the Count Brasov, George Mikhailovich. Born to a common mother as the son of the late Grand Duke, this young man is the true heir. However, his muddy claim due to morganatic lineage raises some issues, and could greatly anger the more conservative elements of the nation. To resolve this issue, the knowledge of the Grand Duke’s fate could merely be hidden from the public. With this truth hidden, Ungern could rule as Eternal Regent in his stead, awaiting the ‘inevitable’ return of the one true Tsar. \n\nAlternatively, our wise Regent could go with a more radically traditional option. With his fascination and dedication to monarchism and Russian traditions holding strong, Ungern could call a new Zemsky Sobor, pulling together all the various nobles, high bureaucrats, clergy of both the Church and Buddhism, and representatives of the commoners and workers of our new Russia to elect a new Tsar. Whatever Ungern’s decision, it must be made with great care, for the future of all of Russia lies in the balance."

However, restoring the Tsar, even if he is yet to be found, was only one of the Regent's goals. His second, are arguably most important goal was the revitalization of the faith of the various peoples of the Empire. It is a well known fact that Sternberg's main goal in everything is the complete destruction of Atheistic Communism, and any of it's twisted Secularist cousins, be it Syndicalism or Liberalism.\n\n To this end, the Regent has wisely directed our fiance ministry to grant each local province a lump sum of cash to be used towards growing that province's religious populace and traditions. It matters not if the money is used towards the growth of Orthodoxy, Buddhism, or even Tengrism and other 'Pagan faiths'. All that matters to the Regent is the destruction of that most dangerous to the Soul of every man, Atheism, Secularism and lukewarmness.\n\nWhile this has indeed begun to be implemented in every locality we control, some have wondered if perhaps we should implement a national version of this policy, so that the Empire has a guiding principle, besides the Regent of course. The Regent himself is famously vague on his exact religious beliefs, leading many to wonder if this request for a national policy is an attempt to finally pry an answer from the mind of the Mad Baron.

Members of the nobility, those within the high bureaucracy, clergymen from the both the Church and even the occasional Lama from Mongolia, along with representatives of the commoners, have all gathered in [MON.GetCapital] at the beckoning of their Regent.\n\n As the final member of this new Zemsky Sobor took their seat, the Mad Baron began a speech, that he had seemingly been waiting to give since he took power within Russia. In his speech, he decried the evils of Atheistic Communism, and hammered home the point that these men gathered within this esteemed body have a moral and religious duty to decide on a new monarch. Following this, the Regent hung his head low and announced with deep sadness that Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, the rightful Tsar of all Russia, had been murdered by the hands of the Bolshevik Devils. Following a short period of extolling the virtues of the late Grand Duke, the Regent of All Russia declared the opening of the Zemsky Sobor, taking them with the finding of a new Tsar.\n\nDespite fears that the Sobor would quickly collapse into gridlock, the opposite has occurred, and five factions have rapidly come to dominate the Sabor. The largest of these factions supports Pytor Wrangel, famed war hero and avid monarchist, as Tsar. Made up mostly of noble veterans with a small sprinkling of commoner support, these 'Wrangelites' support the Baltic noble due to his promises to strengthen the armed forces and grant Holy Russia the leadership she needs in these trying times. Similar to this clique, composed of members from largely the same backgrounds, are the ‘Drozdovites’ who support the war hero Mikhail Drozdovsky for the position for many of the same reasons.The third faction that has come to prominence within the Sobor is a far-cry from the militarists of the first two camps and instead support Prince Felix of the prestigious Yusupov family for the throne. Supported mainly by the commoners, a decent-sized portion of the nobility that despise the Romanovs, and a small section of the clergy, these 'Yusupovites' harken back to their candidate’s Khanic ancestry and believe that Felix,  one of the men responsible for the death of Rasputin, alone can be a voice for the masses. The fourth and largest of the factions within the Sabor, while also the most internally divided, supports the claim of the Romanov dynasty. With support coming from all sides, even from the Regent himself, the 'Romanovites' wish to once more place a Romanov on the Russian throne. Which Romanov gets the throne however, is a topic of much debate. Finally, opposing all of these groups are a tiny and varied group of Buddhists, Ungern-Sternberg loyalists and veterans who served with him in Mongolia, and a myriad of assorted mystics, esoterics, scholars, and nationalists who are instead support the Regent himself, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, to be crowned Tsar instead. \n\nAs debate begun in earnest within the Sabor, it would take only a short while for it to be clear that..."

mongolia.167.t:0 "The Cosmology of Ak-Burkhan"
mongolia.167.d:0 "In the ‘three worlds’ cosmology of Turko-Mongol traditions like Tengrism and other similar faiths, our universe is divided into an upper, middle, and lower realm similar to the Abrahamic idea of heaven, hell, and the mortal realm. Ak Jang follows this same tradition, but with most emphasis placed on the higher ‘White’ plane, hence the name of the White Faith. With most emphasis placed on this upper realm, and the natural world of the mortal realm to a lesser extent, Ak Jang completely rejects worship or reverence for any traditional deities or theologies associated with the underworld, such as Erlik the chief of this lower realm, in an attempt to create a purified faith that shall save the Altaic peoples. Instead, Ak Jang focuses on the worship of the pure deities from the upper realm - called Aru Tos or ‘pure ancestors’ - such as Ak-Burkhan himself who stands as the namesake for the White Faith among Western scholars and is the spectral white rider who first appeared before our founding prophets Chet Chelpan and his adoptive daughter Chugul Sarok Chandyk in order to reveal the white truth to the Altaians in the first place. Ak-Burkhan is also possibly related to the traditional Mongolian deity Tsagan Ebugen aka the White Old Man, with both being depicted as old white riders and with both being seen as heralds of good fortune, longevity, and fulfillment. \n\nHowever, despite being the namesake of the religion, one of its most important figures, and the first deity of Ak Jang to reveal themselves to us, he is but one of our gods. Beside him stands Uch Kurbustan, the triune god of Ak Jang based on other similar triune gods and heroes from across Turkic and Mongolic cultures. The first figure of the triune is the reincarnating hero figure Galden-Oirat (aka Oirat Khan or just the Oirat) who is the mythological ancestor of all Western Mongols, and is usually portrayed as any number of famed Western Mongolian leaders and heroes from the 17th and 18th centuries such as Galdan Tseren. The second figure is Amursana, the legendary Khoit-Oirat chieftain that serves as the avenging spirit of the disaster of Dzungaria, and the third figure is Shunu, a she-wolf goddess seen as the Altaian version of Asena, the totemic lupine ancestor of various Turko-Mongolic peoples. \n\nThis triune guides the White Faith from on high alongside Ak-Burkhan and the rest of the Aru Tos, such as Jajyk, the divine mediator between the upper realm and humanity usually separated into a White half dedicated to the upper realm and a Yellow half dedicated to the mortal realm, Umai the goddess of childbirth and children, and Ot-ene the Mother of Fire who is worshiped during every sacrifice. Below them stands a multitude of protective nature spirits who aid the main gods of the middle world, such as Altai-eezi or the Master of Altai who stands as the genius loci or guardian spirit of all Altai, and Ul’gan who is seen as the spiritual ancestor to many Altaic clans, though the West has misconstrued this by mislabeling him as a creator god of sorts, similar to other mistranslations that have led the West to view the Mother of Fire as a Mother Mary-like figure married to one of the other major gods; both standing as misunderstandings as Western scholars try to apply Abrahamic theological ‘logic’ to foreign faiths. Overall, Ak Jang’s cosmology is strange and syncretic, pulling ideas from various different sources while making it wholly unique and form-fitted to the Altaic reality."

mongolia.168.d:0 "Originally entirely anti-shamanistic, Ak Jang has evolved overtime to incorporate many pre-shamanist and shamanist ideas from traditional Turko-Mongol culture into the White Faith in order to drum up wider support. However, despite taking many of the practices, deities, rituals, and beliefs from the old Altai shamans (called Manjaktu Kams in Altai, referring to costume-wearing spirit mediums who traditionally communicate with the underworld gods like Erlik Khan that the White Faith rejects entirely), that has not stopped Ak Jang from continuing to plant the seeds of anti-shamanism throughout our society, with cunning and wily shamans even appearing as the main villains in many stories spread by the White Faith both old and new. Though most of our past faiths and spiritualities revolved around the words of these Manjaktu Kams, the White Faith offers a more pure way in tune with the elevated plane that is free of the taint of the underworld and its servants, all thanks to the work of the Yarlikchi, which has led to these shamans, along with any other holdover clergy from other faiths, holding next to no power in our current system. \n\nThe Yarlikchi are the oral epic singers of Altai society who maintain the oral tradition of our people that goes back untold millennia, but with the ascendance of the White Faith, these singers too were risen up to become the dominant clergy and traditional authority in our society, replacing the shamans that dominated before them. Now guided by their melodious histories, stories, and myths, we true children of Amursana, Shunu, and Galden-Oirat now are free to embrace the purified truth of the White Faith as this new age religion rapidly becomes the embodiment of Altaic national identity and consciousness."

mongolia.169.d:0 "The White Faith holds dear and sacred many practices that coalesces to make a unique and vibrant religion sewn together from different theological sources, with much of the symbology of the faith being centered around the color White as a representation of the purity of the upper world on which Ak Jang is focused. Revering snow-capped mountains, birch sticks, yalama ribbons strewn from trees or one’s own headgear, and the Moon to name a few, Ak Jang holds this shade in the highest regards. However, perhaps the most important white symbol of religious significance to the faith is horse milk. Used as is or fermented, horse milk is used both in daily cuisine as a form of easy sustenance and in religious ceremonies. Keeping the sacrificial nature of Altaic traditional spirituality intact, Ak Jang promotes the idea of sacrificing this horse milk, fermented or not, instead of using animal carcasses or blood, keeping in line with the theme of spiritual purity and natural sanctity prevalent in Ak Jang teachings. Aside from this fascination with whiteness, practitioners of Ak Jang also commonly burn juniper for blessing, purification, and healing, erect special cairns called Oboo, partake in the recitation, patronage, or composition of oral epics, attempt divination and weather-control, and so much more. Ak Jang also has three main festivals, being Shuten or Murgul which is dedicated to the triune god Uch Kurbustan held twice a year in spring and fall around the equinoxes, Chok or Jajyk Choktor held in fall dedicated to Jajyk aka the spiritual mediator(s) of Altai, and Ot Takyr dedicated to Ot-Ene the Mother of Fire. Overall, the White Faith is concerned with maintaining a pure and healthy connection between the natural world and the higher realm, all for the good of our people and all under the watch of the White Rider."

Upon his return to Altai in 1903, he began work as an art teacher in Anos before embarking on his first artistic expedition into the most remote regions of the Altai Mountains. Showcasing his great works in Tomsk as he honed his craft among the Tomsky Society of Art Lovers, Gurkin would continue to perfect his art while showing the wider world the beauty of our homeland through paintings. During the Russian Civil War, Gurkin hid out in Mongolia and Tibet, further perfecting his craft while also working with other similar artists on the run like the Roerich family, and when the war finally ended, he returned to Altai to continue his great works. Along the way, he also converted to Ak Jang, becoming the face of the movement in the West and spreading its pure teachings and beautiful traditions across Russia and beyond.

Regardless, while in Altai, the Roerichs garnered a deep appreciation and fascination with our movement. Though flattering at first, some of our Yarlikchi singers grew tired of their incessant ideas about fusing more ideas from Tibetan Buddhism or their own Agni Yoga philosophy into the White Faith while insisting that we form official links with the Gelug School that has dominated Tibetan and Mongolian theology for centuries, threatening to de-purify the White Faith. However, their interest in our ideas have also led to the White Faith growing in notoriety and popularity across the Western World, for better or for worse.

The Mad Baron has been personally blessed by the Bogd Khan proving his actions ascend beyond the majority of mortals. Sternberg is thought by many Mongolians to be the avatar of the God of War, and by his most loyal supporters as the reincarnation of the great Genghis Khan. His victories over his opposition have only further solidified these beliefs, now in a position of supreme power the Mad Baron has once again sent shockwaves across the region. Addressing the masses from the fortified capital of Urga, Sternberg has declared that he is indeed the reincarnation of Genghis Khan, proclaiming himself as spiritual continuation of the immortal Emperor of all Mongols!"

However until today, we have had little contact with him or his Khanate, whom now reach out to us before now demanding an audience with Puyi. The Mongolian messenger arrived on horseback in a retinue of 4 horsemen with khanate banners waving in the wind. Granting an audience to these peculiar arrivals, Puyi has talked to the envoy and they offer us membership in their "Brotherhood of Eurasia", an alliance devoted to the defense of traditions against the revolutionary and perfidious influences that have wreacked in China and the wider World. Now it is our decision whether to join them in this pact"

These honorable yet savage horsemen offer us membership in their "Brotherhood of Eurasia", an alliance devoted to the defense and emphasis of our native and distinct traditions, pan-Asian unity, and anti-Western attitudes. To further show their commitment to this cooperation, they also wish to discuss the matter of China, seeking to finally solve the issue of the Middle Kingdom to a mutually agreeable end"

mon_khan.12.d:0 "With our initial conquests and period of stabilization over, it is now time to look towards our cousins and neighbors in Central Asia - heartland of the Steppe. In this arid expanse stands potential allies and righteous enemies for our hordes to trample under-hoof, but before we crusade into these lands, we must first choose to align with one of the groups there to make our conquest easier and the assimilation process afterwards smoother. \n\nOf potential allies, we have three possible options. The least likely is giving the lands to Kokand, a liberal democratic haven where Jadidist and Kadimist factions battle for supremacy over this blossoming republic. Though having little in common with our regime’s ideals, they’d likely be beneficial in our attempts to pacify these lands post conquest. Alternatively, we could reach out to the more conservative Khiva or especially Bukhara, whose state ideals are more inline with the Khan’s. What nation shall we align with as we charge into the barren deserts and arid plains of Central Asia once more to retake the rest of the Steppe for the Khanate."

Though there is of course an implicit pressure to accept the rule of the Baron as part of his domain, we also are likely able to negotiate more favorable terms as long term allies and subordinates of the khanate."

mon_khan.14.t:0 "A Matter of Princes"
mon_khan.14.d:0 "The various princes, nobles, and aristocrats of Mongolian society have long influenced and controlled the political stage of the Steppe. With the ascension of the Black Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg to the position of ‘regent’ to the Bogd Khan and his de-facto control over the nation’s every aspect, a final stance must be taken to deal with these ever-meddling and annoyingly ambitious men of Mongolia’s high society. \n\nBefore the Baron lie three options, each with their potential benefits. Using some of his precious plundered loot he and his hordes have collected and salvaged over his career, the Baron could sway the favor of the princes and have them eating out of his hands. Though by far the most costly of his three options, this would also buy their loyalty permanently, alleviating the Baron of an unnecessary headache that has plague him his entire rule without the need for excessive violence and without causing further unrest in this already teetering nation. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, the Baron could take the most enjoyable option for a man of his pleasures and delights, and choose to have these troublesome nobles hunted down and arrested, with any of those foolish enough to resist meeting the cool justice of a cavalryman’s arrow. Though this option would further drive up the spirits, morale, and plunder of the Baron’s beloved cavalry hordes, it would also likely drive Mongolia further into chaos. \n\nFinally, the Baron could take the most simple and cheapest option available to himself, and simply ignore the princes and their unending chittering. They are just princes after all, and what are mere princes to a man of Ungern-Sternberg’s standing! Besides, if left alive and alone, the Baron’s regime would be better able to focus on far more pressing matters of the state, such as the rioting groups of democratic protestors or Buddhist extremists that gnaw away at our administration’s foundation."
mon_khan.14.a:0 "Draw from the plunder pile and pay off every prince you can find."
mon_khan.14.b:0 "Simply ignore these howling morons."
mon_khan.14.c:0 "Purge any prince foolish enough to question the rule of the Black Baron."

mon_khan.15.t:0 "More Pressing Matters"
mon_khan.15.d:0 "With our decision to ignore the ever-bickering and complaining princes, our massively overstretched administration has been freed up to focus on one of the other pressing issues that is plaguing our Khanate as we speak. Though there are many metaphorical fires we could put out that currently burn away at the very fabric of our crumbling Khanate, two developments stand out above all others. \n\nAll throughout Mongolia’s largest cities, democratic protests have begun to break out, influenced by foreign ideas flooding into our lands from Western-tainted peoples such as the Russians or Chinese. These protests must be dealt with if we are to consolidate our full control over Mongolia’s few urban centers. As such, one direction we could take could be to dispatch our available forces to major cities such as Urga, Uliastai, Khem-Beldir, Minusinsk,and others to quell the fire of democratic passion before it can get out of hand. \n\nAlternatively, reports have come in from our rural villages and far-off monasteries of Buddhist extremists desecrating temples and burning villages already sworn to the Baron’s rule. These zealots claim the Baron is a false prophet and a madman sent to distract the Mongolian people from the light of true Buddhism, and have decried Ungern-Sternberg as a fool playing God. These ideas would be very dangerous to our regime if left to get out of hand, and as such, this development would also be worth dealing with as soon as possible, lest these radicals undermine the people’s faith in their Baron."
mon_khan.15.a:0 "Democracy is a disease. Move into the cities and crush these protestors."
mon_khan.15.b:0 "These fanatics are mere heretics to the True Way. End their reign of terror."

mon_khan.16.t:0 "The New Buddhist Icon"
mon_khan.16.d:0 "The Mongolian people are largely and deeply Buddhist, and have been for centuries. However, many see their dear leader the Black Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg as a tyrant who merely adopted this ancient tradition to satisfy his own morbid curiosities and to quell the people of Mongolia. The people call him a false Tulku unlike the beloved but infantile Bogd Khan, but Ungern-Sternberg has long endeavored to be a figure of equal or greater reverence than a mere child born into the life of luxury. \n\nTo remedy this false public perception, the Baron has participated in a slew of public events with loyal monks and seers, performing all the acts and rituals of a true, practicing Buddhist. However, drawing upon the honored Tibetan monk Agvan Dorzhiev’s work ‘The Shambhala Prayer’, the Baron has created a new prayer, glorifying himself, that shall be taught to all the people of Mongolia. They will all be expected to be able to recite this work of pious art by memory, no matter its length, for faith in Mongolia, faith in Buddhism, and faith in the Baron have all become one in the same. The Baron, or as he slowly has been pusing to be called - the Khan, shall prove to all Mongolians he is a true Buddhist and a true Tulku, not by birth but by earned right.  \n\n’O all-around perfect Khan, Clear Evolved From First of All, who made the great distant lineage widespread in the cities of Shambala, my ever-vigilant sublime guardian, please make these words of truth come true that I request to you...’"

With the war behind us and Japan at our side, we have been given a unique opportunity to place a member of their Imperial Family on the Dragon Throne in the Forbidden City of Beijing. Though this move would likely anger millions of Chinese citizens, they are in no position to argue, bargain, or even fight back. While it would be only right for the emperor himself to take the dragon throne, we still have the choice of whom should be the representitive of the Imperial Family's rule once they are coronated as the new Emperor of China?"

We could either crown the infamous Khan Ungern-Sternberg, for he himself has shown interest in the position and proved to be a loyal ally in our reclamation of our homelands, but the ramifications could be unseemly given his past and beliefs. Alternatively, we could crown the respected Bogd Khan as the new Emperor, as technically Ungern-Sternberg, even with his near-divine status, is still regent to this great Khan and reincarnated tulku. Finally, to appease the Buddhists of China, Tibet, and Mongolia, we could take the most radical option and place the 14th Dalai Lama himself on the throne instead. This child would serve as a valuable tool to manipulate for use as a new spiritual and national rallying figure for this restored kingdom."

Upon the beginning of this urgent and sudden meeting, the chief rider of the Mongolian delegation handed the Patriarch a scroll sealed and embossed with the mark of the Khan. Written on this parchment was a simple offer from the Khan: join us on our holy crusade to cleanse all of Asia, or simply be another roadblock for the Khanate’s cavalry to crush underhoof - a simple enough proposal, though one that possibly holds the very fate of our salvationist movement.

However, to all groups, the Great Yuan is known widely as being called dead. The great Mongol-led Dynasty of Kublai Khan withered and crumbled into history before the Qing were even dreams in the minds of the nomadic Jurchens, and has been completely extinct since the 1360’s. That is however, until the righteous crusade of the great Bloody Baron, heir to Ghenghis Khan and avatar of the Buddhist god of war Vaiśravaṇa.

However, an alternative exists to both these camps, though they lack much popular support.

Disappointed and enraged, the Khan has retreated to his grand yurt to blur the night away in a haze of women, opium, gambling, and booze as the riders return their horses to the grazing pastures.

Arriving on horseback and regalled in regal garb, dark riders from the Mongolian Khanate entered our capital and demanded an immediate audience with the esteemed [ROOT.GetLeader] and his closest advisors. Upon the beginning of this urgent and suggen meeting, these emissaries from Urga have announced that the Khan Ungern-Sternberg has invited our nation to the upcoming diplomatic summit dubbed the Urga Conference. The goal of this summit is supposedly to draw closer ties between certain like-mined regimes of the East, like ours and the Khanate, while working together for the defense and survival of our native and distinct traditions, while working towards pan-Asian unity while bound together by anti-Western attitudes. Though this offer is quite enticing, it would also draw the ire of many of the surrounding warlords and competing national governments vying for our land and China’s throne. What shall we do?"
mon_khan_conference.6.a:0 "Arrange for the necessary preparations. We make way for Urga!"
mon_khan_conference.6.b:0 "Deny the invitation of this false Khan."

mon_khan_conference.7.t:0 "The Khan and the Patriarch Split Ways"
mon_khan_conference.7.d:0 "After endless days of delegation and pandering, the Urga Conference has finally ended, but yet we have been left empty handed. Despite our overtures, the Mongolian Khanate has decided to go with different allies, leaving us in the dust with no one to help us in our crusade to seize China for ourselves and our righteous Persistent Way. Not only has the Khan wasted our time, but he has disrespected our very cause and the 18th Great Patriarch Zhang Tianran himself. We do not need this mad Khan, and we shall bring salvation to China without him."

The great Khan Ungern-Sternberg and our honored leader, the 18th Great Patriarch of the Yiguandao Zhang Tianran, have struck a deal that shall change the face of Asia forever. We now ride as allies and brothers in a fraternity that shall liberate all of China and Asia from foreing infestations and ideological squabbles. Together with the Khan, we shall be the purging flame that both cleanses and brings salvation to the true children of the Far-East."

POLITICS_KHAN_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', and officially referred to by his noble title, Darkhan Khoshoi Chin Wang in the degree of Khan, had a troubled upbringing, constantly moving and with a father who was committed to an insane asylum. His family estate in Estonia was burned down in 1905, which confirmed his anti-peasant and eventual anti-communist beliefs. He eventually joined Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg, where he became interested in the occult and buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia, where he became known for his heavy drinking and dangerous moods. In 1913, he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as an officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after not being allowed to fight for Mongolian independence. \n\nIn the Weltkrieg, Ungern fought first in Galicia then, after a two month prison stint following an episode where he attacked another officer in a drunken rage, he would serve once more in the Caucasus. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the Whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently in his personal crusade against the communists. \n\nUngern eventually travelled through China where he married Manchu Princess Elena Pavlovna, or ‘Ji’. Eventually, he moved to Urga, and defeated the Chinese garrison stationed there, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne and proclaiming Mongolia independent. \n\nUngern himself did not get too involved in Mongol problems, but he kept the peace through force. After narrowly defeating a socialist revolution in 1921 and 1924, he was forced to get more involved. His forces prowled the streets as he hunted out dissidents and purged Mongolian society, including in temples. Though close friends and having similar ideas as the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, Ungern’s ambition knows no bounds. With Ungern’s grip dependent on his Russian military clique, there are fears he will continue to siphon power from the Bogd Khan for himself. \n\nThese fears were made manifest when Ungern was wounded in a battle with the Gada Meiren, falling into a brief coma and recovered prophetic, hallucinatory visions of Buddhidst deities and ethereal spirits. Upon his reawakening, the Mad Baron was dead, and a new Khan rose to take his place. Maddened beyond comparison, Ungern now believes himself to be the reincarnation of Ghenghis Khan and the avatar of Mahakala, the Buddhist God of Death. Now, this great Khan seeks to restore the great Mongolian Empire of old and spread his reign and unique strand of Buddhism across all of Eurasia."

POLITICS_JA_LAMA_DESC:0 "Mongolia has long been a land of myth, mystery, and legends, so it is no wonder how such a peculiar man as Ja Lama has come to rule the Steppe. Once known as Dambiijanstan and born in the lands of the Kalmyks in 1862, Ja Lama has come far in his long life. Spending much of his youth as a peddler and soothsayer in Astrakhan during the time of the old Tsarist regime, Ja Lama would eventually make his way to Mongolia in 1890 after numerous run-ins with the local law and as visions assailed his mind of a destiny calling him forth. \n\nRising as a warlord and anti-Qing revolutionary in the heart of Mongolia, Ja Lama would solidify his position within the minds and hearts of the Mongolian people after liberating the city of Khovd from Qing occupation, and has since led the city as its bandit king. From this triumphant victory, Ja Lama would continue to pursue a harsh war against the Chinese settlers that plagued Mongolia while also working to elevate his position and image as a true holyman and Mongolian hero. \n\nClaiming to be a true warrior tulku, a reincarnating custodian of a pure Buddhist soul, Ja Lama has much of Mongolia wrapped around his finger, and has now risen to be its newest Khan. As the supposed heir and reincarnation of the Oirat hero Amursana and the avatar of Mahakala, Ja Lama sees himself as the rightful saviour of the Mongolic peoples and the promised hero of prophecy who shall finally drive the Chinese from our lands and revive the Oirat Khanate of old. A man of stark dichotomies, he is a bloodthirsty, sadistic warrior who is known to flay his enemies alive while also being an extremely devout and pious adherent to Gelug Buddhism and the White Faith, albeit an overzealous and mad one at that. Under his rule, Mongolia shall endeavor to restore its former glories as Ja Lama consolidates his grip over the Steppe."
POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DESC:0 "Born in Chahar, Demchugdongrub was the only son of Namjil Wangchuk, Duoluo Duling Junwang of Sönid Right Banner and Chief of the Xilingol League. After the death of his father at only 6, Demchugdongrub inherited the title of Duoluo Duling Junwang. Under Yuan Shikai in 1912, he was promoted to the title of Jasagh Heshuo Duling Jinong. In Chahar he remained for many years, becoming a de facto leader of the province during the chaos following the end of the Weltkrieg.\n\nDemchugdongrub didn't join Ungern-Sternberg's side until 1926, following Ungern's seizing of Chahar Province from the Guominjun. Ungern met Demchugdongrub in Chahar, and allowed him to keep his titles and to lead Chahar Province. Under Demchugdongrub, Chahar Province grew in military industry, and became far less rebellious against Ungern. In Chahar he remained for many years, funding Pan-Mongol movements throughout Inner Mongolia. In 1932, Demchugdongrub, with a number of other Inner Mongolian nobles, moved to Urga, to get more involved in its politics. Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Revolt, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, seized power. Now, Demchugdongrub's dream of a united Pan-Mongol state can be fully realised."
POLITICS_UNENBAYAN_DESC:0 "Much like many of the nobles who dominated Mongolian politics for many years, Ünenbayan was born in Inner Mongolia. Also known by his Chinese name, Wu Heling, he graduated from school in Chengde, and afterwards studied law in Peking University while also working at the Minister of Interior in the Beiyang government. There, he worked with Prince Gungsangnorbu of Harqin Right Banner at the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. After he graduated from university in 1926, he got more involved in Mongolian affairs, getting into contact with Prince Demchugdongrub and Yondonwangchug in Chahar. Eventually he decided to travel there, to work under Demchugdongrub in Chahar Province. Later, when Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga with many Chahar nobles, he left Ünenbayan there to effectively rule the autonomous province. He proved rather effective at this, only eventually leaving Chahar during the Western Revolt, so that he could assist Demchugdongrub in Urga. Following the successful democratic revolution lead by the Mongol Ardyn Nam, Ünenbayan lobbied to stop the discrimination against the aristocrats of Urga. Being a younger man now in power of Mongolia, Ünenbayan sees an opportunity to mend the rift between the rich elite and the poor peasants, while defending the democracy that Mongolia has become."
POLITICS_7TH_CHANGKYA_KHUTUKHTU_DESC:0 "Born Lobsang Pelden Tenpe Dronme, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu is an extremely important figure in Mongolia. During the Qing Dynasty and the short lived Beiyang Government, the Changkya Khutukhtu’s were the head of the Gelug line of Tibetan Buddhism in Inner Mongolia. After Ungern-Sternberg took the province of Xilingol from the Guominjun, the 7th Changkya Khutuktu declared his loyalty to Ungern-Sternberg, and travelled to Urga to work in Gandantegchinlen Monastery. After regularly holding speeches outside of the monastery, he became a very popular and important figure in Urga.\n\nHowever, his intentions changed in 1930. Ungern-Sternberg, after a small peasant rebellion in Urga, blamed multiple high ranking lamas, and purged them. This caused massive uproar in the highly buddhist society, especially in the upper echelons. The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu therefore decided to form the Buddistuudyn Zövlöl, a secretive group of high ranking lamas who lobbied for increased theocracy in Mongolian society. After the Western Revolt, the Buddistuudyn Zövlöl were able to seize power, and fully begin to implement their plan to reform Mongolian society to a Gelug Buddhist centre."
POLITICS_JAMSRANGIIN_TSEVEEN_DESC:0 "A central figure in Mongolian politics, Jamsrangiin Tseveen was born in Transbaikal during the Russian Empire. He went to a Buryat private school in St. Petersburg, and eventually began visiting Buryat tribes in Irkutsk. In 1902, he became an auditor at St. Petersburg University. While there, he went on many research trips across Transbaikal and Outher Mongolia. After a few years he began to teach Mongolian Language there, and also visited Inner Mongolia and Ordos. When the Bogd Khaanate became independent in 1911, Tseveen supervisied a secular Russian school there and was editor for two newspapers, the Shine toli and Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig.\n\nAfter Mongolia was occupied by Xu Shuzheng in 1919, Tseveen became a professor at Irkutsk University. He also travelled around the area and met with many discontent Mongolias, who eventually founded the Mongol Ardyn Nam. At their founding congress in 1921, Tseveen wrote the Ten Aspirations, the party’s platform. Following their failed revolution in 1921, Tseveen went into hiding in Transbaikal, helping continue to organise the MAN. After the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, Tseveen helped rally Buryat rebels in joining the MAN rebels in once again trying to overthrow Unger-Sternberg. After this failure and the death of their leader, Damdin Sükhbaatar, the MAN went back into hiding. Since then, Tseveen has travelled across the more empty regions of Mongolia, educating the people and conducting research.\n\nFollowing the Western Revolt and the MAN takeover, Tseveen began to see the problems in the party. Over the years he grew more disillusioned with the more radical elements of the party, and saw it as corrupt. Following a power struggle in the party, Tseveen created the Mongol Libyeral Nam, as an opposition to the MAN."
POLITICS_SOLIIN_DANZAN_DESC:0 "As a young man, revolutionary Soliin Danzan was a living as a horse thief, poor and struggle to survive. He lived like this for many years, until he went to Urga to work as a customs official in the Ministry of Finance. In 1919, he, Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, and Damdin Sükhbaatar formed the nationalist group Züün Khüree, which later merged with the Konsulyn Denj group, led by Dogsomyn Bodoo. For a few years after this, the MAN worked with Russian bolsheviks in trying to take over Mongolia. This culminated in the 1921 revolution against Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, which barely failed. Danzan went into hiding after this, as did the rest of the MAN. Danzan was one of the key organisers of the 1924 revolution, another failed mission which led to the death of Sükhbaatar. Following a dangerous power struggle with Dambym Chagdarjav and Dogsomyn Bodoo, Danzan became chairman of the party, once again in hiding. For the years since, Danzan helped push the MAN to a more nationalistic and less bolshevik group, completely disavowing from the failed bolsheviks from Russia.\n\nAfter the Western Revolt in 1936, Soliin Danzan and the MAN were able to seize power, finally allowing him to implement his policies. However, there are still many threats to his rule. The party is still very split, with power hungry members ready to strike. Also, the introduction of democracy, though something the party promises, could be a threat to the party’s rule."

Now, following Ünenbayan making Demchugdongrub Head of State, the Popular Prince finally has a chance to realise his Pan-Mongol dream."
POLITICS_GADA_MEIREN_DESC:0 "Few souls in Mongolia are as wild, free, and unknown as that of Gada Meiren. Like a vengeful spirit, he has raged against the forces that have beset the wondrous Steppe, cutting down Russians and Chinese alike in his crusade to free Mongolia from foreign tyranny and oppression. Born in the small village of Jam-Un Tokhui in 1892, the man now known as Gada Meiren was born as Nadmid of the Mültütü clan, once holding the Chinese name of Meng Qingshan - a stained moniker he has long since abandoned and forsaken. As the last surviving son of his family, he has been nicknamed as ‘lou yada’, the last son, which has become a sort of national nickname for the hero as the ‘last true son’ of a free Mongolia. \n\nAfter witnessing his lands be sold off to greedy Chinese settlers as a child, having his home ripped away from him and his family forced to flee, the young Nadmid swore revenge against the Qing and all foreign forces from that day forth. Upon reaching military age in 1921, Nadmid joined in with the local banner army, learning military tactics and earning his current title of Gada Meiren, referring to his status as an officer. \n\nAfter years of military service and further witnessing the Chinese rape the Steppe and the wilderness he called home, Gada Meiren attempted to peacefully ask the Chinese to stop their activities and settlement by traveling to Mukden with a diplomatic delegation, but were instead met with handcuffs and exiled back to the Steppe. This setback proved to be the final straw, and after his faithful wife Mudan rescued him from prison, he has served as a true freedom fighter to the Mongolian people and a horrid terrorist to the Qing ever since. \n\nHaving tacit links to the Mongol Ardyn Nam and their democratic mandate, Gada Meiren’s revolutionary acts and banditry have paid off, and after working with both nomads and peasants from the countryside and these pompous urban democrats to preserve Mongolia’s identity, the lands of the Mongol people have finally been saved. Now, Gada Meiren rules over Mongolia as its official Khan, but he has left the governing largely up to the MAN. Instead, this true spirit of the Tengri ideal continues his lifestyle living out the pastoralist ideal across the Steppe, ready to answer the call if the people need him again."

He fought many battles with the Chinese in this period until Urga was occupied again by Chinese troops. He began to open a dialogue with the MAN revolutionaries, and was arrested by the Chinese. He almost died in prison, but survived long enough to be broken out by Ungern’s forces and was cared back to full health. Since then, he has fought by the side of Ungern, owing him his life. However, his allegiance does not lie with Ungern, but rather Mongolia as a whole."

Demchugdongrub didn't join Ungern until 1926, after Chahar province was seized from the Guominjun. For a few years after that, Demchugdongrub stayed in Chahar, leading divisions against Chinese border incursions. He even had to command troops against Chahar citizens, as many of the Han Chinese rebelled against Ungern's heavily pro-Mongol and pro-Russian rule. Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga in 1932 with Altanochir, and got quickly involved in its politics. After only a few months he was made head of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, and so he focused far less on military matters, though they remained important to him."

Forced into Outer Mongolia in 1910, he travelled to Urga in 1911 after the National Revolution with his family, and the Bogd Khan himself promoted him to general. He fought for the liberation of Inner Mongolia 1913, and sieged a fortress with help from bandit leader Ja Lama.

He was imprisoned by the Chinese still in Urga, but Ungern freed him when he took the city, and so Tornovsky joined him. He became the Asiatic Cavalry Division’s Chief of Staff. He commanded the division during the 1921 MAN revolution, and lead another division during the 1924 MAN revolution. He has become very loyal to Ungern, and hates syndicalism and socialism almost as much as Ungern himself."

He took part in multiple battles against communists in Siberia, where he was promoted to commander of White Russia. He commanded White Russian troops and had large control of Siberia. He eventually joined Ungern's forces in Mongolia, bringing much of his remaining forces. Ungern almost had him killed for opposing him, but he showed his skill during the 1921 attempted MAN revolution in Mongolia. He then travelled to the west, to have more independence from Ungern, still worried he will eventually be purged. Since then, he has continued to crush any rebels in that area, and has helped train Mongol rebels in Dzungaria."

He moved to Siberia at the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, where he got involved in Kolchak’s anti-communist government. When travelling into Mongolia, he met Ungern and joined his side, due to his interest in Ungern's strange beliefs about buddhism and monarchism. He stuck with Ungern, becoming his Chief of Intelligence and a close political advisor. Following a diplomatic trip to Japan and then the USA, he went back to Mongolia, performing counterintelligence against the MAN revolution of 1924, where his intelligence lead to the attack of their base in Uliastai and the death of their leader Sükhbaatar. He continued to work counterintelligence, and grew even closer to Ungern, being promoted to the rank of general in 1926. This was mostly a symbolic promotion, for although he had commanded some troops in his time, Ossendowski was not majorly skilled at it, and did not have much experience with it."

He was assigned to Inner Mongolia, where he stayed until he was contacted by Prince Demchugdongrub after Xilingol was seized by Mongolia from the Guominjun. After some negotiations, Buyandelger defected to Mongolia, and travelled with Demchugdongrub to Urga so that they could be introduced. Buyandelger did not stay for long, and he soon travelled back to Xilingol with his forces. In Inner Mongolia, he continues to train Mongolian guerrillas in areas under Chinese control. However, many still question his loyalty to Urga. He defected to Ungern’s side very quickly, and some rumours even indicate Buyandelger still communicates with his old friends in Beijing."
POLITICS_URZHIN_GARMAEV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1888\nMakarovo Village, Transbaikal Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn to the Buryrat people, as a member of the northernmost Mongolian subgroup, Garmaev initially grew up to become a language teacher. He felt little in the way of a call to any national identity or supposed homeland, living most of his life under Tsarist oppression until he made a life changing visit in 1917 to the Tsugol Datsan Monastery. There, the chief Lama recommended he join the fight against the godless Bolsheviks to defend the Buryat and Buddhist way of life, encouraging him to enlist under the local cossack Ataman, Grigory Semyonov. Garmaev rapidly gained Semyonov’s attention and was tasked with recruiting Buryrat speaking soldiers, a task which he excelled at. He was promoted to the officer rank and assigned to the newly formed Buryat-Mongolian regiment 1919, which was sent to support Baron Ungern-Sternberg’s expedition into Mongolia. Garmaev became enamoured with the Mad Baron’s esoteric sense of Mongolian nationalism, having already begun to form his own set of core beliefs, after his visit to Tsugol Datsan. He was encouraged by both Sternberg and Semyonov to preach pan-Mongolian nationalism to the regiment’s troops, as well as the civilians they came across, as a means to indoctrinate them into opposing the Bolsheviks. This eventually caused Garmaev to break with Semyonov, as he grew fearful that the Ataman merely wished to exploit the Buryats and the Mongols for his own purposes, whilst viewing Sternberg as a more rightful leader, who truly had the Mongolic peoples best interests at heart. He was rapidly promoted into a leadership position by Sternberg, and has maintained a great deal of influence, both within the Mad Baron’s administration, but also a growing popularity among the right leaning Mongolian nationalists who have come to accept Garmaev as one of their own."

### Focus tree ###

MON_ungerns_mongolia:0 "Ungern's Mongolia"
MON_ungerns_mongolia_desc:0 "Mongolia is still under the control of Baron Ungern Von Sternberg, who has kept the nation under his grasp for a while. However with the ever shifting political currents seemingly speeding up, the baron will have to act if he wishes to keep control."
MON_bribe_nobles_support:0 "Bribe the Princes"
MON_bribe_nobles_support_desc:0 "Though the nobles are opposing our government currently, we can easily take some of the less loyal nobles by bribing them. The princes should be so pliant towards conformity after decades of chinese supression."
MON_purge_the_nobles:0 "Purge the Princes"
MON_purge_the_nobles_desc:0 "The Princes have always been a problem, holding far too much influence in Mongolian government. It is time they see their end."
MON_ignore_prince_issue:0 "Ignore the Princes"
MON_ignore_prince_issue_desc:0 "The princes are not truly the issue we are facing. We must focus on other avenues, and perhaps even get support from them in defeating other factions."
MON_impose_authoritarian_ideas:0 "Impose Authoritarian Ideas"
MON_impose_authoritarian_ideas_desc:0 "Many in Urga currently believe that perhaps it is time for democracy. The problem is that they do not realise how wrong they are, and must be disciplined to stop democracy from infesting the whole of the nation."
MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism:0 "Display Ungern's Buddhism"
MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism_desc:0 "Many in Mongolia do not believe Ungern-Sternberg is committed enough to protecting buddhism and acting in a buddhist lifestyle. Some public displays of him and some loyal monks meditating and holding some speeches should convince them otherwise."
MON_use_nobles_to_destroy_buddhists:0 "Nobility Assist in Destroying Buddhists"
MON_use_nobles_to_destroy_buddhists_desc:0 "Using the Princes vast wealth, they have agreed to help us crush some of the buddhist resistance in Urga."
MON_use_nobles_to_destroy_democrats:0 "Nobility Assist in Destroying Democrats"
MON_use_nobles_to_destroy_democrats_desc:0 "Using the Princes vast wealth, they have agreed to help us crush some of the socialist resistance in Urga."
MON_the_great_buddhist_icon:0 "The New Buddhist Icon"
MON_the_great_buddhist_icon_desc:0 "Though Ungern-Sternberg is not a tulku like the Bogd Khan, he should still be known as a buddhist figure of almost equal importance in Mongolia. Fortunately foundational work like the Tibetan Agvan Dorzhiev's work 'The Shambhala Prayer' is already well known and easy material to manipulate for propaganda."
MON_the_greatest_dictator:0 "Cult of Personality"
MON_the_greatest_dictator_desc:0 "To make sure Ungern-Sternberg remains in power, the propaganda around his cult of personality should be temporarily increased massively. This cult of personality relies on mythmaking that officer Ossendowski is adept at spinning."
MON_enforce_officer_loyalty:0 "Enforce Officer Loyalty"
MON_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc:0 "The officer class is a hotbed for noble traitors, socialist rebels and buddhist extremists. Their loyalty should be tested and hardened to root out these issues. To the general staff, this measure also helps restrict the ability of russian politics to influence their decisionmaking."
MON_arrest_all_opponents:0 "Arrest Any Opponent"
MON_arrest_all_opponents_desc:0 "Though before we had strict laws about opposition, it is obvious these laws aren't strict enough. The prisons should be overflowing with opponents before the nation is safe. By abusing the archaic, traditonal oral legal code of the Mongolian Steppe known as the Yassa system, where khans and Kurultai leaders purposefully keep legal details vague so they can fit the needs of the ruling class and be easily bent to our current needs and wants, we shall bend the meaning of law, order, and justice to suite our very needs. This step, and others like it, shall allow the Mad Baron to tighten his grip on Mongolia more easily."
MON_urga_military_parade:0 "Urga Military Parade"
MON_urga_military_parade_desc:0 "Nothing gets the peoples support and shows dominance more than a military parade. To the people of Urga, a military parade is more of a holiday than a display of power, owing to the newness of the concept. Regardless of whether the crowd is satiated by fun or fear, it will help secure our rule in the city."
MON_ungerns_secures_power:0 "Ungern Secures Power"
MON_ungerns_secures_power_desc:0 "Finally, after so long Baron Sternberg has cemented his control over the nation officially after defeating the vast amount of opposition in the nation. Having finally defeated the hordes of Socialists, Bandits and Chinese, Ungern and the Russian-led military clique have full control of the nation, and their spirits brightened by this military victory. Now the nation is fully theirs to command and their dreams can be made a reality."
MON_increased_military_funding:0 "Increase Military Funding"
MON_increased_military_funding_desc:0 "It is clear that the entire reason the western revolt managed to last so long is because the military lacked the means to crush it. So now that conflict in China is looking more inevitable with the amount of hostility ramping up, we will have to increase the funding for our armies."
MON_cavalry_primacy:0 "Cavalry Primacy"
MON_cavalry_primacy_desc:0 "Cavalry has always been the key to warfare in the Mongolian Steppes, so let us not discard it easily but rather master it. To even move through this harsh land let alone outmaneuver the enemy we have to accept cavalry as our main force."
MON_increase_gun_production:0 "Invest in Weapon Research"
MON_increase_gun_production_desc:0 "Our army's weapons are obsolete and nonstandard, with most of our forces looking like they just raided a museum with a mix of weapons from the weltkrieg to even the 19th century. Therefore if we wish to keep up with the aggressively expansive Chinese armies we must ensure our equipment is kept up to a modern issued standard."
MON_aggressive_industrialisation:0 "Aggressive Industrialisation"
MON_aggressive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Mongolia’s population often lives outside our few cities and even outside towns, meaning that our industrial base is pretty small. Thus we should start to encourage investors from Russia and other places to start up business and industry in our steppes. We will encourage and attract them with free reign, and seeing that we defeated the socialist revolts, workers rights will be but a false idol in our lands."
MON_train_the_nomads:0 "Train the Nomads"
MON_train_the_nomads_desc:0 "The Nomadic population of our lands have often been disunited, never grouping together beyond villages. To create a better use both of these peoples as well as to unite our lands further, we will draft them into our forces and give these land livers some actual useful training."
MON_create_mil_factory_angrily:0 "Set Unattainable Goals"
MON_create_mil_factory_angrily_desc:0 "Inside of our state owned factories, let us create nearly impossible goals for our workers to strive to achieve, by setting sparks of “encouragement” in the form of competition and beatings they will keep working hard everyday."
MON_marshal_of_the_steppes:0 "Baron of the Steppes"
MON_marshal_of_the_steppes_desc:0 "The steppes are a harsh land to govern with their vast distances. Yet let all who are within this land know the name of their benefactor, their leader. Baron Ungern Von Sternberg is who the people of the steppes have to thank for restoring order."
MON_look_at_russia_policy:0 "Reform Russia Policy"
MON_look_at_russia_policy_desc:0 "With Baron Sternberg always seeing himself as a Russian first, let us look back to the rapidly changing Russian political landscape and change our policy on how we look at them."
MON_russia_friendship:0 "Russian Friendship"
MON_russia_friendship_desc:0 "The Russians and Mongols have always been two brother peoples, so let us remain friendly with those across the border for we never wish this friendship to end."
MON_give_russians_citizenship:0 "Give Russians Citizenship"
MON_give_russians_citizenship_desc:0 "When Baron Sternberg invaded Mongolia, many Russian officers followed him into this land. Now with this wayward land under our control, why wait any longer to give our faithful followers official citizenship. Both those who were with us at the start and those who wish to come to us shall be made Citizens of this land, under the watchful and fair protection of the Baron."
MON_military_mission_to_russia:0 "Military Mission to Russia"
MON_military_mission_to_russia_desc:0 "Our military was for years supported by the Russian officers who accompanied us to this land, now that we have restored ties to our motherland, let us learn the new military advantages they have learned so that our army will be a modern army just like our brothers in Russia."
MON_conscript_siberian_russians:0 "Restart Economic Aid"
MON_conscript_siberian_russians_desc:0 "Economic aid from Russia was ended following the assassination of Kerensky. With both of our governments now stable, there is no reason not to restart this aid."
MON_promote_cooperation_between_us:0 "Promote Russian Co-operation"
MON_promote_cooperation_between_us_desc:0 "We should promote co-operation between Mongolians and Russians to the Mongolian people who are not yet convinced about our friendship."
MON_request_arms:0 "Rectify Arms Treaties"
MON_request_arms_desc:0 "Before the death of Kerensky, Russia and Mongolia had multiple arms treaties to keep our army supplied. We should approach them once again to get these benefits."
MON_mutual_guarentees:0 "Request Russian Guarantees"
MON_mutual_guarentees_desc:0 "We cannot survive alone. With our position secure, we should approach Russia for guarantees of our independence, to protect ourselves from Chinese encroachment."
MON_we_dont_need_russia:0 "Cast the Dice, Alone"
MON_we_dont_need_russia_desc:0 "The Russians abandoned us as soon as their position changed. We must act alone, for we are the only ones we can trust."
MON_encourage_mongol_identity:0 "Promote Mongol Identity"
MON_encourage_mongol_identity_desc:0 "If we are to abandon Russian safety, we should promote Mongolism to keep the nation united."
MON_recruit_chinese_mongols:0 "Attract Chinese Mongols"
MON_recruit_chinese_mongols_desc:0 "Many Mongolian people are trapped under Chinese control. We should try to attract them to immigrate here, so that they can serve us."
MON_claim_transsiberian_railway_land:0 "Claim Trans-Siberian Railway"
MON_claim_transsiberian_railway_land_desc:0 "The Trans-Siberian Railway that runs over Mongolia has massive Mongolian minorities. It is rightful Mongolian clay, and though we are very unlikely to take it, it is a strong show of force for our people to claim it."
MON_ready_for_war:0 "Ready for War"
MON_ready_for_war_desc:0 "While alone, we must prepare for war. We are surrounded by threats, so we must act accordingly."
MON_military_propaganda:0 "Militarist Propaganda"
MON_military_propaganda_desc:0 "The society of Mongolia must become completely and utterly committed to the military if we are to survive against our enemies."
MON_we_stand_alone:0 "We Stand Alone"
MON_we_stand_alone_desc:0 "The Mongolian people have been abandoned by our allies, and trapped in by our enemies. Though we stand alone on the world stage, we must fight eternally for our independence."
MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg:0 "Centralised Power Under Ungern-Sternberg"
MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg_desc:0 "One of the problems that caused the revolt in the West and the chaos that descended into Urga was because we were forced to share power. The radical buddhists and rich princes had large power in our government. Now, with them defeated, we can centralise power under Ungern-Sternberg, so that he can protect the nation."
MON_propoganda_in_the_cities:0 "Propaganda in the Cities"
MON_propoganda_in_the_cities_desc:0 "With the cities being the only main population groups in the nation, a massive propaganda campaign should be started in them, to entrench the idea that conformity to the state is required to survive."
MON_statue_in_urga:0 "Destroy the Socialists"
MON_statue_in_urga_desc:0 "Though the socialist MAN were unable to take power months ago during the Western Revolt, they still control some small cells, primarily in the hard to reach north of the nation. These cells must be completely destroyed if we are to be safe from the communist threat."
MON_young_officer_recruitment:0 "Young Officer Schools"
MON_young_officer_recruitment_desc:0 "We should try to get the best officers we can for our military, and a great way to do this is to start training them from a young age. The opening of multiple young officer schools in Mongolia should help bolster our officer class."
MON_pledge_alligence_to_sternberg:0 "Full Allegiance to Ungern"
MON_pledge_alligence_to_sternberg_desc:0 "The people must be taught that they do not have a choice in serving Ungern-Sternberg. The state and the Baron must come first in life, and everything they do should be to help the state survive and thrive."
MON_encourage_myths_about_sternberg:0 "Encourage Myths and Legends"
MON_encourage_myths_about_sternberg_desc:0 "Most Mongolians still believe much folklore and myths about history and current life. Many people even believe Ungern-Sternberg to be the reincarnation of Jamsaran, the God of War. Though it would not be stately to directly confirm these myths, we should secretly encourage these myths across the nation, so that people continue to fear the Baron."
MON_the_legend_lives_on:0 "The Legend Lives on"
MON_the_legend_lives_on_desc:0 "Baron Unger-Sternberg will never die. He controls the state and is the state. Those who have not realised this yet must be put to the gallows."
MON_more_mil_expansion:0 "Total Militarization At Any Cost"
MON_more_mil_expansion_desc:0 "With the lofty ambitions of Ungern’s goals, we will need to dedicate the entire industrial apparatus of the state towards military production, save what few sectors are needed to provide a sustainable existence for our people. We will turn the skies over cities like Urga and Khovd black with the smog of progress as the factories that will fuel our victory spring to life."
MON_spread_orthodxy:0 "Endorse The Holy Trinity Church of Urga"
MON_spread_orthodxy_desc:0 "In order to prepare the people of Mongolia for further interactions with Russia in preparation for our inevitable triumph, we must spread the only other true faith on Earth besides Buddhism: Russian Orthodoxy. These two religions are two sides of the same coin, preaching the same ideals to two different yet kindred peoples. By endorsing the largest Orthodox parish in the nation and allowing more churches to be built around Mongolia, we spread this faith as we spread Buddhism as well."
MON_spread_bhuddism:0 "Buddhist Fanaticism"
MON_spread_bhuddism_desc:0 "Buddhism is the preferred faith of our Baron and most of our population, for it is a righteous and pure faith that is undeniable in its truth and benefits. Across the Steppe, fanaticism and zealotry for the Buddhist faith has exploded as many feel as though this righteous faith is beset by external forces. We must tap into this primal rage and channel it into useful avenues, for Buddhism the one of the two true faiths, and all others are heretical filth."
MON_buddy_with_bogd_khan:0 "The Two ‘Khans’ of Urga"
MON_buddy_with_bogd_khan_desc:0 "Baron Undern-Sternberg and the Bogd Khan have long been close friends and allies, with the spiritual leader serving as Ungern’s guide as he delved further into the Buddhist faith. Together, they form a diarchy as the two most powerful and revered men in Mongolia, and with their cooperation, all of Mongolia shall be made to prosper."
MON_spread_monarchism:0 "Herald of the True Tsar"
MON_spread_monarchism_desc:0 "The Baron is a staunch monarchist by all standards, following the will of his friend and mentor the Bogd Khan here while championing the crusade of the missing but rightful heir to the Romanov throne, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. Though this true son of Russia has not been seen in over a decade, the Baron still holds hope that he shall return to lead Russia to greatness. In his absence, the Baron is his regent, and the herald of the purity of Russian monarchism."
MON_currency_reform:0 "An Authentically Mongolian Currency"
MON_currency_reform_desc:0 "To finance the necessary expansion Mongolia’s economy and industry will need to fuel Ungern’s battlelust, the Baron has devised an ingenious monetary scheme. By creating a new currency tied to the personal herds of livestock of Mongolia’s various farmers, estates, and shepherds, we shall ensure a reliable weight behind this hopefully functional currency for Mongolia’s economy to expand with. In this system, a sheep would be worth 10 notes, a cow 25 notes, a horse 50 notes, and a camel 100. Nicknamed ‘Barons’ after Ungern himself, these notes shall be the building blocks of the new Mongolian financial sector."
MON_expand_trans_siberian:0 "The Iron Veins of Mongolia"
MON_expand_trans_siberian_desc:0 "The Trans-Siberian Railway is the lifeblood of Mongolia, connecting us to the wider world and allowing much needed supplies to flow into our lands. We must expand this line until a sprawling network of rail extends across the Steppe and all Mongolia. We shall drag Mongolia into the modern age through the power of the Iron Horse."
MON_deal_with_bandits_ungern:0 "The Bandit King"
MON_deal_with_bandits_ungern_desc:0 "Through his time as a raider and bandit that rampaged across the Steppe, the Baron Undern-Sternberg has developed close ties and reliable contacts to numerous bandit groups and warlords across Mongolia. By cashing in on past debts, or paying with new bribes, the Baron shall earn the aid of these brigands as we prepare for our final conquest."
MON_deas_with_nomads:0 "Nomadic Allies"

To support this initiative, a measured but free press to operate legally in Mongolia. Without unrestricted access to information or the ability to voice one’s own complaints, we are no better than the Ungern regime who tried to keep most of the Mongolian people in the dark.

It is painfully clear that spending massively spiralled out of control under the Baron’s rule, and though it will be hard, these cuts must be made and these funds appropriated by the state, all for the good of our national financial state."
MON_landowners_rights_act:0 "The Landowners Rights Act"
MON_landowners_rights_act_desc:0 "During the chaos of the 1921 and 1924 Revolutions, and later during the chaos of the great Western Revolt, a slew of new, emergency-measure rights were hastily given to landowners, landlords, and other property-owning citizens as a means of securing themselves and their properties from the ravages of national unrest. With this chaos now over and dealt with, and these new rights proving to make these landlords far more loyal to our regime, we have decided to consolidate and organize these laws into an expanded, formal Landowners Rights Act, which will enshrine these property owners as a prioritized social class above the arats and nomads but below the lamas and the princes. In this position they shall become a true middle class and pseudo-nobles, growing our economy, enriching and expanding our culture, and providing a new, powerful social class that is loyal to our regime."
MON_encourage_nomadism:0 "Encourage A Return to Nomadism"
MON_encourage_nomadism_desc:0 "Much of Mongolia’s population is completely nomadic, moving around through the year rather than settling permanently. This idea is enshrined in Mongolian society, permeating throughout our peoples and their lives for centuries. People in the cities of Khovd or Urga should instead be encouraged to return to their roots and the roots of their ancestors, so they are both more in tune with our shared traditions and easier to control due to being spread out and less likely to- conspire in large groups against us."
MON_encourage_foreign_business:0 "New Mongolian Entrepreneurialism"
MON_encourage_foreign_business_desc:0 "Other than Russian business, the Baron’s rule has starved us of foreign investment. We should encourage this if we are to survive and thrive in the modern world. With their investments, we shall foster a new Mongolian small business community that shall help create a new Mongolian entrepreneurial class, further diversifying the economy of Mongolia as we break free of Russian domination and build a healthy Mongolian economy that can stand on its own two feet. Of course only businesses and families pre-approved by the princes will be allowed to participate in these business ventures, with most being other nobles or landowners, Mongolia’s economy will still flourish."
MON_dissolve_organisations:0 "Purge Mongolia of Rival Organizations"
MON_dissolve_organisations_desc:0 "Since the chaos of the Western Revolt, we have tolerated the existence of opposing organisations that rival our rule. From the MAN and their democratic allies to the fundamentalist Buddhists and even rival landlords and lower nobles who have forgotten their place as they attempt to rise above their station. We must put these rabble rousers and peasants in their place. We have consolidated our rule over this Khanate and our sway over the Bogd Khan enough to easily justify banning and dissolving these organizations at once."
MON_the_traditional_nation:0 "Pure Mongolian Traditionalism"
MON_the_traditional_nation_desc:0 "Mongolian society is inherently traditionalist. This must be encouraged, to stop the calls for revolution, so let us look back to old forms of our societal traditions for inspiration, such as the old Yassa legal code that heavily benefits our desire to control and ultimately reverse the direction of caustic modernity. The two failed revolutions of 1921 and 1924, the failed Western Revolt, and even the failures of the Mad Baron have all shown their is only one constant in Mongolia - our rule. We are the heralds of tradition and the beacons of Temüjin’s legacy. Traditionalism shall be the only ideology or dogma we prescribe to, for all others shall only lead Mongolia astray and to damnation."
MON_mongol_identity:0 "The True Mongol Identity"
MON_mongol_identity_desc:0 "In the past, Mongolia was a great empire covering massive swathes of Eurasia in the largest contiguous empire the world has ever seen. Since this golden age, many have tried to subdue and erode our culture, from the Russians to the Chinese. Through it all, what it means to be a Mongol has survived, and now we shall make it prosper. We are the true sons and daughters of Genghis Khan and the heirs to an undying legacy forged in the war and conquest. We are the Mongols, nothing more, and nothing less."

MON_statue_of_genghis_desc:0 "We as a nation must remember our history, and our greatest leader, Genghis Khan. The great Temüjin is a perfect example of the Mongol identity which we want to encourage in our new state. Therefore, a great statue of him should be constructed in Urga, to push this idea of Mongolism and a cult of personality shall be erected around his image. Our nobles are the true heirs to his bloodline and his throne, and as such, they are the perfect people to lead our Khanate - a fact all Mongolians shall be forced to behold and know to be true."
MON_great_independence:0 "Our Eternal Independence"
MON_great_independence_desc:0 "Mongolian people must always fight to be independent, for we have only so recently earned it from our revolution from the Qing, and we shall not lose it again so easily. We are at constant threat from the Chinese and from the Russians, and therefore every Mongol has the duty to protect the nation. Every man shall be taught to fire a rifle and every woman shall be taught to dress a wound. We pray to the gods and the sky itself that we never need to use these skills, but it is better to know and not need them, than the alternative."
MON_mongol_nationalism:0 "Traditional Mongolian Nationalism"
MON_mongol_nationalism_desc:0 "Nationalism is a key part of our regime. The people must see themselves as great once again, and must be encouraged to protect the nation at all costs. A unified Mongolic identity must be crafted from the disparate tribes, ethnic groups, and peoples that make up the one Mongolic race. Oirats, Daurs, Buryats, Moghols, Kalmyks, Thukhums, Tatars, Khamags, and more - we are all Mongols."

Only with the many: the many sacrificed, the many princes and nobles, the many lamas and tulkus, and even the many arats all work together, playing their part and fulfilling their destined role and niche, to ensure Mongolia’s survival. Only with all of our people can our state truly be Great. We carry with us a millenia old legacy, and with the many peoples of Mongolia, we shall not falter as we carry this legacy to our destiny."

MON_buddhist_mongolia_desc:0 "Mongolia at its very core is a Buddhist nation, and yet foolish foreigners and local warlords have tried and failed time and time again to eradicate our influence. However, we have always endured, for even in the wake of the horrors committed against Buddhists and the clergy in the Revolutions of ‘21 and ‘24, or under the Ungern regime’s endless purges, our faith and our purity have survived. Now, under the Buddistuudyn Zövlöl, Mongolia shall once begin on the Eightfold Path as we seek to establish a true and pure Theocracy under the Bogd Khan and the Buddistuudyn Zövlöl."

For far too long has their unbridled ambition and thirst for power clouded their judgement, leading them to fail Mongolia time and time again. Claiming authority based on mere status and tacit blood connections to the long dead Khan of Khans, these fools have had enough time at the top.

With these lies, he was able to influence and attract much of our naive populace to his foul bastardization of our pure faith.

MON_end_russian_influence_desc:0 "Russian influence is pervasive in Mongolian society.

MON_distribute_aid_through_monasteries_desc:0 "The poor and downtrodden of Mongolia have been oppressed and neglected by every regime to lead before our mandate.

Among them are the Chinese, the Russians, the Socialists and secular democrats, the shamanists and other savages that follow the accursed ideas of Ak Jang - all these sects of Mongolian society writhing in heresy and hedonism. These putrid spawn do not belong in Mongolian society! We shall persecute, expel, and eradicate this plague until all of Mongolia is made pure.

MON_militant_buddhism:0 "Militant Buddhism"
MON_militant_buddhism_desc:0 "Buddhism, though seen largely as a peaceful religion under the principle of ahimsa, can easily be interpreted to justify violence just as well. The dukkha, or sin and impiety, of others must be expunged and eradicated, as it is a weakness and obstacle on the path to Nirvana.

MON_rally_for_buddhism_desc:0 "The Jebtsundamba Khutuktu is the key leader of Mongolia, serving as the Bogd Khan, an elevated title of the Bogd Gegen, denoting both his political and spiritual primacy as the head of our society. All in Mongolia are his servants, for he is our main tether to divinity and the temporal world. Our armed forces must be trained and thoroughly indoctrinated to hold the Bogd Khan as a deity and divine avatar, and as such, must swear to defend him with their lives, no matter the cost."

Heretics, secularists, and even putrid Socialists are spread throughout our military’s ranks, as well as the armies of the various princes and warlords. These disloyal officers and soldiers must be purged from military service, and if need be sent to the next life entirely, so that a new officer class can be created - one free from vice and truly pious in their adherence to the Eightfold Path and the militant path to Nirvana."

Whether they be mere visitors, true believers on a pilgrimage, or wayward souls come to stay and train at our holy sites, these individuals are the perfect fodder to recruit into our growing military.

MON_buddhist_law_desc:0 "With the Buddyn Zövlöl’s hold on Mongolia solidified, they can now move to enact their plans to enshrine Buddhism’s place at the center of Mongolian society. Following the cosmic laws of Dharma and the fundementalist, extremist, and hyper-zealous beliefs of the militant Buddistuudyn Zövlöl, a new legal code shall be created for Mongolia, replacing both the Western style law that had slowly begun to become popular here due to Russia, China, and the rest of the West, and the archaic Yassa system which Ungern-Sternberg abused. The various schools of Buddhism shall be enshrined as the state religion, and any and all citizens who break the edicts and principles of our faith shall be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law."

MON_militerise_police_force_desc:0 "To protect the Buddhist theocratic revolution brilliantly orchestrated by the Buddistuudyn Zövlöl, the police force must become a fully militarised force, made loyal only to the Bogd Khan and our council. These dogmatic defenders of the faith shall be the first line of defense on the homefront, providing security and ensuring safety and absolute piety within our borders. To handle any serious or heretical threats, our new secret police force has been given far reaching powers and access to the best military supplies our state can muster to eradicate the enemies of the state."

MON_buddhist_education:0 "A Truly Pious Buddhist Education"
MON_buddhist_education_desc:0 "The education of Mongolia must be completely reformed, to instead become an education based on, and only on, Buddhist teachings.

The only knowledge our people need is their faith."
MON_teach_in_monasteries:0 "Academia and the Monasteries"
MON_teach_in_monasteries_desc:0 "Monasteries are the perfect place to teach our new Buddhist education. This should be encouraged.

MON_ban_all_other_religions:0 "The Non-Buddhist Ban"
MON_ban_all_other_religions_desc:0 "Other religions are dangerous for Mongolian society. Mongolia is a Buddhist nation, and therefore Buddhism should be the only legal religion.

MON_develop_other_religions:0 "Develop The Varied Mongol Faiths"
MON_develop_other_religions_desc:0 "Other minor religions in Mongolia should be allowed to remain legal, so as not to anger the people. Instead, these religions should be developed to help support Buddhism and Mongolian society. Oddities like the White Faith to larger minority religions like Confucianism and Orthodoxy shall be minorly permitted, and Tengri will be allowed to exist among the nomads. Under our watch, we can slowly influence these faiths and their followers in Mongolia towards more Buddhist ideas and principles."
MON_destroy_shamanism:0 "Eradicate Black Shamanism"
MON_destroy_shamanism_desc:0 "Black Shamanism is followed by small, mostly nomadic groups in Mongolia. This form of Mongolic shamanism denies any and all Buddhist influences, and seeks a total return to the archaic old religions of the Steppe, primarily focusing on old Buryat, Oirat, and Altaic beliefs. They should be forced to instead follow Buddhism or face persecution."
MON_evolve_shamanism:0 "Embrace Yellow Shamanism"
MON_evolve_shamanism_desc:0 "Black Shamanism can be evolved and altered, to instead act as a form of Buddhism for these nomadic societies that still follow it. By forcing Buddhist influences into these old beliefs, we can slowly bring many of these nomads over to our side. Doing so would be difficult without aid, but luckily such a movement already exists, called Yellow Shamanism for their relation to the Yellow Hat, or Gelug, school of Buddhism. By championing this fusion of shamanist and Buddhist beliefs, we can finally mend the religious divide that has fractured the Steppe for centuries."
MON_allow_shamanism:0 "Exclude Shamanism from the Ban"
MON_allow_shamanism_desc:0 "We cannot ban a faith that is so ingrained to our society’s history and tradition, even if it goes against our government. Shamanism is nearly as old as our society itself, and to cast off this tradition would be an affront to our ancestors. Genghis Khan allowed freedom of religion, and so should we, just this once, for this truly Mongolian faith."
MON_buddhist_brotherhood:0 "Embrace the Four Noble Truths"
MON_buddhist_brotherhood_desc:0 "The Four Noble Truths serve as the first teachings ever given by the Buddha, and form the basis of most of our beliefs. Dukkha teaches us that suffering and pain are inescapable, as we are all caught in the vicious cycle of rebirth that is samara. Samudaya, or the arising, fuses our Dukkha with our Taṇhā, or desire, furthering our pain as we prepare for Nirodha, or the cessation of this agony by letting go of desire and craving. Finally, Magga - the Noble Eightfold Path - opens to us, ceasing suffering and opening the way to Nirvana. Our state has endured these Four Truths in our bloody and excruciating climb to greatness, and now the path to Nirvana and true prosperity is open to us."

MON_monastery_aid_program:0 "Embrace the Principle of Dāna"
MON_monastery_aid_program_desc:0 "Dāna, or generosity and virtuous kindness, is a key tenet of most Buddhist schools. Often interpreted as charity, our state seeks to take it a step further.

MON_develop_rural_villages:0 "Develop Rural Mongolia"
MON_develop_rural_villages_desc:0 "The numerous rural villages, settlements, and hamlets that dot the Steppe are struggling massively, especially in the West following the recent revolt.

MON_construct_more_monasteries:0 "Expand Monastery Complexes"
MON_construct_more_monasteries_desc:0 "Many monastery complexes were destroyed or partially wrecked in the various revolutions, bandit raids, and purge Mongolian Buddhist have endured.

MON_poverty_in_urga:0 "From Arats to Anagārikas"
MON_poverty_in_urga_desc:0 "The masses of arats, or peasants, in Mongolia have long lived in squalor, especially within the urban sprawls of Urga, Ordos, or Khovd. With the aid of the various monasteries, we must uplift these poor, hungry, and dirty masses. We must wash away their sin and their grime and bring them into the light of Buddhism. We shall offer them clothes and food and a warm place to sleep, and in return, they shall become Anagārikas - low monks in training made to be fully devoted to the state, the Bogd Khan, and the Buddistuudyn Zövlöl."
MON_support_the_fellow_man:0 "Civic Uses For the Khiids"
MON_support_the_fellow_man_desc:0 "The khiids, or monasteries of Mongolia, must be made to provide more than spiritual aid and simple charity and services expected of most modern churches, regardless of faith. Using the monasteries as shelters, halfway houses, health clinics, libraries, schools, government centers, and more shall expand the amount of services available to our people while ensuring everything they input has been sanctioned by the state. This will also draw the monasteries closer to the central Buddistuudyn Zövlöl itself, furthering our control over all Mongolia."
MON_benevolent_lamas:0 "Gifts from the Benevolent Lamas"
MON_benevolent_lamas_desc:0 "Some of the lamas and other high tulkus, or reincarnating holymen, of our society are relatively wealthy. Over the years of collecting donations, amassing hordes of tribute and holy relics, and living in lavishly decorated monastic complexes, the lamas have access to more wealth than any arat. We shall incentivize and encourage these Buddhist clergymen to act in benevolence to help the poor, in accordance with the Buddhist principle of Dāna."

This includes the development of roads across the steppes and subsidies to nomadic families."
MON_expand_urga_industry:0 "Expand the Great Settlement"
MON_expand_urga_industry_desc:0 "While Urga is the largest and most populated city in the country, it does not compare to the economic might or size of other capital cities across the world. If we wish to see Mongolia stand high upon the world stage, it is imperative that Urga is expanded, developed, and industrialised so that it may act as an example to the other cities across the nation." 
MON_military_factory:0 "Mongol Militarization"
MON_military_factory_desc:0 "In this new age of warfare, we are abominably outmatched by almost all our surrounding neighbours; our guns are outdated, our equipment is scarce, and the rate of weapon production is laughable.

MON_weapons_development:0 "New Weapons for a New Age"
MON_weapons_development_desc:0 "One of the main issues that have appeared as a result of our lack of military development is the lack of proper weapons, and we have been falling behind on acquiring new weapons for some time. Our guns are old and only getter older, while our enemies amass better weapons year by year. It is only a matter of time before they use them against us, and only through extensive research into new weapons will we withstand them."
MON_start_mongol_highway:0 "Fund the Trans-Mongolian Railway"
MON_start_mongol_highway_desc:0 "The Trans-Mongolian Railway is an ambitious plan that has never truly been realised - until now. With government incentive, we can fulfil this dream and create a railway that spans across the vast swathes of land, starting with Urga and the surrounding area."
MON_khovd_factory:0 "From Yurts and Gers to Houses"
MON_khovd_factory_desc:0 "Khovd is yet another settlement located on the far reaches of the nation, isolated and arid. It is often the site of trade much like Uliastai, but the settlement itself has undergone very little change over hundreds of years, being merely composed of many tents and camps. However, if it were to be developed into a proper, modern city, then it could prove especially useful in our developing economy."

MON_military_focus:0 "Horselords of the Steppe"

MON_train_officers:0 "Train the Bo'ols and Kheshig"
MON_train_officers_desc:0 "Our officers, from our bo'ol generals to our Kheshig officers, typically lack the discipline and good training that makes what other nations call an officer.

MON_recruit_nomads:0 "Arm and Train the Nomads"

MON_national_unity_front_desc:0 "There are few self respecting Mongolian’s who would willingly be in a party that is accepting of the current state of affairs, However the Chinese want to put up the impression of things being allowed to continue as they were. So new parties are to be created and formed in a united front that will composite those Mongolians still allowed in government."
MON_reorganise_military_structure:0 "Reorganize Military Structure"
MON_reorganise_military_structure_desc:0 "One thing that has become apparent is how different the Chinese military thinks compared to ours, so perhaps by grabbing some doctrines from their playbook we can begin to remove those wayfaring souls that still cling to the old ways of the Mongolian Military before the coming of the Chinese."

MON_chinese_military_officers_desc:0 "The Chinese Officers obviously have a lot to teach us, especially after our defeat where our ignorance in the ways of warfare was shown.

MON_chinese_loyalty:0 "Loyalty to China"

MON_kuomintang:0 "Mongolian KMT"
MON_kuomintang_desc:0 "The Chinese Kuomintang has led it’s way back to control of both China and Mongolia, so the former elements of our own Kuomintang which has been buried in obscurity these past few years have recently resurfaced. Now both of our nation’s can be hand in hand with their similar ideals, for such petty things as separation shouldn’t be in the way of progress."
MON_begin_land_reform:0 "Begin Land Reform"
MON_begin_land_reform_desc:0 "Land Reform has always been something the KMT has put forward, both it’s divided right and left wing elements can both agree that a man who works the fields should be able to claim the field.

MON_push_for_industrialisation_desc:0 "Economic Modernization has always been sought in Mongolia, but where before it was mainly for the profit of the elite’s grasp on the nation, now it’s needed to bring forth our market into the world stage as well as China. First thing on the list is getting rid of those informal cottage workshops and turning them into vast factories."
MON_kmt_military:0 "The Mongolian NRA"
MON_kmt_military_desc:0 "The National Revolutionary Army of the Chinese KMT propelled them to victory, for they were inspired by the prospects they upheld. Without these prospects victory surely would not have come to them, so it should only be expected that here in Mongolia we introduce these same ideals and teachings. That way our forces can be advantaged both tactically and spiritually. We will win in the battle of hearts and minds."
MON_kmt_propaganda:0 "Kuomintang Propaganda"
MON_kmt_propaganda_desc:0 "The Kuomintang value the prospect of communication, for there is nothing more powerful to a human than words.

Their hearts will be brought into line with the ideals of the KMT."
MON_kmt_mongolia:0 "Kuomintang Control"
MON_kmt_mongolia_desc:0 "Our attempts to bring forth Mongolia and China in one mind has slowly been working, but due to the nature of the people it’s been slow.

MON_fuck_the_chinese_desc:0 "As Amursana has proclaimed, the Chinese have been nothing but a blight upon the Steppe and its peoples.

From the time of our initial conquest over the lands they now call theirs to our interactions with the famed Muscovy of old, to much more recent times such as the conquest of all of Siberia and their incursions into Mongolia with their accursed Trans-Siberian Railway, we have combated and sparred with these Slavs at every step and turn.

MON_local_prophecies_desc:0 "Superstitions and divinity run rampant through the spiritual culture of Mongolia, with prophecies, divinations, and other forms of divine foresight being commonly exchanged and spread, with many holding great reverence. One such prophecy has long claimed that a descendent of Amursana would rise once again to lead the unification of the nomadic peoples and the freeing of the Oirats, Altays, Mongols, and all other of our kin held under the boot of foreign oppression. Our regime must influence these prophecies, planting the seeds of ‘truth’ that Ja Lama is indeed this promised son, and he shall lead the nomads of the Steppe to freedom and power."

MON_burkhanism:0 "Spread The White Faith"
MON_burkhanism_desc:0 "Ak Jang, the White Faith, is a syncretic nationalist religious movement originating within Altai groups in Russia that has begun to spread across the Steppe. Millenarian in nature and incorporating aspects of ancient Altaic spiritual beliefs with Tengri, Buddhist, Eastern Orthodox, and other various shamanistic ideas, this fusion of creeds and dogmas is led by hierarchy of oral historians who sing the histories of our very people, able to recall centuries of knowledge through song and chant. Seeking to unite the nomadic peoples of East Asia under one faith and banner, Ja Lama has latched himself to the movement. We should aid in the spread of this faith and make it an official state religion alongside Gelug Buddhism."
MON_embrace_nomadic_lifestyles:0 "Mongolian Pastoralism"
MON_embrace_nomadic_lifestyles_desc:0 "The pastoralist lifestyle is second nature to a true Mongolian. We are a people of nomads and wanderers, adventurers and conquers! We should never set deep roots into the soil, for we are ever on the move as we move towards our destiny. Our way of life is and always should be intertwined with the land, but never pinned to it. Return to the ways of the Khans of old, for this Arcadian ideal is both our past and future."
MON_skin_flaying:0 "New Mongolian Art"

His own yurt is adorned with many of his favorite pieces, both inside on the walls and outside, fluttering in the wing like flags or tapestry. However, these canvases are no meager linen, but leather. However, not just the mere leather of lesser creatures like yak or sheep, but made from the mightiest and most ferocious of all the Earth’s beasts: Man.

Like a true god of death and devastation, he shall lead the Mongol hordes to exterminate the enemies of our people and restore the great legacy of the Dzungar Khanate of old. Under Mahakala’s banner, our armies shall march, our enemies shall perish, and a new pan-Mongolic state shall rise.

All enemies of the Mongolia people shall be brought to the sword or trampled under our hooves."

MON_horde_tactics_desc:0 "Genghis Khan is a man who needs no introduction. Able to conquer nearly two-thirds of Eurasia in his own lifetime and earning a spot within the Tengri pantheon, he was a true God among men. We must emulate his abilities, tactics, and legacy and apply them to our modern Mongolian military. Emulating and modernizing his tactics will surely allow us to repeat the successes he once had."
MON_guerilla_army:0 "Guerillas of the Steppe"
MON_guerilla_army_desc:0 "The rough terrain of the Mongolian landscape is varied and rugged. Though plains stretch across the nation, so too does crags, deserts, and the great Steppe itself.

MON_expand_recruitment:0 "The Mongolian Wave"
MON_expand_recruitment_desc:0 "Mongolia may not have a massive population, but for every soldier we field, their steed is right there alongside them.

MON_scavage_guns:0 "Battlefield Procurement"
MON_scavage_guns_desc:0 "As we fight more wars and leave behind the ruins and rubble of battle, the lands surrounding us have become littered with the former equipment and supplies of our fallen foes.

MON_raiding_army:0 "Raid and Pillage"
MON_raiding_army_desc:0 "Raiding and pillaging is the true Mongol way, and our armies have had this ingrained in the very fibre of their being. While on the warpath, all of our enemy’s treasures shall be ours as our troops sweep through their lands and claim everything of value as rightful plunder of our righteous war effort. When not at war, our armies shall transition from a standing army into smaller raiding parties, sent out across our border regions and neighboring lands in search of bounty. No matter the state of our nation, war or peace, raiding shall be constant as a facet of the Mongolian identity."
MON_hunt_down_gada_meiren:0 "Hunt Down Gada Meiren"
MON_hunt_down_gada_meiren_desc:0 "The foul peasant ‘revolutionary’ Gada Meiren has been a thorn in our side for far too long. Though his actions for the Mongolian people are admirable and his fight against the Chinese noble, he is too much of a wildcard to be left in play. We must hunt him down and silence him for good. He shall be enshrined forever as a true Mongolian patriot for his great deeds for our people, regardless of his vaguely leftist views."

MON_commit_more_gamer_moments:0 "Cut Them All Down"
MON_commit_more_gamer_moments_desc:0 "The Mongolian populace must be made pure and wholly Mongolian. Our fellow Mongolics, from the mighty Oirats to the Alatic peoples and even the far-off Kalmyks, our shared people are righteous. However, not all races can be so lucky. The last of the Russian and Chinese settlers too stubborn or foolish to leave will be dealt with so that Mongolia can once more be pure."
MON_lamas_fifedom:0 "The Fiefdom of Ja Lama"
MON_lamas_fifedom_desc:0 "Mongolia has been cleansed of foregin parasites, internal weaknesses, and ideological poison. These lands are ruled by Ja Lama now, and all in Mongolia must swear fealty to him. Though he is still tacitly linked to the Bogd Khan and his authority, all know that Ja Lama is truly the one in charge as he and his kurultai of savage bandits and warrior khans bend the Yassa legal system and our very faith to fully suit and justify the glorious actions of the Warrior Tulku. Now, he shall move to radically and rapidly push Mongolia towards its new destiny - a destiny tied to the traditions and honored past of the Mongol people."

Our Khanate shall be freed of the Gamin and made purely, wholly Mongolic as we build a new society for our people."
MON_agricultural_development:0 "An Agricultural Revolution"
MON_agricultural_development_desc:0 "Though we are a nomadic people, we also must be self-sufficient, and we cannot feed an entire growing nation on the bounties of the wild alone. Ja Lama has envisioned a Nomadic Agricultural Revolution for Mongolia, where massive farms would be built to the fertile East of the nation, with farm-hands rotating so that workers are not separated from the nomadic lifestyle for too long, while the West and interior of the nation surrounding the Gobi would serve as pasture land for our ever-growing grazing herds. Though expensive, it is just what Mongolia needs to feed its populace while also staying true to its nomadic roots."
MON_expanded_education:0 "A True Mongol Education"
MON_expanded_education_desc:0 "Every child in the state must be given a proper education, teaching them the ways of their nomadic heritage, the faiths of their people, and the true history of the Mongolian peoples. With much of the curriculum being penned by Ja Lama himself with loyal academics and spiritual leaders grainting their guidance, a new educational code shall be created for all Mongol children to learn. The next generation will know the truth of the Mongolian legacy!"
MON_fight_corruption_clergy:0 "Cleanse the Clergy"
MON_fight_corruption_clergy_desc:0 "Much of the clergy within Mongolia are corrupt, with tainted and dubiously-motivated monks and lower tulkus preying on the good faith of our people for their own gain. We shall bring these false soothsayers to the sword, and replace them with loyal, pious new servants to the gods. These new priests shall have true loyalty to the White Faith and Buddhism, but also to Ja Lama himself."
MON_nomadic_primacy:0 "Nomadic Primacy"
MON_nomadic_primacy_desc:0 "We are the people of the yurt, the true and original nomads of East Asia, and the eternal wanderers of the Steppe. The nomadic lifestyle is the foundation of our religions, our society, our culture, our military, and so on. It is the very identity of the true Mongols, and so all true Mongols today shall live as their ancestors did. Learning from how they live can help teach us how to have a productive and efficient society without the need of settled cities and urban prisons of concrete and steel."
MON_raid_economy:0 "An Economy Built on Plunder"
MON_raid_economy_desc:0 "The very lifeblood of our entire economy is based on bounty, plunder, treasure, and the fruits beared by our countless hordes of raiders and riders and that roam East Asia for the good of our Khanate.

MON_deal_with_bandits_desc:0 "Bandits and brigands have long been a pervasive issue that has plagued much of Mongolia and its wilderness. We must put an end to their raids and burn their camps so that our people may live in these new lands without threat."
MON_control_the_monastaries:0 "Control the Monasteries"
MON_control_the_monastaries_desc:0 "The many Buddhist, Tengrist, and other monasteries and churches that dot these lands must be swayed to our side, one way or another.

MON_deal_with_democrats:0 "Silence the Cries for Democracy"
MON_deal_with_democrats_desc:0 "Though relatively well suppressed by the Ungern regime, democrats and republicans have begun to rear their ugly heads once more, particularly the Ardīn Nam. We must crush these vile forces, for the Mongolian people have no say in their governance anymore."
MON_nobility_problem:0 "The Issue of the Nobility"
MON_nobility_problem_desc:0 "The princes and nobles of the Yazguurtnuudyn Zövlöl have nearly always been influential in Mongolia, long ruling these lands before the rise of the Bloody Baron.

MON_end_gada_meiren_desc:0 "Gada Meiren, the nomadic people’s hero of the Steppe, has long raiding our borders, settlements, and farmlands, salting our fields and slaughtering our people in the name of a ‘free’ Mongolia.

MON_drive_out_the_russians_desc:0 "In order to restore the glories of the Anhui Clique and retake the lands of our people, we will need a fully sinified environment to launch our crusade into the Middle Kingdom from.

We will drive out the last of the Chinese settlers and their imperialist holdouts, for Mongolia belongs to the Russian Bear and no one else."
MON_anfu:0 "Rebirth of the Anhui Clique"
MON_anfu_desc:0 "Long exiled to the Steppe since the disaster that was the Northern Expedition, the Anhui Clique has once again established a stable foothold after nearly dying out after the German Intervention.

A cabal of Capitalists, captains of industry, financiers, and other cronies of capital all united in their wish to see our Anhui Clique ruling over China, the Communications Clique is the lifeblood of our economy and one of our only allies in the maelstrom that consumes the Middle Kingdom. We should move to strengthen our ties with their sharp-minded investors, allowing them to fund our industrial build-up and militarization process as we prepare to take China for ourselves."
MON_srs:0 "The Soyombo Revival"
MON_srs_desc:0 "Named for an archaic script designed by Zanabazar, the first leader of Tibettan Buddhism, to standardize Mongolian, Sanskrit, and Tibetan writings, the Soyombo Revival Society is an odd group of Russian immigrants and generals who model themselves on ancient Mongolian secret societies. Holding minorly esoteric views on spirituality and syncretic religions, this varied band of Russian nationals will now drive Mongolia towards a new destiny: the revival of Russia colonialism in East Asia and the completion of the Zheltorossiyan plan."
MON_cuck_to_trm:0 "An Ode to Vladivostok"
MON_cuck_to_trm_desc:0 "We must align with the rightful Russian Government that has been long exiled to Vladivostok. Not only is their capital far closer to ours, making cooperation far easier, but also their time living at the end of the world in a harsh environment makes them kindred spirits with the Russians of our lands. We shall tame the Steppe, and they shall tame Siberia, and together, we shall retake Moscow from those decadent traitors to the hardy Russian ideal."
MON_bow_to_none:0 "Bow to None"
MON_bow_to_none_desc:0 "Torn between rival governments and futile political debates, the Russian people are fractured. The Moscow and Vladivostok governments are at each other's throats, with our people only getting caught in the crossfire. To choose a side now would only lead us further into darkness, unrest, and uncertainty. We shall always be Russians, and forever loyal to our identity and our culture, but at least for now, we must march our own way to build a peaceful, united home for our people."
MON_russian_immigration:0 "The New Russian Frontier"
MON_russian_immigration_desc:0 "If we are to truly tame the Steppe and make it the new frontier for Russian expansion and settlement, then we are going to need more bodies.

MON_russian_colonization:0 "A Resurgent Russian Colonial Spirit"
MON_russian_colonization_desc:0 "Colonialism is in the blood of the Russian people. Since our ancestors claimed all of Siberia and the wilds past the Urals, casting out the Sibir, the Altay, and many others in their conquest, the very essence of colonial triumph has been bound to the Russian identity. Now, with this new frontier, we have revived this spirit once again and breathed new life into Russia Imperialism. All of East Asia will now feel the pressure and splendor of the Russian people."
MON_russian_alphabet:0 "A New Mongolian Script"
MON_russian_alphabet_desc:0 "To continue our goals of Russifying Mongolia and eradicating their national identity, the OVS and our Russian benefactors have devised an idea to steal the very language of the Mongolian people.

MON_take_care_of_khan_desc:0 "The Bogd Khan has long proven to be an obstacle to our rule and total control over Mongolia. To circumvent his authority, we shall quietly and discreetly deal with this holy tulku, removing him from the equation entirely. Once they begin to look for his reincarnated replacement, we will either do away with his superstitious church entirely or instead mold the new child as a puppet to our rule, influencing him with the syncretic ideals of the OVS, puppeting both the faith and minds of the Mongolian natives."
MON_cuck_to_russia:0 "Kneel Before Moscow"
MON_cuck_to_russia_desc:0 "Keeping with the centuries-long tradition of Russian Buddhists viewing each Tsar and later president of Russia as the reincarnation of the White Tara, Buddhist deity of purity, we shall stay loyal to Mother Russia, for we would be foolish not to kowtow to the true Russian government. Though they are centered far to the West of the Urals, the exiled government in Vladivostok stands no chance against them. With Moscow at our backs, our colonial dream shall flourish as we seek to tame these wild lands."

MON_rally_ungern_loyalists_desc:0 "Though the Mad Baron Ungern-Sternberg is long dead, left rotting in some forgotten battlefield, much of his loyalists and ‘allies’ still remain, with many of them being key OVS members.

MON_end_of_nomadicism_desc:0 "If Mongolia is to prosper and truly become a modern, profitable colonial state, and eventually part of the Russian homeland itself, changes will need to be made.

MON_revenge_on_japan:0 "Avenge the Russo-Japanese War"
MON_revenge_on_japan_desc:0 "The Russo-Japanese War was one of the largest military disasters in Russian history.

From agriculture to the most modern industry, all fields of study in Mongolia shall be improved."

MON_promise_autonomy:0 "A Deal for Autonomy"
MON_promise_autonomy_desc:0 "We shall strike a deal with these wild nomads, and a simple one that even brutes like them could understand. We shall promise them nominal independence under our restored Chinese state if, and only if, these savages of the Steppe serve as shock troopers and meat shields for our more valuable military assets. We shall use Chinese brains and Mongol blood to save China, and in return, they will be allowed to keep their wasteland."

MON_mondernize_mongolia_desc:0 "Mongolia is a non-industrialized, archaic backwater that reeks of horse dung and dirty peasants.

Though it originally failed and Mongolia broke free under the Bogd Khan and Ungern-Sternberg, the ideas of this failed program have not.

Though we share an appreciation and zealotry for Buddhism, the sects we follow are largely different. In addition to these shallow differences, their appreciation and piety for shamanism, Burkhanism, and the Tengri faiths all work to erode our authority.

New factories shall rise, new urbanization programs shall commence, and the nomadic identity of Mongolia shall be quickly eroded and replaced.

As we divorce Mongolia from all religion, the hundreds of monasteries and holy sites across the state shall be ransacked, pillaged, looted, or seized and repurposed, with the treasures and fortunes that these opulent sites hold being liquidated and redistributed to the masses. Properties seized shall aid the state and the functions of the Revolution, or otherwise divided up and given to the masses in a push for collectivization.

Reaching a breaking-point on matters of foreign policy, with Ulanhu wishing to align with the Eastern Dragon of China and the LKMT as Luvsansharav seeks to maintain their ties to the Northern Bear and their long-time Bolshevik allies, it would seem that the new Ardīn Nam approaches a crossroads as rivals and old foes lurk in the shadows waiting for their opportunity to strike.

A Centralized Syndicalist provisional regime has been established as the foundations of this new foreign Socialist thoughtform are applied to the State, though the uniformity of the squabbling Syndicalists is already beginning to waver, and it likely won’t be long until a sole leader rises above all others."

Now that we have solidified Syndicalism’s hold over the Steppe, we must now pay our dues to these old allies.

These Red Khuraldais shall even come together in a centralized and united forum from time to time to dictate national interests and policies.

The purges, massacres, and destruction wrought at the hands of our predecessors can never truly be undone, and will never be forgotten, but we can still reverse this course. The purges shall be ended, the political repressions shall cease, the ideas of Socialist liberties and Proletarian freedoms shall return, and the slaughter of our own people merely over their spiritual preference shall finally come to an end.

Finishing this trinity shall be ideas similar to the God-Builders of Russia pushed by Anandyn Amar and Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj, fusing this new religion with ideas of Socialism and Anarchism, working together with the Bogdo Lama and Gada Meiren to create a new combined religion that incorporates all aspects of Mongolia’s history and native culture in order to unite all true Mongolians under one pseudo-Socialist identity bound by the soul and the sky."

### Events ###

mon.1.t:0 "A History of Mongolia"
mon.1.d:0 "Mongolia was under the control of the Manchu Qing Dynasty for centuries, until the 1911 Xinhai Revolution led to Mongolian independence under the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the head of Mongolian Buddhism, who took the title of the Bogd Khan. China still claimed Mongolia as Chinese territory, and Mongolia’s independence was shattered in 1919, when Xu Shuzheng, a Chinese warlord of the Anhui Clique, occupied the country. However, in 1920, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, a White Russian military leader, leading his Asiatic Cavalry Division, took Urga from the Chinese, and restored the Bogd Khan.\n\nUngern enforced the Khan’s rule with an iron fist, crushing revolts and dissidents while making deals with the aristocratic Mongol Princes. The Mongol Ardyn Nam, a socialist party inspired by the Bolsheviks, was formed, and began a revolution in 1921 to overthrow Ungern’s regime. Due to lack of foreign support, this revolution failed, and the MAN were forced to go into hiding. Following the near-death and temporary coma of the Bogd Khaan in 1924 due to his poor health and a possible failed poisoning attempt by Ardīn Nam agents , the MAN rebelled again, claiming Ungern no longer held any legitimacy in the country without his liege. This revolution was harshly repressed, and multiple senior members of the MAN, including their leader Damdin Sükhbaatar, were executed, forcing the shattered MAN remnants into hiding once more. In this time, Ungern made deals with the Russian government, for economic and military support, and his forces were also able to seize Xilingol from the Chinese Guominjun. Ungern's rule was still shaky, however, and following a series of peasant uprisings in 1930 led primarily by Buddhist lamas and the nomadic patriot Gada Meiren, Ungern purged many high ranking lamas in his government, destroying much of the support he had accrued over the years.\n\nWith the Bogd Khan’s ever failing health and Ungern’s ever rising ambitions, the future of Mongolia is uncertain, especially as old foes and new enemies begin to stir once more."
mon.1.a:0 "What about now?"

mon.3.t:0 "A Charge Against Gada Meiren"
mon.3.d:0 "The sun rose high across the Eastern Steppe as yet another unruly and chaos-filled day began anew to test the Bloody Baron and his struggling regime. If it wasn’t putting down the week’s tenth marauding bandit horde, it was once again doing battle with the infamous Gada Meiren and his radical separatists - no day offered rest or respite for the Mad Baron, and it has begun to take its toll. \n\nUngern-Sterberg has never been a fully stable man, and the constant state of war his mind swirls in coupled with the rigors of running a state as backwards as Mongolia have truly begun to wear away the aging warlord’s remaining sanity and health. However, nothing like a good fight returns the vigor and desire for conquest and power to the Bloody Baron’s veins, and fate would just have it that another fight was brewing on the horizon. \n\nTo the East, the famed Gada Meiren, rebel leader and Mongolian nationalist revolutionary, and his forces have been seen amassing once more, poised to strike into the heartlands of Mongolia yet again and wreak havoc on the Baron’s domain. Never shying from a fight, the Baron Ungern-Sternberg has rallied his forces of Russian exiles and hired mercenaries and tribals to ride to meet this ‘lou yada’ and his hobbled-together militias on the fields of battle. \n\nAfter marching towards each other for a full day and a night, the two forces met and began their clash on the grasslands outside the village of Mandurkhu, with the riders of the Mad Baron and Gada Meiren viscously greeting each other with bow and sabre. In a thunderous crash of steel on steel and beast on beast, the writhing masses of these rallied cavalry hordes slammed into one another with the force of a freight train, causing sparks to dance off swords and armor as red mist filled the air, turning the sky as red as the bloody soil beneath them. \n\nAfter hours of struggle and horrific slaughter, the dust began to settle as a calm quiet swept across the once raging battlefield. Though a pyrrhic conflict for both sides, a clear, but bloodied and bruised, victor is left standing, but who?"  
mon.3.a:0 "Routed, Gada Meiren flees the maelstrom, barely, and rides off into the Black Gobi."
mon.3.b:0 "The Mad Baron is savagely cut-down in battle, and Gada Meiren has claimed his head!"
mon.3.c:0 "Ungern-Sternberg was struck by a stray arrow, but managed to reach his horse to escape to Urga!"

mon.2.t:0 "The Result of the Power Struggle"
mon.2.d:0 "The Mongolian Khanate has been thrown into absolute chaos with the apparent death of the Bloody and Mad Baron himself, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. With the passing of this false Khan, Mongolia is now free to decide its own political destiny, but no one said this decision would be peaceful or blood-free. Even now, the various forces that have long vied for power and wished for the Baron’s fall now all move at once to jump on this one chance to seize power before the power vacuum created by the Khan’s departure to the next world fully closes as it finds a new occupant to fill the void. \n\nFrom ambitious nobles to radical Buddhists and foreign interests, people from all walks of life and from all schools of thought seek to make Mongolia, our Mongolia, their own plaything, as if our nation was just a vehicle to achieve their own greedy ends. Whatever their reasoning, desires, or true end goal, nothing will change the fact that only one group can rule Mongolia. After the dust settles and these bickering, warring factions have had their shot at seizing the mandate to rule Mongolia, who shall stand atop the pile of them all to rule these wild lands?"
mon.2.a:0 "The radical Buddhists take power to cleanse impiety and sin from this paradise!"
mon.2.b:0 "The nobles and princes have long schemed for this day, and have seized power!"

mon.2.e:0 "The infamous wanderer Ja Lama marches on Urga!"
mon.2.f:0 "Foreign officers and plotters take power, toppling Mongol rule from within!"

mon.300.t:0 "A Baron Dies, but a Khan is Reborn"
mon.300.d:0 "Urga is in chaos and the Baron is in a coma, and not a soul in Mongolia knows what will happen next as the various forces and factions within our Khanate now seek to tear apart everything Ungern-Sternberg and the Bogd Khan have worked to achieve. In a yurt at the center of the city, the Mad Baron now lies unconscious, writhing in agony and muttering broken gibberish as a heavy fever claims his body and delirium and delusion seize his mind. \n\nAs the world rages around him, Ungern-Sternberg was locked away in the vault of his own mind, oblivious to the numerous aides and attendants that now worked without end to try to revive their dying patriarch. Roman’s mind was alight with fantastical visions and near-prophetic glimpses of pure Nirvana - his very psyche and soul reaching out into the cosmic expanse and seemingly communing with the very essence of the Universe itself, though it is just as likely that these visions have less to do with divine intervention and more to do with the last of the Baron’s functioning brain matter slowly suffocating and decaying away. \n\nAs the voices ceased and the cacophony that stormed within his mind finally subsided in a sudden instant, the eyes of the Khan bolted open once more with life, now blood-shot and wild-eyed like never before. Without hesitation or warning, the Khan let out a primordial scream that shook the heavens and nearly deafened those in the yurt with him who were tending to his wounds, before finally uttering but one complete phrase...."
mon.300.a:0 "The World shall tremble in fear, for now I am become Mahakala, the Destroyer of Worlds."

mon.4.t:0 "The Nation Stabilizes"
mon.4.d:0 "Fighting across the nation is coming to an end, as [MON.GetName] defeats all opponents. As rival armies collapse, Mongolia nears unity and stability is finally returning to the nation. Now, we can focus on cementing our rule and establishing a cohesive government. "
mon.4.a:0 "Fantastic!"

mon.42.t:0 "Buddistuudyn Zövlöl Takes Power"
mon.42.d:0 "The Buddistuudyn Zövlöl, a secretive council of buddhist lamas, have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
mon.42.a:0 "For Buddhism!"
mon.42.b:0 "For Buddhism, and the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu!"

mon.43.t:0 "Ungern Retakes Power"
mon.43.d:0 "Ungern-Sternberg has retaken power in Urga. Though he now hold de jure control of the nation, his influence outside Urga remains limited, and he will have to act fast if he are to keep his power"
mon.43.a:0 "For Ungern!"

mon.44.t:0 "Noyodyn Zövlöl Take Power"
mon.44.d:0 "The aristocratic Mongol Princes, under the leadership of Prince Demchugdongrub, have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
mon.44.a:0 "For Order!"

mon.45.t:0 "MAN Seizes Control, but Must Decide its Future"
mon.45.d:0 "The Mad Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg is dead, and all of Mongolia is in chaos. The central government has entirely collapsed, and the only shred of legitimate governance within the nation is now rallied around the Mongol Ardyn Nam, leaders of the People’s Revolution and the Mongolian Spring. \n\nThis MAN, the largest and oldest unified political party in Mongolia, has long sought to bring true democracy and modern reform to Mongolia, and exist as a large coalition of democrats from all across the spectrum, with the largest and most dominant faction being the moderate socialists by far, who stand as remnants of the original MAN that led the 1921 and 1924 failed revolutions. Purged of their radical faction who all ran into exile across the wider Socialist world such as in Russia before the Reds fell, India, France, Italy, England, and beyond, the MAN preaches the thoughtform of Socialism through peaceful and democratic reform at all costs. However, the party has begun to split on one matter: how ‘fair and free’ should our new democracy be? \n\nFearing that opening up this democracy to the masses, and more harmfully the nobility and clergy, would bring about a backslide from our Democratic Socialist and Social Democratic goals, many have begun to suggest that democracy in Mongolia should be rigged from the outset. By putting on a charade for the public and the rest of those democratic bodies outside our Leftist wing, we could preserve our vision without angering the public. The pushback to this idea is predictably harsh, but that does not mean that it is out of the realm of possibility. Which section of the debate about the future of the MAN shall win out \n\nIn stark contrast to the Ardīn Nam’s noble democratic pursuit, Gada Meiren stands as the other main unifying force within Mongolia. Though his support base is not as large, he has far more support among the rural and tribal population of the Steppe, and as an ardent Mongolian nationalist and war hero, he has even been able to win over many of the more nationalist or militarists elements that despise the more liberal Ardīn Nam. Seeking to radically reform Mongolian society, ousting foreign leeches in favor of pro-Mongolian populist policies, Gada Meiren has shown to be a strong force to reckon with and a true rival to the Ardīn Nam. Though their competition is fierce, the two forces are near evenly matched, and whoever wins out in the coming power struggle is anyone’s guess."
mon.45.a:0 "The MAN sticks to true democratic principles!"
mon.45.b:0 "The MAN moves to rig Mongolian democracy from the beginning."
mon.45.c:0 "Gada Meiren, the Last Son, proclaims victory for all true Mongolians!"

mon.46.t:0 "Ja Lama Advances on Urga"
mon.46.d:0 "Smoke and ash filled the skies of Urga as Ja Lama entered the smoldering city. Bandits, revolutionaries, and mercenaries have all already made their mark on this city in the wake of the Mad Baron’s passing, and only chaos reigned over this city of madness now. \n\nJa Lama’s main prize was the central palace of the city, currently standing as the only bastion of order in all of Urga, where the Bogd Khan sits waiting behind sealed doors and armed guards, waiting for stability to once again settle over the city. Knowing that peace would not come on its own, Ja Lama and his forces knew what they had to do. Drawing sabres and mounting their steeds, Ja Lama and his riders would cleanse Urga of this raucous rabble, saving the city and the Bogd Khan first, then he and his forces would repeat the same in village after village and town after town until all of Mongolia has been brought to heel once more. The Baron is dead, and the Bogd Khan still reigns, but this is Ja Lama’s Mongolia now."
mon.46.a:0 "The heir of Amursana returns home."

mon.47.t:0 "Foreigners Take Control of Mongolia"
mon.47.d:0 "In the wake of Ungern-Sternberg’s demise, the various foreign wolves and vultures that his rule kept at bay were now free to spread across all of Mongolia like parasites and scavengers moving in to rip apart a newly deposited carcass. Of the two main groups of are the Chinese remnants of the Anhui Clique’s political wing - the Anfu Club - who seek to restore Gamin rule over Mongolia and later all of China, and the Soyombo Revival Society, a pro-Russian group composed mostly of old Ungern-Sternberg loyalists and other Russia expatriates who seek to turn Mongolia into a Russian client state bent on retaking Manchuria. Both these groups are well-funded and well-connected, and now it is only a matter of which one shall take over Mongolia and which direction our people will be steered in."
mon.47.a:0 "For the Anfu Club!"
mon.47.b:0 "For the Soyombo Revival Society!"

mon.49.t:0 "Ungern loyalists march toward Urga"
mon.49.d:0 "After we were able to seize power of the government, loyalists of the tyrannical Mad Baron escaped. Now, after mustering and rebuilding a small amount power in a village nearby, these troops are coming back to retake the city. The army, a mix of Mongols, Russians, and Chinese bandits number over a thousand troops. With most of the national army in the west, we only have the power of the civilians and the hastily established revolutionary militia to defend the city."
mon.49.a:0 "Call on civilians to resist, and march in the militia."
mon.49.b:0 "Call on the citizens to resist these traitors!"
mon.49.c:0 "Lay down our arms, no need for a massacre."
mon.50.t:0 "Ungern loyalists destroyed"
mon.50.d:0 "Finally, after much fighting and many casualties, Ungern has been killed, and his troops have been repulsed. Urga is ours, for now."
mon.50.a:0 "The people of Urga want change!"
mon.51.t:0 "Ungern loyalists have captured Urga!"
mon.51.d:0 "After little fighting, Ungern and his troops were able to take back the city. Though most of our officials have escaped, we are unlikely to be seen as the real government without power in Urga."
mon.51.a:0 "Those men are more Russian than Mongolian."
mon.52.t:0 "Re-evaluation of Monastery funding"
mon.52.d:0 "With the power now in the people’s hands, and with Mongolia modernising every day, one key thing to evaluate is the funding the monasteries receive from the government. The monasteries, though an important aspect of Mongolia, is a very traditional area of the nation, and many lamas even push anti-government propaganda, either harbouring back to Ungerns Mongolia or even supporting the now defunct Buddistuudyn Zövlöl. Some in our government state that funding for the monasteries should be reduced, for they harbour sentiments of authoritarianism and traditionalism. Others in government argue that for now, it might be best to keep the lamas on our side, and to leave the funding where it is, or even increase it."
mon.52.a:0 "Keep the Monasteries on our side."
mon.52.b:0 "Give the money to the people!"
mon.52.c:0 "The lamas may be a good ally, let's give them more funding."
mon.53.t:0 "The Popular Prince"
mon.53.d:0 "Khatanbaatar Magsarjav was elected to government mostly thanks to assistance from the aristocrats. Now, discussions have begun throughout the party as to whether he is the right man to lead. Many people do not know him too well, and mostly see him as a noble bureaucrat, lacking much charisma. A figure of the aristocrats that does have charisma, however, is Prince Demchugdongrub. Following the Western Revolt, the Prince and many of his aristocrats remained in Urga, to try to keep their influence. Demchugdongrub has remained a very popular figure, and many have stated he should rule as prime minister, with Khatanbaatar Magsarjav as his deputy. Some, however, may see this as a betrayal of the democratic process."
mon.53.a:0 "Invite Demchugdongrub to become Prime Minister."
mon.53.b:0 "If he wants to lead, he can do it democratically!"
mon.54.t:0 "Review the Budget"
mon.54.d:0 "Throughout Ungerns years as dictator of Mongolia, spending increased massively. The country’s economy is weak, and changes must be made. Ungern began massive military projects, all of which cost massive amounts. We, the aristocrats, were taxed massively to pay the bill. Of course, aristocrat taxes have already been cut massively, and to offset this we could increase the tax on the poor majority of the nation, the arats. Perhaps, we could even begin a tax policy on the monasteries."
mon.54.a:0 "Cut military spending."
mon.54.b:0 "Raise Arat tax."
mon.54.c:0 "Implement Monastery tax."
mon.55.t:0 "Assassination attempt on Ungern-Sternberg!"
mon.55.d:0 "While riding his horse in a parade through Urga, a sudden noise deafened the crowds. A shot that echoed through the city, that missed Baron Ungern by two inches. The assassin, a twenty three year old man, was shot almost immediately. Ungern ordered the marching army to fire on the crowd, frenzied by the attempt on his life. The crowd dispersed in a panic as civilians, or possible MAN agents, were killed by Ungerns troops. After the city had calmed down, the assassin has been identified as a member of the Mongol Ardyn Nam, however many peasants in Urga claim this to be fabricated by our government."
mon.55.a:0 "At least the Baron survived."
mon.56.t:0 "[MON.GetLeader] asks for weapons"
mon.56.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader] has asked our government for weapons, to help him defend Mongolia from its enemies. Mongolia is our foothold in China, and it might be best to keep it on our side."
mon.56.a:0 "Send them arms."
mon.56.b:0 "We are too busy."
mon.57.t:0 "Russia agreed to send arms"
mon.57.d:0 "Russia have sent us a shipment of guns, and have agreed to do this every year so long as we remain in power."
mon.57.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.58.t:0 "Russia refused to send arms"
mon.58.d:0 "Russia have decided to no longer send us any arms."
mon.58.a:0 "Damn."
mon.59.t:0 "Diplomatic Mission from Mongolia"
mon.59.d:0 "Mongolia, lead by the religious zealot the [MON.GetLeader], has recently sent us a diplomatic mission. Due to both of our nations being major homes for buddhism, the Mongolian diplomats have stated that they wish to see our nations grow closer, through guarantees and military access. They await our answer."
mon.59.a:0 "We buddhist nations must stick together!"
mon.59.b:0 "We are better off alone."
mon.60.t:0 "The Western Revolt has finally been crushed"
mon.60.d:0 "After many months of fighting in the west of the nation, between bandits, rebels, and government troops, the revolt has been crushed. Most rebels have dispersed, gone into hiding or fled the country, fearing for their lives. Order has come out on top, and the country is secure. However, there are still some small bandit groups, taking advantage of the destruction. They will have to be dealt with."
mon.60.a:0 "At last, the nation is safe."
mon.61.t:0 "The Offer"
mon.61.d:0 "Today, we received a letter from a few of the bandit leaders in the west. In the letter, it said that their groups do not have any stake in what has developed. They came for simple banditry, but it has turned into all out rebellion. The letter goes on to say that although their groups continues to fight in the west, they would be willing to stop, if given some money and supplies. It is a large amount of money, which we will need to find, but it will help reduce the size of the chaos in the west."
mon.61.a:0 "Use the nobles money to pay the bribe."
mon.61.b:0 "Sell off some of the monasteries jewels to pay it."
mon.61.c:0 "Raise taxes on the poor to pay the bribe."
mon.61.e:0 "Reduce military funding to pay the bribe."
mon.61.f:0 "We will not negotiate with these bandits!"
mon.62.t:0 "The bandit leader takes the bribe"
mon.62.d:0 "The bandit leaders have taken our offer, and have decided to end their operations in the west. In these times of brutal battle, good news like this should be celebrated, but a quiet drink is all [MON.GetLeader] had time for, before having to return to keeping Urga in his hands."
mon.62.a:0 "That'll reduce their forces."
mon.63.t:0 "Mongolia asks for guarantees"
mon.63.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader], currently leader of Mongolia, has requested that we guarantee their nation, to keep them safe from outside threats. This will cement them as our influence in the region."
mon.63.a:0 "Guarantee them."
mon.63.b:0 "We don't want to be pulled into Chinese affairs."
mon.64.t:0 "Russia has agreed!"
mon.64.d:0 "Russia has agreed to give us guarantees, to keep us safe from outside threats."
mon.64.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.65.t:0 "Russia has refused!"
mon.65.d:0 "Russia has refused to give us guarantees. We are left alone."
mon.65.a:0 "Damn."
mon.66.t:0 "Power Struggle in the Ma Clique"
mon.66.d:0 "For many years, the Ma Clique has been led by family elder Ma Fuxiang. In the Clique, he was seen as a pillar of stability, who would stop any power struggle occurring between the very divided Ma families. Many in China even see him as the stabiliser of the Northwest, ending Tibetan and our own aggression into Chinese soil.\n\nHowever, news has just reached us that Ma Fuxiang has passed away. Currently he has been replaced by Ma Lin, but another Ma, Ma Bufang, and Ma Lin are already embroiled in a power struggle. This could be a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the Ma Clique's position."
mon.66.a:0 "Good to know."
mon.67.t:0 "Buyandelger gathers force on the Ulanqab border"
mon.67.d:0 "Mongolian general Buyandelger has generally stayed uninvolved with the power struggles happening currently in Urga. For years, he has continued to live in Inner Mongolia, raiding Chinese shipments through the region. Now, we have just received reports that Buyandelger has gathered a large force on the border with the Ma Clique, likely to do some border raids into Ulanqab."
mon.67.a:0 "Let the border raids begin."
mon.68.t:0 "Mongolian border raids from Ulanqab"
mon.68.d:0 "Ever since the death of family patriarch Ma Fuxiang, tensions on both the northern and southern border have been getting worse and worse. Border Raids from Mongolia, primarily in the province of Ulanqab, have caused much chaos over the recent weeks. This is not wholly unexpected, though we should be prepared for if this escalates further."
mon.68.a:0 "This is fine."
mon.69.t:0 "Buyandelger makes his choice"
mon.69.d:0 "With his large force moving through Ulanqab, a thought occurred to Buyandelger. If he was to take Guisui, he would have de facto control of the province. With the Ma's struggling with internal conflict, it should not be too difficult to move his force through the region and to take the city. Now, it is whether he decides to do it or not."
mon.69.a:0 "It's too risky."
mon.69.b:0 "Buyandelger, do it."
mon.70.t:0 "Large Mongolian force moving to Guisui"
mon.70.d:0 "Some of our scouts have reported a large force of Mongolian soldiers moving toward the main city of Ulanqab, Guisui. Should the Mongols take it, they will have de facto control of the whole region. Though there is a garrison in Guisui, many fear it will not be enough to beat the quickly approaching Mongols. Ma Hongkui is currently in the region with his force, so he may be able to fight them off."
mon.70.a:0 "The garrison will hold."
mon.70.b:0 "Send a force under Ma Hongkui."
mon.71.t:0 "Mongolian general Buyandelger takes Guisui"
mon.71.d:0 "The Mongolian general Buyandelger, who led the large Mongol force through Ulanqab, has been able to defeat any Ma forces in the area and has taken Guisui. There, he declared it now under Mongolian control. However, we can still act. Ma Hongbin is also now in the area, and could move his own forces up to try to retake the city."
mon.71.a:0 "We cannot act, leave Ulanqab."
mon.71.b:0 "Send a force under Ma Hongbin."
mon.72.t:0 "We have taken Ulanqab!"
mon.72.d:0 "After Buyandelger began to move toward Guisui to take Ulanqab, he was met with surprisingly little resistance from the Ma Clique. Though he had to fight some small battles with border troops, and had to fight through the Guisui garrison, for now it seems the Ma Clique have retreated from Ulanqab. Finally, Mongolian families have been reunited, and Mongolian rule in the region has been restored."
mon.72.a:0 "Good work Buyandelger."
mon.73.t:0 "Ma Hongkui loses"
mon.73.d:0 "Ma Hongkui's forces travelled for a day and a night to finally reach the Mongolian force. In the early hours of the morning, Ma Hongkui sent in his soldiers to attack the Mongolians, who looked like they were just camping. However, it was a trap! After Hongkui sent his main force in, a group of Mongolian cavalry had snuck behind and attacked on the back lines, at the same time as the battle going on at the front. Ma Hongkui's force was caught in the middle, and beaten. Hongkui was able to make his escape, but he lost the battle, and the Mongol force has almost reached Guisui."
mon.73.a:0 "Damn."
mon.74.t:0 "Mongol raiders beaten in Ulanqab"
mon.74.d:0 "After much fighting between our forces and theirs, in the end, our forces were able to beat the Mongolian force back to the border. For now, Ulanqab remains in our hands."
mon.74.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.75.t:0 "Buyandelger beaten"
mon.75.d:0 "After almost being able to take Guisui from the Ma Clique, Buyandelger and his force have been beaten back to Xilingol. They fought hard, but were unable to beat the better trained and better armed Chinese troops. For now, Ulanqab remains in their hands."
mon.75.a:0 "Damn."
mon.76.t:0 "Ma Hongbin has lost, Mongolians take Guisui"
mon.76.d:0 "Ma Hongbin decided to try to go for a full frontal attack against the Mongolian force with his own force, to avoid being scouted and routed by the Mongols. Therefore he charged directly at the city, but by that point he had already fallen into Buyandelger's trap. From behind hills on both sides of his force emerged groups of Mongol cavalry, who pincered Hongbin's forces, leaving them with 2 options: either retreat and concede the city, or move into the city and try to take it, then deal with the outside cavalry afterwards. In this critical moment, Hongbin decided to push through to try to take the city. However, much of his force had already started to retreat, seeing the city as a death sentence. With that, Ma Hongbin's weakened group were forced to retreat. It seems Ulanqab has now fallen into Mongol hands."
mon.76.a:0 "Damn."
mon.77.t:0 "Peasant Rebellion in Urga"
mon.77.d:0 "In Urga, many peasants, after learning of the sweeping laws implemented to massively increase the power of bosses and nobles, while also destroying their own rights, has decided to take up arms and join the Mongol Ardyn Nam. Battle continues to rage in the streets, and the poorer regions of the city are in MAN control."
mon.77.a:0 "Damn."

mon.100.d:0 "Baron Ungern has ruled the nation for many years, and more and more has had to get more involved in its internal affairs. This of course took a toll on the Baron’s health over the years. This morning, when his maid came in to serve him breakfast, she dropped the tray in shock, as she saw a frail Ungern laying in his bed, covered in his own bloody vomit. Many monks and lamas were ordered in, bringing many herbs and other tribal remedies. However, it appears the Barons health is not getting much better."

mon.101.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning, guards stationed outside Baron Ungern’s room suddenly heard a loud thud. As they entered the room, they saw Ungern’s body, face down on the ground, collapsed. Upon further inspection, they discovered he wasn’t breathing, and quickly rushed to find lamas to try to save him. Alas, it was too late for the Baron. The guards stationed outside his room were executed, for letting him die on their watch, as were many of the lamas who were there to cure him.\n\nWhile investigating the room, a short book was found, written by Ungern, detailing what would happen if he died. It was read to a council of Ungern’s inner circle: Boris Rezukhin, Mikhail Tornovsky, Ferdynand Ossendowski, Agvan Dorzhiev, and Vladimir Roerich. Also present was the powerless 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. It stated that Rezukhin was Ungern’s successor, and that he must be protected so that he could rule in the Barons stead. Tornovsky refutes this, stating that he was Ungern’s rightful successor, but after Rezukhin pulled a pistol on him, he conceded. The book also stated stability of the realm was paramount, and that though Rezukhin will now rule, Baron Ungern-Sternberg will still be used in all propaganda, and his cult of personality will remain."

Although Kerensky did not allow the House of Romanov to rightfully retake the throne, he was still better than the Reds, and he allowed our relationship to grow strong.\n\nHowever, everything has all been brought to question. Any sign of stability that Kerensky brought to Russian politics was lost the moment the bullet struck his body.

Both of them even compared us to the dictator Ungern-Sternberg! Ironic, seeing as the Ünenbayan's aristocratic friends were the ones helping keep the Baron's government alive. However, their reaction to this is unsurprising. What is surprising is the reaction of the people. It appears, though we were the most likely to win the election, it appears the people still wanted to be able to make the choice.

The beliefs of buddhism, something that Ungern claimed to follow, were noticeably absent in the previous government. The 1930 purge is evidence that Ungern's buddhist claims were little more than lies and deceptions. The Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu lived as little more than a prisoner, not receiving the proper training.

He would have died had it not been for Ungern's Asiatic Cavalry Division taking Urga from Chinese control and freeing him. Many Mongolians see the old man as a unifying figure; a sign that Mongolians are still able to lead in this Russian-dominated government. However, perhaps his links to the MAN never went away. Though we have failed to find any evidence of this, perhaps he aided the MAN rebels against us, and almost led to our downfall. He constantly makes it clear that he doesn't serve us, rather serving Mongolia directly. Maybe it is time for the old General to meet his end."

After that, he travelled to the west of the nation, to put down rebellion and to train anti-Chinese forces in the province of Dzungaria. It is clear that in this mission he failed. At the start of the Western Revolt, he was in Dzungaria, rather than doing his job of putting down anti-government activity. Ungerns mistrust of him was obviously justified.

He was promoted to the rank of general by the Bogd Khan himself, after he came to Urga following the revolution against the Chinese. In expelling Chinese troops, he worked with bandit leader Ja Lama multiple times. This is where the worry about Togtokh Taij lies.

With this new mass industrialisation along with the complete lack of labour rights, all of the workers constructing these factories are in clear danger. A common cause of death nowadays is death while constructing a new factory. The best example of this occurred today, when 37 people were killed in an explosion during the construction of a factory outside Mörön. The factory is to become a textile factory, owned personally by Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man. Due to the lack of any safety regulations whatsoever, a poorly build bit of construction machinery failed, causing a fire which led to the explosion. Rezukhin commented that it was the fault of the workers doing poor work, a statement Ungern agreed with."

So, under the command of Boris Rezukhin, a battalion was sent out from Urga up north to the location. After travelling and searching for a few days, they eventually found it. A large complex of gers of all sizes, surrounded by a quickly put up wooden fence. Patrols of men armed with rifles and wearing MAN symbols on their caps travelled around the complex every few minutes. It is clear that the camp is struggling to keep together, following the failure of their now third revolution. After surrounding the camp, Rezukhin moved his troops in, and took the complex. There was a small firefight, but nothing major; it seems most of their actual fighting soldiers died during the revolution. Rezukhin rounded up everyone else that was left, primarily older men or women, and either shot them there or took them in for questioning. After going through all the papers in the gers, the locations of multiple, smaller MAN cells were discovered, as well as some of their future plans which included a plan to assassinate Ungern-Sternberg. After getting all the decent information out of the area, Rezukhin burned the complex to the ground, and brought back his prisoners for questioning through out secret police."

After refusing to cede their land to the government, the newly created Mongolian Revolutionary Army were sent in, under the leadership of Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. After approaching the princes lands once again, the princes guard stood firm, and refused to allow the MRA in. Dogsom said that they had the choice now to either surrender now or face death. Though a handful of guards put down their arms and were let go, the vast majority stood their ground and refused to move. With that, Dogsom gave the command to open fire. The princes guard put up a strong fight, but they were eventually beaten by the MRA. The few that remained surrendered and were arrested, as were the princes whose troops they were."

Their disgusting ideology seeks to replace true virtue, harmony, and divinity with false truths and hollow lies that do nothing but fill the heads of the arats with fantasy and false hope. The putrid head of this infestation has been the ever elusive Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav, leader of the MAN’s Totalist wing and chief orchestrator of numerous terrorist attacks against monasteries and lamas during the failed revolutions of 1921 and 1924. \n\nWith these horrific crimes still in recent memory, and with the location of his hideout being recently revealed to our agents, we have moved to imprison Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav and slaughter the lot of his compatriots. Never again shall the siren’s call of Socialism pollute the minds of the Mongolian people, for their blinding ideology is nothing but a wall blocking all true Buddhists from Nirvana."

Two of the most prominent and beloved khiid complexes to be demolished was the Gandantegchinlen Monastery and Danzandarjaa Monastery, two sprawling monastic complexes in Outer Mongolia’s Northern expanses. By funding the restoration and reconstruction of these centers of the Buddhist faith, along with others across the nation, we shall finally cleanse the dark marks left behind by the foul Socialists and their violent, bloodthirsty uprisings. Monasteries and the clergy across Mongolia shall receive greater funding, new statues and artwork of Avalokiteśvara, the Buddha, Mahakala, and other Buddhist gods shall be erected across Mongolia and within these restored sites, and new stupas and temples will be built in excess to spread across the Steppe in its entirety. All Mongolian’s will have access to Buddhist holy sites, and all non-Buddhist will simply have to convert to enjoy the benefits these sites shall offer, or simply wallow in their heretical foolishness."

Heavenly perfection of the temporary realm is a fickle and nigh-impossible ideal to achieve, and yet the pious zealots of our theocratic state under the spiritual guidance of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu have achieved it, or so they claim. True Nirvana and oneness with the universe, pure enlightenment in all its forms, a new mode of spiritual and physical existence - all gifts claimed to be within reach for Mongolia if only we just reach out now and take it. Shambhala - heaven on Earth - is calling to us, and we must answer the call. Under the Buddistuudyn Zövlöl and the Bogd Khan, Mongolia has let slip the Earthly tethers that once shackled us to this corrupt planet and have graced Samsara itself.

Standing at over 7 foot 9 inches, or 2.36 meters, tall, Gongor was by far the largest Mongolian seen in centuries. Born around 1885 as the third child of a nomadic herder, the rumors of his size caught the attention of the Bogd Khan, and he was invited to the princely court and made into a honorary noble at the Bogd Khan’s court, Öndör Gongor was always one of the most standout faces in the Khan’s court. In his prime, he served as the keeper to the Khan’s elephants, his bodyguard, a semi-professional wrestler, and even as a diplomat and toll-office worker, all in service of his liege. Marrying a noble seamstress after following a prophecy of fate as dictated by the Khan, Öndör Gongor lived happily in service of the Mongolian state until his recent tragic death. \n\nLong suffering from gigantism and the slew of health defects and deformities the condition can cause, Gongor passed away in his sleep just a few days ago. The state has put on a lavish funeral for their beloved Mongolian Giant, and the nation mourns for this tragic loss of a truly gentle soul."

However, today we take note of his naturalist and exploratory efforts in which he worked in tandem with famed American archeologist Roy Chapman Anders over the course of the mid 20’s. Finally, after much delay, Andrews has published his notes on Damdinbazar’s adventures and of his own treks throughout Mongolia in a new book, ‘On the Trail of Ancient Man: A Narrative of the Field War of the Central Asiatic Expeditions’. \n\nReleased to critical acclaim and high sales both throughout Mongolia and within the lands of the Americans, the journal has everything from in-depth observational studies on local animal life of the Mongolia steppe to deep narrative recordings of local Tibetan monk oral histories, with so much more lying within its pages. \Though this tome mentions many odd wonders and mystifying phenomena that Damdinbazar and Andrews saw in their travels, one specific passage has left readers from Urga to Washington gasping in wonder. The particular passage of note describes a beast that resides in the Gobi Desert, slinking beneath the great dunes of that accursed hellscape. Described by Andrews in the novel, supposedly quoting Damdinbazar directly as being ‘...shaped like a sausage about two feet long, has no head nor leg and it is so poisonous that merely to touch it means instant death. It lives in the most desolate parts of the Gobi Desert.' This account has left many readers reeling, with many more seeking to take a trip to the wild Gobi just to catch a glimpse of this living cryptid alive. Though many local nomadic tribes and old explorers may know better to believe these myths, with many believing these supposed ‘Death Worm sightings’ is no more than delirious, water-deprived explorers running scared from sand boas, this has not deterred this myth from spreading like wildfire. From the sands of the Gobi to the hustle and bustle of New York City, all will now know the great and legendary beast that is the ‘Mongolian Death Worm,’ and though that, all who did not once pay attention to Mongolia certainly do now!

What formerly stood here as a colonial settlement of Han Chinese settlers now only existed as a pile of embers and rubble, blood stained and abandoned by all. The center square of the town, once alive with the energy of life, now sat vacant and quiet, save for the cawing of crows that feasted on the scattered remains of this settlement’s former inhabitants. The streets, once busy and packed with caravans and trade stalls, were now filled with towering horrors that spilled a pungent, almost toxic miasma into the air that could bring even the most steeled soldier to their knees, eyes watering and retching. Not beast or being, these decaying, half-burned mounds of flesh and viscera are all that remains of those who once lived here - hastily constructed failed funeral pyres extinguished before reaching full burn, with their fuel melting together and now left to rot in the Mongolian sun as the vultures of the Steppe pick these bones for scraps. Erected by the perpetrators of this horrific attack, their sight and stench now serve as a warning to all who dare enter these lands who are not of Mongolian blood, for these lands belong to Ja Lama now. \n\nOnce a shining example of Chinese colonialism, this smoldering ruin is now nothing more than a black stain the Steppe - a lasting symbol of retribution and pure, unmitigated hatred that shall be repeated a hundred times across Mongolia and more as Ja Lama and his hordes continue their purification crusade across the Steppe.

Combining elements of Mongolian shamanism, Tengrism, Gelug Buddhism, Eastern Orthodoxy, archaic Altaic prehistorical belief systems, and many other lesser sources, Ak Jang could potentially be the one true faith to unify the Mongolic peoples. \n\nStriving for the Dzungari Ideal and preaching that a legendary heir of Amursana shall ride forth to save and enlighten the Mongolic people, the religion has already been co-opted by our ruling regime as a way to legitimize Ja Lama’s rule. Our Khan supposedly even fancies himself as this promised hero, and has reportedly begun spreading this idea around himself as some sort of prophet of ‘Ak-Burkhan', the main deity of the White Faith, with the aid of his loyal clergymen and shamans who follow his every command as if he were a god himself.

Though Urga still served as the capital of Mongolia and the seat of its government, across the Steppe to the West in Khovd is where the heart of Ja Lama’s domain truly lied. Since his rescuing of the city from its former Han overlords, Ja Lama has spent the last decade and a half or more slowly transforming the once meager settlement of Khovd into his personal fortress. \n\nThe city, once a tiny nomadic village, is now surrounded by barbed wire and tall, jagged fences and walls that keep both enemies out and its occupants within. Each post connecting the interlock wall sections is adorned with the severed head or dismembered limbs of those foolish to ride against the new Khan, and each surface is adorned with the hides of Mongolia’s foes - their skins stretched taught and strained to cover the exposed surfaces of the perimeter walls like goat skin over a drum. Past these flesh-covered metal and wooden barricades lies a sea of gers and yurts, small hovels, and a few larger permanent structures dotted across the expanse of tents like a small archipelago amid a sea of lean-tos and nomadic structures. \n\nIn the center of this sprawl stands the central fortress of Ja Lama himself - a large, walled and equally grotesquely decorated compound where Ja Lama’s personal ger stood as well as the homes of those closest to him in his retinue. In his massive central tent, adorned with the draped and dried skins of hundreds of his foes, dozens of concubines lavished their liege and pranced about as Ja Lama sat and smoked opium in front of the fire. The walls of his ger were adorned with the pelts, skins, and trophies of his most favored prey, man or beast, as well as his large collection of weapons and firearms. In any available open floor space, piles of plunder and treasure sat stacked in meter-high mounds, and smoke from his hearth and his opium pipe filled the room with a smoky haze. This central home stood as the black heart of Ja Lama’s khanate, and from this grisly decorated hold, he rules over all Mongolia."

mon.450.d:0 "The origins and particulars of Ja Lama have long been shrouded in mystery, largely due to the great effort he goes to in order to obscure his true nature and identity. Across Mongolia and East Asia, reports claim that the man once called Dambijantsan was born in China, either Inner or Outer Mongolia, Kalmykia, or even Shambhala itself, with Ja Lama never giving a solid and consistent answer. How he came to be revealed as a tulku and who elevated him to the position of Lama has never been solidly deduced, and even particulars about when either he or his son were born continue to elude both his allies and the wider public. As always, Ja Lama proves to be an unsolvable enigma, and yet now rules all of Mongolia, for better or for worse. \n\nMysteries about his origins are not the only questions or doubts that have been raised against this living folktale, for this legend among men also claims to hold a myriad of powers and abilities. A fierce practitioner of ‘gun magic’, it is said that Ja Lama could cure the ailment of any many by simply focusing on the disease and firing his trusty rifle in the patient’s general direction. Additionally, he has been reported to carve Tibetan letters and runes into his bullets, granting them divine accuracy and magical properties unfathomable to an ordinary human mind. On top of his dabbling in the arts of gun magic, it is said he is immune to bullets, able to read minds, invincible and invulnerable to any Earthly force, ageless and timeless without withering or decay, and able to conjure the powers and abilities of the Buddhist deity Mahakala itself - these fantastical abilities are just a few of the powers and magics ever-ready and at the disposal of the great Ja Lama, or so he and his supporters vehemently claim. These powerful abilities make Ja Lama a practical legend and demigod in the eyes of many, while to others he just comes across as a conman or a lying fool. However, these naysayers are never around or loud for long about their complaints or doubts, for the eyes and ears of Ja Lama are everywhere, and none shall doubt his powers! And who are they to doubt these clearly true claims? These tales, bizarre as they may seem, when told by the light of a campfire, deep in the Gobi eighty miles from any other human beings, are not so easily dismissed, and they are all the more undeniable when one of Ja Lama’s men has a rifle aimed square in the eye."

In the 18th century, Amursana was an Oirat taishi, or prince, who led a righteous revolt against the Qing in hopes of freeing the Mongolic peoples of Dzungaria and Altishahr. Instead of victory however, Amursana was cut down and his people, our people, were slaughtered en masse in what has since been called the Dzungar Genocide. Since this fatal loss, the Chinese have subjugated and oppressed our people, and now centuries have passed under this harsh reality. \n\nWith the ascendance of Ja Lama however, all that can finally change. As the reincarnation and blood descendent of Amursana, many in our nation are confident that he is the prince that has been promised in prophecy and White Faith, and Ja Lama uses this faith to his advantage as he rules over all of Mongolia. It is not known if he truly is what he says he is, or if he even truly believes it himself, but he has gone so far as to name his own son after the famed hero, and has seemingly dedicated his entire life to living in Amursana’s image. Whatever the case or reality may be, Ja Lama is the closest thing we have to the fabled last hero of the Oirats, and under his guidance, maybe the Mongolic peoples can finally be truly free."

With his power proving supreme over all others in Mongolia and from his elevated position in the spiritual hierarchy of our Buddhist church, Ja Lama has revealed to the people of Mongolia his ‘true’ identity. Claiming to be the physical embodiment and avatar of Mahākāla, the Buddhist God of Time, Maya, Creation, Destruction, and Power, Ja Lama has heralded the revival of the Dzungar Khanate and declared that Mongolia shall be the heartland of a newly restored Oirat nation. With this declaration, he has recited to his nation in a national broadcast a poem he wrote of such an event: \n\n’I am a mendicant monk from the Russian Tsar's kingdom, but I am born of the great Mongols. My herds are on the Volga river, my water source is the Irtysh. There are many hero warriors with me. I have many riches. Now I have come to meet with you beggars, you remnants of the Oirats, in the time when the war for power begins. Will you support the enemy? My homeland is Altai, Irtysh, Khobuk-sari, Emil, Bortala, Ili, and Alatai. This is the Oirat mother country. By descent, I am the great-grandson of Amursana, the reincarnation of Mahākāla, owning the horse Maralbashi. I am he whom they call the hero Dambijantsan. I came to move my pastures back to my own land, to collect my subject households and bondservants, to give favour, and to move freely. \n\nWith these words, Ja Lama, Avatar of Mahakala and Heir to Amursana, has declared war against modernity and time itself, for from the pages of history and myth and into reality he has revived the dreams of a free Oirat nation. May all the enemies of the Mongolic peoples live in fear and horror, for the God of the Steppe is coming for all who still infect our rightful lands and oppress our kin."

mon.454.t:0 "The Warrior ‘Tulku’"
mon.454.d:0 "The man once commonly called Dambijantsan has long gone by the title Ja Lama, the warrior tulku and reincarnating holyman. However, none have ever been able to verify where or when he acquired this title and how he came to learn he was a true tulku, or reincarnating custodian of a pure Buddhist soul. Supposedly raised and taught by a lower lama as a boy and raised in the Gelug school long before coming to Mongolia, Ja Lama is the claimed reincarnation of Amursana - a fact never substantiated in any official capacity by other tulkus or priests. Though his claims are wild, this does not mean he is a mere pretender. Real tulku or not, few in Mongolia are as pious and devoted to their faith as Ja Lama, who serves as a champion for both pure Gelug Buddhism and the White Faith."

mon.455.d:0 "With a thundering stampede, Ja Lama and his riders took off across the Southern border of our lands and rode into the lands of the Han. Once more, these dark riders would dive deep into the heartlands of the Chinese and further spread hell amidst their ranks. \n\nAfter a two hour ride, the horde found themselves their target: a small farming village nestled into the hillside, standing defenceless and unaware of the coming chaos. In a flash, Ja Lama’s retinue descended upon the settlement, and after a bloody cacophony of horrific screams and clashing steel, yet another Gamin village fell to the might of Ja Lama. With their soldiers, some still barely alive, skinned and flayed as their bodies were dismembered and refigured into grotesque shapes and effigies, the stench of death began to spread throughout the still-burning ruins. While some soldiers continued to make their grisly art of flesh and tissue, others raided the few structures left standing and salvaged them for all valuables and plunder. Like vultures or jackals picking over a carcass, Ja Lama’s men ripped through every last pile of debris and corpses, looting anything of value and claiming the skins of the most ferocious enemy combatants. \n\nAfter their haul was complete and their loot sacks filled, these dark riders took flight once more across the prairie back to the lands of their own, carrying with them the next round of plunder that would fuel Mongolia’s economy and desires until the next round of riders returned. Like clockwork, hordes under Ja Lama’s command repeated this horrific routine, day in and day out, carrying with them the future of Mongolia with each haul. "

The people of Mongolia no longer need a beacon to rally behind, for they now have Ja Lama to guide them. The always independent and stubborn Bogd Gegen must be silenced so that Ja Lama’s hold over all of Mongolia can be complete, but to kill a god is no easy task. \n\nIn the quiet of night, agents of Ja Lama shall poison the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu in his sleep, and with this act, their final plan to secure Mongolia’s future shall be put into motion. With the old fool out of the way, all attention shall be diverted to finding his reincarnated replacement, the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. Once this infant is found, Ja Lama and his retinue seek to mold the child to their own will and ideas, effectively puppeting the spiritual leader of Mongolia and their people’s one true link to the gods. This child shall be indoctrinated in both the ideas of Gelug Buddhism and the White Faith, cementing our new religion’s importance within Mongolian society and granting it divine legitimacy from our link to the Buddha himself. None in Mongolia may learn of the true and dark deeds we will have committed to get us to this moment though, so utmost secrecy must be assured. Any and all who let slip a single word of this plan shall be put to death with absolute urgency, for the spiritual future of all Mongolia now hangs in the balance, for Ja Lama and his regime shall now kill a god."
mon.456.a:0 "With this act, we must begin the search for his replacement, so that we may influence him from the start."

mon.4560.t:0 "A Dog’s Bark is Worse than his Bite"
mon.4560.d:0 "When not out slaughtering the enemies of Mongolia and crushing the Gamin parasites under his boot at the barrel of a gun, Ja Lama is a much different man. Inside the confines of his own domain, among the people he works so hard to protect, the hard facade of a crazed killer melts away. A fan of leisure and of relaxation, he is frequently spotted near swimming holes or in eateries, relaxing the day away as he enjoys the fineries of life. Smoking opium has long been a passtime of his, but so has volunteering for the local Buddhist monasteries and entertaining the local children while their parents work their fields or earn their livings. This stark dichotomy shocks many who do not know the true nature of Ja Lama. Though he may be a bloodthirsty warlord who flays his enemies alive, he does so for the good of his people. If it were not for these human connections he keeps with his own kin and countrymen, he would be nothing but a beast."

Like Amursana before him, Ja Lama has led the Mongolic people to throw off their shackles. Under our Khan, our people have been liberated and our enemies, the vile Qing, have been destroyed and forever cast from our lands. The Dzungar Genocide has been avenged and now our people can roam the Steppe peacefully as their ancestors once did, without fear of death or foreign encroachment. \n\nNow that our new Khanate has risen from the ashes and this pastoralist ideal has been returned to our lands, we must decide on a new banner for our resurgent horde, and before us we have a few options."

mongolia.10300.d:0 "Following the failed Revolutions of 1921 and 1924 against the Mad Baron, the MAN Socialists were largely forced to flee, hide, or face the wrath of Ungern-Sternberg’s purges. Numerous major party officials and innocents were brought before the sword, including the main figure of the First Seven and Father of Mongolian Socialism Damdin Sükhbaatar, who was the leading theorist among the MAN’s seven original founders. After shepherding Damdin’s widow and son into safety in exile, Choibalson began to wage a guerilla campaign against the Mad Baron, but alone and disconnected from his comrades, he began to lose faith in the Revolution. However, as he waged his personal war against the Mad Baron, he came to find an unlikely ally in Ja Lama, who was waging his own war against Ungern in Mongolia’s western frontier. \n\nTogether, they forged an uneasy and opportunistic alliance as Choibalson put his experience as a revolutionary to good use in his new life as a bandit. Eventually falling prey to his own hedonistic vices such as drinking, gambling, and whoring, Choibalson transformed from a once-proud Communist and true freedom fighter into the violent and cold-hearted lead lieutenant of Ja Lama’s armed forces. Despite all this, Choibalson still holds onto a small sliver of his former Communist and anti-theist ways, resisting the notion that Ja Lama is truly the reincarnation of Amursana and implementing his own fusion of conservative Socialism within his nomadic camp. Despite these deviations from Ja Lama’s rhetoric, Choibalson’s position is safe, for without his military expertise and the respect he commands among our armed forces, Ja Lama would rapidly find himself without the authority needed to backup his ludicrous ideas."

mongolia.1231.d:0 "With the Steppe secure and Mongolia now stabilized under our rightful regime, we must now decide on what our position towards the outer world shall be, outside of possible alliances and economic ties. Before us lies three major camps, each supporting a different plan. Most support the simple and widely-lauded plan of only uniting the Mongolic peoples as a whole, pursuing the Pan-Mongolian dream of uniting all Mongols, Altais, Oirats, Yakuts, Buryats and more under one banner, while focusing on these ancestral lands and our own kin alone. One of the groups opposing them are a disconnected group curiously made of both honest Sinophiles and virulent Sinophobes, with the Sinophiles wishing to unite all of China so that the Five Races can be equal and as one at long last, bringing peace to the Steppe and the Middle Kingdom for the first time in centuries, while their temporary allies the Sinophobes instead hope to conquer China so that they may violently usher in a new future free from any and all Chinese sources of influence, so that the Mongolian people can finally dominate the Far East as we rightfully should, or so they say. The other group opposing them are more united, largely made up of more traditionalist elements that seek to instead focus on Turko-Mongol unity, expanding the Pan-Mongolic ideal to extend to our Turkic cousins across Central Asia as well.

It is the destiny of China and the Han people to not only subjugate these lands, but to completely and utterly erase every last facet of the Mongol identity from existence. Our pure race is in a perfect position to be able to do this necessary act, and we have just the way to do so without bloodshed. Copying a tactic of the Chinese people that has persisted for centuries, we shall use our massive numbers to our advantage by genetically assimilating the Mongol race. \n\nThrough a series of forced sterilizations, state-enforced miscegenation quotas, population fracturing, and other forms of population control, we shall totally Sinify the Mongolian people, wiping not only their culture, but their very genes from this planet and replacing it with the pure, righteous Han Chinese identity. ‘Mongolia’ as a concept will be a thing of the past within a few short generations as we make the Steppe truly Chinese."

The various nomads and riders of the Steppe and the Gobi have been conscripted to form elite Kheshig cavalry divisions centered around protecting the leaders and generals of the Anfu Club in the heat of battle, while also serving as an elite fast-attack strikeforce and vanguard brigade. Complementing these noble riders and joining them in battle are the numerous masses of arats, or Mongolian peasants, that shall stand together as barely organized rabble serving as a meatshield against the Chinese hordes we are sure to face on the march to Beijing. Though many of these poor, innocent farmers and herders will be brutally cut down, joining the river of blood that flows along these plains with every battle, but so too shall the blood of our enemies join the mix.

That question of course being what to do in regards to the spiritual lives of the Mongolian people. While of course our own colonization efforts have indeed begun to bring the light of Christ and His most holy bride the Church to these forsaken lands, those who adhere to the One True Faith still make up a tiny fraction our total population.\n\nThis being the case, an intense debate has broken out within the halls of power on just what to do with in this regard. On one side lies the more hardline within our administration. They wish to see Mongolia turned into a truly Christian land, free from the stain of paganism. They plan to accomplish this viva the use of both increased missionary work and the use of force. One such target of force would be the Bogh Khan, he would be forced to either convert or meet his maker.\n\nThe other side of this debate lies those who wish for a more moderate approach. While they agree that Mongolia must be an Orthodox Christian nation, they believe that only by working with the local religion, the local myths, can we hope to truly bring Mongolia into the faith. While this method would indeed bring about a unique form of Mongolian Orthodoxy, it would also take much longer, a downside none can refute.\n\nBesides these two options, another does in fact exist.

Often depicted as having seven eyes, with two normal eyes, one on the forehead, and one more on each of her hands and feet, this all-seeing goddess of infinite wisdom and compassion is seen to embody the very essence of a true Russian ruler, with the tradition starting in 1764 under the rule of Catherine the Great.

While this is done, the second plan calls for the laity of Mongolia to abandon the Qudum Mongγol Bičig as well and replace it with a Cyrillic-based alphabetic transliteration of Mongolian.

There are four main cliques that dominate Mongolian political society.\n\nThe Rossiyskaya Voyennaya Klika are a clique of White Russian officers under the leadership of Ungern-Sternberg. They focus on cooperation with Russia, military strength and anti-socialism. They currently lead the country, working with the Yazguurtnuudyn Zövlöl and the Buddistuudyn Zövlöl.\nThe Yazguurtnuudyn Zövlöl is the name of the hierarchy of Mongolian princes and nobles, who had been the ruling class of the country for centuries. Focusing on keeping their wealth and power secure, they are larelgely led by the Inner Mongolian Prince Demchugdongrub, who leads a  domineering and ambitious group of Inner Mongolian Princes centered around the region of Xilingol.\nThe Buddistuudyn Zövlöl are a council of high ranking buddhists lamas, tulkus, and monks in Mongolia, which was formed following Ungern’s purge of lamas in 1930. Many members of the council are fanatic buddhists, who wish to turn Mongolia into a truly theocratic society under the Bogd Khan. They are led by the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, a high ranking lama from Inner Mongolia.\nThe Mongol Ardyn Nam, the socialist party who rebelled in 1921 and 1924 remain in hiding, but are still a strong force to be reckoned with. Led by Soliin Danzan and receiving aid from various other Mongolian democratic parties and even the famed Gada Meiren, they have taken some inspiration from Russia and Chinese democratic regimes, and therefore have begun advocating for multiparty democracy under their control.\n\nAside from these main political cliques, the bandit lord and warrior tulku Ja Lama rules from his bandit fortress in Khovd, seeking to restore ancient glories and vengeance against the Chinese. Foreigners besiege our Khanate as well, for the Soyombo Revival Society has once again begun to rise to national prominence, advocating for the transformation of Mongolia into a Russian colonial satellite. Their main opposition comes in the form of the Anfu Club, remnants of the disgraced Anhui Clique that fled to Mongolia following the disastrous Northern Expedition and now seek to use Mongolia as the launching point of their crusade to Beijing. \n\nAs if our inner-politics could not get more hectic, Mongolia also faces many external threats. For many years, border skirmishes have taken place between the Muslim Chinese Ma Clique and Mongolian troops across the border. A similar situation is taking place in the Dzungaria region of the Xinjiang Clique. The main point of tension is the province of Yushu, which has swapped hands between Tibet and the Ma Clique over the past few years. The province is a powderkeg waiting to explode, and when it does, the opportunity to unite the Mongolian people cannot be ignored.

mon.658.d:0 "In Medieval Europe, one of the most popular folktales of the Saints was that of Barlaam and Josaphat. In the short, the legend tells the story of an Indian prince who, despite his father's hatred and persecution of the Christian faith, ends up converting thanks to the wise guidance of the mystic Barlaam, a hermit. After a time, his father also converts to the Christian religion, after which he abdicates the throne to Josaphat to live as a hermit. Josaphat, like his father before him, abdicates the throne and goes on to live a life of piety, performing miracles and converting souls with his teacher Barlaam before his death.\n\nTo modern scholars, especially those who study Buddhism, the story of Barlaam and Josaphat is little more then a 'baptism' of one of the many stories regarding the Buddha and his life. While this fact is usually of little consequence, with our government beginning to sponsor the Orthodox Church within Mongolia, many wonder if this ancient story could become a boon to our attempts at converting this land.\n\nThose who support using the legend for our own benefit fall into two camps. The first, made up mostly of the rank and file of the OVS, believe we should use our new found connections with the Church to have Saint Josaphat be formally declared both the Patron of Mongolia.  But more then that, declare he is the actual Buddha, and that stories that he was the founder of Buddhism are later fabrications. While such an action would require quite a bit of push on our end for the Church to agree to it, it would also greatly increase our efforts at converting Mongolia.\n\n The second camp, mostly made up of die-hard loyalists of the Mad Baron, call for a much more radical approach. This second camp wishes for us to in essence fully embrace the idea that Josaphat is Buddha, but not in an Orthodox context. Instead, they wish for us to slowly start phasing out use of Buddha from the Mongolian mind, replaced with St. Josaphat. By doing this, they believe, we will slowly the complete synchronization of Buddhism and Orthodox Christianity. While such a proposal is obviously abhorrent to any true Christian, to the followers of the Mad Baron, it is simply recognizing the truth of Divinity present in all forms of Religion.\n\nWhile both ideas are radical in their own right, [MON.GetLeader] could simply elect to ignore them. After all, would need do we have for causing even more religious unrest?"

Now finally cracking under these disagreements over foreign policy, national identity, and theory, the Radical MAN coalition led by Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav and Ulanhu has finally split, reaching an impasse over whether to align with the Socialist movements in Russia or in China, with Ulanhu supporting the KMT while Luvsansharav supports the decrees put forth by Lenin and his loyal Bolsheviks. However, the wider coalition is incredibly split over this decision, with violence and secret purges being carried out to sway positions, causing the deaths of prominent Socialists such as Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. There is a high likelihood that the coalition could reach a deadlock over the decision, possibly giving the Syndicalist minority or some other force a chance to finally rise to save the Revolution, for there are whispers that Nadmid of Clan Mültütü, better known by his nicknames Lou yada or Gada Meiren, has begun to ride once again.

Aided in open secret by operatives from the Internationale commanded by Peljidiin Genden, inspired by Proudhounist ideas, Market Syndicalism, and the rhetoric of Léon Jouhaux, and backed by a grassroots Ecological Syndicalist movement inspired by the Proletkultists in Russia led by unionist and author Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj, the Syndicalist wing is incredibly diverse and filled with many extremists and violent radicals turned moderates and liberals like Genden himself, but are dedicated to bringing a more ‘civilized’ and modern Revolution to Mongolia in opposition to the barbarity of the fallen Communists. \n\nHowever, riding in opposition to both the violent Communists and these foreign-backed and funded Syndicalists is Gada Meiren himself - the savior of Mongolia and bandit king that cut down the tyrant Ungern-Sternberg not long ago. Nadmid of Clan Mültütü, as he is truly known, and his horde, backed by the surviving democratic elements of the MAN under Anadyn Amar, Ard Ayush, and Soliin Danzan, as well as by the Bogd Khan, now ride to Ulaanbaatar in an attempt to save Mongolia from foreign ideals and to protect our native, millenia-old nomadic traditions.

In traditional Mongolian culture, there has always been a code of honor when it comes to executions. To spill the blood of another Mongol was seen as dishonorable, for both the executioner and his victim, and as such, only foreigners were executed in such brutish ways. \n\nThe honorable way to execute a fellow Mongol was called ‘death by immurement’, meaning to seal the guilty away in a tight area such as a small room, cave, or small vessel such as a steel or wooden coffin, unable to move much, if at all, and subjected to the whims of their warden. Some were fed through a slit, with the brief seconds of sunlight coming in through the opening being the only sun they would see for days or weeks, and able to survive a terrible life for however long their minds or their bodies could endure it, or however long their captors felt like letting them live. Others would have a far more brief, but infinitely more agonizing experience, left in tight boxes in the most desolate and exposed areas of the great Gobi, only to quickly roast alive during the day or to freeze to death inside their sarcophagi under the harsh and variable weather of our desert, unless of course starvation, dehydration, predators, or the shear stress of it all killed you first. \n\nHowever, we could award this traitor no honorable death, and instead kill him in any number of traditional ways fit for slaying foreigners unfitting of our mercy and respect.

For years he has led Ja Lama’s hordes as his chief general, but with the rise of true Mongolian Communism, Choibalsan has been thrown into mental anguish, drinking himself into a stupor and exclaiming to all that he is the true savior of Mongolia and the Revolution. \n\nGreeting his old comrade on the plains outside the city, Luvsansharav agreed to the duel before both mounted their steeds, drew their traditional sabors, and charged headlong at each other in a showing of traditionalist brutality. Despite his reputation for meekness and cowardice,  Luvsansharav charged the drunken Choibalsan - once esteemed as one of Mongolia’s greatest warriors - and quickly cut him down from his steed in one fell swoop. The upper half of Choibalsan’s torso fell to the ground with a stunned, confused, and tragic look upon his dying face as Luvsansharav wiped the blood from his blade and sheathed it. After years of betrayal, the traitorous son of the MAN and the former Father of the Mongolian Revolution has been cut down by the true herald of this new People’s Republic. All hail Luvsansharav!"

However, much to our frustration, he is nowhere to be found. It would seem that those spineless moderates still loyal to him gave him warning of our impending rise, for he has been smuggled out of Ulaanbaatar, formerly Urga, and now lives on the run. Though rumors that the infamous Gada Meiren, the nomadic bandit warlord who cut off the head of the Mad Baron, aided in the Bogdo Lama’s escape and now protects the disgraced ‘king’ strike fear into the hearts of our more cowardly men, Luvsansharav fears no man, announcing to all that Gada Meiren and the former Bogd Khan will be caught and brought to justice no matter the cost."

Dominated by Anandyn Amar, Ard Ayush, Dogsomyn Bodoo, and their hand-selected clique of loyal liberal Socialists and Mongolian patriots, this Crimson Khuraldai is responsible for managing and overseeing the disorganized web of mobile yurt cities, livestock and horse herds, and nomadic Arat collectives, communes, and cooperatives that now make up the majority of our traditionalist economy built vaguely on Socialism. Anarchist and Democratic in nature, this economy built on distributism, cooperation, and barter is a Socialist form of the ancient Mongolian empire, ensuring that we never stray from our cultural roots. Promoting the health of the people and our natural environment over industrial pursuits and heavily pastoral, agrarian, and nomadic in nature, this unique form of Arat-focused pseudo-Anarchism under the Crimson Muqali Anandyn Amar is form-fit to suit the needs of Mongolia’s new Revolution."

Their target was a group of reactionary bandits and rebels that have been reported to be harassing the local nomadic Arat herders and communalized craftsmen, stealing their tithes meant for the central Crimson Khuraldai. Riding into the bandit camp after hours of riding and under the dead of night, the last thing their victims heard was the thunderous stampede of an approaching horde, the twang of arrows being loosed, the clattering of sabors being drawn, and the fire of jezzails and rifles. Before any of the bandits could even climb up out of their gers and yurts or up from their drunken hazes by campfire light, they were all cut down without remorse.

Fusing shamanstic schools with ideas from the White Faith, from Tengrism, and from Gelug Buddhism, the two have created a new faith for all true sons and daughters of the Great Khan to embrace. Led by these two titanic figures and backed up by the Liberal Socialist and semi-Anarchist government of Anandyn Amar, Ard Ayush, Dogsomyn Bodoo, and Soliin Danzan in order to format it for our new vaguely Socialist reality, this new faith will unite the people and our arats, or nomadic peasantry that make up about 95% of the population, like ever before, and all those that oppose it shall be marked as false Mongols and Gamin parasites."

With Choibalson’s unfortunate death at the hands of Luvsansharav, Bumstend - with his Socialist record still carrying some weight - was offered a choice by Gada Meiren himself: join or die. \n\nSmartly, Bumstend loyally returned to the Party, largely convinced by our new position of Socialist religious syncretism and by Gada Meiren’s threat.

However, after falling in love with our culture, way of life, and new syncretic religion as he lives like a nomadic peasant in our beautiful and tranquil pastoral paradise out on the Steppe, he has often hinted at his desire to stay here within Gada Meiren’s clique. Should we grant him a place within the Great Red Khural and allow his and his father’s brand of Esoteric Buddhist Leninism to begin to influence the state’s new syncretic religion and the identity of our horde, or is it more wise to let George and his family of odd geniuses to merely go on with their globetrotting adventures untethered?"

As he and his forces remove the Chinese filth and the scars they have left upon our land, our clergymen and monks have been busy proliferating a new syncretic faith to help guide our newly freed people. \n\nBeing called the ‘Red Faith’ by many of its practitioners, this new pantheon is partially based on Gada Meirien’s own shamanistic beliefs mixed with Karma Kagyu Buddhism, Tengri, and even some Socialist principles based on the ideas of the Mongol Ardyn Nam. Though it still pales in comparison to the popularity of pure Gelug Buddhism, this new syncretic religion has already outpaced the vile Chinese belief systems, becoming the second most prominent unified faith in Mongolia."

A beautiful and once-pristine grassland that stretched for hundreds of miles and filled with nomadic idealism has now been turned into a hive of Chinese settlement that scars the land and their massive agricultural initiatives that eat away at the once flowing and unbroken seas of long grass that swayed endlessly in these lands. \n\nNestled at the heart of this flowing grasslands is the once wild and free homeland of Gada Meiren himself, in the village of Jam-Un Tokhui where he was born as Nadmid of the Mültütü clan. Once a small, traditional hub for nomadic clans and Mongolian settlers to live in peace while intertwined with their own culture, now an abomination stands in its place. Massive fields of oats and millet crops now stretch over the once verdant prairie, and where traditional gers and yurts once stood, made from animal skins and timber, now stands large Chinese housing complexes of mortar and stone, imposing and permanent new marks that sully this great paradise that is the Mongolian wilderness. These structures and fields stand as an affront to the very Mongolian way of life! The fools that work these lands are nothing more than mindless parasitic drones raping the natural bounty of our land as they make profit for their masters and breed like vermin in an attempt to suffocate the Monglian people in their own lands. However, with the return of Gada Meiren to his ancestral home, this perversion shall finally be brought to an end. This Banner, once his home, shall be razed to the ground, and by the sword and bow of his riders, every Han settler shall be cut down and laid to rot in the Mongolian sun as their structures are torn to the ground and their fields are burned and salted. Only then shall these rats have finally provided something of use to our people, for their blood and bones shall feed the next generation of grasslands that regrow over this accursed settlement. \n\nOnce this dark but all too necessary deed is complete, Gada Meiren’s horde will ride off to yet another Han encampment and repeat this process once more, until all of the Khorchin plains and all of Mongolia are free and repaid for the hardships we have endured."

mon.459.d:0 "In traditional Buddhist thought, particularly in the ancient Nyingma school that has attracted much interest from Gada Meiren, there exists certain hidden valleys and rifts in this world called Beyuls - physical manifestations of Buddhist purity and Shambhala on Earth in the form of verdant and pure natural paradises tucked away from the world and protected by a powerful guardian deity. Already have examples of these paradises been discovered today, proving the righteousness of our faith. In Tibet, great fissures hidden in the Himalayas like Barun Valley and Puyol offer pristine slices of practical Eden long isolated and preserved from the horrors of Man’s world. In Mongolia itself, similar sites exist in the form of the Ten Sacred Mountains of Mongolia: ten centers of Buddhist serenity and naturalistic purity dotted across the expanse of our nation. However, with Gada Meiren’s efforts to restore the true Mongolian pastoralist ideal and natural beauty that our nation has been blessed with, a new idea has begun to form within the ranks of lamas, other tulkus, and monks within our clergy.\n\nThese zealots have begun to see Gada Meiren himself as a dharmapāla of a newly forming Mongolian Beyul. As the dharmapāla, or a vengeful Buddhist warrior deity of wrath tasked with the protection of holy lands, law, and justice, Gada Meiren is said to be the herald of a new Buddhist golden age in Mongolia. As his war against the foreign forces that plague Mongolia continues and as he spreads both his Red Faith and the established Buddhist schools of Gelug and Nyingma, the Steppe is only made more pure and verdant. Soon, all of Mongolia shall be one large and protected Beyul, with Gada Meiren as its holy guardian."

Though it is largely unknown if our hero holds any of these egalitarian and Socialist views himself, it is widely known that he at least is a true champion of the Mongolian people and seeks to see all his people prosper, and this uncertainty has not stopped the MAN from pushing this agenda to the wider nation. \n\nLabeling it as a form of ‘Red Nomadism’, the Mongol Ardyn Nam have begun to influence the younger generations of nomads and riders that still roam the Steppe and the wider Mongolian wilderness. Fusing traditional Mongolia ideals and culture with modern Socialist views, this new strain resembles some Western ideas of anarchism or communalism, without much of the useless theory that has gone into those less forms of living. Our nomadic and commune-like society is not born out of mere fantasy or the ideas of pampered Western nobles - it is instead forged in our own histories and experiences; a proven legacy that has endured for millenia and a way of life that has endured while lesser civilizations have been lost to history. \n\nThese ideas have already become immensely popular with many of the young soldiers that have fallen in with Gada Meiren’s horde, and as he spreads purity across Mongolia, so too does he spread this new school of thought, whether he means to or not. Red Nomadism is the only true future for Mongolia, and Gada Meiren will be the instrument of its proliferation."

Another hero of the Mongolian people patrols the Korchin grasslands, laying waste to both Russian colonists and Han settlers alike in a holy and righteous crusade against imperialism. However, unlike Gada Meiren, a man of low-birth and humble beginnings, his counterpart is no mere nomad or peasant. \n\n Yangsanjab, Prince Öndür, Favored Son of the Borjigin Clan, and Descendant of Hasar, brother of Temüjin himself, is one of the most honored and revered nobles in all of Mongolia. Even before taking up his current exploits, he has been held in high regards by both the former Qing lords that oppressed Mongolia’s people and the Mongolia people themselves, who have long viewed Yangsanjab as one of the more honorable princes in the Yazguurtnuudyn Zövlöl. This adoration is both due to his own heroic and noble actions and his high spiritual significance, being a disciple of the Janggiya Khutuktu and a close friend of the 9th Panchen Lama, and as such has risen to be a popular face of the Mongolian nobility. Now, this high level of reverence has been even further elevated, for this proud noble has proven himself time and time again to be a true ally of the Mongolian people, for like Gada Meiren, Yangsanjab has led his own horde of freedom fighters and insurgents against the Han and Russian colonialists, serving valiantly in the wider flight to uproot this foreign presence in Mongolia for good. \n\nThough in theory, these two forces would be opposed to one another, at least ideologically, for one stands as a rich and proud noble while the other stands as a revolutionary, things could not be further from the truth. Despite these surface level differences, these two forces of nature and Mongolia fury have miraculously become fast friends and comrades, with their hordes frequently coopertting as they mercilessly slaughter the Han and salt their fields for the good of all Mongolians.

Leaving nothing but a short note scrapped on a parchment and stuck to the table with a knife, this spirit of the Steppe has disappeared without a trace. \n\nIn his absence, his instructions to the MAN are clear: Gada Meiren is to stay as the de-facto leader of Mongolia, and as the face of the nation and its government, with his absences being largely kept hidden from the people. In his stead, the MAN is to work with the Bogd Khan to continue his work in purifying and safeguarding Mongolia from any outside threat while working to uplift any and all true Mongolians within our borders. Under this arrangement, the MAN would rule as a sort of shadow-government behind the facade of Gada Meiren’s absolute political authority and under the spiritual and moral guidance of the Bogd Khan. This system shall ensure Mongolia’s continued stability and safety as it progresses towards a truly egalitarian, ‘Red Nomadic’ state. \n\nIn the meantime, as these politicians and monks take the reins of rule, the savior of all Mongolia has returned to the lands of his people in secret, out in the far East of Mongolia’s prairie. Here, he rides with his wife Mudan and their children and the people of their clan in peace, continuing their idealistic life now free of foreign encroachment and banditry. If his people ever need him again, he shall ride forth once more, for he is the Red Niō of Mongolia - its protector and guardian, just as the Niō of legend guard the enlightened Buddha himself. As he rides across the grasslands of his birth once more a free man, may all of Mongolia sing praises of his name, for this Last Son of Khorchin is the true savior of Modern Mongolia, and the greatest Mongol to ride since Genghis Khan himself. Our nation and our people shall forever be in his debt, and may we never be in such a dire position to require his aid again.

Finding the Bogd Khan in his hiding place out on the Steppe and dragging him back to the capital for all to witness, Luvsansharav would execute this supposed demigod and link to the divine with a simple swipe of his sabor. \n\nForcing the most revered tulku to his knees before cleaving his head clean off, Luvsansharav ended the reincarnating line of the Bogdo Lama’s spirit before a crowd of thousands, lifting his bleeding head for all to see. Refusing to search for his next corporeal vessel, this line of Gelug Buddhist lama was finally at an end.

tot_mon_flavor.9.d:0 "Accelerating his consolidation of the state as he progresses to complete democratic centralism under the State Khural and himself, Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav has begun to issue the same decrees Lenin once did during the failed Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Creating a true dictatorship of the Proletariat guided by himself and his vanguard in the radical MAN while purging any and all potential political enemies in a bloodbath to secure the Party and the Revolution, Luvsansharav will stop at nothing to bring Communism with Mongolian Nationalist characteristics to the Steppe. Increasingly totalitarian and pushing for total industrialization, collectivization, urbanization, democratic centralism, militant atheism, and Soviet modernization, Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav is called the Lenin of Mongolia and the New Father of the Revolution by his allies, and the Red Death by his ever-dwindling supply of foes."

tot_mon_flavor.10.d:0 "In order to foster closer ties with out Chinese allies, Ulanhu has moved to allow Chinese immigration and interbreeding, but in a careful form in order to preserve Mongolian culture and identity without letting it get swallowed up by the Chinese wave. We shall build a syncretic Sino-Mongolian identity, culture, and society for all within our state to embrace, supported by our brand of Communism. Families that intermingle between the cultures shall be incentivized and rewarded, and a new cultural program shall begin to spread and popularize this new syncretic national identity. Together, the Pan-Mongolic peoples and the Chinese shall bring a true Communist Revolution to East Asia."

tot_mon_flavor.11.d:0 "Ruling Mongolia like his own Communist fiefdom like he once did in Inner Mongolia during the failed Revolution of the 1920s, Ulanhu holds all of Mongolia in the palm of his hand. Supported by the State Khural and his Red Guard - paramilitaries largely made up of loyal students and peasants frequently of Chinese or Sino-Mongolian descent - Ulanhu is largely free to dictate the direction of the LKMT and Lenin-inspired Revolution he finds himself at the forefront of. Having slain the Bogd Khan in secret after finding him hiding out on the Steppe, Ulanhu has decided to stop the anti-theist purges, for the most part, and has shifted gears. Claiming that the reincarnation of this Bogdo Lama has been confirmed to be a young boy from Inner Mongolia of both Chinese and Mongolian blood, Ulanhu shall be able to effectively dominate and dictate the future of the dwindling Buddhist religion. All in Mongolia and our wider growing People’s Republic shall learn to embrace our sole leader as Communism and Proletarian Paradise come to Mongolia by Ulanhu’s decree."

Serendipitously, his son Chiang Ching-kuo serves with Ulanhu and the Party here in Mongolia, for he has long been a friend of our leader, once sharing a desk with him at their Communist studies in Moscow under Lenin. In order to draw closer to Kai-shek’s new syncretic government, we could raise his son and our loyal minister to be the new face of the MAN as Ulanhu takes a backseat and focuses on our armed forces, or we could simply continue our close relations with the LKMT government under the direction of the Red Son. Who should we choose to lead us into the future of a shared Red China?"

tot_mon_flavor.13.d:0 "Borjgin Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj has risen to lead the Syndicalist wing of the MAN, and as such, this poet and playwright has been free to pursue his own syncretic mixture of pastoral and Buddhist Social-Futurism inspired by Proletkultists Mayakovsky and Lunarcharsky and of Ecologically-focused Syndicalism centered around traditional agrarianism. Pulling on ideas created by the God-Builders and by Mayakovsky’s Social Futurists, moderated and de-radicalized to fit the needs of Mongolia and her peoples, Natsagdorj and his regime shall create a pastoral utopia based upon Syndicalism, ecological conservation, and Mongol Steppe-inspired Traditionalist Futurism, synthesizing a unique form of Syndicalism that pulls from both the past practices and future possibilities of Mongolia while also taking care to preserve the natural paradise we live within. Buddhism and Tengrism shall once again be allowed to be practiced and spread, the Bogdo Lama - the former Bogd Khan - is to be pardoned, and the purges and persecutions shall be ceased, though these faiths shall remain mostly separate from the state aside from the Socialist-Spiritual fusion slowly being concocted by our own God-Builders. Centrally, Natsagdorj’s literary works and art, such as his much beloved opera ‘The Three Sad Hills’ that is performed every season at the Ulaanbaatar Opera House, shall help form the foundations of this new culture, and all in Mongolia will prosper for it. We will build a new artistic pastoral paradise here on the Steppe under Syndicalism and under Natsagdorj."

tot_mon_flavor.14.d:0 "Going forward with his Eco-Syndiacalist agenda inspired by his love of Mongolia’s natural beauty and by his time running his own artistic trade union, Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj has begun to unveils a series of new natural reserves and ecologically-minded communes, with the crown jewel of these new zones of conservation and Socialism being the new Gün-Galuut Nature Reserve. This stretch of Steppe is just South of the capital, and represents a perfect slice of Mongolian nature, containing high mountains, steppes, rivers, lakes, grasslands, and wetlands while protecting local species such as the whooper swan, the gray wolf, the Przewalski’s Wild Horse, and so much more. Dedicating his beloved poem ‘My Native Land’ to the site and changing the words to fit our new shared Syndicalist reality, Natsagdorj and his clique of Eco-Syndicalist hope that this reserve and others like it shall enable Mongolia to protect its wilderness while fostering the creation of conservationist Syndicalist unions, further progressing our state towards true Syndicalism and natural paradise. Furthermore, Natsagdorj’s long-time contemporary and friend Norman Wallace Lermond from America and his clique of Bellamyite Eco-Socialists have congratulated our leader on the move, stating that together, conservationist groups like ours will truly save Mother Earth."

tot_mon_flavor.15.d:0 "Peljidiin Genden has maintained control over the Syndicalist wing of the MAN along with his clique of Right Communists and Syndicalists, and now is largely free to pursue his own fusion of Liberalized Market Syndicalism and Leninist-Bukharinist syncretic Socialism. Creating a New Economic Policy, or NEP, form-fit for Mongolia based on the writings of the titans before him while ceasing the anti-theist purges that plagued the last administration, Genden seeks to wash away the sins of his past and the past of the MAN by creating a liberalized Syndicalist paradise that brings prosperity, freedom, and Socialist liberty to all within our borders. Taking notes from the Agrarian Market Syndicalist and Proudhounist-inspired Léon Jouhaux - one of the chief Syndicalist theorists from Socialist France and one of the chief benefactors of our coup - Genden hopes to right the wrongs he once supported in order to truly save the Mongolian Proletariat and bring them the standard of living and peace they deserve. Under Genden and this unique fusion of Syndicalism, Capitalism, and Liberalism, Mongolia and her people shall be healed."
tot_mon_flavor.15.a:0 "Fusing the best to benefit the people the most."

tot_mon_flavor.16.t:0 "Genden’s Apology"
tot_mon_flavor.16.d:0 "Once a devout Buddhist before his turn to Communism, Peljidiin Genden has long felt the weight of guilt upon his soldiers, standing by and letting hundreds of lamas and clergymen die during the initial MAN Revolution. Distancing himself from these past mistakes and reaffirming his own Buddhist faith, Genden has declared that Mongolia shall practice total freedom of religion - a sharp reversal of previous positions. Apologizing for his past mistakes and swearing to right these wrongs, Genden has begun to siphon some state funding towards the monastic reconstruction effort, rebuilding and repairing the centuries-old monasteries destroyed by the former radical MAN government. Dedicated to this new shift, he has even gone so far as to pardon the former Khan, the Bogdo Lama, and has allowed him to live in peace in his former palace in the capital so long as he stays entirely within the purview of his spiritual duties. Though many still do not forgive him, Genden has endeavored to fix the mistakes of his past in order to save Mongolia."

### Shared Soc Flavor:

tot_mon_flavor.17.t:0 "The Mother of Mongolian Socialism"
tot_mon_flavor.17.d:0 "Sükhbaataryn Yanjmaa - widow of MAN founder and Father of the Mongolian Revolution Damdin Sükhbaatar, and nicknamed the Mother of Mongolian Socialism herself - is being honored today by the State and by [root.getleader] for her decades-long dedication to Mongolian Socialism, even after the death of her beloved husband who was one of the First Seven to bring Communism to the Steppe. A staunch ally of the Revolution, she and her young son were nearly murdered along with her late husband in 1924 after the Second Revolution failed, but were saved by Choibalson before he waged his personal war against the Mad Baron and slipped into Ja Lama’s camp. Since her survival, she has worked with the MAN from exile, guiding the Party as its widely-respected matriarch, and as such, a massive parade is to be held in her honor as a statue of her figure is unveiled in the capital. Though she has shied away from a leadership position herself and focused on less-visible matters since her husband’s execution, that has not stopped her from furthering Mongolia’s Revolution, proving to be a true patriot and hero to the People’s Republic. \n\nRecently, she has begun to spread the ideas of feminism and the woman’s role in the Revolution, creating a series of women’s unions across the nation while working with her Russian contemporaries and friends Clara Zetkin, Khertek Anchimaa-Toka, and Nadezhda Krupskaya. However, despite her hesitations on leading, many within the more liberal factions within the MAN still push for our mauve matriarch to take the reins her late husband should have been holding in order to unite more of the disparate and distrustful Mongolian Left under one banner. Whether this can come to fruition one day is another matter entirely."

tot_mon_flavor.19.d:0 "Namjil Hayankhirvaa, or Namzhilyn Khayankhirvaa, is an honored revolutionary within the Radical wing of the MAN, leading the Internal Security Service against reactionary elements with his loyal squads of cronies. Recently making a name for himself after unveiling a totally real counter-revolutionary plot allegedly hatched by Jambyn Lkhümbe and Ajvaagiin Danzan which would have sold Mongolia out to the Japanese and executing all those claimed to be involved, Hayankhirvaa may be a ruthless protector of the Revolution, but he is far from a simple brute. \n\nBorn in Outer Mongolia, he became a monk in his youth and was educated in local monasteries before taking a pilgrimage to Russia and studying at the Kalmyk Theological Seminary. Gifted with a natural affinity for learning languages, he spoke his native Mongolian tongue, and later learned Tibetan, Russian, and Turkish as well. Most interestingly, he would later travel to Istanbul within the Ottoman Empire, studying linguistics and graduating with honors from the International Esperanto School and learning this synthetic language along the way. Later forming his own Esperantist Union during his time in Moscow and Paris, he returned to Mongolia during our rise and now spreads his Esperantist-Right Socialist fusion to any that will listen to him. However, despite his intelligence and skill as a revolutionary and as head of the special service, his strange ideas largely fall on deaf ears. At least he is useful while he babbles about strange tongues."

Though Soliin Danzan and Dogsomyn Bodoo still live and work to progress the Revolution, the traitorous Khorloogiin Choibalson was recently slain as retribution, leaving these two as the last of the MAN Old Guard that still draw breath. Additionally, other key members of the First Seven and the wider MAN now lost to us either due to inter-party violence or during our fight against the Mad Baron, such as Damdin Sükhbaatar, Darizavyn Losol, Dansranbilegiin Dogsom, L. Dendev, Dambyn Chagdarjav, Gelegorjiin Demid, Rinchingiin Elbegdorj, and Jambyn Lkhümbe, will be honored and remembered as well. A national holiday shall be created to cherish them and to honor their sacrifices, a military parade honoring their spirit is to be held under the direction of General Khatanbaatar Magsarjav, and a large statue of the founding MAN members is to be built at the center of Ulaanbaatar. No matter how we progress towards Socialism, we will never forget the giants that carried us here."

mon_saneberg_flavor.1.d:0 "According to Baron Von Sternberg, within the heart of every Russian, especially those of the Peon class, have an inward and deep love and devotion to the Tsar and the righteous feudal rule that has governed Russia and all mankind since time immemorial. It is only due to the poisonous influence of the Revolutionary and their Judeo–Bolshevik masters that the people lose this great love and loyalty. Thus, the Baron-turned-Regent has made reawakening this lost spirit and removing forever the influences that caused the loss of it to be the government's number one priority. To do this, the government shall work tirelessly to track down the spreaders of this vile poison, and work to rebuilt lost feudal structures. Nobles shall have their land and rights restored. Where no nobility remains to be restored, the most loyal Peons shall be ennobled, and the Baron's most loyal followers shall be given a position to suit their dedication to the cause. While such a radical transformation and undoing decades of failed reforms shall no doubt take years if not longer, in the end it will be worth it. After all, the Restoration is nothing short of a rebuilding of the natural order of things, and yet such an undertaking is worth the wait. For if God is with us, which he surely will be due to us restoring His Law, who is against us?"

mon_saneberg_flavor.2.t:0 "Fate of the Eurasianist Party"
mon_saneberg_flavor.2.d:0 "Of all political parties to rise in the nigh 20 year existence of the feeble Russian Republic, the Eurasianist Party stands out. Unlike the cowardly VNS or the craven Kadets, which sought the restoration of the Tsar along side the Republican system, the Eruasiainsts sought to dismantle the Republic and replace it with a new state, one built under a new, Eurasian, identity. Albeit under an 'Intellectual Council' that would guide the nation to it's Eurasian future.\n\nWhile the Mad Baron has no love of political parties, and especially no love for the Intelligentsia, save for when they can confirm his biases, the Eurasianists are different. Both the Baron and the Party share a wanted to transform Russia from a European power into a uniquely Eurasian one, although how much Asian is within this 'Eurasian' identity differs between the two. Both also share a special hatred for Socialism, along with similar ideas for where the borders of Eurasia end. With this being the case, and with the Baron short on allies across the reclaimed Empire, a few close to the Baron have raised the possbilty of working with them. While such an alliance so to speak would clearly be one sided, having allies we could turn too to help govern the state would greatly come in handy. To this end, three choices have been presenteed to the Baron on the status of the Eurasianists. Firstly, we could simply claim their ideals for our own, and allow them to exist, while working with us. Secondly, we could invite the leader of the Party to government, which would greatly indebt them to us. Lastly, we could simply ban them. The choice lies with the Baron alone."

In a short speech, the Patriarch espoused the virtues of the Imperial Family, as he retold a dramatic retelling of their martyrdom. He told of the struggle of their short few weeks of house arrest, their patience in the face of abuse, and their resilience in the face of death.\n\nShortly after the canonization ceremony, the Mad Baron officially announced a new national holiday, On this day every year, each Russian shall take the day off to attend the Divine Liturgy, and to pay respect to the late Tsar, and remember the evils of Socialism. While some have complained about such a holiday, calling it an abomination of State and Church relations in the modern age.

This being the case, few if any could see and understand this, and even fewer were willing to do anything about it. This was of course until the rise of Baron von Ungern-Sternberg, the Hero of Mongolia and Savior of Russia. In the Baron, even among other whites, was a burning hatred and desire to cleanse the world of Revolutionary fervor.\n\nWith Russia now once more under the control of a holy government, the Baron finds himself in a unique position to see the end of the Revolution. Should he only given the word, his vast armies could swarm forth from the borders of the Empire, not stopping until the revolution is finally and truly dead. While such a campaign would be costly, and some would even say impossible, the era of the Revolution could finally be well and truly over. The Baron has longed for this moment since the Revolution first reared it's head in the revolution of '05, but if he truly believes the time is right remains to be seen."

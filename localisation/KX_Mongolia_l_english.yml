MON_claims_of_greatness_desc:0 "Baron Roman Nicolaus von Ungern-Sternberg is the enigmatic and brutal leader of Mongolia.

Born as Agvaanl Uvsanchoijinyam Danzan Vanchüg, this reincarnation of the spiritual head of Gelug Tibetan Buddhism stands as both the spiritual and, in theory, political leader of Mongolia, but reality is often different from theory. \n\nIn truth, the Bogd Khan’s domain is run by the Bloody Baron Ungern-Sternberg, but this has not reduced the Bogdo Lama to be a mere puppet. Given their similar goals and dreams of a strong and free Mongolia, the two have grown quite close as they endeavor to restore the former glories of the Mongolia people to this sad, run-down state they now found themselves lording over. This relationship has drawn the ire of the the other Lamas, as well as the various democratic and zealous Buddhist groups in our nation, who view this cooperation between the ‘False Khan’ and the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as a perversion of Buddhist traditions and practices. \n\nRegardless, the ageing Bogd Khan still nominally rules as the monarch and patriarch of Mongolia and the Father of Mongolian Buddhism, and now only time will tell if he strengthens his own positions or lets himself and his nation drift off as puppets of other, more ambitious actors."

Yet, Mongolia did not gain full independence until Baron Roman Nicolaus von Ungern-Sternberg and his Asiatic Cavalry Division invaded Mongolia in 1920 and delivered it from the Russian protectorate. Having then captured a significant section of the resource-rich region of Tuva from the Russians, he was free to consolidate his rule. Sternberg began promoting his political authority in the country, developing a powerful military apparatus too entrenched for anyone to dislodge from his position while he works to make his claims and desires a reality..."

Heavily influenced by the numerous Bolshevik exiles who have hidden away in Mongolia since the Russian Civil War, this more authoritarian and Totalist-inspired wing of the party seeks to emulate the fallen Soviet model of old, creating a Mongolian Union of Soviets to truly free the Mongolian proletariat.

Behind him stand thousands of militiamen and volunteers willing to die for his righteous cause - to oust the infective Chinese and other foreign parasites from Mongolia. Though some of his ideas the West would describe as socialist or progressive, he is also a militant nationalist and more of a storied figure of legend than any true political ideologue, herding his hordes of nomadic followers to steal back the rightful land of the Mongols from nobles, lamas, and foreigners who seek to sully this great Steppe. Gaida Meiren and his followers shall tear down the feudal structures imposed on the Mongolia people by the Chinese and the Mongolian Nobility and finally sever Mongolia’s destiny from that of the Middle Kingdom.

As the largest Socialist force in the nation, their only real competition for support comes from the exploits of Gada Meiren, or would have if it were not for Gada Merien’s forces and the MAN hammering out a deal of cooperation and coalition for the good of Mongolia.

However, this faction seeks to crown either the leading Prince in their coalition, Demchugdongrub, or even the Khan of Kumul as their new King and political leader.

Split internally between those who seek to cooperate with the Mongolians, giving them greater autonomy, and hardliners who seek to Sinicize Mongolia as much as possible and open its lands fully for Chinese settlement. These Gamin, as the Mongolians call them, have few friends in Mongolia, but that will not deter them from their lofty goals.§!"

These mystics and holymen serve as the advisors and aides to the Bogd Khan, and seek to complete the process of making the Bogd Khan a true monarch of Mongolia. They seek to establish a ‘hereditary’ line where the current reincarnation of the Khan is once again put on the throne as the one mortal form dies and another takes its place, with the Buddyn Zövlöl serving as interim regents while each new Jebtsundamba Khutuktu is found, creating a functional dynastic monarchy founded on Buddhist principles. However, this council is not a unified front, and fundementalist influences have been seeping in, driving many of its members to more radical, extremist views. All in all though, the Buddyn Zövlöl merely seeks to create a pure theocratic monarchy here in Mongolia, and will stop at nothing to achieve this dream.§!"

Mon_dev_Tuva:0 "Develop the Tuvan region"
Mon_dev_Tuva_desc:0 "During the Blue Revolution, Tuva and the West were the most sympathetic to the revolutionary cause, with rumors claiming that its leaders were hiding therein. We should develop the region in order to keep the local populace content, at least for now..."

MON_dev_xinjiang:0 "Develop the Xinjiang Region"
MON_dev_xinjiang_desc:0 "After our recent conquest of Xinjiang, many factories and necessary infrastructure within the region have been destroyed beyond repair. It is our duty as their benevolent rulers to help them get back on their feet."

MON_army_money:0 "Increase Military Spending"
MON_army_money_desc:0 "In these times of great strife, Mongolia needs to defend herself. We must therefore ensure that we increase funding for the Armed Forces to the point where our nation can well defend herself. Better to expend capital on defense, than to be left floundering when war comes."

MON_army_supply:0 "Logistics Initiative"
MON_army_supply_desc:0 "Having huge stockpiles of weapons and machinery means nothing if they can't get to our men on the frontlines. This plan would hopefully put us in a position where, at the very least, supplies will get to our men fast."

MON_best_help:0 "Help from the Guard"
MON_best_help_desc:0 "The Baron’s Guard already received the best training and top of the line equipment which mark them out as the elite of our Army. Consequently, some in our High Command suggest that we cement this role by giving them the role of officers in our grand army."

MON_cav_modern:0 "The Modern Cavalry"
MON_cav_modern_desc:0 "As we continue our research into motorized vehicle,s the old cavalry divisions have begun to feel antiquated and obsolete. Though they won't be put out of service for a while longer, it is clear that our men now find their tanks and trucks more reliable than mere horses."

MON_empire_reborn_desc:0 "Our glorious leader of all Mongols, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, has ascended from a common forieng mercenary to a divine crusader leading all who follow to the glories of victory!

MON_brotherhood_alliance:0 "Pact of Brotherhood"
MON_brotherhood_alliance_desc:0 "Sternberg has envisioned an alliance of strong kingdoms loyal to the traditions of Eurasian culture, a brotherhood built off mutual respect and strength.

MON_mad_khan:0 "The Horde Must Expand!"
MON_mad_khan_desc:0 "With chaotic fighting and regimes rising and falling all around us, it is the perfect time to launch expansionist wars on our weaker neighbours.

MON_complete_empire_desc:0 "Our vast conquests have expanded the borders of Mongolia to stretch across Eurasia, the steppe plains and eastern China are under our control.

MON_bribe_nobles_support:0 "Bribe the Princes"
MON_bribe_nobles_support_desc:0 "Though the nobles are opposing our government currently, we can easily take some of the less loyal nobles by bribing them. The princes should be so pliant towards conformity after decades of chinese supression."

MON_impose_authoritarian_ideas:0 "Impose Authoritarian Ideas"
MON_impose_authoritarian_ideas_desc:0 "Many in Urga currently believe that perhaps it is time for democracy. The problem is that they do not realise how wrong they are, and must be disciplined to stop democracy from infesting the whole of the nation."
MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism:0 "Display Ungern's Buddhism"
MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism_desc:0 "Many in Mongolia do not believe Ungern-Sternberg is committed enough to protecting buddhism and acting in a buddhist lifestyle. Some public displays of him and some loyal monks meditating and holding some speeches should convince them otherwise."

MON_the_great_buddhist_icon_desc:0 "Though Ungern-Sternberg is not a tulku like the Bogd Khan, he should still be known as a buddhist figure of almost equal importance in Mongolia. Fortunately foundational work like the Tibetan Agvan Dorzhiev's work 'The Shambhala Prayer' is already well known and easy material to manipulate for propaganda."
MON_the_greatest_dictator:0 "Cult of Personality"
MON_the_greatest_dictator_desc:0 "To make sure Ungern-Sternberg remains in power, the propaganda around his cult of personality should be temporarily increased massively. This cult of personality relies on mythmaking that officer Ossendowski is adept at spinning."
MON_enforce_officer_loyalty:0 "Enforce Officer Loyalty"
MON_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc:0 "The officer class is a hotbed for noble traitors, socialist rebels and buddhist extremists. Their loyalty should be tested and hardened to root out these issues.

MON_urga_military_parade:0 "Urga Military Parade"
MON_urga_military_parade_desc:0 "Nothing gets the peoples support and shows dominance more than a military parade. To the people of Urga, a military parade is more of a holiday than a display of power, owing to the newness of the concept.

MON_ungerns_secures_power_desc:0 "Finally, Ungern-Sternberg and his Russian military clique have defeated the opposition, and have once again taken the reigns of the nation. Renewed by the vigor of military victory, the Russian-led junta is ready to make their postulations into reality."

MON_aggressive_industrialisation:0 "Aggressive Industrialisation"
MON_aggressive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Much of the population lives a nomadic lifestyle, not in the cities or towns. Due to this, the low population, and the harsh conditions, Mongolia's industry is very lacking.

MON_train_the_nomads:0 "Train the Nomads"
MON_train_the_nomads_desc:0 "The nomadic population of the steppes is too disunited and not trained enough to be a strong military force. Great training is needed to be able to make war like we must."

MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg_desc:0 "One of the problems that caused the revolt in the West and the chaos that descended into Urga was because we were forced to share power. The radical buddhists and rich princes had large power in our government. Now, with them defeated, we can centralise power under Ungern-Sternberg, so that he can protect the nation."
MON_propoganda_in_the_cities:0 "Propaganda in the Cities"

MON_statue_in_urga_desc:0 "Though the socialist MAN were unable to take power months ago during the Western Revolt, they still control some small cells, primarily in the hard to reach north of the nation. These cells must be completely destroyed if we are to be safe from the communist threat."

MON_encourage_myths_about_sternberg_desc:0 "Most Mongolians still believe much folklore and myths about history and current life. Many people even believe Ungern-Sternberg to be the reincarnation of Jamsaran, the God of War.

MON_more_mil_expansion_desc:0 "With the lofty ambitions of Ungern’s goals, we will need to dedicate the entire industrial apparatus of the state towards military production, save what few sectors are needed to provide a sustainable existence for our people. We will turn the skies over cities like Urga and Khovd black with the smog of progress as the factories that will fuel our victory spring to life."
MON_spread_orthodxy:0 "Endorse The Holy Trinity Church of Urga"
MON_spread_orthodxy_desc:0 "In order to prepare the people of Mongolia for further interactions with Russia in preparation for our inevitable triumph, we must spread the only other true faith on Earth besides Buddhism: Russian Orthodoxy. These two religions are two sides of the same coin, preaching the same ideals to two different yet kindred peoples. By endorsing the largest Orthodox parish in the nation and allowing more churches to be built around Mongolia, we spread this faith as we spread Buddhism as well."
MON_spread_bhuddism:0 "Buddhist Fanaticism"
MON_spread_bhuddism_desc:0 "Buddhism is the preferred faith of our Baron and most of our population, for it is a righteous and pure faith that is undeniable in its truth and benefits. Across the Steppe, fanaticism and zealotry for the Buddhist faith has exploded as many feel as though this righteous faith is beset by external forces. We must tap into this primal rage and channel it into useful avenues, for Buddhism the one of the two true faiths, and all others are heretical filth."
MON_buddy_with_bogd_khan:0 "The Two ‘Khans’ of Urga"
MON_buddy_with_bogd_khan_desc:0 "Baron Undern-Sternberg and the Bogd Khan have long been close friends and allies, with the spiritual leader serving as Ungern’s guide as he delved further into the Buddhist faith.

MON_spread_monarchism_desc:0 "The Baron is a staunch monarchist by all standards, following the will of his friend and mentor the Bogd Khan here while championing the crusade of the missing but rightful heir to the Romanov throne, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. Though this true son of Russia has not been seen in over a decade, the Baron still holds hope that he shall return to lead Russia to greatness. In his absence, the Baron is his regent, and the herald of the purity of Russian monarchism."
MON_currency_reform:0 "An Authentically Mongolian Currency"
MON_currency_reform_desc:0 "To finance the necessary expansion Mongolia’s economy and industry will need to fuel Ungern’s battlelust, the Baron has devised an ingenious monetary scheme. By creating a new currency tied to the personal herds of livestock of Mongolia’s various farmers, estates, and shepherds, we shall ensure a reliable weight behind this hopefully functional currency for Mongolia’s economy to expand with. In this system, a sheep would be worth 10 notes, a cow 25 notes, a horse 50 notes, and a camel 100. Nicknamed ‘Barons’ after Ungern himself, these notes shall be the building blocks of the new Mongolian financial sector."
MON_expand_trans_siberian:0 "The Iron Veins of Mongolia"
MON_expand_trans_siberian_desc:0 "The Trans-Siberian Railway is the lifeblood of Mongolia, connecting us to the wider world and allowing much needed supplies to flow into our lands.

MON_deal_with_bandits_ungern_desc:0 "Through his time as a raider and bandit that rampaged across the Steppe, the Baron Undern-Sternberg has developed close ties and reliable contacts to numerous bandit groups and warlords across Mongolia. By cashing in on past debts, or paying with new bribes, the Baron shall earn the aid of these brigands as we prepare for our final conquest."
MON_deas_with_nomads:0 "Nomadic Allies"
MON_deas_with_nomads_desc:0 "The Baron has long held close ties with various Mongolian groups of nomads, steppe riders, and other traditionalist Mongolian groups that still adhere to the pastoralist ideal. By ensuring to protect this lifestyle as the rest of the world modernizes around them, we shall sway these forces to join us in our coming crusade."
MON_anti_anti_asian:0 "Pan-Asian Supremacism"
MON_anti_anti_asian_desc:0 "Though a Baltic German by blood and raised as a Russian, the Baron Ungern-Sternberg is a true all to the Pan-Asian cause. Detesting anti-Asian hate and and long promoting Asian supremacist views, seeing himself as an honorary Mongolian, Ungern wishes to spread these ideas across all of Mongolia and eventually all of Russia. The time of the pompous West’s dominance is over, for the sun is rising once more in the East."
MON_prepare_for_war:0 "Prepare for Eschaton"
MON_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "Eschaton, the End Times, is nearly upon us, and we must be ready for it.

MON_take_over_trm_desc:0 "Across the Amur in Vladivostok lies the pretender government led by [TRM.getleader], who has sat licking their wounds since their exile following the Russian Civil War.

We will slaughter these pretenders where they stand, while their backs are still to the icy Pacific."
MON_take_over_russia:0 "Claim the Russian Mantle"
MON_take_over_russia_desc:0 "We must drive for Moscow and claim our rightful position as lords of Russia.

MON_make_fengtian_based:0 "A New Mandate"
MON_make_fengtian_based_desc:0 "The Qing have already lost their mandate, and yet the mandate still requires an Emperor, thus we shall sponsor a new Dynast, backing their (perhaps new)claims over China in exchange for their support."

With most of Central Asia in his hands, Ungern Khan rules all Mongolic peoples and everyone living in a yurt swears allegiance to him alone. A man beyond the capabilities of other mortals, Ungern is thought of by many Mongolians as an avatar of the God of War or in the very least – as a reincarnation of the great Genghis Khan and with his newest victories those doubting these claims have been reduced to a mere handful. Fuelled by the sweet fruits of victory Ungern Khan has convened a grand assembly in Urga to manifest the triumph of Mongolia's recent conquests. The question, however, remains whether or not the Mad Baron will satisfy himself with the establishment of a Greater Mongolia or take his faithful tribal forces and his hardened Savage Division further on the path of ambition, madness and glory?"

mongolia.33.d:0 "A ruthless dictator, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was never considered an ordinary man and his plans and actions were usually expressive and harsh. However, his officers and generals always waited for the right moment to overthrow him, as they considered him an out-of-control warmonger who had no mercy even for his trusted lieutenants. Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern's demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling. The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government. Commanders loyal to the Khan were arrested without any warning and all major sites in Urga occupied by the putschists. As the rebels stormed the Baron's residence, Ungern viciously defended himself shooting several leading conspirators in a desperate firefight. However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself. Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan came to an end."

Due to the assassination, Russia has fallen into domestic chaos and will thus not be interested nor capable of intervening in domestic Mongolian politics. Roman von Ungern-Sternberg understands that this is the right time to make Mongolia as great as it once was, but he needs a skilled second in command to succeed. Will he choose his loyal general from the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Boris Rezukhin? Or maybe the current head of government, the Mongolian aristocrat Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren to further consolidate his popularity with the Mongol people? Finally the religious leader, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, could be chosen to guarantee Ungern's divine status and prove his direct reincarnation as the God of War?"

The union of the two peoples and the consolidation of Buddhism's two great centres would cement Ungern's claim to a new Mongolian Empire. We should liberate Tibet from the heretical traitors who care more about their moneybags than about their people. Our armies are ready to bring peace and prosperity to Tibet - Genghis Khan II has to unite all Mongolic peoples into one nation. It's our destiny."

mongolia.40.d:0 "The Mongols always held von Ungern-Sternberg in high regards and called him 'Ak Bagatur' – 'The White Warrior'. It was generally believed that he was a reincarnation of Genghis Khan and as such didn't care much about his original Russian upbringing. But when Ungern was overthrown and his generals took power, the Mongol population was deeply disappointed with the successor's behaviour. The former commanders of Ungern's army considered themselves Russians and ruled Mongolia as if were a colony and not their motherland. This oppression combined with the strictness of a military regime caused a wave of riots in the Mongolian army, which consisted of various tribesmen under command of steppe nobility. Leaders of the Mongol tribes under the command of the aristocratic 'noyan' Amagaiin Bajudai started a massive anti-government revolt under the slogan of "Mongolian tribes against the Russian oppressors".

For the second time in history, a force has ridden out from the Eastern Steppe to conquer all of Russia, but this time it was not a mere Mongol leading the charge, but a true son of Russia himself! \n\nNow, the Baron shall rule this prize as regent until an official government can be formed and the true Tsar found.

Sternberg, along with his elite russian guard entered the camp of Ja Lama while being tracked with the beady eyes of the Lama’s battle hardened forces and made their way towards the central yurt. There, the Lama sat playing cards with his generals, old and wise and yet completely drunk and surrounded by a horde of plunder and weapons. One such weapon in the Ja Lama’s illustrious collection was a Russian Fedorov, a weapon Sternberg had once also used in a shared struggle with Ja Lama.  As the Baron began to speak, he was swiftly shushed and pushed back by Ja Lama’s guard, not wanting their game to be disturbed or their master to be angered and roused from his drunken stupor. In direct response, the Baron’s men drew their weapons and awaited his orders… \n\nThe Baron thought to himself for a moment. He had two options.

mongolia.106.d:0 "The infamous peasant bandit leader Gada Meiren and his forces have seized a major bridge on the Trans-Mongolian railway, persuading the local garrison to join him in their occupation as they attempt to bring the vital line to a complete halt. Being observed by Sternberg and his men from a ridge, Gada Meiren has fortified his position and he will only further entrench his position with time. Sternberg does not have enough men in his scouting party to overcome Meiren’s forces decisively, meaning a bloody and exceedingly risky conflict would ensue. However, Sternberg does also have his artillery battalion at his disposal, and with their guns in range, he has the ability to destroy Gada Meiren's forces. However, such a barrage would greatly risk the bridge as a result, leaving the Mad Baron with a tough decision to make."

As the structure began to collapse, Gada Meiren and his men attempted to make a hasty withdrawal. However, Sternberg, fueled with vengeance and a desire to slay this bandit lord, ordered for his artillery attachment to loose another volley, hoping to wipe Gada Meiren and his army from the map. \n\nThe second barrage hit heavier than the last, their guns now finding the perfect firing solution and arc after ranging with the first barrage. Hitting with deadly accuracy, this second wave further decimated the bridge's foundation and support beams, but frustratingly missed the bulk of Gada Meiren’s forces. \n\n Enraged, Ungern ordered salvo after salvo until the barrels of his howitzers glowed red hot and his ammunition was largely spent. As the smoke began to clear, the bridge lay in absolute ruins, severing a vital connector of the Trans-Siberian Railway, while Gada Meiren and the last of his surviving forces had long since fled into the countryside in the cacophony. Absolutely enraged, Ungern drew his service revolver and quickly executed the closest artillery officer near him before mounting his horse and riding off back towards Urga, with both the bridge he needed to defend now destroyed and his nemesis once again slipping away."
mongolia.107.a:0 "He won't be a threat anytime soon."

mongolia.108.t:0 "A Great Sacrifice"
mongolia.108.d:0 "Sternberg has led the assault, charging at Gada Meiren’s defensive line on the bridge head on in the hope of overwhelming them. Gada Meiren had anticipated the Bloody Baron’s attack however, and set explosives on the ridge preemptively. With a massive explosion, the mountain face began to fall onto Ungern’s forces, which crushed the majority of Sternberg’s men in rubble and debris. Blinded by rage, Sternberg stormed Gada Meiren’s fortification with his surviving forces, sacrificing more men in order to get even near Gada Meiren. However, the avalanche had provided Gada with enough time to escape with the main body of his forces, leaving the local garrison to buy him time to escape into the countryside wounded and without an army. Enraged, Sternberg slaughtered all those left, realizing he had been humiliated by Gada Meiren with thousands of his men now left dead for nothing."

However, with this victory secured, the question now is now who amongst these loyalists should lead? We could simply set up a new regency council composed of all influential members within the loyalist clique to lead the nation in the Khan’s stead. With Russian generals, Mongolian tulkus, and various other nobles and military figures all having equal say, it would at least ensure no one group rose to dominance and sullied the Khan’s legacy. Alternatively, we could crown one of the more notable standouts within the clique as the political leader of the nation. Of men that fit this bill, we could either go with the honored noble Navaanneren, a true direct descendant of Ghenghis Khan himself, or the Bogd Gegen, our spiritual leader, regranting him the title of Bogd Khan. Finally, and most wildly, we could send a delegation to the Baltics and ask that the Khan’s estranged brother come to Mongolia to rule as the new Khan, taking up his late brother’s mantle and ruling our Khanate in his stead. Who shall we choose?"
mongolia.109.a:0 "A Regency Council shall be made, composed of the Khan’s most ardent loyalists.."

However, the question that is on everyone's mind is who will be his successor? The two most likely candidates are his son, who he has named after Amursana, the famed Oirat hero, and his faithful ally and top military general Khorloogiin Choibalsan. Either would make a fine leader for Mongolia to carry on his vision, though Amursana is far more spiritual of the two, having fallen in the White Faith movement, while Choibalsan is a hard, cold-blooded military man.

This honor rightfully belongs to but one man: the esteemed Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, youngest brother to Nicholas II, the last ruling Tsar of Russia. However, though he is of royal blood and noble birth, there is but one issue with the Grand Duke’s viability as a candidate for the throne - he has not been seen since 1917. \n\nDuring the chaos and calamity of the Russian Civil War, Nicholas abdicated and Michael was named as his official successor, but his coronation never came and he went missing shortly after, and has not been seen since. Not all hope is lost however, for numerous reports have come in across the nation of possible sightings of the Grand Duke over the years, and the Imperial Regent Ungern seeks to investigate them all. If all else fails, Michael was fortunate enough to sire a legitimate son before his disappearance, the Duke George Mikhailovich, though he was born to a commoner mother along morganatic lines. Ungern will stop at nothing in his attempt to revive a true monarchy here in Russia once more, and so he shall go to the ends of the Earth itself to look for this divinely-ordained heir, for only he can lead Russia to its destiny. To begin the search for the missing Tsar, officers have told the Regent of an old widow in Yekaterinburg, said to know the location of our missing Sovereign."

Today, however, was different - flocks of soldiers ran around bearing shovels instead of guns, and a dozen or so piles of snow and dirt surrounded the village. This was a division sent out by the baron-turned-warlord-turned Regent of Russia, Roman Sternberg.\n\nIt was only on the whim of a rumour that Sternberg had heard from his officers; an elderly woman, cloaked in a mystic black robe, proclaimed in Yekantinburg that she knew where the dear Grand Duke Michael Romanov was buried. There was nothing to attest that her ramblings were true; yet there was nothing that disproved them either in the eyes of the Regent, even if he was dared to believe that the man he was searching for was dead all along.\n\n‘’Idiots, idiots! You work from dawn to dusk in the snow for a man in Hell!’’\n\nIt did not take long afterwards for the entire division to disperse, with a sour look on every man’s face. As for the old trickster, her joke would pay her the ultimate price - but at least it would give one of the multiple hovels surrounding the village a purpose."

With the vastness of Russia being what it is, these men have been given top level access to what little we do about the Grand Duke's movements during the course of the civil war.\n\nWhile this method will no doubt take much longer then hoped, it may just be the one way we can know for certain the fate of Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich."

Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was never meant to be the permanent leader of these lands, always planning to yield upon the return of his sworn liege, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, but with it being all too likely that this true royal was slain at the hands of the vile Bolsheviks during the civil war, we have been left with few options. \n\nFor all our bad luck in this matter, we have been graced with one blessing, and that is in the form of the Count Brasov, George Mikhailovich. Born to a common mother as the son of the late Grand Duke, this young man is the true heir. However, his muddy claim due to morganatic lineage raises some issues, and could greatly anger the more conservative elements of the nation. To resolve this issue, the knowledge of the Grand Duke’s fate could merely be hidden from the public. With this truth hidden, Ungern could rule as Eternal Regent in his stead, awaiting the ‘inevitable’ return of the one true Tsar. \n\nAlternatively, our wise Regent could go with a more radically traditional option. With his fascination and dedication to monarchism and Russian traditions holding strong, Ungern could call a new Zemsky Sobor, pulling together all the various nobles, high bureaucrats, clergy of both the Church and Buddhism, and representatives of the commoners and workers of our new Russia to elect a new Tsar. Whatever Ungern’s decision, it must be made with great care, for the future of all of Russia lies in the balance."

However, restoring the Tsar, even if he is yet to be found, was only one of the Regent's goals. His second, are agurely most important goal was the revitalization of the faith of the various peoples of the Empire. It is a well known fact that Sternberg's main goal in everything is the complete destruction of Atheistic Communism, and any of it's twisted Secularist cousins, be it Syndicalism or Liberalism.\n\n To this end, the Regent has wisely directed our fiance ministry to grant each local province a lump sum of cash to be used towards growing that province's religious populace and traditions. It matters not if the money is used towards the growth of Islam, Orthodoxy, or even Buddhism. All that matters to the Regent is the destruction of that most dangerous to the Soul of every man, Atheism, Secularism and lukewarmness.\n\nWhile this has indeed begun to be implemented in every locality we control, some have wondered if perhaps we should implement a national version of this policy, so that the Empire has a guiding principle, besides the Regent of course. The Regent himself is famously vague on his exact religious beliefs, leading many to wonder if this request for a national policy is an attempt to finally pry an answer from the mind of the Mad Baron. Regardless of the reasons, the Regent has agreed whole heartily to the request, authorizing a national religious policy that..."

Members of the nobility, those within the high bureaucracy, clergymen from the both the Church and even the occasional Lama from Mongolia, along with representatives of the commoners, have all gathered in [MON.GetCapital] at the beckoning of their Regent.\n\n As the final member of this new Zemsky Sobor took their seat, the Mad Baron began a speech, that he had seemingly been waiting to give since he took power within Russia. In his speech, he decried the evils of Atheistic Communism, and hammered home the point that these men gathered within this esteemed body have a moral and religious duty to decide on a new monarch. Following this, the Regent hung his head low and announced with deep sadness that Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, the rightful Tsar of all Russia, had been murdered by the hands of the Bolshevik Devils. Following a short period of extolling the virtues of the late Grand Duke, the Regent of All Russia declared the opening of the Zemsky Sobor, taking them with the finding of a new Tsar.\n\nDespite fears that the Sobor would quickly collapse into gridlock, the opposite has occurred, and five factions have rapidly come to dominate the Sabor. The largest of these factions supports Pytor Wrangel, famed war hero and avid monarchist, as Tsar. Made up mostly of noble veterans with a small sprinkling of commoner support, these 'Wrangelites' support the Baltic noble due to his promises to strengthen the armed forces and grant Holy Russia the leadership she needs in these trying times. Similar to this clique, composed of members from largely the same backgrounds, are the ‘Drozdovites’ who support the war hero Mikhail Drozdovsky for the position for many of the same reasons.The third faction that has come to prominence within the Sobor is a far-cry from the militarists of the first two camps and instead support Prince Felix of the prestigious Yusupov family for the throne. Supported mainly by the commoners, a decent-sized portion of the nobility that despise the Romanovs, and a small section of the clergy, these 'Yusupovites' harken back to their candidate’s Khanic ancestry and believe that Felix,  one of the men responsible for the death of Rasputin, alone can be a voice for the masses. The fourth and largest of the factions within the Sabor, while also the most internally divided, supports the claim of the Romanov dynasty. With support coming from all sides, even from the Regent himself, the 'Romanovites' wish to once more place a Romanov on the Russian throne. Which Romanov gets the throne however, is a topic of much debate. Finally, opposing all of these groups are a tiny and varied group of Buddhists, Ungern-Sternberg loyalists and veterans who served with him in Mongolia, and a myriad of assorted mystics, esoterics, scholars, and nationalists who are instead support the Regent himself, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, to be crowned Tsar instead. \n\nAs debate begun in earnest within the Sabor, it would take only a short while for it to be clear that..."

His victories over his opposition have only further solidified these beliefs, now in a position of supreme power the Mad Baron has once again sent shockwaves across the region.

The Mongolian messenger arrived on horseback in a retinue of 4 horsemen with khanate banners waving in the wind.

In this arid expanse stands potential allies and righteous enemies for our hordes to trample under-hoof, but before we crusade into these lands, we must first choose to align with one of the groups there to make our conquest easier and the assimilation process afterwards smoother. \n\nOf potential allies, we have three possible options. The least likely is giving the lands to Kokand, a liberal democratic haven where Jadidist and Kadimist factions battle for supremacy over this blossoming republic. Though having little in common with our regime’s ideals, they’d likely be beneficial in our attempts to pacify these lands post conquest. Alternatively, we could reach out to the more conservative Khiva or especially Bukhara, whose state ideals are more inline with the Khan’s. What nation shall we align with as we charge into the barren deserts and arid plains of Central Asia once more to retake the rest of the Steppe for the Khanate."

mon_khan.14.t:0 "A Matter of Princes"
mon_khan.14.d:0 "The various princes, nobles, and aristocrats of Mongolian society have long influenced and controlled the political stage of the Steppe. With the ascension of the Black Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg to the position of ‘regent’ to the Bogd Khan and his de-facto control over the nation’s every aspect, a final stance must be taken to deal with these ever-meddling and annoyingly ambitious men of Mongolia’s high society. \n\nBefore the Baron lie three options, each with their potential benefits. Using some of his precious plundered loot he and his hordes have collected and salvaged over his career, the Baron could sway the favor of the princes and have them eating out of his hands. Though by far the most costly of his three options, this would also buy their loyalty permanently, alleviating the Baron of an unnecessary headache that has plague him his entire rule without the need for excessive violence and without causing further unrest in this already teetering nation. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, the Baron could take the most enjoyable option for a man of his pleasures and delights, and choose to have these troublesome nobles hunted down and arrested, with any of those foolish enough to resist meeting the cool justice of a cavalryman’s arrow. Though this option would further drive up the spirits, morale, and plunder of the Baron’s beloved cavalry hordes, it would also likely drive Mongolia further into chaos. \n\nFinally, the Baron could take the most simple and cheapest option available to himself, and simply ignore the princes and their unending chittering. They are just princes after all, and what are mere princes to a man of Ungern-Sternberg’s standing! Besides, if left alive and alone, the Baron’s regime would be better able to focus on far more pressing matters of the state, such as the rioting groups of democratic protestors or bhuddist extremists that gnaw away at our administration’s foundation."

mon_khan.15.d:0 "With our decision to ignore the ever-bickering and complaining princes, our massively overstretched administration has been freed up to focus on one of the other pressing issues that is plaguing our Khanate as we speak. Though there are many metaphorical fires we could put out that currently burn away at the very fabric of our crumbling Khanate, two developments stand out above all others. \n\nAll throughout Mongolia’s largest cities, democratic protests have begun to break out, influenced by foreign ideas flooding into our lands from Western-tainted peoples such as the Russians or Chinese. These protests must be dealt with if we are to consolidate our full control over Mongolia’s few urban centers. As such, one direction we could take could be to dispatch our available forces to major cities such as Urga, Uliastai, Khem-Beldir, Minusinsk,and others to quell the fire of democratic passion before it can get out of hand. \n\nAlternatively, reports have come in from our rural villages and far-off monasteries of Bhuddist extremists desecrating temples and burning villages already sworn to the Baron’s rule. These zealots claim the Baron is a false prophet and a madman sent to distract the Mongolian people from the light of true Buddhism, and have decried Ungern-Sternberg as a fool playing God. These ideas would be very dangerous to our regime if left to get out of hand, and as such, this development would also be worth dealing with as soon as possible, lest these radicals undermine the people’s faith in their Baron."

However, many see their dear leader the Black Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg as a tyrant who merely adopted this ancient tradition to satisfy his own morbid curiosities and to quell the people of Mongolia. The people call him a false Tulku unlike the beloved but infantile Bogd Khan, but Ungern-Sternberg has long endeavored to be a figure of equal or greater reverence than a mere child born into the life of luxury. \n\nTo remedy this false public perception, the Baron has participated in a slew of public events with loyal monks and seers, performing all the acts and rituals of a true, practicing Buddhist. However, drawing upon the honored Tibetan monk Agvan Dorzhiev’s work ‘The Shambhala Prayer’, the Baron has created a new prayer, glorifying himself, that shall be taught to all the people of Mongolia. They will all be expected to be able to recite this work of pious art by memory, no matter its length, for faith in Mongolia, faith in Buddhism, and faith in the Baron have all become one in the same. The Baron, or as he slowly has been pusing to be called - the Khan, shall prove to all Mongolians he is a true Buddhist and a true Tulku, not by birth but by earned right.  \n\n’O all-around perfect Khan, Clear Evolved From First of All, who made the great distant lineage widespread in the cities of Shambala, my ever-vigilant sublime guardian, please make these words of truth come true that I request to you...’"

Though this move would likely anger millions of Chinese citizens, they are in no position to argue, bargain, or even fight back.

We could either crown the infamous Khan Ungern-Sternberg, for he himself has shown interest in the position and proved to be a loyal ally in our reclamation of our homelands, but the ramifications could be unseemly given his past and beliefs. Alternatively, we could crown the respected Bogd Khan as the new Emperor, as technically Ungern-Sternberg, even with his near-divine status, is still regent to this great Khan and reincarnated tulku. Finally, to appease the Budhists of China, Tibet, and Mongolia, we could take the most radical option and place the 14th Dalai Lama himself on the throne instead. This child would serve as a valuable tool to manipulate for use as a new spiritual and national rallying figure for this restored kingdom."

Upon the beginning of this urgent and sudden meeting, the chief rider of the Mongolian delegation handed the Patriarch a scroll sealed and embossed with the mark of the Khan. Written on this parchment was a simple offer from the Khan: join us on our holy crusade to cleanse all of Asia, or simply be another roadblock for the Khanate’s cavalry to crush underhoof - a simple enough proposal, though one that possibly holds the very fate of our salvationist movement.

The great Mongol-led Dynasty of Kublai Khan withered and crumbled into history before the Qing were even dreams in the minds of the nomadic Jurchens, and has been completely extinct since the 1360’s. That is however, until the righteous crusade of the great Bloody Baron, heir to Ghenghis Khan and avatar of the Buddhist god of war Vaiśravaṇa.

However, an alternative exists to both these camps, though they lack much popular support.

mon_khan_conference.1.d:0 "The Japanese have agreed to meet with us in our esteemed capital of Urga to hash out a solid and final solution concerning the fate of China. Long has the Middle Kingdom served as a thorn in the sides of both the Mongolian and Japanese people, and with our cooperation, their downfall is all but guaranteed. We should prepare an official proposal for what our aims for the conference will be, particularly concerning how China will be governed in the likely result of our alliance’s victory. It is however quite clear that the Japanese will wish to preserve their widespread and ever-growing economic influence over China and all of wider Asia, whatever the outcome of our cooperation. After much thought and consideration, we have decided to propose for..."

mon_khan_conference.2.t:0 "A Conference in Urga"
mon_khan_conference.2.d:0 "With the arrival of both the Japanese and Mongolian delegation to the heart of the city, the Urga conference has begun in earnest. The representatives of the Emperor and the Baron have now begun to present their own proposals while discussing and debating the finer points of our treaty and the final terms of the inevitable occupation of China. This deliberation is expected to go on for days, and will likely result in either a set plan being agreed upon, or more deliberation and counteroffers being issued until an agreement can be made or the whole conference falls apart."
mon_khan_conference.2.a:0 "After days of debate, the initial proposals have been accepted"
mon_khan_conference.2.b:0 "An impasse has been reached, and so we must go with another plan..."

mon_khan_conference.3.t:0 "A Conference in Urga"
mon_khan_conference.3.d:0 "After tense and at times hostile negotiations, the Japanese have finally been made to see reason and have accepted our terms. With a handshake between two divine avatars and the flick of a pen, the Japanese Empire and the Mongolian Khanate stand united as sovereign empires and guardians of East Asia. The Urga Conference is finally settled, from this point on, our military and economic spheres are united."
mon_khan_conference.3.a:0 "United, Our brotherhood shall reign over all of the east!"

mon_khan_conference.4.t:0 "Preparing a counter-proposal"
mon_khan_conference.4.d:0 "After strenuous hours and days of tense negotiations, this Urga Conference has so far been a failure, but we are not done yet. The Baron's initial offer was not to our Emperor’s liking, but this is our mistake, for we should have known better than to leave the diplomatic minutiae to these savage nomads in a noble’s costume.  Our delegation has been instructed by His Majesty himself to pen our own proposal on our terms - hopefully one that will prove agreeable. After their internal deliberation with input from the Emperor, they have decided to counter-offer with..."

mon_khan_conference.5.t:0 "A Japanese counter-proposal"
mon_khan_conference.5.d:0 "Despite the lengthy negotiations, it seems that the Japanese envoys have decided to reject our initial proposal. However, they have also returned with a counterproposal of their own. Should we accept these likely final terms, or shall we dismiss these pompous airheads back to their pathetic island. The Khan needs no allies, of course, but nevertheless, every drop of Japanese blood spilled on the battlefield for our shared cause is one less drop of Mongolian blood wasted. What should be our final decision?"
mon_khan_conference.5.a:0 "The negotiations must be settled, agree to these terms"
mon_khan_conference.5.b:0 "Dismiss these fools, we will look for allies elsewhere"

mon_khan_conference.6.t:0 "An Invitation to Urga"
mon_khan_conference.6.d:0 "Jinan was abuzz today over the arrival of a diplomatic delegation from the Eastern Steppe. Arriving on horseback and regalled in regal garb, dark riders from the Mongolian Khanate entered our capital and demanded an immediate audience with the esteemed [tag.getleader] and his closest advisors. Upon the beginning of this urgent and suggen meeting, these emissaries from Urga have announced that the Khan Ungern-Sternberg has invited our nation to the upcoming diplomatic summit dubbed the Urga Conference. The goal of this summit is supposedly to draw closer ties between certain like-mined regimes of the East, like ours and the Khanate, while working together for the defense and survival of our native and distinct traditions, while working towards pan-Asian unity while bound together by anti-Western attitudes. Though this offer is quite enticing, it would also draw the ire of many of the surrounding warlords and competing national governments vying for our land and China’s throne. What shall we do?"
mon_khan_conference.6.a:0 "Arrange for the necessary preparations. We make way for Urga!"
mon_khan_conference.6.b:0 "Deny the invitation of this false Khan."

mon_khan_conference.7.t:0 "The Khan and the Patriarch Split Ways"
mon_khan_conference.7.d:0 "After endless days of delegation and pandering, the Urga Conference has finally ended, but yet we have been left empty handed. Despite our overtures, the Mongolian Khanate has decided to go with different allies, leaving us in the dust with no one to help us in our crusade to seize China for ourselves and our righteous Persistent Way. Not only has the Khan wasted our time, but he has disrespected our very cause and the 18th Great Patriarch Zhang Tianran himself. We do not need this mad Khan, and we shall bring salvation to China without him."
mon_khan_conference.7.a:0 "We shall find our own way to rule the Middle Kingdom."

mon_khan_conference.8.t:0 "A New Brotherhood Rises"
mon_khan_conference.8.d:0 "After endless days of delegation and pandering, the Urga Conference has finally ended, and we have come out of this stronger and more assured in our path’s righteousness than ever before! The great Khan Ungern-Sternberg and our honored leader, the 18th Great Patriarch of the Yiguandao Zhang Tianran, have struck a deal that shall change the face of Asia forever. We now ride as allies and brothers in a fraternity that shall liberate all of China and Asia from foreing infestations and ideological squabbles. Together with the Khan, we shall be the purging flame that both cleanses and brings salvation to the true children of the Far-East."
mon_khan_conference.8.a:0 "The Khan shall facilitate our rise to dominate all of China!."

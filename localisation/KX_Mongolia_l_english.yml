MON_claims_of_greatness:0 "Claims of Greatness"
MON_claims_of_greatness_desc:0 "Baron Roman Nicolaus von Ungern-Sternberg is the enigmatic and brutal leader of Mongolia. His fearsome reputation is such that it has led some Buddhists to claim that he is both an avatar of the God of War and the reincarnation of Genghis Khan himself.

Gada Meiren, a man famous for fighting against autocrats, has been spotted inciting people to violence within the tribal communities of Mongolia.

Born as Agvaanl Uvsanchoijinyam Danzan Vanchüg, this reincarnation of the spiritual head of Gelug Tibetan Buddhism stands as both the spiritual and, in theory, political leader of Mongolia, but reality is often different from theory. \n\nIn truth, the Bogd Khan’s domain is run by the Bloody Baron Ungern-Sternberg, but this has not reduced the Bogdo Lama to be a mere puppet. Given their similar goals and dreams of a strong and free Mongolia, the two have grown quite close as they endeavor to restore the former glories of the Mongolia people to this sad, run-down state they now found themselves lording over. This relationship has drawn the ire of the other Lamas, as well as the various democratic and zealous Buddhist groups in our nation, who view this cooperation between the ‘False Khan’ and the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as a perversion of Buddhist traditions and practices. \n\nRegardless, the ageing Bogd Khan still nominally rules as the monarch and patriarch of Mongolia and the Father of Mongolian Buddhism, and now only time will tell if he strengthens his own positions or lets himself and his nation drift off as puppets of other, more ambitious actors."

Though his past relationship and cooperation with the Bloody Baron has soured his view in the eyes of some of his citizens, most still view him as a divine figure and the only true rule of Mongolia. \n\nRegardless of some doubters, the ageing Bogd Khan still nominally rules as the monarch and patriarch of Mongolia and the Father of Mongolian Buddhism, and now only time will tell if he strengthens his own positions or lets himself and his nation drift off as puppets of other, more ambitious actors."

Yet, Mongolia did not gain full independence until Baron Roman Nicolaus von Ungern-Sternberg and his Asiatic Cavalry Division invaded Mongolia in 1920 and delivered it from the Russian protectorate. Having then captured a significant section of the resource-rich region of Tuva from the Russians, he was free to consolidate his rule. Sternberg began promoting his political authority in the country, developing a powerful military apparatus too entrenched for anyone to dislodge from his position while he works to make his claims and desires a reality..."

As the oldest organized political party in the nation, it long dominated Mongolian politics until Ungern-Sternberg’s rise. Heavily influenced by the Bolsheviks, by the LKMT and the smaller CPC, many of its members have lived in exile abroad since the rise of the Mad Baron and the failure of the 1922 Revolution during the Russian Civil War. More authoritarian and militant than their moderate MAN counterparts, this Totalist-inspired wing of the party seeks to bring about a true Communist Revolution guided by the ides of Lenin, creating a worker's paradise for the Mongolian Proletariat. However, the faction is split between those who wish to drift back towards the Bolsheviks, and those that wish to drift instead towards Chinese Socialism, but given their weakened position, their hope of doing so without an outside force aiding them is slim.§!"

Drawing large influences and inspirations from the successful revolutions in France and Britain and in the rising Syndicalist movements in Indochina and Indian, these Mongolian Syndicates seek to create their own Council of Trade Unions here in Mongolia to help uplift the worker’s of our growing nation while rapidly pushing for industrialization at all costs.

Behind him stand thousands of militiamen and volunteers willing to die for his righteous cause - to oust the infective Chinese and other foreign parasites from Mongolia. Though some of his ideas the West would describe as socialist or progressive, he is also a militant nationalist and more of a storied figure of legend than any true political ideologue, herding his hordes of nomadic followers to steal back the rightful land of the Mongols from nobles, lamas, and foreigners who seek to sully this great Steppe. Gaida Meiren and his followers shall tear down the feudal structures imposed on the Mongolia people by the Chinese and the Mongolian Nobility and finally sever Mongolia’s destiny from that of the Middle Kingdom.

As the largest Socialist force in the nation, their only real competition for support comes from the exploits of Gada Meiren, or would have if it were not for Gada Merien’s forces and the MAN hammering out a deal of cooperation and coalition for the good of Mongolia.

However, this faction seeks to crown either the leading Prince in their coalition, Demchugdongrub, or even the Khan of Kumul as their new King and political leader.

However, reality has played out differently than this intended plan, and though the two are close, the Baron Ungern-Sternberg has increasingly seized more of the power in the nation for himself, pushing his old friend and suzerain more and more into the position of a glorified puppet.

Named for the street in Beijing where its founding members used to meet before their exile and composed nearly entirely of ethnic Chinese, these foreigners seek to reclaim former glories and triumphantly conquer their homeland in China. Split internally between those who seek to cooperate with the Mongolians, giving them greater autonomy, and hardliners who seek to Sinicize Mongolia as much as possible and open its lands fully for Chinese settlement.

These mystics and holymen serve as the advisors and aides to the Bogd Khan, and seek to complete the process of making the Bogd Khan a true monarch of Mongolia. They seek to establish a ‘hereditary’ line where the current reincarnation of the Khan is once again put on the throne as the one mortal form dies and another takes its place, with the Buddyn Zövlöl serving as interim regents while each new Jebtsundamba Khutuktu is found, creating a functional dynastic monarchy founded on Buddhist principles. However, this council is not a unified front, and fundementalist influences have been seeping in, driving many of its members to more radical, extremist views. All in all though, the Buddyn Zövlöl merely seeks to create a pure theocratic monarchy here in Mongolia, and will stop at nothing to achieve this dream.§!"

MON_khem_beldyr_resources_desc:0 "We did not seize the lands of Tuva because they look pretty. We shall expand our mines there so that the thirst of our mighty war machine is sated, at least until we find new lands to conquer."

MON_dev_sib_railway_desc:0 "Soon after we declared independence, we created our own connection to the famed Trans-Siberian Railway — the Trans-Mongolian — in order to secure better trade links to the outside world.

MON_cav_modern_desc:0 "As we continue our research into motorized vehicle,s the old cavalry divisions have begun to feel antiquated and obsolete. Though they won't be put out of service for a while longer, it is clear that our men now find their tanks and trucks more reliable than mere horses."

MON_bribe_nobles_support:0 "Bribe the Princes"
MON_bribe_nobles_support_desc:0 "Though the nobles are opposing our government currently, we can easily take some of the less loyal nobles by bribing them. The princes should be so pliant towards conformity after decades of chinese supression."

MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism:0 "Display Ungern's Buddhism"
MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism_desc:0 "Many in Mongolia do not believe Ungern-Sternberg is committed enough to protecting buddhism and acting in a buddhist lifestyle. Some public displays of him and some loyal monks meditating and holding some speeches should convince them otherwise."

MON_the_great_buddhist_icon_desc:0 "Though Ungern-Sternberg is not a tulku like the Bogd Khan, he should still be known as a buddhist figure of almost equal importance in Mongolia. Fortunately foundational work like the Tibetan Agvan Dorzhiev's work 'The Shambhala Prayer' is already well known and easy material to manipulate for propaganda."
MON_the_greatest_dictator:0 "Cult of Personality"
MON_the_greatest_dictator_desc:0 "To make sure Ungern-Sternberg remains in power, the propaganda around his cult of personality should be temporarily increased massively. This cult of personality relies on mythmaking that officer Ossendowski is adept at spinning."
MON_enforce_officer_loyalty:0 "Enforce Officer Loyalty"
MON_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc:0 "The officer class is a hotbed for noble traitors, socialist rebels and buddhist extremists. Their loyalty should be tested and hardened to root out these issues.

MON_urga_military_parade_desc:0 "Nothing gets the peoples support and shows dominance more than a military parade. To the people of Urga, a military parade is more of a holiday than a display of power, owing to the newness of the concept.

MON_aggressive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Much of the population lives a nomadic lifestyle, not in the cities or towns. Due to this, the low population, and the harsh conditions, Mongolia's industry is very lacking.

MON_train_the_nomads:0 "Train the Nomads"

MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg_desc:0 "One of the problems that caused the revolt in the West and the chaos that descended into Urga was because we were forced to share power. The radical buddhists and rich princes had large power in our government. Now, with them defeated, we can centralise power under Ungern-Sternberg, so that he can protect the nation."
MON_propoganda_in_the_cities:0 "Propaganda in the Cities"

MON_encourage_myths_about_sternberg_desc:0 "Most Mongolians still believe much folklore and myths about history and current life.

MON_spread_orthodxy:0 "Endorse The Holy Trinity Church of Urga"
MON_spread_orthodxy_desc:0 "In order to prepare the people of Mongolia for further interactions with Russia in preparation for our inevitable triumph, we must spread the only other true faith on Earth besides Buddhism: Russian Orthodoxy. These two religions are two sides of the same coin, preaching the same ideals to two different yet kindred peoples. By endorsing the largest Orthodox parish in the nation and allowing more churches to be built around Mongolia, we spread this faith as we spread Buddhism as well."
MON_spread_bhuddism:0 "Buddhist Fanaticism"
MON_spread_bhuddism_desc:0 "Buddhism is the preferred faith of our Baron and most of our population, for it is a righteous and pure faith that is undeniable in its truth and benefits. Across the Steppe, fanaticism and zealotry for the Buddhist faith has exploded as many feel as though this righteous faith is beset by external forces. We must tap into this primal rage and channel it into useful avenues, for Buddhism the one of the two true faiths, and all others are heretical filth."

MON_buddy_with_bogd_khan_desc:0 "Baron Undern-Sternberg and the Bogd Khan have long been close friends and allies, with the spiritual leader serving as Ungern’s guide as he delved further into the Buddhist faith.

MON_currency_reform:0 "An Authentically Mongolian Currency"
MON_currency_reform_desc:0 "To finance the necessary expansion Mongolia’s economy and industry will need to fuel Ungern’s battlelust, the Baron has devised an ingenious monetary scheme. By creating a new currency tied to the personal herds of livestock of Mongolia’s various farmers, estates, and shepherds, we shall ensure a reliable weight behind this hopefully functional currency for Mongolia’s economy to expand with. In this system, a sheep would be worth 10 notes, a cow 25 notes, a horse 50 notes, and a camel 100. Nicknamed ‘Barons’ after Ungern himself, these notes shall be the building blocks of the new Mongolian financial sector."

MON_anti_anti_asian:0 "Pan-Asian Supremacism"
MON_anti_anti_asian_desc:0 "Though a Baltic German by blood and raised as a Russian, the Baron Ungern-Sternberg is a true all to the Pan-Asian cause. Detesting anti-Asian hate and and long promoting Asian supremacist views, seeing himself as an honorary Mongolian, Ungern wishes to spread these ideas across all of Mongolia and eventually all of Russia. The time of the pompous West’s dominance is over, for the sun is rising once more in the East."

MON_ungern_alone:0 "A Sovereign Power"
MON_ungern_alone_desc:0 "We cannot rely on foreign powers with their ulterior motives to achieve our ends, the Chinese are divided, too busy warring endlessly with themselves to be relied on, the Japanese hunger for fresh plunder more than for righteousness, and the Europeans are either spreading such evil themselves or decadent to the point of impotence. In this ruined and rotting world, Our Baron can rely only on his own strength, from one end of Eurasia to the other, Mongolia alone shall be the bulwark of tradition!."

mongolia.32.t:0 "A New Mongolian Empire?"
mongolia.32.d:0 "Now that our cowardly enemies are defeated nobody can stop our Khan from restoring the past glory of Mongolia. With most of Central Asia in his hands, Ungern Khan rules all Mongolic peoples and everyone living in a yurt swears allegiance to him alone. A man beyond the capabilities of other mortals, Ungern is thought of by many Mongolians as an avatar of the God of War or in the very least – as a reincarnation of the great Genghis Khan and with his newest victories those doubting these claims have been reduced to a mere handful. Fuelled by the sweet fruits of victory Ungern Khan has convened a grand assembly in Urga to manifest the triumph of Mongolia's recent conquests. The question, however, remains whether or not the Mad Baron will satisfy himself with the establishment of a Greater Mongolia or take his faithful tribal forces and his hardened Savage Division further on the path of ambition, madness and glory?"
mongolia.32.a:0 "Mongolia will rise again under Ungern Khan!"

mongolia.33.t:0 "Death of von Ungern-Sternberg"
mongolia.33.d:0 "A ruthless dictator, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was never considered an ordinary man and his plans and actions were usually expressive and harsh. However, his officers and generals always waited for the right moment to overthrow him, as they considered him an out-of-control warmonger who had no mercy even for his trusted lieutenants. Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern's demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling. The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government. Commanders loyal to the Khan were arrested without any warning and all major sites in Urga occupied by the putschists. As the rebels stormed the Baron's residence, Ungern viciously defended himself shooting several leading conspirators in a desperate firefight. However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself. Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan came to an end."

mongolia.35.t:0 "A Second in Command for Ungern Khan?"
mongolia.35.d:0 "Today newspapers around the world has been filled with the news of the assassination of the Russian president, Alexander Kerensky. Due to the assassination, Russia has fallen into domestic chaos and will thus not be interested nor capable of intervening in domestic Mongolian politics. Roman von Ungern-Sternberg understands that this is the right time to make Mongolia as great as it once was, but he needs a skilled second in command to succeed. Will he choose his loyal general from the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Boris Rezukhin? Or maybe the current head of government, the Mongolian aristocrat Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren to further consolidate his popularity with the Mongol people? Finally the religious leader, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, could be chosen to guarantee Ungern's divine status and prove his direct reincarnation as the God of War?"

mongolia.36.a:0 "Loot the land and salt the earth!"
mongolia.36.b:0 "They shall be incorporated peacefully."

mongolia.37.t:0 "Annexation of Tibet"
mongolia.37.d:0 "Tibet is now under hooves of our horses...But we should remember our long friendship and cooperation with this people. Their government will be punished for their betrayal, but citizens of Tibetan mountains will probably agree to join our Empire under the rule of glorious Genghis Khan II! Tibetans know how to fight in the ice hills, and their soldiers will be beneficial to our mighty armies...But warriors of the Khan want to be rewarded for long bloody battles..."
mongolia.37.a:0 "Loot the land and salt the earth!"
mongolia.37.b:0 "They shall be incorporated peacefully."

mongolia.38.t:0 "Dealing with the Lhasa Regime"
mongolia.38.d:0 "Tibet always enjoyed cordial relations with Mongolia, but once they heard about the restoration of our Great Empire, the cowardly government in Lhasa turned their back upon Ungern. The union of the two peoples and the consolidation of Buddhism's two great centres would cement Ungern's claim to a new Mongolian Empire. We should liberate Tibet from the heretical traitors who care more about their moneybags than about their people. Our armies are ready to bring peace and prosperity to Tibet - Genghis Khan II has to unite all Mongolic peoples into one nation. It's our destiny."
mongolia.38.a:0 "Ungern Khan shall unite ALL Buddhists! Onward!"
mongolia.38.b:0 "We have enough Lamas in Urga."

mongolia.40.t:0 "Tribal Revolt!"
mongolia.40.d:0 "The Mongols always held von Ungern-Sternberg in high regards and called him 'Ak Bagatur' – 'The White Warrior'. It was generally believed that he was a reincarnation of Genghis Khan and as such didn't care much about his original Russian upbringing. But when Ungern was overthrown and his generals took power, the Mongol population was deeply disappointed with the successor's behaviour. The former commanders of Ungern's army considered themselves Russians and ruled Mongolia as if were a colony and not their motherland. This oppression combined with the strictness of a military regime caused a wave of riots in the Mongolian army, which consisted of various tribesmen under command of steppe nobility. Leaders of the Mongol tribes under the command of the aristocratic 'noyan' Amagaiin Bajudai started a massive anti-government revolt under the slogan of "Mongolian tribes against the Russian oppressors". Soon a wave of terror covered the steppes..."

mongolia.48.d:0 "It's been hundreds of years since Macau became a Portuguese holding in 1557 by purchasing it from the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Now that the South lies in the hands of the Mongolians once more, the khan is considering whether to claim the port of Macau from the Portuguese or to not interfere with the ownership of the city sold before the rise of the Mongols."
mongolia.48.a:0 "It belongs to China!"
mongolia.48.b:0 "Let the idea slide."

mongolia.49.t:0 "Mongol Demands"
mongolia.49.d:0 "After centuries, the Mongol Khan now decided to demand Macau from us. The Mongol Empire is now one of the strongest states in the Far East and fighting them is probably not a good idea."

Though we have lost many of our countrymen and allies along the way, we have triumphed under the leadership and guidance of Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, and now all of Russia is our prize. For the second time in history, a force has ridden out from the Eastern Steppe to conquer all of Russia, but this time it was not a mere Mongol leading the charge, but a true son of Russia himself! \n\nNow, the Baron shall rule this prize as regent until an official government can be formed and the true Tsar found. In Mongolia, his old ally and friend the Bogd Khan shall rule in his stead, serving as an ally to Sternberg’s Russia while simultaneously granting the Mongolian people independence and self-rule."

mongolia.103.d:0 "After recent complaints, Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg has riden out once again to attempt to pacify the Warlord Ja Lama who has grown unpopular with the people of Khovd. Sternberg, along with his elite Russian guard entered the camp of Ja Lama while being tracked with the beady eyes of the Lama’s battle hardened forces and made their way towards the central yurt. There, the Lama sat playing cards with his generals, old and wise and yet completely drunk and surrounded by a horde of plunder and weapons. One such weapon in the Ja Lama’s illustrious collection was a Russian Fedorov, a weapon Sternberg had once also used in a shared struggle with Ja Lama.  As the Baron began to speak, he was swiftly shushed and pushed back by Ja Lama’s guard, not wanting their game to be disturbed or their master to be angered and roused from his drunken stupor. In direct response, the Baron’s men drew their weapons and awaited his orders... \n\nThe Baron thought to himself for a moment. He had two options. He could either strike this arrogant fool down where he sat right now, ending his reign of terror and securing the city of Khovd for ourselves. However, none can deny that despite his eccentricities and barbarism, Ja Lama is a great warrior and would serve the state well, and brings with him a horde of military experts like Khorloogiin Choibalson and Gonchigiin Bumstend, among others. After thinking for this brief moment, the Baron stepped forward and made his call."

Being observed by Sternberg and his men from a ridge, Gada Meiren has fortified his position and he will only further entrench his position with time. Sternberg does not have enough men in his scouting party to overcome Meiren’s forces decisively, meaning a bloody and exceedingly risky conflict would ensue. However, Sternberg does also have his artillery battalion at his disposal, and with their guns in range, he has the ability to destroy Gada Meiren's forces. However, such a barrage would greatly risk the bridge as a result, leaving the Mad Baron with a tough decision to make."

However, Sternberg, fueled with vengeance and a desire to slay this bandit lord, ordered for his artillery attachment to loose another volley, hoping to wipe Gada Meiren and his army from the map. \n\nThe second barrage hit heavier than the last, their guns now finding the perfect firing solution and arc after ranging with the first barrage. Hitting with deadly accuracy, this second wave further decimated the bridge's foundation and support beams, but frustratingly missed the bulk of Gada Meiren’s forces. \n\n Enraged, Ungern ordered salvo after salvo until the barrels of his howitzers glowed red hot and his ammunition was largely spent. As the smoke began to clear, the bridge lay in absolute ruins, severing a vital connector of the Trans-Siberian Railway, while Gada Meiren and the last of his surviving forces had long since fled into the countryside in the cacophony. Absolutely enraged, Ungern drew his service revolver and quickly executed the closest artillery officer near him before mounting his horse and riding off back towards Urga, with both the bridge he needed to defend now destroyed and his nemesis once again slipping away."

Gada Meiren had anticipated the Bloody Baron’s attack however, and set explosives on the ridge preemptively. With a massive explosion, the mountain face began to fall onto Ungern’s forces, which crushed the majority of Sternberg’s men in rubble and debris. Blinded by rage, Sternberg stormed Gada Meiren’s fortification with his surviving forces, sacrificing more men in order to get even near Gada Meiren. However, the avalanche had provided Gada with enough time to escape with the main body of his forces, leaving the local garrison to buy him time to escape into the countryside wounded and without an army. Enraged, Sternberg slaughtered all those left, realizing he had been humiliated by Gada Meiren with thousands of his men now left dead for nothing."

However, with this victory secured, the question now is now who amongst these loyalists should lead? We could simply set up a new regency council composed of all influential members within the loyalist clique to lead the nation in the Khan’s stead. With Russian generals, Mongolian tulkus, and various other nobles and military figures all having equal say, it would at least ensure no one group rose to dominance and sullied the Khan’s legacy. Alternatively, we could crown one of the more notable standouts within the clique as the political leader of the nation. Of men that fit this bill, we could either go with the honored noble Navaanneren, a true direct descendant of Ghenghis Khan himself, or the Bogd Gegen, our spiritual leader, regranting him the title of Bogd Khan. Finally, and most wildly, we could send a delegation to the Baltics and ask that the Khan’s estranged brother come to Mongolia to rule as the new Khan, taking up his late brother’s mantle and ruling our Khanate in his stead. Who shall we choose?"

The two most likely candidates are his son, who he has named after Amursana, the famed Oirat hero, and his faithful ally and top military general Khorloogiin Choibalsan. Either would make a fine leader for Mongolia to carry on his vision. Amursana is far more spiritual of the two, having fallen in the White Faith movement, while Choibalsan is a hard, cold-blooded military man with pseudo-Socialist populist beliefs leftover from his time in the MAN and with a love for light hedonism and strong patriotism.

Finally, Rolf could either simply reign as a figurehead, and allow the Buddhist monks and the Bogd Khan truly run the scenes of Mongolia behind the facade of Rolf’s authority, or allow Roman’s young daughter to rule as her father’s and Genghis’ reincarnation instead. Each holds their benefits, but no one but Rolf can decide this now."

With his passing, the cycle of reincarnation shall begin anew as his tulku spirit travels through the cosmos towards its next vessel. \n\nNow begins the long and painstaking journey to reveal the new Bogd Gegen, and until his return, the Panchen Lama shall serve as our spiritual guide.

mongolia.159.t:0 "The One True Tsar, with One Issue"
mongolia.159.d:0 "Though he is all powerful and the supreme commander of all forces in Russia, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg is the Imperial Regent, not the Tsar. This honor rightfully belongs to but one man: the esteemed Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, youngest brother to Nicholas II, the last ruling Tsar of Russia. However, though he is of royal blood and noble birth, there is but one issue with the Grand Duke’s viability as a candidate for the throne - he has not been seen since 1917. \n\nDuring the chaos and calamity of the Russian Civil War, Nicholas abdicated and Michael was named as his official successor, but his coronation never came and he went missing shortly after, and has not been seen since. Not all hope is lost however, for numerous reports have come in across the nation of possible sightings of the Grand Duke over the years, and the Imperial Regent Ungern seeks to investigate them all. If all else fails, Michael was fortunate enough to sire a legitimate son before his disappearance, the Duke George Mikhailovich, though he was born to a commoner mother along morganatic lines. Ungern will stop at nothing in his attempt to revive a true monarchy here in Russia once more, and so he shall go to the ends of the Earth itself to look for this divinely-ordained heir, for only he can lead Russia to its destiny. To begin the search for the missing Tsar, officers have told the Regent of an old widow in Yekaterinburg, said to know the location of our missing Sovereign."
mongolia.159.a:0 "We shall search from Kamchatka to Dvinsk, for we must find our Tsar!"

mongolia.160.t:0 "To Find a Romanov"
mongolia.160.d:0 "In the outskirts of Yekaterinburg, all was fair and fine for the peasant villagers who spent their days commuting to and fro from the fields and their homes. Today, however, was different - flocks of soldiers ran around bearing shovels instead of guns, and a dozen or so piles of snow and dirt surrounded the village. This was a division sent out by the baron-turned-warlord-turned Regent of Russia, Roman Sternberg.\n\nIt was only on the whim of a rumour that Sternberg had heard from his officers; an elderly woman, cloaked in a mystic black robe, proclaimed in Yekantinburg that she knew where the dear Grand Duke Michael Romanov was buried. There was nothing to attest that her ramblings were true; yet there was nothing that disproved them either in the eyes of the Regent, even if he was dared to believe that the man he was searching for was dead all along.\n\n‘’Idiots, idiots! You work from dawn to dusk in the snow for a man in Hell!’’\n\nIt did not take long afterwards for the entire division to disperse, with a sour look on every man’s face. As for the old trickster, her joke would pay her the ultimate price - but at least it would give one of the multiple hovels surrounding the village a purpose."
mongolia.160.a:0 "Never speak of this again."

mongolia.161.t:0 "The Search Expands"
mongolia.161.d:0 "With the Yekaterinburg lead now dead and buried, we have exhausted the one lead as per the location of Grand Duke Michael. With this in mind, Regent Sternberg has ordered his top officers to search every nook and cranny of the Empire to find either proof of the Grand Duke's death, or the Grand Duke himself. With the vastness of Russia being what it is, these men have been given top level access to what little we do about the Grand Duke's movements during the course of the civil war.\n\nWhile this method will no doubt take much longer then hoped, it may just be the one way we can know for certain the fate of Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich."

mongolia.162.t:0 "Realities About the Future of the Throne"
mongolia.162.d:0 "With Ungern’s conquest of Russia proving successful and the harsh reality of the Grand Duke’s finally revealed to the grand Regent, a final decision on what to do with the Russian throne must be made. Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was never meant to be the permanent leader of these lands, always planning to yield upon the return of his sworn liege, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, but with it being all too likely that this true royal was slain at the hands of the vile Bolsheviks during the civil war, we have been left with few options. \n\nFor all our bad luck in this matter, we have been graced with one blessing, and that is in the form of the Count Brasov, George Mikhailovich. Born to a common mother as the son of the late Grand Duke, this young man is the true heir. However, his muddy claim due to morganatic lineage raises some issues, and could greatly anger the more conservative elements of the nation. To resolve this issue, the knowledge of the Grand Duke’s fate could merely be hidden from the public. With this truth hidden, Ungern could rule as Eternal Regent in his stead, awaiting the ‘inevitable’ return of the one true Tsar. \n\nAlternatively, our wise Regent could go with a more radically traditional option. With his fascination and dedication to monarchism and Russian traditions holding strong, Ungern could call a new Zemsky Sobor, pulling together all the various nobles, high bureaucrats, clergy of both the Church and Buddhism, and representatives of the commoners and workers of our new Russia to elect a new Tsar. Whatever Ungern’s decision, it must be made with great care, for the future of all of Russia lies in the balance."
mongolia.162.a:0 "The true Tsar’s morganatic son George shall be crowned as the new Tsar of all Russia."
mongolia.162.b:0 "In the absence of the one true Tsar, Ungern-Sternberg shall reign as the Eternal Regent."

mongolia.163.t:0 "Religious Policy of the Empire"
mongolia.163.d:0 "With Russia finally once more restored to her rightful state under the Tsardom, one of the primary goals of Regent Sternberg's crusade is finally complete. However, restoring the Tsar, even if he is yet to be found, was only one of the Regent's goals. His second, are arguably most important goal was the revitalization of the faith of the various peoples of the Empire. It is a well known fact that Sternberg's main goal in everything is the complete destruction of Atheistic Communism, and any of it's twisted Secularist cousins, be it Syndicalism or Liberalism.\n\n To this end, the Regent has wisely directed our fiance ministry to grant each local province a lump sum of cash to be used towards growing that province's religious populace and traditions. It matters not if the money is used towards the growth of Orthodoxy, Buddhism, or even Tengrism and other 'Pagan faiths'. All that matters to the Regent is the destruction of that most dangerous to the Soul of every man, Atheism, Secularism and lukewarmness.\n\nWhile this has indeed begun to be implemented in every locality we control, some have wondered if perhaps we should implement a national version of this policy, so that the Empire has a guiding principle, besides the Regent of course. The Regent himself is famously vague on his exact religious beliefs, leading many to wonder if this request for a national policy is an attempt to finally pry an answer from the mind of the Mad Baron. Regardless of the reasons, the Regent has agreed whole heartily to the request, authorizing a national religious policy that..."

mongolia.164.t:0 "The Great Zemsky Sobor"
mongolia.164.d:0 "Just as in 1598 during the fall of the Rurik Dynasty, Regent Sternberg has called together representatives from every wake of life within Russo-Mongolian society. Members of the nobility, those within the high bureaucracy, clergymen from the both the Church and even the occasional Lama from Mongolia, along with representatives of the commoners, have all gathered in [MON.GetCapital] at the beckoning of their Regent.\n\n As the final member of this new Zemsky Sobor took their seat, the Mad Baron began a speech, that he had seemingly been waiting to give since he took power within Russia. In his speech, he decried the evils of Atheistic Communism, and hammered home the point that these men gathered within this esteemed body have a moral and religious duty to decide on a new monarch. Following this, the Regent hung his head low and announced with deep sadness that Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, the rightful Tsar of all Russia, had been murdered by the hands of the Bolshevik Devils. Following a short period of extolling the virtues of the late Grand Duke, the Regent of All Russia declared the opening of the Zemsky Sobor, taking them with the finding of a new Tsar.\n\nDespite fears that the Sobor would quickly collapse into gridlock, the opposite has occurred, and five factions have rapidly come to dominate the Sabor. The largest of these factions supports Pytor Wrangel, famed war hero and avid monarchist, as Tsar. Made up mostly of noble veterans with a small sprinkling of commoner support, these 'Wrangelites' support the Baltic noble due to his promises to strengthen the armed forces and grant Holy Russia the leadership she needs in these trying times. Similar to this clique, composed of members from largely the same backgrounds, are the ‘Drozdovites’ who support the war hero Mikhail Drozdovsky for the position for many of the same reasons.The third faction that has come to prominence within the Sobor is a far-cry from the militarists of the first two camps and instead support Prince Felix of the prestigious Yusupov family for the throne. Supported mainly by the commoners, a decent-sized portion of the nobility that despise the Romanovs, and a small section of the clergy, these 'Yusupovites' harken back to their candidate’s Khanic ancestry and believe that Felix,  one of the men responsible for the death of Rasputin, alone can be a voice for the masses. The fourth and largest of the factions within the Sabor, while also the most internally divided, supports the claim of the Romanov dynasty. With support coming from all sides, even from the Regent himself, the 'Romanovites' wish to once more place a Romanov on the Russian throne. Which Romanov gets the throne however, is a topic of much debate. Finally, opposing all of these groups are a tiny and varied group of Buddhists, Ungern-Sternberg loyalists and veterans who served with him in Mongolia, and a myriad of assorted mystics, esoterics, scholars, and nationalists who are instead support the Regent himself, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, to be crowned Tsar instead. \n\nAs debate begun in earnest within the Sabor, it would take only a short while for it to be clear that..."

Using some of his precious plundered loot he and his hordes have collected and salvaged over his career, the Baron could sway the favor of the princes and have them eating out of his hands. Though by far the most costly of his three options, this would also buy their loyalty permanently, alleviating the Baron of an unnecessary headache that has plague him his entire rule without the need for excessive violence and without causing further unrest in this already teetering nation. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, the Baron could take the most enjoyable option for a man of his pleasures and delights, and choose to have these troublesome nobles hunted down and arrested, with any of those foolish enough to resist meeting the cool justice of a cavalryman’s arrow. Though this option would further drive up the spirits, morale, and plunder of the Baron’s beloved cavalry hordes, it would also likely drive Mongolia further into chaos. \n\nFinally, the Baron could take the most simple and cheapest option available to himself, and simply ignore the princes and their unending chittering. They are just princes after all, and what are mere princes to a man of Ungern-Sternberg’s standing! Besides, if left alive and alone, the Baron’s regime would be better able to focus on far more pressing matters of the state, such as the rioting groups of democratic protestors or bhuddist extremists that gnaw away at our administration’s foundation."

These protests must be dealt with if we are to consolidate our full control over Mongolia’s few urban centers. As such, one direction we could take could be to dispatch our available forces to major cities such as Urga, Uliastai, Khem-Beldir, Minusinsk,and others to quell the fire of democratic passion before it can get out of hand. \n\nAlternatively, reports have come in from our rural villages and far-off monasteries of Bhuddist extremists desecrating temples and burning villages already sworn to the Baron’s rule. These zealots claim the Baron is a false prophet and a madman sent to distract the Mongolian people from the light of true Buddhism, and have decried Ungern-Sternberg as a fool playing God. These ideas would be very dangerous to our regime if left to get out of hand, and as such, this development would also be worth dealing with as soon as possible, lest these radicals undermine the people’s faith in their Baron."

However, drawing upon the honored Tibetan monk Agvan Dorzhiev’s work ‘The Shambhala Prayer’, the Baron has created a new prayer, glorifying himself, that shall be taught to all the people of Mongolia. They will all be expected to be able to recite this work of pious art by memory, no matter its length, for faith in Mongolia, faith in Buddhism, and faith in the Baron have all become one in the same.

Alternatively, we could crown the respected Bogd Khan as the new Emperor, as technically Ungern-Sternberg, even with his near-divine status, is still regent to this great Khan and reincarnated tulku. Finally, to appease the Buddhists of China, Tibet, and Mongolia, we could take the most radical option and place the 14th Dalai Lama himself on the throne instead. This child would serve as a valuable tool to manipulate for use as a new spiritual and national rallying figure for this restored kingdom."

mon_khan.20.t:0 "Emissaries from the Eastern Steppe"
mon_khan.20.d:0 "Jinan was abuzz today over the arrival of a diplomatic delegation from the Mongolian Khanate. Arriving on horseback and regaled in regal garb, dark riders from this infamous and storied distant land entered our capital and demanded an immediate audience with the esteemed Great Patriarch Zhang Tianran and his closest advisors. Upon the beginning of this urgent and sudden meeting, the chief rider of the Mongolian delegation handed the Patriarch a scroll sealed and embossed with the mark of the Khan. Written on this parchment was a simple offer from the Khan: join us on our holy crusade to cleanse all of Asia, or simply be another roadblock for the Khanate’s cavalry to crush underhoof - a simple enough proposal, though one that possibly holds the very fate of our salvationist movement. We must make our decision now, for once these riders leave to return to Urga, we will not get a second chance."
mon_khan.20.a:0 "The Patriarch and the Khan shall purify all of Asia as they bring our people to salvation."
mon_khan.20.b:0 "Our cause is righteous enough to not have to make deals with demons."

mon_khan.21.t:0 "A Chinese China"
mon_khan.21.d:0 "It would be foolish to put anyone other than a true Chinese noble on the Dragon Throne. Though the Chinese have been defeated in battle numerous times, we must never underestimate their unending masses and their ability to sow discord and instability within any administration that tries to hold these lands. To hopefully alleviate some of this tension and unrest, a Chinese noble of righteous birth shall be chosen, but who?"
mon_khan.21.a:0 "Zhu Yuxun, Marquis of Extended Grace and heir to the Ming, shall take by his rightful throne."
mon_khan.21.b:0 "Kun Te-Chang, Duke of Yansheng and Heir to Confucius, shall take the Dragon Throne."

mon_khan.22.t:0 "Great Yuan Once More"
mon_khan.22.d:0 "The Yuan Dynasty has been known by many names. To the Chinese, it was Yuán Cháo, to the archaic Middle Mongols, it was Dai Ön Ulus, and to modern Mongolians it was Yeke Ywan Ulus. However, to all groups, the Great Yuan is known widely as being called dead. The great Mongol-led Dynasty of Kublai Khan withered and crumbled into history before the Qing were even dreams in the minds of the nomadic Jurchens, and has been completely extinct since the 1360’s. That is however, until the righteous crusade of the great Bloody Baron, heir to Ghenghis Khan and avatar of the Buddhist god of war Vaiśravaṇa. This demigod of the Buddhist faith and living effigy of Mongolian retribution and nationalism has seized the Mandate of Heaven and reclaimed the lands of the Middle Kingdom for a Mongolian Khanate once more for the first time in nearly a millennium. With his conquest and triumph, the Yuan Dynasty shall rise once more!"
mon_khan.22.d:0 "Mongol rule has once again returned to China."

mon_khan.23.t:0 "The Mongol Empire Rises!"
mon_khan.23.d:0 "In a bold but not surprising move, Sternberg under the guise of a reincarnated Genghis Khan took to his theatrical stage atop his fortified residence. Amongst piles of ancient weaponry and armour he stood, donned in golden plate and possessing a battle-hardened scar across the right side of his face, the once laughable eccentric now possessed an aura of intimidating energy. Addressing the gathering crowds he declared that the Mongol Empire shall rise once more, and with its rise will come a new age of war and conquest!"
mon_khan.23.a:0 "Hail to the horde!"

mon_khan.24.t:0 "An end to Republican Rule?"
mon_khan.24.d:0 "With the ascendance of the rabidly traditionalist Baron of Mongolia, many in our nation from Harbin to Shenyang have long whispered in fear of the terror beyond the steppe, now that they have struck an accord with our nominal allies in Japan, an envoy from Mongolia has demanded we abandon our republican government and embrace dynastic rule once more, by threat of force. \nMany in our nation resent the idea of abandoning our ideals so easily, but yet more dread the thought of standing up against both the Japanese and Mongols, and if we really have a choice in the matter."

mon_khan.25.t:0 "The New Mandate"
mon_khan.25.d:0 "Since the declaration of dynastic rule in Fengtian once more, there has been much talk but little decision about what dynasty exactly should be placed on the throne of China, the two primary schools of thought are either an existing alternative Chinese noble be enthroned or to invite the rule of the Japanese Imperial family, the former is most popular by far, supported by (resigned and grumbling) nationalists and more pragmatic elements alike, while the latter has the backing of the Concordia association citing Pan-Asian values. However, an alternative exists to both these camps, though they lack much popular support. This small but outspoken group claims that only though crowning a new monarch that neither side chiefly supports is the only way for China to remain unified, and the only candidates of fitting noble blood are our Buddhist friends to the West."

mon_khan.26.t:0 "A Shocking Denial from the Yiguandao"
mon_khan.26.d:0 "Our riders have returned from Jinan with somber expressions and muted anger as they trot solemnly into the center of Urga. Waiting for them was the Khan himself, already informed of the news via wire sent earlier in the day. The foolish Patriarch of the Yiguandao have flatly denied our diplomatic overtures, denying to work with our Khanate in any way, despite the similar goals of our two movements. Disappointed and enraged, the Khan has retreated to his grand yurt to blur the night away in a haze of women, opium, gambling, and booze as the riders return their horses to the grazing pastures. Though we have lost a potential ally this day, we have gained a new future foe - a fact that has deeply pleased our Khan who now seeks to show these cultists the error of their ways on the fields of war once we ride into the Middle Kingdom in full."

mon_khan.27.d:0 "Tokyo was greeted this morning to the bombastic and opulent arrival of a diplomatic delegation from the rising Mongolian Khanate to the West. Galloping into the central square before the Kōkyo, these riders from the Steppes have come bearing gifts and treasures from their growing empire of plunder, and have requested an immediate audience with the Emperor himself. These honorable yet savage horsemen offer us membership in their "Brotherhood of Eurasia", an alliance devoted to the defense and emphasis of our native and distinct traditions, pan-Asian unity, and anti-Western attitudes, to this end they ask us to sponsor their claims to the Russian empire, which would naturally put such a proposal at odds with the Transamurian government"
mon_khan.27.a:0 "Very well, we are stronger together!"

mon_khan.28.d:0 "With the ascendance of the rabidly traditionalist Baron of Mongolia, many in our nation, especially the Russians who had once served alongside him, have long whispered in fear of the terror beyond the Steppe.

mon_khan.28.a:0 "We have no choice, we must yield..."

mon_khan.29.t:0 "Transamur submits to our will"
mon_khan.29.d:0 "The pathetic fools in Transamur have submitted to our request, and now these Russian exiles have entered the fold. With this decision, they have abandoned their single-minded ambition to reclaim all of Russia, and instead have tied themselves to our regime."

mon_khan.30.t:0 "Another Far-Eastern War"
mon_khan.30.d:0 "Transamur has denied our humble and fair request, and now look as though they are preparing for war. Not since the Ruso-Japanese War have the Russians fought an Asian threat, and once more we shall prove them to be the underprepared fools.

Long has the Middle Kingdom served as a thorn in the sides of both the Mongolian and Japanese people, and with our cooperation, their downfall is all but guaranteed. We should prepare an official proposal for what our aims for the conference will be, particularly concerning how China will be governed in the likely result of our alliance’s victory.

The representatives of the Emperor and the Baron have now begun to present their own proposals while discussing and debating the finer points of our treaty and the final terms of the inevitable occupation of China. This deliberation is expected to go on for days, and will likely result in either a set plan being agreed upon, or more deliberation and counteroffers being issued until an agreement can be made or the whole conference falls apart."

The Baron's initial offer was not to our Emperor’s liking, but this is our mistake, for we should have known better than to leave the diplomatic minutiae to these savage nomads in a noble’s costume.  Our delegation has been instructed by His Majesty himself to pen our own proposal on our terms - hopefully one that will prove agreeable.

However, they have also returned with a counterproposal of their own. Should we accept these likely final terms, or shall we dismiss these pompous airheads back to their pathetic island.

Upon the beginning of this urgent and suggen meeting, these emissaries from Urga have announced that the Khan Ungern-Sternberg has invited our nation to the upcoming diplomatic summit dubbed the Urga Conference. The goal of this summit is supposedly to draw closer ties between certain like-mined regimes of the East, like ours and the Khanate, while working together for the defense and survival of our native and distinct traditions, while working towards pan-Asian unity while bound together by anti-Western attitudes. Though this offer is quite enticing, it would also draw the ire of many of the surrounding warlords and competing national governments vying for our land and China’s throne. What shall we do?"

POLITICS_KHAN_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', and officially referred to by his noble title, Darkhan Khoshoi Chin Wang in the degree of Khan, had a troubled upbringing, constantly moving and with a father who was committed to an insane asylum. His family estate in Estonia was burned down in 1905, which confirmed his anti-peasant and eventual anti-communist beliefs. He eventually joined Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg, where he became interested in the occult and buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia, where he became known for his heavy drinking and dangerous moods. In 1913, he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as an officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after not being allowed to fight for Mongolian independence. \n\nIn the First Weltkrieg, Ungern fought first in Galicia then, after a two month prison stint following an episode where he attacked another officer in a drunken rage, he would serve once more in the Caucasus. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the Whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently in his personal crusade against the communists. \n\nUngern eventually travelled through China where he married Manchu Princess Elena Pavlovna, or ‘Ji’. Eventually, he moved to Urga, and defeated the Chinese garrison stationed there, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne and proclaiming Mongolia independent. \n\nUngern himself did not get too involved in Mongol problems, but he kept the peace through force. After narrowly defeating a socialist revolution in 1921 and 1924, he was forced to get more involved. His forces prowled the streets as he hunted out dissidents and purged Mongolian society, including in temples. Though close friends and having similar ideas as the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, Ungern’s ambition knows no bounds. With Ungern’s grip dependent on his Russian military clique, there are fears he will continue to siphon power from the Bogd Khan for himself. \n\nThese fears were made manifest when Ungern was wounded in a battle with the Gada Meiren, falling into a brief coma and recovered prophetic, hallucinatory visions of Buddhidst deities and ethereal spirits. Upon his reawakening, the Mad Baron was dead, and a new Khan rose to take his place. Maddened beyond comparison, Ungern now believes himself to be the reincarnation of Ghenghis Khan and the avatar of Mahakala, the Buddhist God of Death. Now, this great Khan seeks to restore the great Mongolian Empire of old and spread his reign and unique strand of Buddhism across all of Eurasia."

POLITICS_JA_LAMA_DESC:0 "Mongolia has long been a land of myth, mystery, and legends, so it is no wonder how such a peculiar man as Ja Lama has come to rule the Steppe. Once known as Dambiijanstan and born in the lands of the Kalmyks in 1862, Ja Lama has come far in his long life. Spending much of his youth as a peddler and soothsayer in Astrakhan during the time of the old Tsarist regime, Ja Lama would eventually make his way to Mongolia in 1890 after numerous run-ins with the local law and as visions assailed his mind of a destiny calling him forth. \n\nRising as a warlord and anti-Qing revolutionary in the heart of Mongolia, Ja Lama would solidify his position within the minds and hearts of the Mongolian people after liberating the city of Khovd from Qing occupation, and has since led the city as its bandit king. From this triumphant victory, Ja Lama would continue to pursue a harsh war against the Chinese settlers that plagued Mongolia while also working to elevate his position and image as a true holyman and Mongolian hero. \n\nClaiming to be a true warrior tulku, a reincarnating custodian of a pure Buddhist soul, Ja Lama has much of Mongolia wrapped around his finger, and has now risen to be its newest Khan. As the supposed heir and reincarnation of the Oirat hero Amursana and the avatar of Mahakala, Ja Lama sees himself as the rightful saviour of the Mongolic peoples and the promised hero of prophecy who shall finally drive the Chinese from our lands and revive the Oirat Khanate of old. A man of stark dichotomies, he is a bloodthirsty, sadistic warrior who is known to flay his enemies alive while also being an extremely devout and pious adherent to Gelug Buddhism and the White Faith, albeit an overzealous and mad one at that. Under his rule, Mongolia shall endeavor to restore its former glories as Ja Lama consolidates his grip over the Steppe."
POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DESC:0 "Born in Chahar, Demchugdongrub was the only son of Namjil Wangchuk, Duoluo Duling Junwang of Sönid Right Banner and Chief of the Xilingol League. After the death of his father at only 6, Demchugdongrub inherited the title of Duoluo Duling Junwang. Under Yuan Shikai in 1912, he was promoted to the title of Jasagh Heshuo Duling Jinong. In Chahar he remained for many years, becoming a de facto leader of the province during the chaos following the end of the First Weltkrieg.\n\nDemchugdongrub didn't join Ungern-Sternberg's side until 1926, following Ungern's seizing of Chahar Province from the Guominjun. Ungern met Demchugdongrub in Chahar, and allowed him to keep his titles and to lead Chahar Province. Under Demchugdongrub, Chahar Province grew in military industry, and became far less rebellious against Ungern. In Chahar he remained for many years, funding Pan-Mongol movements throughout Inner Mongolia. In 1932, Demchugdongrub, with a number of other Inner Mongolian nobles, moved to Urga, to get more involved in its politics. Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Revolt, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, seized power. Now, Demchugdongrub's dream of a united Pan-Mongol state can be fully realised."
POLITICS_UNENBAYAN_DESC:0 "Much like many of the nobles who dominated Mongolian politics for many years, Ünenbayan was born in Inner Mongolia. Also known by his Chinese name, Wu Heling, he graduated from school in Chengde, and afterwards studied law in Peking University while also working at the Minister of Interior in the Beiyang government. There, he worked with Prince Gungsangnorbu of Harqin Right Banner at the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. After he graduated from university in 1926, he got more involved in Mongolian affairs, getting into contact with Prince Demchugdongrub and Yondonwangchug in Chahar. Eventually he decided to travel there, to work under Demchugdongrub in Chahar Province. Later, when Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga with many Chahar nobles, he left Ünenbayan there to effectively rule the autonomous province. He proved rather effective at this, only eventually leaving Chahar during the Western Revolt, so that he could assist Demchugdongrub in Urga. Following the successful democratic revolution lead by the Mongol Ardīn Nam, Ünenbayan lobbied to stop the discrimination against the aristocrats of Urga. Being a younger man now in power of Mongolia, Ünenbayan sees an opportunity to mend the rift between the rich elite and the poor peasants, while defending the democracy that Mongolia has become."
POLITICS_7TH_CHANGKYA_KHUTUKHTU_DESC:0 "Born Lobsang Pelden Tenpe Dronme, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu is an extremely important figure in Mongolia. During the Qing Dynasty and the short lived Beiyang Government, the Changkya Khutukhtu’s were the head of the Gelug line of Tibetan Buddhism in Inner Mongolia. After Ungern-Sternberg took the province of Xilingol from the Guominjun, the 7th Changkya Khutuktu declared his loyalty to Ungern-Sternberg, and travelled to Urga to work in Gandantegchinlen Monastery. After regularly holding speeches outside of the monastery, he became a very popular and important figure in Urga.\n\nHowever, his intentions changed in 1930. Ungern-Sternberg, after a small peasant rebellion in Urga, blamed multiple high ranking lamas, and purged them. This caused massive uproar in the highly buddhist society, especially in the upper echelons. The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu therefore decided to form the Buddyn Zövlöl, a secretive group of high ranking lamas who lobbied for increased theocracy in Mongolian society. After the Western Revolt, the Buddyn Zövlöl were able to seize power, and fully begin to implement their plan to reform Mongolian society to a Gelug Buddhist centre."
POLITICS_JAMSRANGIIN_TSEVEEN_DESC:0 "A central figure in Mongolian politics, Jamsrangiin Tseveen was born in Transbaikal during the Russian Empire. He went to a Buryat private school in St. Petersburg, and eventually began visiting Buryat tribes in Irkutsk. In 1902, he became an auditor at St. Petersburg University. While there, he went on many research trips across Transbaikal and Outher Mongolia. After a few years he began to teach Mongolian Language there, and also visited Inner Mongolia and Ordos. When the Bogd Khaanate became independent in 1911, Tseveen supervisied a secular Russian school there and was editor for two newspapers, the Shine toli and Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig.\n\nAfter Mongolia was occupied by Xu Shuzheng in 1919, Tseveen became a professor at Irkutsk University. He also travelled around the area and met with many discontent Mongolias, who eventually founded the Mongol Ardīn Nam. At their founding congress in 1921, Tseveen wrote the Ten Aspirations, the party’s platform. Following their failed revolution in 1921, Tseveen went into hiding in Transbaikal, helping continue to organise the MAN. After the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, Tseveen helped rally Buryat rebels in joining the MAN rebels in once again trying to overthrow Unger-Sternberg. After this failure and the death of their leader, Damdin Sükhbaatar, the MAN went back into hiding. Since then, Tseveen has travelled across the more empty regions of Mongolia, educating the people and conducting research.\n\nFollowing the Western Revolt and the MAN takeover, Tseveen began to see the problems in the party. Over the years he grew more disillusioned with the more radical elements of the party, and saw it as corrupt. Following a power struggle in the party, Tseveen created the Mongol Libyeral Nam, as an opposition to the MAN."
POLITICS_SOLIIN_DANZAN_DESC:0 "As a young man, revolutionary Soliin Danzan was a living as a horse thief, poor and struggle to survive. He lived like this for many years, until he went to Urga to work as a customs official in the Ministry of Finance. In 1919, he, Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, and Damdin Sükhbaatar formed the nationalist group Züün Khüree, which later merged with the Konsulyn Denj group, led by Dogsomyn Bodoo. For a few years after this, the MAN worked with Russian bolsheviks in trying to take over Mongolia. This culminated in the 1921 revolution against Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, which barely failed. Danzan went into hiding after this, as did the rest of the MAN. Danzan was one of the key organisers of the 1924 revolution, another failed mission which led to the death of Sükhbaatar. Following a dangerous power struggle with Dambym Chagdarjav and Dogsomyn Bodoo, Danzan became chairman of the party, once again in hiding. For the years since, Danzan helped push the MAN to a more nationalistic and less bolshevik group, completely disavowing from the failed bolsheviks from Russia.\n\nAfter the Western Revolt in 1936, Soliin Danzan and the MAN were able to seize power, finally allowing him to implement his policies. However, there are still many threats to his rule. The party is still very split, with power hungry members ready to strike. Also, the introduction of democracy, though something the party promises, could be a threat to the party’s rule."
POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DEMOCRATIC_DESC:0 "Born in Chahar, Demchugdongrub was the only son of Namjil Wangchuk, Duoluo Duling Junwang of Sönid Right Banner and Chief of the Xilingol League. After the death of his father at only 6, Demchugdongrub inherited the title of Duoluo Duling Junwang. Under Yuan Shikai in 1912, he was promoted to the title of Jasagh Heshuo Duling Jinong. In Chahar he remained for many years, becoming a de facto leader of the province during the chaos following the end of the First Weltkrieg.\n\nDemchugdongrub didn't join Ungern-Sternberg's side until 1926, following Ungern's seizing of Chahar Province from the Guominjun. Ungern met Demchugdongrub in Chahar, and allowed him to keep his titles and to lead Chahar Province. Under Demchugdongrub, Chahar Province grew in military industry, and became far less rebellious against Ungern. In Chahar he remained for many years, funding Pan-Mongol movements throughout Inner Mongolia. In 1932, Demchugdongrub, with a number of other Inner Mongolian nobles, moved to Urga, to get more involved in its politics. Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Revolt, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Noyodyn Zövlöl, failed to seize power, and he and the aristocrats faced much descrimination from the now empowered peasant Arats. Now, following Ünenbayan making Demchugdongrub Head of State, the Popular Prince finally has a chance to realise his Pan-Mongol dream."
POLITICS_GADA_MEIREN_DESC:0 "Few souls in Mongolia are as wild, free, and unknown as that of Gada Meiren. Like a vengeful spirit, he has raged against the forces that have beset the wondrous Steppe, cutting down Russians and Chinese alike in his crusade to free Mongolia from foreign tyranny and oppression. Born in the small village of Jam-Un Tokhui in 1892, the man now known as Gada Meiren was born as Nadmid of the Mültütü clan, once holding the Chinese name of Meng Qingshan - a stained moniker he has long since abandoned and forsaken. As the last surviving son of his family, he has been nicknamed as ‘lou ɣada’, the last son, which has become a sort of national nickname for the hero as the ‘last true son’ of a free Mongolia. \n\nAfter witnessing his lands be sold off to greedy Chinese settlers as a child, having his home ripped away from him and his family forced to flee, the young Nadmid swore revenge against the Qing and all foreign forces from that day forth. Upon reaching military age in 1921, Nadmid joined in with the local banner army, learning military tactics and earning his current title of Gada Meiren, referring to his status as an officer. \n\nAfter years of military service and further witnessing the Chinese rape the Steppe and the wilderness he called home, Gada Meiren attempted to peacefully ask the Chinese to stop their activities and settlement by traveling to Mukden with a diplomatic delegation, but were instead met with handcuffs and exiled back to the Steppe. This setback proved to be the final straw, and after his faithful wife Mudan rescued him from prison, he has served as a true freedom fighter to the Mongolian people and a horrid terrorist to the Qing ever since. \n\nHaving tacit links to the Mongol Ardīn Nam and their democratic mandate, Gada Meiren’s revolutionary acts and banditry has paid off, and after working with both nomads and peasants from the countryside and these pompous urban democrats to preserve Mongolia’s identity, the lands of the Mongol people have finally be saved. Now, Gada Meiren rules over Mongolia as its official Khan, but he has left the governing largely up to the MAN. Instead, this true spirit of the Tengri ideal continues his lifestyle living out the pastoralist ideal across the Steppe, ready to answer the call if the people need him again."

Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga in 1932 with Altanochir, and got quickly involved in its politics.

When travelling into Mongolia, he met Ungern and joined his side, due to his interest in Ungern's strange beliefs about buddhism and monarchism.

Following a diplomatic trip to Japan and then the USA, he went back to Mongolia, performing counterintelligence against the MAN revolution of 1924, where his intelligence lead to the attack of their base in Uliastai and the death of their leader Sükhbaatar. He continued to work counterintelligence, and grew even closer to Ungern, being promoted to the rank of general in 1926.

After some negotiations, Buyandelger defected to Mongolia, and travelled with Demchugdongrub to Urga so that they could be introduced.

POLITICS_URZHIN_GARMAEV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1888\nMakarovo Village, Transbaikal Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn to the Buryrat people, as a member of the northernmost Mongolian subgroup, Garmaev initially grew up to become a language teacher. He felt little in the way of a call to any national identity or supposed homeland, living most of his life under Tsarist oppression until he made a life changing visit in 1917 to the Tsugol Datsan Monastery. There, the chief Lama recommended he join the fight against the godless Bolsheviks to defend the Buryat and Buddhist way of life, encouraging him to enlist under the local cossack Ataman, Grigory Semyonov. Garmaev rapidly gained Semyonov’s attention and was tasked with recruiting Buryrat speaking soldiers, a task which he excelled at. He was promoted to the officer rank and assigned to the newly formed Buryat-Mongolian regiment 1919, which was sent to support Baron Ungern-Sternberg’s expedition into Mongolia. Garmaev became enamoured with the Mad Baron’s esoteric sense of Mongolian nationalism, having already begun to form his own set of core beliefs, after his visit to Tsugol Datsan. He was encouraged by both Sternberg and Semyonov to preach pan-Mongolian nationalism to the regiment’s troops, as well as the civilians they came across, as a means to indoctrinate them into opposing the Bolsheviks. This eventually caused Garmaev to break with Semyonov, as he grew fearful that the Ataman merely wished to exploit the Buryats and the Mongols for his own purposes, whilst viewing Sternberg as a more rightful leader, who truly had the Mongolic peoples best interests at heart. He was rapidly promoted into a leadership position by Sternberg, and has maintained a great deal of influence, both within the Mad Baron’s administration, but also a growing popularity among the right leaning Mongolian nationalists who have come to accept Garmaev as one of their own."

MON_cavalry_primacy:0 "Cavalry Primacy"
MON_cavalry_primacy_desc:0 "Cavalry has always been the key to warfare in the Mongolian Steppes, so let us not discard it easily but rather master it. To even move through this harsh land let alone outmaneuver the enemy we have to accept cavalry as our main force."

MON_increase_gun_production:0 "Invest in Weapon Research"
MON_increase_gun_production_desc:0 "Our army's weapons are obsolete and nonstandard, with most of our forces looking like they just raided a museum with a mix of weapons from the weltkrieg to even the 19th century. Therefore if we wish to keep up with the aggressively expansive Chinese armies we must ensure our equipment is kept up to a modern issued standard."

MON_aggressive_industrialisation:0 "Aggressive Industrialisation"
MON_aggressive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Mongolia’s population often lives outside our few cities and even outside towns, meaning that our industrial base is pretty small. Thus we should start to encourage investors from Russia and other places to start up business and industry in our steppes. We will encourage and attract them with free reign, and seeing that we defeated the socialist revolts, workers rights will be but a false idol in our lands."

MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg_desc:0 "One of the problems that caused the revolt in the West and the chaos that descended into Urga was because we were forced to share power.

MON_cooperate_with_monasteries_desc:0 "The monasteries, the more neutral ones at least, are not our enemies. They bring faith and goodwill to our people, aid in tax collection and humanitarian works, and serve as our link to the gods themselves. We should try to work with them to destroy the rising tide of radical Buddhist influences and fundamentalism that has begun to sway many sects and monasteries to more dangerous ideals.

MON_empower_the_workers_desc:0 "The arats, or peasant class, form the overwhelming and massive majority of Mongolian citizenry, and yet they hold next to no power against the nobles, monks, and other officials that crowd out Mongolia’s bureaucracy with their greed.

MON_remove_power_from_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles have oppressed the people’s will for long enough, and the previous government under Ungern-Sternberg practically helped them do it!

MON_mongolian_consitution:0 "Draft the Mongolian Constitution"
MON_mongolian_consitution_desc:0 "With the foundations of our new democracy established, we can not finally pen a new document outlining the new laws and guidelines for this shining new republic we have built.

MON_end_old_institutions:0 "Modernize Traditional Institutions"
MON_end_old_institutions_desc:0 "Many old Mongolian institutions are ancient bodies created either by the traditional monasteries or the Russian Baron Ungern-Sternberg.

MON_limited_freedoms:0 "The Inherent Rights of Man Restored"
MON_limited_freedoms_desc:0 "For years, Mongolians have lived oppressed and subjugated existences without knowing the joys of true liberty and freedom at all. With the ascension of our democracy, this will change. By legislating a new bill of rights outlining the basic human rights each and every Mongolian citizen is now entitled to, true democracy and liberty shall be granted to our people, and this our people have never know these benefits, we can air on the side of caution as to not shake up our fragile society too much."
MON_revolutionary_military:0 "A Revolutionary Military"
MON_revolutionary_military_desc:0 "A new and modernized military is necessary to defend our new democracy, for the old armies of the Ungern regime were nothing more than mere thugs and bandits preying on the weak of Mongolia.

MON_defensive_approach_desc:0 "Our army is small, young, and weak, and our numerous enemies are powerful and numerous. Taking an offensive approach in any conflict would surely get us all killed, but luckily we have a few tricks up our sleeve. Mongolia is home to natural barriers and terrain suited for defense. With the rugged Steppe and the harsh Gobi serving as natural shields and fortresses separated by massive expanse of prairie, no enemy will be able to sneak up on us while we hold out within these natural bastions. With these defensive tactics forming the basis of our new military strategy, the Mongolian heartland will never fall!"

MON_reimburse_nobles_desc:0 "The nobles, though they were in the wrong before, have been thoroughly mistreated by the revolutionary-democratic interim administration.

MON_encourage_investment_desc:0 "For Mongolia to truly grow and thrive, we will need investments and aid from foreign businesses.

Together with these foreign benefactors, Mongolia shall prosper once more!"
MON_traditional_values:0 "Promote Traditional Values"

MON_political_freedoms:0 "The Mongolian Red Scare"
MON_political_freedoms_desc:0 "The Socialists that infest the MAN party have gone too far in their revolutionary pursuits. The people must be taught that socialism does not help them, but instead further divides us - preying upon our unique identities and desire for a better life as they seek to rip away the very essence of what it means to be Mongolian.

Prime Minister Ünenbayan, on the other hand, does not share this popularity. Perhaps it is time for him to step down, and allow Demchugdongrub to take his place."
MON_MAN_win_election:0 "MAN Election Victory"
MON_MAN_win_election_desc:0 "The Mongol Ardīn Nam, Mongolia’s first and oldest political party, have won the election. This democratic wing of the main leftist party in Mongolia seeks to slowly bring Socialism and all its glories to the people of Mongolia in the pursuit of a better, more free and equal Mongolian society, and they have already shown to be dedicated in this pursuit. So dedicated that they have begun to crowd out all other democratic elements in the nation to establish an effective political monopoly over all of Mongolia to enact their dreams unhindered."

MON_freedom_of_press_desc:0 "Now that we have secured a democratic mandate, perhaps it is time to allow true freedom and liberty to reign for our people so that all may live how they choose so long as it does not infringe upon the inherent rights of others. To support this initiative, a measured but free press to operate legally in Mongolia. Without unrestricted access to information or the ability to voice one’s own complaints, we are no better than the Ungern regime who tried to keep most of the Mongolian people in the dark.

All Mongolians must be made equal within the eyes of the law so that our judiciary operates in a fair and measured way. The status of one’s birth or the religion one follows shall no longer dictate what laws you must adhere to. There shall be one codified list of laws, and all in Mongolia shall be made to follow them, for no one, not even the Bogd Khan, is exempt. All will kneel before our mandate of justice, for even gods can be made to obey our laws."
MON_MAN_rigged_elections:0 "MAN Puppets Democracy"
MON_MAN_rigged_elections_desc:0 "With the rise of the cautious clique that seeks to puppet true democracy in the name of ‘true’ prosperity and progress for all, the MAN has moved to puppet democracy in Mongolia. Bending this strange fusion of vague constitutional monarchism, radical Progressivism, and moderate Socialism under the Bogd Khan to their will, the MAN will ensure electoral success and peace for terms and terms to come in order to enact their idea of the egalitarian Revolution."

Instead, all these duties and privileges shall be passed on to the MAN government, entirely shackling Mongolian Buddhism and traditionalism to our ‘democratic’ mandate. We may not be able to fully eradicate theism in Mongolia, but we will fully bend it to our will and needs."
MON_revolution_via_reform:0 "Revolution Through Guaranteed Reform"
MON_revolution_via_reform_desc:0 "By crippling the democratic process and completely subjugating it to their will, the MAN has ensured that their dominance shall not be uprooted for decades to come.

MON_aid_poor_in_cities_desc:0 "With the rise of modern society in Mongolia, many began to move into cities and settle down, betraying our nomadic roots for ease and comfort. Cities like Urga now hold much of our populace while the rural Mongolians still clinging to the old ways are further and further left behind.

MON_buryat_allies:0 "Buryat Allies"
MON_buryat_allies_desc:0 "Much of our party’s support comes from Buryat exiles who fled from Russian aggression in Siberia and Transamur.

MON_russian_influence:0 "Controlled Foreign Influences"
MON_russian_influence_desc:0 "Much of our party’s rhetoric is based on liberal parties in Russia and China like the Kadets and the Chinese Youth Party of Qing.

MON_empower_landowners:0 "Empower Landowners"
MON_empower_landowners_desc:0 "Rich landowners are some of our main supporters in Mongolia, and control much of the land that many arats work on. They should be empowered in law and incentivized in policy so that they are swayed to help stop any chance at peasant uprising or popular revolt."
MON_pay_off_officers:0 "Bribe Disloyal Officers"
MON_pay_off_officers_desc:0 "Many of the officers of our army lack loyalty to our government, instead having loyalties to only cash and riches in the wake of Ungern’s fall. Using our vast wealth, we should bribe some of them to ensure their loyalty, for without these men we are defenceless."
MON_national_citizen_guard:0 "Form the Mongolian State Arat Guard"
MON_national_citizen_guard_desc:0 "Not many of the regular arat masses support our regime, seeing us as greedy fools detached from true Mongolian nomadic life. However, within the cities, particularly in Urga and Khovd, concentrated pockets of loyalists to our regime exist. We should form the Mongolian State Arat Guard, a group of our regular citizenry and ardent loyalists rallied and trained as a skilled militia to fight against rebel peasants who might seek to disrupt our mandate to rule."
MON_princes_personal_guard:0 "Reform the Kheshig"
MON_princes_personal_guard_desc:0 "In the past, the Kheshig were the loyal, sworn defenders to the Khans and princes of the Mongol Empire. Today, many of the nobles and princes have a personal guard to protect themselves, but they are a far cry from their predecessors. These guards should be reforged into an elite fighting force and better organised so as to fight off rebels and foreign foes alike."
MON_aristocratic_kingdom:0 "The Aristocratic Khanate"
MON_aristocratic_kingdom_desc:0 "Finally, the Yazgurtan Survaljtan have fully solidified their hold over Mongolia, once again ushering in an age of noble rule on the Steppe. After having to share power with Baron Ungern-Sternberg for so long, these aristocrats now have the mandate to rule by themselves, and the Bogd Khan shall be their monarch. We can now turn Mongolia back to a nationalist state rooted in our culture and traditions."
MON_traditional_army:0 "An Army Rooted in Our Traditions"
MON_traditional_army_desc:0 "Our army has been transformed, for our previous armed forces were far too influenced by our reliance on Russia. We should move to create a more traditional, organised army based on Mongolian tactics and strategies, not the foreing-stained tactics of a disgraced ‘world power’."
MON_private_prince_recruitment:0 "A Unified Princely Army"
MON_private_prince_recruitment_desc:0 "The personal levies and militias of the princes and lords of Mongolia should be transformed to a grand, unified, and standardized princely army. Under a unified front and with better cohesion and organization, we shall be better able to protect our Khanate and the nobility of Mongolia from foreigners and rebels while allowing them to command their own troops."
MON_unite_princes_recruitment:0 "The Mongolian National Honor Guard"
MON_unite_princes_recruitment_desc:0 "The best, most skilled, and most experienced soldiers in our armed forces shall be organized into a National Honor Guard unit. These veterans shall serve as the vanguard forces to our armies and as the official bodyguards to the nation’s highest political and spiritual figures. These heroes of Mongolia shall be the last line of defense for our culture and our very identity."
MON_organise_army_divisions:0 "Reorganize the Mongolian Banner Armies"
MON_organise_army_divisions_desc:0 "The main army of Mongolia must not be left to mothball and wither as we update and reform our special forces and princely armies. The main and myriad banner armies must be reorganized as well, for they serve as the frontline and main mass of our armed forces. This rabble of arats, nomads, and other enlisted peasants must be reforged and made anew, for without this main force, any war effort we undertook would crumble. Any local bannerlords who do not fall in line shall be replaced with loyal nobles instead to ensure the loyalty and obedience of our main fighting force."
MON_military_council_in_urga:0 "The Urga Military Council"
MON_military_council_in_urga_desc:0 "Our ability to plan out and undertake the complexities of modern warfare is severely lacking, for our armed forces still largely exists with no overarching organisation between generals and military leaders. A grand unified military council in Urga should be formed to coordinate the nation’s military efforts and strategies so that our reformed armed forces can be ever ready to defend the people of our Khanate."
MON_militant_nation:0 "A Militant Mongolian Spirit"
MON_militant_nation_desc:0 "War and conquest are in the very blood of true Mongols, for we have a centuries-strong legacy of victory and battlelust. We must evoke this warrior spirit once more, and spread it to encompass all of Mongolia. We are a nation of soldiers and warriors, nomads and riders. To conquer and to pillage is our destiny, and to strive for victory is the only righteous goal."
MON_review_the_budget:0 "Trim the Fat from the Budget"
MON_review_the_budget_desc:0 "Spending was increased massively and recklessly under the regime of Ungern-Sternberg. Failed industrialisation schemes, poor army management, and backbreaking payments to the Russian government has our Khanate on the verge of bankruptcy and economic collapse. We must decide what to do, and what we must cut, to save our struggling economy."
MON_continue_status_quo:0 "A Return to the Old Status Quo"
MON_continue_status_quo_desc:0 "The old status quo of Mongolia was long controlled by the princes and nobles of these lands as the kin of the great Temüjin himself. This legacy gives us our right to this mandate, and is what helps keep us in power as servants, or masters, of the Bogd Khan. Traditionalism is the basis of Mongolia, and this should be continued and encouraged, for our past is what shapes us more than anything."
MON_cut_costs:0 "Reverse the Baron’s Lavish Spending"
MON_cut_costs_desc:0 "The Mad Baron has lavish tastes and a bottomless appetite of greed that was insatiable no matter how much plunder and treasure he amassed. Hoarding this loot, he spent it only on himself and his luxurious, hedonistic pursuits, leading the Mongolian economy to ruin. It is painfully clear that spending massively spiralled out of control under the Baron’s rule, and though it will be hard, these cuts must be made and these funds appropriated by the state, all for the good of our national financial state."
MON_landowners_rights_act:0 "The Landowners Rights Act"
MON_landowners_rights_act_desc:0 "During the chaos of the 1921 and 1924 Revolutions, and later during the chaos of the great Western Revolt, a slew of new, emergency-measure rights were hastily given to landowners, landlords, and other property-owning citizens as a means of securing themselves and their properties from the ravages of national unrest. With this chaos now over and dealt with, and these new rights proving to make these landlords far more loyal to our regime, we have decided to consolidate and organize these laws into an expanded, formal Landowners Rights Act, which will enshrine these property owners as a prioritized social class above the arats and nomads but below the lamas and the princes. In this position they shall become a true middle class and pseudo-nobles, growing our economy, enriching and expanding our culture, and providing a new, powerful social class that is loyal to our regime."
MON_encourage_nomadism:0 "Encourage A Return to Nomadism"
MON_encourage_nomadism_desc:0 "Much of Mongolia’s population is completely nomadic, moving around through the year rather than settling permanently. This idea is enshrined in Mongolian society, permeating throughout our peoples and their lives for centuries. People in the cities of Khovd or Urga should instead be encouraged to return to their roots and the roots of their ancestors, so they are both more in tune with our shared traditions and easier to control due to being spread out and less likely to- conspire in large groups against us."
MON_encourage_foreign_business:0 "New Mongolian Entrepreneurialism"
MON_encourage_foreign_business_desc:0 "Other than Russian business, the Baron’s rule has starved us of foreign investment. We should encourage this if we are to survive and thrive in the modern world. With their investments, we shall foster a new Mongolian small business community that shall help create a new Mongolian entrepreneurial class, further diversifying the economy of Mongolia as we break free of Russian domination and build a healthy Mongolian economy that can stand on its own two feet. Of course only businesses and families pre-approved by the princes will be allowed to participate in these business ventures, with most being other nobles or landowners, Mongolia’s economy will still flourish."
MON_dissolve_organisations:0 "Purge Mongolia of Rival Organizations"
MON_dissolve_organisations_desc:0 "Since the chaos of the Western Revolt, we have tolerated the existence of opposing organisations that rival our rule. From the MAN and their democratic allies to the fundamentalist Buddhists and even rival landlords and lower nobles who have forgotten their place as they attempt to rise above their station. We must put these rabble rousers and peasants in their place. We have consolidated our rule over this Khanate and our sway over the Bogd Khan enough to easily justify banning and dissolving these organizations at once."
MON_the_traditional_nation:0 "Pure Mongolian Traditionalism"
MON_the_traditional_nation_desc:0 "Mongolian society is inherently traditionalist. This must be encouraged, to stop the calls for revolution. The two failed revolutions of 1921 and 1924, the failed Western Revolt, and even the failures of the Mad Baron have all shown their is only one constant in Mongolia - our rule. We are the heralds of tradition and the beacons of Temüjin’s legacy. Traditionalism shall be the only ideology or dogma we prescribe to, for all others shall only lead Mongolia astray and to damnation."
MON_mongol_identity:0 "The True Mongol Identity"
MON_mongol_identity_desc:0 "In the past, Mongolia was a great empire covering massive swathes of Eurasia in the largest contiguous empire the world has ever seen. Since this golden age, many have tried to subdue and erode our culture, from the Russians to the Chinese. Through it all, what it means to be a Mongol has survived, and now we shall make it prosper. We are the true sons and daughters of Genghis Khan and the heirs to an undying legacy forged in the war and conquest. We are the Mongols, nothing more, and nothing less."
MON_statue_of_genghis:0 "The Heirs of Temüjin"
MON_statue_of_genghis_desc:0 "We as a nation must remember our history, and our greatest leader, Genghis Khan. The great Temüjin is a perfect example of the Mongol identity which we want to encourage in our new state. Therefore, a great statue of him should be constructed in Urga, to push this idea of Mongolism and a cult of personality shall be erected around his image. Our nobles are the true heirs to his bloodline and his throne, and as such, they are the perfect people to lead our Khanate - a fact all Mongolians shall be forced to behold and know to be true."
MON_great_independence:0 "Our Eternal Independence"
MON_great_independence_desc:0 "Mongolian people must always fight to be independent, for we have only so recently earned it from our revolution from the Qing, and we shall not lose it again so easily. We are at constant threat from the Chinese and from the Russians, and therefore every Mongol has the duty to protect the nation. Every man shall be taught to fire a rifle and every woman shall be taught to dress a wound. We pray to the gods and the sky itself that we never need to use these skills, but it is better to know and not need them, than the alternative."
MON_mongol_nationalism:0 "Traditional Mongolian Nationalism"
MON_mongol_nationalism_desc:0 "Nationalism is a key part of our regime. The people must see themselves as great once again, and must be encouraged to protect the nation at all costs. A unified Mongolic identity must be crafted from the disparate tribes, ethnic groups, and peoples that make up the one Mongolic race. Oirats, Daurs, Buryats, Moghols, Kalmyks, Thukhums, Tatars, Khamags, and more - we are all Mongols."
MON_remembering_our_history:0 "Roots of Our Past, Seeds of Our Future"
MON_remembering_our_history_desc:0 "With these new ideas on nationalism, our founder Temüjin, and on what it means to be Mongolian itself all established and dedicated, we must now teach it to the next generation in order to cement these ideals as part of wider Mongolian culture. This rhetoric shall be pushed in all schools, whether they be secular or monastic, to ensure all Mongolians learn the truth about their identity."
MON_great_mongolian_state:0 "Ikh Mongol Uls"
MON_great_mongolian_state_desc:0 "Olnoo Örgögdsön Mongol Uls, the State of Mongolia Elevated by the Many, or Ikh Mongol Uls, meaning the Great Mongol State, are the two official names of our Khanate, and they hold great meaning to our people. Only with the many: the many sacrificed, the many princes and nobles, the many lamas and tulkus, and even the many arats all work together, playing their part and fulfilling their destined role and niche, to ensure Mongolia’s survival. Only with all of our people can our state truly be Great. We carry with us a millenia old legacy, and with the many peoples of Mongolia, we shall not falter as we carry this legacy to our destiny."

MON_buddhist_mongolia:0 "The Buddyn Zövlöl’s Theocratic Revolution"
MON_buddhist_mongolia_desc:0 "Mongolia at its very core is a Buddhist nation, and yet foolish foreigners and local warlords have tried and failed time and time again to eradicate our influence. However, we have always endured, for even in the wake of the horrors committed against Buddhists and the clergy in the Revolutions of ‘21 and ‘24, or under the Ungern regime’s endless purges, our faith and our purity have survived. Now, under the Buddyn Zövlöl, Mongolia shall once begin on the Eightfold Path as we seek to establish a true and pure Theocracy under the Bogd Khan and the Buddyn Zövlöl."
MON_declare_nobles_traitors:0 "Divinity Reveals All Truths"
MON_declare_nobles_traitors_desc:0 "Long have vile elements infiltrated the minds and souls of the Mongolian people, leading them astray and down the path of sin and impiety as they cloud their judgement with silver-tongued lies. Only the righteous truth that faith brings can cleanse this haze, and the lamas, tulkus, and monks of the Buddyn Zövlöl are just the divine messengers to oversee this change."
MON_arrest_noble_council:0 "Cleanse the Yazgurtan Survaljtan"
MON_arrest_noble_council_desc:0 "The Noble Council, led by Demchugdongrub, are a heretical and blasphemous group of greed-fueled traitors. For far too long has their unbridled ambition and thirst for power clouded their judgement, leading them to fail Mongolia time and time again. Claiming authority based on mere status and tacit blood connections to the long dead Khan of Khans, these fools have had enough time at the top. The entirety of this aristocratic council shall be arrested, and those who resist shall faith divine judgement instead."
MON_slander_sternbergs_buddhism:0 "Slander the Baron’s Perverted ‘Buddhism’"
MON_slander_sternbergs_buddhism_desc:0 "The Mad Baron Ungern-Sternberg lorded around as a false tulku and heretical prophet, claiming to be a true believer in Buddhism in all aspects. With these lies, he was able to influence and attract much of our naive populace to his foul bastardization of our pure faith. We must show these fools they have been lied to, and instead reintroduce them to the purity of Gelug Buddhism."
MON_end_russian_influence:0 "Eradicate All Russian Influence"
MON_end_russian_influence_desc:0 "Russian influence is pervasive in Mongolian society. For too long have these savages sought to diminish our culture and eradicate our faiths, all for their own gain due to our opportune position on the Steppe.

MON_distribute_aid_through_monasteries:0 "Faith Heals All Wounds"
MON_distribute_aid_through_monasteries_desc:0 "The poor and downtrodden of Mongolia have been oppressed and neglected by every regime to lead before our mandate. The previous regimes of the nobles, the Chinese, the Russians, and Ungern have all done nothing but neglect our people in pursuit of their own self interests. We should give out aid and basic welfare through the monasteries to gain their support."
MON_empower_monasteries:0 "Empower the Monasteries"
MON_empower_monasteries_desc:0 "The various monasteries, monastic complexes, temples, and stupas that dot the Steppe are the cornerstone of Mongolian society. They are pure beacons of piety and faith as we all strive towards enlightenment and inner peace. These holy sites should be protected and empowered to have official say in government proceedings, forming a larger national Buddyn Zövlöl made up of these loyal sites and our own established leaders all under the guidance of the 7th Changkya Khtukhtu and the Bogd Khan."
MON_prosecute_non_buddhists:0 "Persecute Non-Buddhists"
MON_prosecute_non_buddhists_desc:0 "Non-buddhists are generally rebellious types, fighting against our government and raging against our culture. Among them are the Chinese, the Russians, the Socialists and secular democrats, the shamanists and other savages that follow the accursed ideas of Ak Jang - all these sects of Mongolian society writhing in heresy and hedonism. These putrid spawn do not belong in Mongolian society! We shall persecute, expel, and eradicate this plague until all of Mongolia is made pure. We shall have our revenge for the horrors committed against our people, and through law and blood, justice shall be served."
MON_theocratic_state:0 "A Pure Theocratic Khanate"
MON_theocratic_state_desc:0 "Finally, Buddhism has won in Mongolia, winning out over the unfaithful and the impure. We can now push to transform Mongolia towards its destiny as a true and pure Gelug theocracy, similar to the governments of our friends and brothers in faith in Tibet and Bhutan. How, we shall take it further, for we shall strive to create a true slice of Shambhala here on the Steppe."
MON_militant_buddhism:0 "Militant Buddhism"
MON_militant_buddhism_desc:0 "Buddhism, though seen largely as a peaceful religion under the principle of ahimsa, can easily be interpreted to justify violence just as well. The dukkha, or sin and impiety, of others must be expunged and eradicated, as it is a weakness and obstacle on the path to Nirvana. We should encourage any strain of militant or fundementalist Buddhism that should arise on the Steppe and hone these ideas to protect the nation and our faith."
MON_rally_for_buddhism:0 "Guardians of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu"
MON_rally_for_buddhism_desc:0 "The Jebtsundamba Khutuktu is the key leader of Mongolia, serving as the Bogd Khan, an elevated title of the Bogd Gegen, denoting both his political and spiritual primacy as the head of our society. All in Mongolia are his servants, for he is our main tether to divinity and the temporal world. Our armed forces must be trained and thoroughly indoctrinated to hold the Bogd Khan as a deity and divine avatar, and as such, must swear to defend him with their lives, no matter the cost."
MON_purge_the_military:0 "An Army Free of Heretics and Secularists"
MON_purge_the_military_desc:0 "The officer class is full of disloyal, corrupt, and self-serving officers and generals who have no loyalty nor faith in the teachings of the Buddha. Heretics, secularists, and even putrid Socialists are spread throughout our military’s ranks, as well as the armies of the various princes and warlords. These disloyal officers and soldiers must be purged from military service, and if need be sent to the next life entirely, so that a new officer class can be created - one free from vice and truly pious in their adherence to the Eightfold Path and the militant path to Nirvana."
MON_recruit_through_monasteries:0 "Monastic Recruitment Scheme"
MON_recruit_through_monasteries_desc:0 "The many khiids, or monasteries and other temple complexes of the Buddhist faith spread across the Steppe, receive a great deal of visitors and new tenants each day. Whether they be mere visitors, true believers on a pilgrimage, or wayward souls come to stay and train at our holy sites, these individuals are the perfect fodder to recruit into our growing military. We shall establish recruiting stations in these khiids and official training schools in their monasteries, training both clergy and laity how to fight as we prepare for war."
MON_fight_to_the_death:0 "Heralds of Eschaton"
MON_fight_to_the_death_desc:0 "People of Mongolia must be taught that the nation comes first, rather than their own life. Protecting Buddhism and Mongolian society is more important than survival and self-preservation, for until they escape the painful cycle of Samsara and reach Nirvana, they shall forever be faithful servants of our Khanate. Zealotry, dogmatic piety, and rabid fundamentalism shall all be proliferated within our state, fomenting a rabid national appetite for war and conquest. We shall prove our faith through purification and bloodshed as the heralds of the End Times."
MON_lama_officers:0 "Tulku Officers"
MON_lama_officers_desc:0 "The Lamas are some of the most intelligent and skilled leaders in Mongolian society, serving as the spiritual leaders of our people and chief advisors to the Bogd Khan as the leaders of the Buddyn Zövlöl.

MON_buddhist_law_desc:0 "With the Buddyn Zövlöl’s hold on Mongolia solidified, they can now move to enact their plans to enshrine Buddhism’s place at the center of Mongolian society. Following the cosmic laws of Dharma and the fundementalist, extremist, and hyper-zealous beliefs of the militant Buddyn Zövlöl, a new legal code shall be created for Mongolia. The various schools of Buddhism shall be enshrined as the state religion, and any and all citizens who break the edicts and principles of our faith shall be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law."
MON_militerise_police_force:0 "Militant Buddhist Peacekeepers"
MON_militerise_police_force_desc:0 "To protect the Buddhist theocratic revolution brilliantly orchestrated by the Buddyn Zövlöl, the police force must become a fully militarised force, made loyal only to the Bogd Khan and our council. These dogmatic defenders of the faith shall be the first line of defense on the homefront, providing security and ensuring safety and absolute piety within our borders. To handle any serious or heretical threats, our new secret police force has been given far reaching powers and access to the best military supplies our state can muster to eradicate the enemies of the state."
MON_protect_the_jebtsundamba_khutughtu:0 "Safeguard the Buddhist Faith"
MON_protect_the_jebtsundamba_khutughtu_desc:0 "The people and police must be taught that protecting Buddhism is paramount. Piety is key, and heretical thought shall only subjugate us further to the sick and cruel cycle of reincarnation. Only through strict adherence to Buddhist principles may we all attain Nirvana, and so strict adherence to Buddhism must be ensured by any means necessary."
MON_buddhist_education:0 "A Truly Pious Buddhist Education"
MON_buddhist_education_desc:0 "The education of Mongolia must be completely reformed, to instead become an education based on, and only on, Buddhist teachings. Children will be indoctrinated from a young age to act in full accordance with Buddhist principles, and all schools in the nation shall be run by members of the clergy. The only knowledge our people need is their faith."
MON_teach_in_monasteries:0 "Academia and the Monasteries"
MON_teach_in_monasteries_desc:0 "Monasteries are the perfect place to teach our new Buddhist education. This should be encouraged. The largest monasteries in the nation shall be partially converted into centers of higher learning, effectively serving as Buddhist universities. Here, we can better monitor everything our intellectuals learn and teach as well as better integrate what findings they do gleam into our regime."
MON_ban_all_other_religions:0 "The Non-Buddhist Ban"
MON_ban_all_other_religions_desc:0 "Other religions are dangerous for Mongolian society. Mongolia is a Buddhist nation, and therefore Buddhism should be the only legal religion. All other faiths, from Ak Jang to Orthodoxy and Tengri to Taoism shall be banned from practice in our Khanate, and only the various Buddhist schools and branches will be permitted."
MON_develop_other_religions:0 "Develop The Varied Mongol Faiths"
MON_develop_other_religions_desc:0 "Other minor religions in Mongolia should be allowed to remain legal, so as not to anger the people. Instead, these religions should be developed to help support Buddhism and Mongolian society. Oddities like the White Faith to larger minority religions like Confucianism and Orthodoxy shall be minorly permitted, and Tengri will be allowed to exist among the nomads. Under our watch, we can slowly influence these faiths and their followers in Mongolia towards more Buddhist ideas and principles."
MON_destroy_shamanism:0 "Eradicate Black Shamanism"
MON_destroy_shamanism_desc:0 "Black Shamanism is followed by small, mostly nomadic groups in Mongolia. This form of Mongolic shamanism denies any and all Buddhist influences, and seeks a total return to the archaic old religions of the Steppe, primarily focusing on old Buryat, Oirat, and Altaic beliefs. They should be forced to instead follow Buddhism or face persecution."
MON_evolve_shamanism:0 "Embrace Yellow Shamanism"
MON_evolve_shamanism_desc:0 "Black Shamanism can be evolved and altered, to instead act as a form of Buddhism for these nomadic societies that still follow it. By forcing Buddhist influences into these old beliefs, we can slowly bring many of these nomads over to our side. Doing so would be difficult without aid, but luckily such a movement already exists, called Yellow Shamanism for their relation to the Yellow Hat, or Gelug, school of Buddhism. By championing this fusion of shamanist and Buddhist beliefs, we can finally mend the religious divide that has fractured the Steppe for centuries."
MON_allow_shamanism:0 "Exclude Shamanism from the Ban"
MON_allow_shamanism_desc:0 "We cannot ban a faith that is so ingrained to our society’s history and tradition, even if it goes against our government. Shamanism is nearly as old as our society itself, and to cast off this tradition would be an affront to our ancestors. Genghis Khan allowed freedom of religion, and so should we, just this once, for this truly Mongolian faith."
MON_buddhist_brotherhood:0 "Embrace the Four Noble Truths"
MON_buddhist_brotherhood_desc:0 "The Four Noble Truths serve as the first teachings ever given by the Buddha, and form the basis of most of our beliefs. Dukkha teaches us that suffering and pain are inescapable, as we are all caught in the vicious cycle of rebirth that is samara. Samudaya, or the arising, fuses our Dukkha with our Taṇhā, or desire, furthering our pain as we prepare for Nirodha, or the cessation of this agony by letting go of desire and craving. Finally, Magga - the Noble Eightfold Path - opens to us, ceasing suffering and opening the way to Nirvana. Our state has endured these Four Truths in our bloody and excruciating climb to greatness, and now the path to Nirvana and true prosperity is open to us."
MON_follow_buddhist_principles:0 "True Followers of the Eightfold Path"
MON_follow_buddhist_principles_desc:0 "Our path and guide to the enlightened state of Nirvana, the Buddhist principles outlined in the Noble Eightfold Path should be enshrined in law, to make sure the people are working for the state, for Buddhism, and towards Nirvana at all times. With the right view, resolve, speech, conduct, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and samadhi, or mediation, we shall open to doors of enlightenment to all true and pious Mongolians as we create the perfect pious state here on Earth."
MON_monastery_aid_program:0 "Embrace the Principle of Dāna"
MON_monastery_aid_program_desc:0 "Dāna, or generosity and virtuous kindness, is a key tenet of most Buddhist schools. Often interpreted as charity, our state seeks to take it a step further.

MON_develop_rural_villages:0 "Develop Rural Mongolia"
MON_develop_rural_villages_desc:0 "The numerous rural villages, settlements, and hamlets that dot the Steppe are struggling massively, especially in the West following the recent revolt. We must enrich these frontier communities, for they are the lifeblood of our nation. Over 60% of our nation lives like this, and as such these groups must be developed so that they can become self-sustainable and actually contribute to our society."
MON_construct_more_monasteries:0 "Expand Monastery Complexes"
MON_construct_more_monasteries_desc:0 "Many monastery complexes were destroyed or partially wrecked in the various revolutions, bandit raids, and purge Mongolian Buddhist have endured.

MON_poverty_in_urga:0 "From Arats to Anagārikas"
MON_poverty_in_urga_desc:0 "The masses of arats, or peasants, in Mongolia have long lived in squalor, especially within the urban sprawls of Urga, Ordos, or Khovd. With the aid of the various monasteries, we must uplift these poor, hungry, and dirty masses. We must wash away their sin and their grime and bring them into the light of Buddhism. We shall offer them clothes and food and a warm place to sleep, and in return, they shall become Anagārikas - low monks in training made to be fully devoted to the state, the Bogd Khan, and the Buddyn Zövlöl."
MON_support_the_fellow_man:0 "Civic Uses For the Khiids"
MON_support_the_fellow_man_desc:0 "The khiids, or monasteries of Mongolia, must be made to provide more than spiritual aid and simple charity and services expected of most modern churches, regardless of faith. Using the monasteries as shelters, halfway houses, health clinics, libraries, schools, government centers, and more shall expand the amount of services available to our people while ensuring everything they input has been sanctioned by the state. This will also draw the monasteries closer to the central Buddyn Zövlöl itself, furthering our control over all Mongolia."
MON_benevolent_lamas:0 "Gifts from the Benevolent Lamas"
MON_benevolent_lamas_desc:0 "Some of the lamas and other high tulkus, or reincarnating holymen, of our society are relatively wealthy. Over the years of collecting donations, amassing hordes of tribute and holy relics, and living in lavishly decorated monastic complexes, the lamas have access to more wealth than any arat. We shall incentivize and encourage these Buddhist clergymen to act in benevolence to help the poor, in accordance with the Buddhist principle of Dāna."

MON_nomadic_economy:0 "Building a Modern Mongolian Economy"
MON_nomadic_economy_desc:0 "For centuries, we have strived as a nomadic people with little change in our way of life. However, as the world around us modernises and develops, our present monetary structure will be utterly useless.

MON_uliastai_factory:0 "The Mercantile Hub of the Steppe"
MON_uliastai_factory_desc:0 "Uliastai is one of the most important settlements in the nation, being a key centre of trade for hundreds of years, and the one of the largest settlements West of Urga. If we focus development and economic incentive on the town and its surrounding regions, especially regarding industrial development, it will surely complement our efforts to revitalise our economy."
MON_fund_nomadic_development:0 "Adapt Our Nomadic Lifestyle"
MON_fund_nomadic_development_desc:0 "Even today a large proportion of our population are nomads and live their lives in such a way. Of course, we cannot simply force all our citizens to abandon their lifestyles instantly, therefore we must adapt and aim to compliment it instead by aiding their lifestyle. This includes the development of roads across the steppes and subsidies to nomadic families."
MON_expand_urga_industry:0 "Expand the Great Settlement"
MON_expand_urga_industry_desc:0 "While Urga is the largest and most populated city in the country, it does not compare to the economic might or size of other capital cities across the world. If we wish to see Mongolia stand high upon the world stage, it is imperative that Urga is expanded, developed, and industrialised so that it may act as an example to the other cities across the nation." 
MON_military_factory:0 "Mongol Militarization"
MON_military_factory_desc:0 "In this new age of warfare, we are abominably outmatched by almost all our surrounding neighbours; our guns are outdated, our equipment is scarce, and the rate of weapon production is laughable. This is in no small part due to our almost non-existent military industry, which must be developed to support our armies and to protect our nation's independence from whoever may dare to try and take it."
MON_weapons_development:0 "New Weapons for a New Age"
MON_weapons_development_desc:0 "One of the main issues that have appeared as a result of our lack of military development is the lack of proper weapons, and we have been falling behind on acquiring new weapons for some time. Our guns are old and only getter older, while our enemies amass better weapons year by year. It is only a matter of time before they use them against us, and only through extensive research into new weapons will we withstand them."
MON_start_mongol_highway:0 "Fund the Trans-Mongolian Railway"
MON_start_mongol_highway_desc:0 "The Trans-Mongolian Railway is an ambitious plan that has never truly been realised - until now. With government incentive, we can fulfil this dream and create a railway that spans across the vast swathes of land, starting with Urga and the surrounding area."
MON_khovd_factory:0 "From Yurts and Gers to Houses"
MON_khovd_factory_desc:0 "Khovd is yet another settlement located on the far reaches of the nation, isolated and arid. It is often the site of trade much like Uliastai, but the settlement itself has undergone very little change over hundreds of years, being merely composed of many tents and camps. However, if it were to be developed into a proper, modern city, then it could prove especially useful in our developing economy."

MON_military_focus:0 "Horselords of the Steppe"
MON_military_focus_desc:0 "The Mongolian military has been dominated by mounted troops as the very nature of our nation’s terrain has caused cavalry to be preferred, however with two changing powerhouses bordering us we must think of expanding our horizons if we wish to keep up."

MON_recruit_to_the_army_desc:0 "We require new ideas and efforts to attract our nation’s men into joining the army. Begin efforts to gather more recruits from the massive arat, or nomadic peasent, population. They make up roughly 96% of Mongolia's population, so they shall be the main source of our new recruits."
MON_train_officers:0 "Train the Bo'ols and Kheshig"
MON_train_officers_desc:0 "Our officers, from our bo'ol generals to our Kheshig officers, typically lack the discipline and good training that makes what other nations call an officer. Therefore we need to start training them to be able to properly lead, and only then do they gain the satisfaction of being called an officer."
MON_recruit_nomads:0 "Arm and Train the Nomads"
MON_recruit_nomads_desc:0 "The nomadic peoples of our nation are typically moving around, which made attempts to recruit them difficult despite the large portion of the population they made up. We require this manpower pool to be available to us."
MON_recruit_from_tribes:0 "Enlist the Tribals"
MON_recruit_from_tribes_desc:0 "Not one area should be overlooked when it comes to potential recruits to our armies, therefore we should begin looking to the far and isolated villages of our nation to gather more fighting men.

MON_reorganise_military_structure:0 "Reorganize Military Structure"
MON_reorganise_military_structure_desc:0 "One thing that has become apparent is how different the Chinese military thinks compared to ours, so perhaps by grabbing some doctrines from their playbook we can begin to remove those wayfaring souls that still cling to the old ways of the Mongolian Military before the coming of the Chinese."
MON_chinese_military_officers:0 "Chinese Officers"
MON_chinese_military_officers_desc:0 "The Chinese Officers obviously have a lot to teach us, especially after our defeat where our ignorance in the ways of warfare was shown.

MON_kuomintang:0 "Mongolian KMT"
MON_kuomintang_desc:0 "The Chinese Kuomintang has led it’s way back to control of both China and Mongolia, so the former elements of our own Kuomintang which has been buried in obscurity these past few years have recently resurfaced.

This idea is crucially needed in Mongolia, so let our KMT elements finally bring forth this platform into our nation."
MON_push_for_industrialisation:0 "Push for Industrialisation"
MON_push_for_industrialisation_desc:0 "Economic Modernization has always been sought in Mongolia, but where before it was mainly for the profit of the elite’s grasp on the nation, now it’s needed to bring forth our market into the world stage as well as China. First thing on the list is getting rid of those informal cottage workshops and turning them into vast factories."
MON_kmt_military:0 "The Mongolian NRA"
MON_kmt_military_desc:0 "The National Revolutionary Army of the Chinese KMT propelled them to victory, for they were inspired by the prospects they upheld. Without these prospects victory surely would not have come to them, so it should only be expected that here in Mongolia we introduce these same ideals and teachings. That way our forces can be advantaged both tactically and spiritually. We will win in the battle of hearts and minds."
MON_kmt_propaganda:0 "Kuomintang Propaganda"
MON_kmt_propaganda_desc:0 "The Kuomintang value the prospect of communication, for there is nothing more powerful to a human than words.

MON_kmt_mongolia:0 "Kuomintang Control"

And to start, the cancer that has been the Chinese occupation must be excised."
MON_fuck_the_chinese:0 "Proliferate Anti-Chinese Thought"
MON_fuck_the_chinese_desc:0 "As Amursana has proclaimed, the Chinese have been nothing but a blight upon the Steppe and its peoples.

From the time of our initial conquest over the lands they now call theirs to our interactions with the famed Muscovy of old, to much more recent times such as the conquest of all of Siberia and their incursions into Mongolia with their accursed Trans-Siberian Railway, we have combated and sparred with these Slavs at every step and turn. We shall finally rid ourselves of these savages once and for all, and through any means necessary."
MON_start_myths:0 "Spread the Legend of Ja Lama"
MON_start_myths_desc:0 "The man now known as Ja Lama, the warrior ‘tulku’, was born in the lands of the Kalmyks in the former Russian Empire and spent much of his youth in Astrakhan as a peddler - a fry cry from the average life of a true tulku. Myths and tales of Ja Lama’s deeds and miracles must be spread throughout Mongolia so that all learn the truth! Ja Lama IS a true avatar of a reincarnating spirit and a tulku by birth, and he shall make all in Mongolia learn this ‘truth.’"

MON_local_prophecies_desc:0 "Superstitions and divinity run rampant through the spiritual culture of Mongolia, with prophecies, divinations, and other forms of divine foresight being commonly exchanged and spread, with many holding great reverence. One such prophecy has long claimed that a descendent of Amursana would rise once again to lead the unification of the nomadic peoples and the freeing of the Oirats, Altays, Mongols, and all other of our kin held under the boot of foreign oppression. Our regime must influence these prophecies, planting the seeds of ‘truth’ that Ja Lama is indeed this promised son, and he shall lead the nomads of the Steppe to freedom and power."

MON_deal_with_bogd_khan_desc:0 "The 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the Bogd Khan, is the key spiritual figure in the nation, as well as the most widely accepted political authority in the nation. If our regime is to survive and truly control Mongolia, he will need to be dealt with, one way or another."
MON_burkhanism:0 "Spread The White Faith"
MON_burkhanism_desc:0 "Ak Jang, the White Faith, is a syncretic nationalist religious movement originating within Altai groups in Russia that has begun to spread across the Steppe. Millenarian in nature and incorporating aspects of ancient Altaic spiritual beliefs with Tengri, Buddhist, Eastern Orthodox, and other various shamanistic ideas, this fusion of creeds and dogmas is led by hierarchy of oral historians who sing the histories of our very people, able to recall centuries of knowledge through song and chant. Seeking to unite the nomadic peoples of East Asia under one faith and banner, Ja Lama has latched himself to the movement. We should aid in the spread of this faith and make it an official state religion alongside Gelug Buddhism."
MON_embrace_nomadic_lifestyles:0 "Mongolian Pastoralism"
MON_embrace_nomadic_lifestyles_desc:0 "The pastoralist lifestyle is second nature to a true Mongolian. We are a people of nomads and wanderers, adventurers and conquers! We should never set deep roots into the soil, for we are ever on the move as we move towards our destiny. Our way of life is and always should be intertwined with the land, but never pinned to it. Return to the ways of the Khans of old, for this Arcadian ideal is both our past and future."
MON_skin_flaying:0 "New Mongolian Art"
MON_skin_flaying_desc:0 "Ja Lama, in his many years experiencing the beautiful brutality of war and human struggle, has grown a certain morbid appreciation for art. His own yurt is adorned with many of his favorite pieces, both inside on the walls and outside, fluttering in the wing like flags or tapestry. However, these canvases are no meager linen, but leather. However, not just the mere leather of lesser creatures like yak or sheep, but made from the mightiest and most ferocious of all the Earth’s beasts: Man. The flayed skin of his enemies is what adorns our Lama’s home, and this practice shall be spread across Mongolia - a true warrior-nomad artstyle for our resurgent Khanate."

MON_continue_raids_desc:0 "The world’s obsession with modernity and industrialization have been a disaster for the Mongolian people. We must raid against this oppressive machine and rage against the long, dark night so that our people and our heritage do not get consumed by the desecrating forces that seek to consume our very collective soul. Without rest nor respite, we shall pour out from the Steppe and pillage every beacon and bastion of this ‘modern world’ so that we may grow rich off their burning corpses and secure as their bodies lay at our feet."

MON_mahakala_larp_desc:0 "Ja Lama has been elevated to the level of a near god-like figure in Mongolia. He is the Avatar of Mahakala, the Hindu-Buddhist God of Time, Maya, Creation, Destruction, and Power. Like a true god of death and devastation, he shall lead the Mongol hordes to exterminate the enemies of our people and restore the great legacy of the Dzungar Khanate of old. Under Mahakala’s banner, our armies shall march, our enemies shall perish, and a new pan-Mongolic state shall rise. The Oirats have their champion, and the rest of East Asia shall soon meet their doom."
MON_expand_jas_army:0 "A True Mongolian Horde"

We shall amass the largest warhost modern Mongolia has seen and use it to take back the lands of our people and our kin. The ground will shake with the thunderous charging of our cavalry as we ride upon our foes and slaughter them at every turn. All enemies of the Mongolia people shall be brought to the sword or trampled under our hooves."
MON_horde_tactics:0 "The Legacy of Genghis"
MON_horde_tactics_desc:0 "Genghis Khan is a man who needs no introduction. Able to conquer nearly two-thirds of Eurasia in his own lifetime and earning a spot within the Tengri pantheon, he was a true God among men. We must emulate his abilities, tactics, and legacy and apply them to our modern Mongolian military. Emulating and modernizing his tactics will surely allow us to repeat the successes he once had."
MON_guerilla_army:0 "Guerillas of the Steppe"
MON_guerilla_army_desc:0 "The rough terrain of the Mongolian landscape is varied and rugged. Though plains stretch across the nation, so too does crags, deserts, and the great Steppe itself. By mastering this terrain and using it our advantage, our relatively small force of highly trained soldiers shall be able to take on the titans of Russia and China without fear of their massive numbers."
MON_expand_recruitment:0 "The Mongolian Wave"
MON_expand_recruitment_desc:0 "Mongolia may not have a massive population, but for every soldier we field, their steed is right there alongside them. In unison, thousands of these riders on horseback form a near unstoppable wall of power and Mongolian national pride. We shall build up our cavalry forces even further, swelling their numbers and breeding mass amounts of war horses to ready ourselves for the coming war."
MON_scavage_guns:0 "Battlefield Procurement"
MON_scavage_guns_desc:0 "As we fight more wars and leave behind the ruins and rubble of battle, the lands surrounding us have become littered with the former equipment and supplies of our fallen foes.

MON_raiding_army:0 "Raid and Pillage"
MON_raiding_army_desc:0 "Raiding and pillaging is the true Mongol way, and our armies have had this ingrained in the very fibre of their being. While on the warpath, all of our enemy’s treasures shall be ours as our troops sweep through their lands and claim everything of value as rightful plunder of our righteous war effort. When not at war, our armies shall transition from a standing army into smaller raiding parties, sent out across our border regions and neighboring lands in search of bounty. No matter the state of our nation, war or peace, raiding shall be constant as a facet of the Mongolian identity."
MON_hunt_down_gada_meiren:0 "Hunt Down Gada Meiren"
MON_hunt_down_gada_meiren_desc:0 "The foul peasant ‘revolutionary’ Gada Meiren has been a thorn in our side for far too long. Though his actions for the Mongolian people are admirable and his fight against the Chinese noble, he is too much of a wildcard to be left in play. We must hunt him down and silence him for good.

MON_commit_more_gamer_moments:0 "Cut Them All Down"
MON_commit_more_gamer_moments_desc:0 "The Mongolian populace must be made pure and wholly Mongolian. Our fellow Mongolics, from the mighty Oirats to the Alatic peoples and even the far-off Kalmyks, our shared people are righteous. However, not all races can be so lucky. The last of the Russian and Chinese settlers too stubborn or foolish to leave will be dealt with so that Mongolia can once more be pure."

MON_lamas_fifedom_desc:0 "Mongolia has been cleansed of foregin parasites, internal weaknesses, and ideological poison. These lands are ruled by Ja Lama now, and all in Mongolia must swear fealty to him.

Our Khanate shall be freed of the Gamin and made purely, wholly Mongolic as we build a new society for our people."
MON_agricultural_development:0 "An Agricultural Revolution"
MON_agricultural_development_desc:0 "Though we are a nomadic people, we also must be self-sufficient, and we cannot feed an entire growing nation on the bounties of the wild alone. Ja Lama has envisioned a Nomadic Agricultural Revolution for Mongolia, where massive farms would be built to the fertile East of the nation, with farm-hands rotating so that workers are not separated from the nomadic lifestyle for too long, while the West and interior of the nation surrounding the Gobi would serve as pasture land for our ever-growing grazing herds. Though expensive, it is just what Mongolia needs to feed its populace while also staying true to its nomadic roots."
MON_expanded_education:0 "A True Mongol Education"
MON_expanded_education_desc:0 "Every child in the state must be given a proper education, teaching them the ways of their nomadic heritage, the faiths of their people, and the true history of the Mongolian peoples. With much of the curriculum being penned by Ja Lama himself with loyal academics and spiritual leaders grainting their guidance, a new educational code shall be created for all Mongol children to learn. The next generation will know the truth of the Mongolian legacy!"

MON_fight_corruption_clergy_desc:0 "Much of the clergy within Mongolia are corrupt, with tainted and dubiously-motivated monks and lower tulkus preying on the good faith of our people for their own gain.

These new priests shall have true loyalty to the White Faith and Buddhism, but also to Ja Lama himself."
MON_nomadic_primacy:0 "Nomadic Primacy"
MON_nomadic_primacy_desc:0 "We are the people of the yurt, the true and original nomads of East Asia, and the eternal wanderers of the Steppe. The nomadic lifestyle is the foundation of our religions, our society, our culture, our military, and so on. It is the very identity of the true Mongols, and so all true Mongols today shall live as their ancestors did. Learning from how they live can help teach us how to have a productive and efficient society without the need of settled cities and urban prisons of concrete and steel."
MON_raid_economy:0 "An Economy Built on Plunder"
MON_raid_economy_desc:0 "The very lifeblood of our entire economy is based on bounty, plunder, treasure, and the fruits beared by our countless hordes of raiders and riders and that roam East Asia for the good of our Khanate.

MON_control_the_monastaries:0 "Control the Monasteries"
MON_control_the_monastaries_desc:0 "The many Buddhist, Tengrist, and other monasteries and churches that dot these lands must be swayed to our side, one way or another.

MON_deal_with_democrats:0 "Silence the Cries for Democracy"
MON_deal_with_democrats_desc:0 "Though relatively well suppressed by the Ungern regime, democrats and republicans have begun to rear their ugly heads once more, particularly the Ardīn Nam. We must crush these vile forces, for the Mongolian people have no say in their governance anymore."
MON_nobility_problem:0 "The Issue of the Nobility"
MON_nobility_problem_desc:0 "The princes and nobles of the Yazgurtan Survaljtan have nearly always been influential in Mongolia, long ruling these lands before the rise of the Bloody Baron.

MON_end_gada_meiren_desc:0 "Gada Meiren, the nomadic people’s hero of the Steppe, has long raiding our borders, settlements, and farmlands, salting our fields and slaughtering our people in the name of a ‘free’ Mongolia.

MON_drive_out_the_chinese_desc:0 "If we are to truly colonize these wild borderlands and revive the dream of Zheltorossiya, we must first handle our last main competitors for this region: the Chinese. Long has the Dragon of the South eyed the Steppe for conquest and colonial enterprise, but they shall not have this chance. We will drive out the last of the Chinese settlers and their imperialist holdouts, for Mongolia belongs to the Russian Bear and no one else."
MON_anfu:0 "Rebirth of the Anhui Clique"
MON_anfu_desc:0 "Long exiled to the Steppe since the disaster that was the Northern Expedition, the Anhui Clique has once again established a stable foothold after nearly dying out after the German Intervention.

A cabal of Capitalists, captains of industry, financiers, and other cronies of capital all united in their wish to see our Anhui Clique ruling over China, the Communications Clique is the lifeblood of our economy and one of our only allies in the maelstrom that consumes the Middle Kingdom. We should move to strengthen our ties with their sharp-minded investors, allowing them to fund our industrial build-up and militarization process as we prepare to take China for ourselves."
MON_srs:0 "The Soyombo Revival"
MON_srs_desc:0 "Named for an archaic script designed by Zanabazar, the first leader of Tibettan Buddhism, to standardize Mongolian, Sanskrit, and Tibetan writings, the Soyombo Revival Society is an odd group of Russian immigrants and generals who model themselves on ancient Mongolian secret societies. Holding minorly esoteric views on spirituality and syncretic religions, this varied band of Russian nationals will now drive Mongolia towards a new destiny: the revival of Russia colonialism in East Asia and the completion of the Zheltorossiyan plan."
MON_cuck_to_trm:0 "An Ode to Vladivostok"
MON_cuck_to_trm_desc:0 "We must align with the rightful Russian Government that has been long exiled to Vladivostok. Not only is their capital far closer to ours, making cooperation far easier, but also their time living at the end of the world in a harsh environment makes them kindred spirits with the Russians of our lands. We shall tame the Steppe, and they shall tame Siberia, and together, we shall retake Moscow from those decadent traitors to the hardy Russian ideal."
MON_bow_to_none:0 "Bow to None"
MON_bow_to_none_desc:0 "Torn between rival governments and futile political debates, the Russian people are fractured. The Moscow and Vladivostok governments are at each other's throats, with our people only getting caught in the crossfire. To choose a side now would only lead us further into darkness, unrest, and uncertainty. We shall always be Russians, and forever loyal to our identity and our culture, but at least for now, we must march our own way to build a peaceful, united home for our people."
MON_russian_immigration:0 "The New Russian Frontier"
MON_russian_immigration_desc:0 "If we are to truly tame the Steppe and make it the new frontier for Russian expansion and settlement, then we are going to need more bodies.

MON_russian_colonization:0 "A Resurgent Russian Colonial Spirit"
MON_russian_colonization_desc:0 "Colonialism is in the blood of the Russian people. Since our ancestors claimed all of Siberia and the wilds past the Urals, casting out the Sibir, the Altay, and many others in their conquest, the very essence of colonial triumph has been bound to the Russian identity.

### Events ###

mon.1.t:0 "A History of Mongolia"
mon.1.d:0 "Mongolia was under the control of the Manchu Qing Dynasty for centuries, until the 1911 Xinhai Revolution led to Mongolian independence under the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the head of Mongolian Buddhism, who took the title of the Bogd Khan. China still claimed Mongolia as Chinese territory, and Mongolia’s independence was shattered in 1919, when Xu Shuzheng, a Chinese warlord of the Anhui Clique, occupied the country. However, in 1920, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, a White Russian military leader, leading his Asiatic Cavalry Division, took Urga from the Chinese, and restored the Bogd Khan.\n\nUngern enforced the Khan’s rule with an iron fist, crushing revolts and dissidents while making deals with the aristocratic Mongol Princes. The Mongol Ardīn Nam, a socialist party inspired by the Bolsheviks, was formed, and began a revolution in 1921 to overthrow Ungern’s regime. Due to lack of foreign support, this revolution failed, and the MAN were forced to go into hiding. Following the near-death and temporary coma of the Bogd Khaan in 1924 due to his poor health and a possible failed poisoning attempt by Ardīn Nam agents , the MAN rebelled again, claiming Ungern no longer held any legitimacy in the country without his liege. This revolution was harshly repressed, and multiple senior members of the MAN, including their leader Damdin Sükhbaatar, were executed, forcing the shattered MAN remnants into hiding once more. In this time, Ungern made deals with the Russian government, for economic and military support, and his forces were also able to seize Xilingol from the Chinese Guominjun. Ungern's rule was still shaky, however, and following a series of peasant uprisings in 1930 led primarily by Buddhist lamas and the nomadic patriot Gada Meiren, Ungern purged many high ranking lamas in his government, destroying much of the support he had accrued over the years.\n\nWith the Bogd Khan’s ever failing health and Ungern’s ever rising ambitions, the future of Mongolia is uncertain, especially as old foes and new enemies begin to stir once more."
mon.1.a:0 "What about now?"

mon.3.t:0 "A Charge Against Gada Meiren"
mon.3.d:0 "The sun rose high across the Eastern Steppe as yet another unruly and chaos-filled day began anew to test the Bloody Baron and his struggling regime. If it wasn’t putting down the week’s tenth marauding bandit horde, it was once again doing battle with the infamous Gada Meiren and his radical separatists - no day offered rest or respite for the Mad Baron, and it has begun to take its toll. \n\nUngern-Sterberg has never been a fully stable man, and the constant state of war his mind swirls in coupled with the rigors of running a state as backwards as Mongolia have truly begun to wear away the aging warlord’s remaining sanity and health. However, nothing like a good fight returns the vigor and desire for conquest and power to the Bloody Baron’s veins, and fate would just have it that another fight was brewing on the horizon. \n\nTo the East, the famed Gada Meiren, rebel leader and Mongolian nationalist revolutionary, and his forces have been seen amassing once more, poised to strike into the heartlands of Mongolia yet again and wreak havoc on the Baron’s domain. Never shying from a fight, the Baron Ungern-Sternberg has rallied his forces of Russian exiles and hired mercenaries and tribals to ride to meet this ‘lou ɣada’ and his hobbled-together militias on the fields of battle. \n\nAfter marching towards each other for a full day and a night, the two forces met and began their clash on the grasslands outside the village of Mandurkhu, with the riders of the Mad Baron and Gada Meiren viscously greeting each other with bow and sabre. In a thunderous crash of steel on steel and beast on beast, the writhing masses of these rallied cavalry hordes slammed into one another with the force of a freight train, causing sparks to dance off swords and armor as red mist filled the air, turning the sky as red as the bloody soil beneath them. \n\nAfter hours of struggle and horrific slaughter, the dust began to settle as a calm quiet swept across the once raging battlefield. Though a pyrrhic conflict for both sides, a clear, but bloodied and bruised, victor is left standing, but who?"  
mon.3.a:0 "Routed, Gada Meiren flees the maelstrom, barely, and rides off into the Black Gobi."
mon.3.b:0 "The Mad Baron is savagely cut-down in battle, and Gada Meiren has claimed his head!"
mon.3.c:0 "Ungern-Sternberg was struck by a stray arrow, but managed to reach his horse to escape to Urga!"

mon.2.t:0 "The Result of the Power Struggle"
mon.2.d:0 "The Mongolian Khanate has been thrown into absolute chaos with the apparent death of the Bloody and Mad Baron himself, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. With the passing of this false Khan, Mongolia is now free to decide its own political destiny, but no one said this decision would be peaceful or blood-free. Even now, the various forces that have long vied for power and wished for the Baron’s fall now all move at once to jump on this one chance to seize power before the power vacuum created by the Khan’s departure to the next world fully closes as it finds a new occupant to fill the void. \n\nFrom ambitious nobles to radical Buddhists and foreign interests, people from all walks of life and from all schools of thought seek to make Mongolia, our Mongolia, their own plaything, as if our nation was just a vehicle to achieve their own greedy ends. Whatever their reasoning, desires, or true end goal, nothing will change the fact that only one group can rule Mongolia. After the dust settles and these bickering, warring factions have had their shot at seizing the mandate to rule Mongolia, who shall stand atop the pile of them all to rule these wild lands?"
mon.2.a:0 "The radical Buddhists take power to cleanse impiety and sin from this paradise!"
mon.2.b:0 "The nobles and princes have long schemed for this day, and have seized power!"
mon.2.c:0 "The People's Revolt takes power for Democracy and true Mongolians!"
mon.2.e:0 "The infamous wanderer Ja Lama marches on Urga!"
mon.2.f:0 "Foreign officers and plotters take power, toppling Mongol rule from within!"

mon.300.t:0 "A Baron Dies, but a Khan is Reborn"
mon.300.d:0 "Urga is in chaos and the Baron is in a comma, and not a soul in Mongolia knows what will happen next as the various forces and factions within our Khanate now seek to tear apart everything Ungern-Sternberg and the Bogd Khan have worked to achieve. In a yurt at the center of the city, the Mad Baron now lies unconscious, writhing in agony and muttering broken gibberish as a heavy fever claims his body and delirium and delusion seize his mind. \n\nAs the world rages around him, Ungern-Sternberg was locked away in the vault of his own mind, oblivious to the numerous aides and attendants that now worked without end to try to revive their dying patriarch. Roman’s mind was a light with fantastical visions and near-prophetic glimpses of pure Nirvana - his very psyche and soul reaching out into the cosmic expanse and seemingly communing with the very essence of the Universe itself, though it is just as likely that these vision have less to do with divine intervention and more to do with the last of the Baron’s functioning brain matter slowly suffocating and decaying away. \n\nAs the voices ceased and the cacophony that stormed within his mind finally subsided in a sudden instant, the eyes of the Khan bolted open once more with life, now blood-shot and wildeyed like never before. Without hesitation or warning, the Khan let out a primordial scream that shook the heavens and nearly deafened those in the yurt with him who were tending to his wounds, before finally uttering but one complete phrase...."
mon.300.a:0 "The World shall tremble in fear, for now I am become Mahakala, the Destroyer of Worlds."

mon.4.t:0 "The Nation Stabilizes"
mon.4.d:0 "Fighting across the nation is coming to an end, as [MON.GetName] defeats all opponents. As rival armies collapse, Mongolia nears unity and stability is finally returning to the nation. Now, we can focus on cementing our rule and establishing a cohesive government. "
mon.4.a:0 "Fantastic!"

mon.42.t:0 "Buddyn Zövlöl Takes Power"
mon.42.d:0 "The Buddyn Zövlöl, a secretive council of buddhist lamas, have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
mon.42.a:0 "For Buddhism!"
mon.42.b:0 "For Buddhism, and the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu!"

mon.43.t:0 "Ungern Retakes Power"
mon.43.d:0 "Ungern-Sternberg has retaken power in Urga. Though he now hold de jure control of the nation, his influence outside Urga remains limited, and he will have to act fast if he are to keep his power"
mon.43.a:0 "For Ungern!"

mon.44.t:0 "Noyodyn Zövlöl Take Power"
mon.44.d:0 "The aristocratic Mongol Princes, under the leadership of Prince Demchugdongrub, have seized power in Urga. Though they now hold de jure control of the nation, their influence outside Urga remains limited, and they will have to act fast if they are to keep their power."
mon.44.a:0 "For Order!"

mon.45.t:0 "MAN Seizes Control, but Must Decide its Future"
mon.45.d:0 "The Mad Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg is dead, and all of Mongolia is in chaos. The central government has entirely collapsed, and the only shred of legitimate governance within the nation is now rallied around the Mongol Ardīn Nam, leaders of the People’s Revolution and the Mongolian Spring. \n\nThis MAN, the largest and oldest unified political party in Mongolia, has long sought to bring true democracy and modern reform to Mongolia, and exist as a large coalition of democrats from all across the spectrum, with the largest and most dominant faction being the moderate socialists by far, who stand as remnants of the original MAN that led the 1921 and 1924 failed revolutions. Purged of their radical faction who all ran into exile across the wider Socialist world such as in Russia before the Reds fell, India, France, Italy, England, and beyond, the MAN preaches the thoughtform of Socialism through peaceful and democratic reform at all costs. However, the party has begun to split on one matter: how ‘fair and free’ should our new democracy be? \n\nFearing that opening up this democracy to the masses, and more harmfully the nobility and clergy, would bring about a backslide from our Democratic Socialist and Social Democratic goals, many have begun to suggest that democracy in Mongolia should be rigged from the outset. By putting on a charade for the public and the rest of those democratic bodies outside our Leftist wing, we could preserve our vision without angering the public. The pushback to this idea is predictably harsh, but that does not mean that it is out of the realm of possibility. Which section of the debate about the future of the MAN shall win out \n\nIn stark contrast to the Ardīn Nam’s noble democratic pursuit, Gada Meiren stands as the other main unifying force within Mongolia. Though his support base is not as large, he has far more support among the rural and tribal population of the Steppe, and as an ardent Mongolian nationalist and war hero, he has even been able to win over many of the more nationalist or militarists elements that despise the more liberal Ardīn Nam. Seeking to radically reform Mongolian society, ousting foreign leeches in favor of pro-Mongolian populist policies, Gada Meiren has shown to be a strong force to reckon with and a true rival to the Ardīn Nam. Though their competition is fierce, the two forces are near evenly matched, and whoever wins out in the coming power struggle is anyone’s guess."
mon.45.a:0 "The MAN sticks to true democratic principles!"
mon.45.b:0 "The MAN moves to rig Mongolian democracy from the beginning."
mon.45.c:0 "Gada Meiren, the Last Son, proclaims victory for all true Mongolians!"

mon.46.t:0 "Ja Lama Advances on Urga"
mon.46.d:0 "Smoke and ash filled the skies of Urga as Ja Lama entered the smoldering city. Bandits, revolutionaries, and mercenaries have all already made their mark on this city in the wake of the Mad Baron’s passing, and only chaos reigned over this city of madness now. \n\nJa Lama’s main prize was the central palace of the city, currently standing as the only bastion of order in all of Urga, where the Bogd Khan sits waiting behind sealed doors and armed guards, waiting for stability to once again settle over the city. Knowing that peace would not come on its own, Ja Lama and his forces knew what they had to do. Drawing sabres and mounting their steeds, Ja Lama and his riders would cleanse Urga of this raucous rabble, saving the city and the Bogd Khan first, then he and his forces would repeat the same in village after village and town after town until all of Mongolia has been brought to heel once more. The Baron is dead, and the Bogd Khan still reigns, but this is Ja Lama’s Mongolia now."
mon.46.a:0 "The heir of Amursana returns home."

mon.47.t:0 "Foreigners Take Control of Mongolia"
mon.47.d:0 "In the wake of Ungern-Sternberg’s demise, the various foreign wolves and vultures that his rule kept at bay were now free to spread across all of Mongolia like parasites and scavengers moving in to rip apart a newly deposited carcass. Of the two main groups of are the Chinese remnants of the Anhui Clique’s political wing - the Anfu Club - who seek to restore Gamin rule over Mongolia and later all of China, and the Soyombo Revival Society, a pro-Russian group composed mostly of old Ungern-Sternberg loyalists and other Russia expatriates who seek to turn Mongolia into a Russian client state bent on retaking Manchuria. Both these groups are well-funded and well-connected, and now it is only a matter of which one shall take over Mongolia and which direction our people will be steered in."
mon.47.a:0 "For the Anfu Club!"
mon.47.b:0 "For the Soyombo Revival Society!"

mon.49.t:0 "Ungern loyalists march toward Urga"
mon.49.d:0 "After we were able to seize power of the government, loyalists of the tyrannical Mad Baron escaped. Now, after mustering and rebuilding a small amount power in a village nearby, these troops are coming back to retake the city. The army, a mix of Mongols, Russians, and Chinese bandits number over a thousand troops. With most of the national army in the west, we only have the power of the civilians and the hastily established revolutionary militia to defend the city."
mon.49.a:0 "Call on civilians to resist, and march in the militia."
mon.49.b:0 "Call on the citizens to resist these traitors!"
mon.49.c:0 "Lay down our arms, no need for a massacre."
mon.50.t:0 "Ungern loyalists destroyed"
mon.50.d:0 "Finally, after much fighting and many casualties, Ungern has been killed, and his troops have been repulsed. Urga is ours, for now."
mon.50.a:0 "The people of Urga want change!"
mon.51.t:0 "Ungern loyalists have captured Urga!"
mon.51.d:0 "After little fighting, Ungern and his troops were able to take back the city. Though most of our officials have escaped, we are unlikely to be seen as the real government without power in Urga."
mon.51.a:0 "Those men are more Russian than Mongolian."
mon.52.t:0 "Re-evaluation of Monastery funding"
mon.52.d:0 "With the power now in the people’s hands, and with Mongolia modernising every day, one key thing to evaluate is the funding the monasteries receive from the government. The monasteries, though an important aspect of Mongolia, is a very traditional area of the nation, and many lamas even push anti-government propaganda, either harbouring back to Ungerns Mongolia or even supporting the now defunct Buddyn Zövlöl. Some in our government state that funding for the monasteries should be reduced, for they harbour sentiments of authoritarianism and traditionalism. Others in government argue that for now, it might be best to keep the lamas on our side, and to leave the funding where it is, or even increase it."
mon.52.a:0 "Keep the Monasteries on our side."
mon.52.b:0 "Give the money to the people!"
mon.52.c:0 "The lamas may be a good ally, let's give them more funding."
mon.53.t:0 "The Popular Prince"
mon.53.d:0 "Khatanbaatar Magsarjav was elected to government mostly thanks to assistance from the aristocrats. Now, discussions have begun throughout the party as to whether he is the right man to lead. Many people do not know him too well, and mostly see him as a noble bureaucrat, lacking much charisma. A figure of the aristocrats that does have charisma, however, is Prince Demchugdongrub. Following the Western Revolt, the Prince and many of his aristocrats remained in Urga, to try to keep their influence. Demchugdongrub has remained a very popular figure, and many have stated he should rule as prime minister, with Khatanbaatar Magsarjav as his deputy. Some, however, may see this as a betrayal of the democratic process."
mon.53.a:0 "Invite Demchugdongrub to become Prime Minister."
mon.53.b:0 "If he wants to lead, he can do it democratically!"
mon.54.t:0 "Review the Budget"
mon.54.d:0 "Throughout Ungerns years as dictator of Mongolia, spending increased massively. The country’s economy is weak, and changes must be made. Ungern began massive military projects, all of which cost massive amounts. We, the aristocrats, were taxed massively to pay the bill. Of course, aristocrat taxes have already been cut massively, and to offset this we could increase the tax on the poor majority of the nation, the arats. Perhaps, we could even begin a tax policy on the monasteries."
mon.54.a:0 "Cut military spending."
mon.54.b:0 "Raise Arat tax."
mon.54.c:0 "Implement Monastery tax."
mon.55.t:0 "Assassination attempt on Ungern-Sternberg!"
mon.55.d:0 "While riding his horse in a parade through Urga, a sudden noise deafened the crowds. A shot that echoed through the city, that missed Baron Ungern by two inches. The assassin, a twenty three year old man, was shot almost immediately. Ungern ordered the marching army to fire on the crowd, frenzied by the attempt on his life. The crowd dispersed in a panic as civilians, or possible MAN agents, were killed by Ungerns troops. After the city had calmed down, the assassin has been identified as a member of the Mongol Ardīn Nam, however many peasants in Urga claim this to be fabricated by our government."
mon.55.a:0 "At least the Baron survived."
mon.56.t:0 "[MON.GetLeader] asks for weapons"
mon.56.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader] has asked our government for weapons, to help him defend Mongolia from its enemies. Mongolia is our foothold in China, and it might be best to keep it on our side."
mon.56.a:0 "Send them arms."
mon.56.b:0 "We are too busy."
mon.57.t:0 "Russia agreed to send arms"
mon.57.d:0 "Russia have sent us a shipment of guns, and have agreed to do this every year so long as we remain in power."
mon.57.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.58.t:0 "Russia refused to send arms"
mon.58.d:0 "Russia have decided to no longer send us any arms."
mon.58.a:0 "Damn."
mon.59.t:0 "Diplomatic Mission from Mongolia"
mon.59.d:0 "Mongolia, lead by the religious zealot the [MON.GetLeader], has recently sent us a diplomatic mission. Due to both of our nations being major homes for buddhism, the Mongolian diplomats have stated that they wish to see our nations grow closer, through guarantees and military access. They await our answer."
mon.59.a:0 "We buddhist nations must stick together!"
mon.59.b:0 "We are better off alone."
mon.60.t:0 "The Western Revolt has finally been crushed"
mon.60.d:0 "After many months of fighting in the west of the nation, between bandits, rebels, and government troops, the revolt has been crushed. Most rebels have dispersed, gone into hiding or fled the country, fearing for their lives. Order has come out on top, and the country is secure. However, there are still some small bandit groups, taking advantage of the destruction. They will have to be dealt with."
mon.60.a:0 "At last, the nation is safe."
mon.61.t:0 "The Offer"
mon.61.d:0 "Today, we received a letter from a few of the bandit leaders in the west. In the letter, it said that their groups do not have any stake in what has developed. They came for simple banditry, but it has turned into all out rebellion. The letter goes on to say that although their groups continues to fight in the west, they would be willing to stop, if given some money and supplies. It is a large amount of money, which we will need to find, but it will help reduce the size of the chaos in the west."
mon.61.a:0 "Use the nobles money to pay the bribe."
mon.61.b:0 "Sell off some of the monasteries jewels to pay it."
mon.61.c:0 "Raise taxes on the poor to pay the bribe."
mon.61.e:0 "Reduce military funding to pay the bribe."
mon.61.f:0 "We will not negotiate with these bandits!"
mon.62.t:0 "The bandit leader takes the bribe"
mon.62.d:0 "The bandit leaders have taken our offer, and have decided to end their operations in the west. In these times of brutal battle, good news like this should be celebrated, but a quiet drink is all [MON.GetLeader] had time for, before having to return to keeping Urga in his hands."
mon.62.a:0 "That'll reduce their forces."
mon.63.t:0 "Mongolia asks for guarantees"
mon.63.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader], currently leader of Mongolia, has requested that we guarantee their nation, to keep them safe from outside threats. This will cement them as our influence in the region."
mon.63.a:0 "Guarantee them."
mon.63.b:0 "We don't want to be pulled into Chinese affairs."
mon.64.t:0 "Russia has agreed!"
mon.64.d:0 "Russia has agreed to give us guarantees, to keep us safe from outside threats."
mon.64.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.65.t:0 "Russia has refused!"
mon.65.d:0 "Russia has refused to give us guarantees. We are left alone."
mon.65.a:0 "Damn."
mon.66.t:0 "Power Struggle in the Ma Clique"
mon.66.d:0 "For many years, the Ma Clique has been led by family elder Ma Fuxiang. In the Clique, he was seen as a pillar of stability, who would stop any power struggle occurring between the very divided Ma families. Many in China even see him as the stabiliser of the Northwest, ending Tibetan and our own aggression into Chinese soil.\n\nHowever, news has just reached us that Ma Fuxiang has passed away. Currently he has been replaced by Ma Lin, but another Ma, Ma Bufang, and Ma Lin are already embroiled in a power struggle. This could be a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the Ma Clique's position."
mon.66.a:0 "Good to know."
mon.67.t:0 "Buyandelger gathers force on the Ulanqab border"
mon.67.d:0 "Mongolian general Buyandelger has generally stayed uninvolved with the power struggles happening currently in Urga. For years, he has continued to live in Inner Mongolia, raiding Chinese shipments through the region. Now, we have just received reports that Buyandelger has gathered a large force on the border with the Ma Clique, likely to do some border raids into Ulanqab."
mon.67.a:0 "Let the border raids begin."
mon.68.t:0 "Mongolian border raids from Ulanqab"
mon.68.d:0 "Ever since the death of family patriarch Ma Fuxiang, tensions on both the northern and southern border have been getting worse and worse. Border Raids from Mongolia, primarily in the province of Ulanqab, have caused much chaos over the recent weeks. This is not wholly unexpected, though we should be prepared for if this escalates further."
mon.68.a:0 "This is fine."
mon.69.t:0 "Buyandelger makes his choice"
mon.69.d:0 "With his large force moving through Ulanqab, a thought occurred to Buyandelger. If he was to take Guisui, he would have de facto control of the province. With the Ma's struggling with internal conflict, it should not be too difficult to move his force through the region and to take the city. Now, it is whether he decides to do it or not."
mon.69.a:0 "It's too risky."
mon.69.b:0 "Buyandelger, do it."
mon.70.t:0 "Large Mongolian force moving to Guisui"
mon.70.d:0 "Some of our scouts have reported a large force of Mongolian soldiers moving toward the main city of Ulanqab, Guisui. Should the Mongols take it, they will have de facto control of the whole region. Though there is a garrison in Guisui, many fear it will not be enough to beat the quickly approaching Mongols.

After Hongkui sent his main force in, a group of Mongolian cavalry had snuck behind and attacked on the back lines, at the same time as the battle going on at the front. Ma Hongkui's force was caught in the middle, and beaten. Hongkui was able to make his escape, but he lost the battle, and the Mongol force has almost reached Guisui."

Therefore he charged directly at the city, but by that point he had already fallen into Buyandelger's trap. From behind hills on both sides of his force emerged groups of Mongol cavalry, who pincered Hongbin's forces, leaving them with 2 options: either retreat and concede the city, or move into the city and try to take it, then deal with the outside cavalry afterwards. In this critical moment, Hongbin decided to push through to try to take the city. However, much of his force had already started to retreat, seeing the city as a death sentence. With that, Ma Hongbin's weakened group were forced to retreat. It seems Ulanqab has now fallen into Mongol hands."

Upon further inspection, they discovered he wasn’t breathing, and quickly rushed to find lamas to try to save him. Alas, it was too late for the Baron. The guards stationed outside his room were executed, for letting him die on their watch, as were many of the lamas who were there to cure him.\n\nWhile investigating the room, a short book was found, written by Ungern, detailing what would happen if he died. It was read to a council of Ungern’s inner circle: Boris Rezukhin, Mikhail Tornovsky, Ferdynand Ossendowski, Agvan Dorzhiev, and Vladimir Roerich. Also present was the powerless 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. It stated that Rezukhin was Ungern’s successor, and that he must be protected so that he could rule in the Barons stead. Tornovsky refutes this, stating that he was Ungern’s rightful successor, but after Rezukhin pulled a pistol on him, he conceded. The book also stated stability of the realm was paramount, and that though Rezukhin will now rule, Baron Ungern-Sternberg will still be used in all propaganda, and his cult of personality will remain."

Both of them even compared us to the dictator Ungern-Sternberg! Ironic, seeing as the Ünenbayan's aristocratic friends were the ones helping keep the Baron's government alive. However, their reaction to this is unsurprising. What is surprising is the reaction of the people.

He would have died had it not been for Ungern's Asiatic Cavalry Division taking Urga from Chinese control and freeing him. Many Mongolians see the old man as a unifying figure; a sign that Mongolians are still able to lead in this Russian-dominated government. However, perhaps his links to the MAN never went away. Though we have failed to find any evidence of this, perhaps he aided the MAN rebels against us, and almost led to our downfall.

After that, he travelled to the west of the nation, to put down rebellion and to train anti-Chinese forces in the province of Dzungaria. It is clear that in this mission he failed. At the start of the Western Revolt, he was in Dzungaria, rather than doing his job of putting down anti-government activity. Ungerns mistrust of him was obviously justified.

In expelling Chinese troops, he worked with bandit leader Ja Lama multiple times. This is where the worry about Togtokh Taij lies.

The best example of this occurred today, when 37 people were killed in an explosion during the construction of a factory outside Mörön. The factory is to become a textile factory, owned personally by Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man. Due to the lack of any safety regulations whatsoever, a poorly build bit of construction machinery failed, causing a fire which led to the explosion.

So, under the command of Boris Rezukhin, a battalion was sent out from Urga up north to the location. After travelling and searching for a few days, they eventually found it. A large complex of gers of all sizes, surrounded by a quickly put up wooden fence. Patrols of men armed with rifles and wearing MAN symbols on their caps travelled around the complex every few minutes. It is clear that the camp is struggling to keep together, following the failure of their now third revolution. After surrounding the camp, Rezukhin moved his troops in, and took the complex. There was a small firefight, but nothing major; it seems most of their actual fighting soldiers died during the revolution. Rezukhin rounded up everyone else that was left, primarily older men or women, and either shot them there or took them in for questioning. After going through all the papers in the gers, the locations of multiple, smaller MAN cells were discovered, as well as some of their future plans which included a plan to assassinate Ungern-Sternberg. After getting all the decent information out of the area, Rezukhin burned the complex to the ground, and brought back his prisoners for questioning through out secret police."

After refusing to cede their land to the government, the newly created Mongolian Revolutionary Army were sent in, under the leadership of Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. After approaching the princes lands once again, the princes guard stood firm, and refused to allow the MRA in. Dogsom said that they had the choice now to either surrender now or face death. Though a handful of guards put down their arms and were let go, the vast majority stood their ground and refused to move. With that, Dogsom gave the command to open fire. The princes guard put up a strong fight, but they were eventually beaten by the MRA. The few that remained surrendered and were arrested, as were the princes whose troops they were."

In his prime, he served as the keeper to the Khan’s elephants, his bodyguard, a semi-professional wrestler, and even as a diplomat and toll-office worker, all in service of his liege. Marrying a noble seamstress after following a prophecy of fate as dictated by the Khan, Öndör Gongor lived happily in service of the Mongolian state until his recent tragic death. \n\nLong suffering from gigantism and the slew of health defects and deformities the condition can cause, Gongor passed away in his sleep just a few days ago.

However, today we take note of his naturalist and exploratory efforts in which he worked in tandem with famed American archeologist Roy Chapman Anders over the course of the mid 20’s. Finally, after much delay, Andrews has published his notes on Damdinbazar’s adventures and of his own treks throughout Mongolia in a new book, ‘On the Trail of Ancient Man: A Narrative of the Field War of the Central Asiatic Expeditions’. \n\nReleased to critical acclaim and high sales both throughout Mongolia and within the lands of the Americans, the journal has everything from in-depth observational studies on local animal life of the Mongolia steppe to deep narrative recordings of local Tibetan monk oral histories, with so much more lying within its pages. \Though this tome mentions many odd wonders and mystifying phenomena that Damdinbazar and Andrews saw in their travels, one specific passage has left readers from Urga to Washington gasping in wonder. The particular passage of note describes a beast that resides in the Gobi Desert, slinking beneath the great dunes of that accursed hellscape. Described by Andrews in the novel, supposedly quoting Damdinbazar directly as being ‘...shaped like a sausage about two feet long, has no head nor leg and it is so poisonous that merely to touch it means instant death. It lives in the most desolate parts of the Gobi Desert.' This account has left many readers reeling, with many more seeking to take a trip to the wild Gobi just to catch a glimpse of this living cryptid alive. Though many local nomadic tribes and old explorers may know better to believe these myths, with many believing these supposed ‘Death Worm sightings’ is no more than delirious, water-deprived explorers running scared from sand boas, this has not deterred this myth from spreading like wildfire. From the sands of the Gobi to the hustle and bustle of New York City, all will now know the great and legendary beast that is the ‘Mongolian Death Worm,’ and though that, all who did not once pay attention to Mongolia certainly do now!

The center square of the town, once alive with the energy of life, now sat vacant and quiet, save for the cawing of crows that feasted on the scattered remains of this settlement’s former inhabitants. The streets, once busy and packed with caravans and trade stalls, were now filled with towering horrors that spilled a pungent, almost toxic miasma into the air that could bring even the most steeled soldier to their knees, eyes watering and retching. Not beast or being, these decaying, half-burned mounds of flesh and viscera are all that remains of those who once lived here - hastily constructed failed funeral pyres extinguished before reaching full burn, with their fuel melting together and now left to rot in the Mongolian sun as the vultures of the Steppe pick these bones for scraps.

Combining elements of Mongolian shamanism, Tengirsm, Gelug Buddhism, Eastern Orthodoxy, archaic Altaic prehistorical belief systems, and many other lesser sources, Ak Jang could potentially be the one true faith to unify the Mongolic peoples. \n\nStriving for the Dzungari Ideal and preaching that a legendary heir of Amursana shall ride forth to save and enlighten the Mongolic people, the religion has already been co-opted by our ruling regime as a way to legitimize Ja Lama’s rule. Our Khan supposedly even fancies himself as this promised hero, and has reportedly begun spreading this idea around himself as some sort of prophet of ‘Ak-Burkhan', the main deity of the White Faith, with the aid of his loyal clergymen and shamans who follow his every command as if he were a god himself.

Though Urga still served as the capital of Mongolia and the seat of its government, across the Steppe to the West in Khovd is where the heart of Ja Lama’s domain truly lied. Since his rescuing of the city from its former Han overlords, Ja Lama has spent the last decade and a half or more slowly transforming the once meager settlement of Khovd into his personal fortress. \n\nThe city, once a tiny nomadic village, is now surrounded by barbed wire and tall, jagged fences and walls that keep both enemies out and its occupants within. Each post connecting the interlock wall sections is adorned with the severed head or dismembered limbs of those foolish to ride against the new Khan, and each surface is adorned with the hides of Mongolia’s foes - their skins stretched taught and strained to cover the exposed surfaces of the perimeter walls like goat skin over a drum. Past these flesh-covered metal and wooden barricades lies a sea of gers and yurts, small hovels, and a few larger permanent structures dotted across the expanse of tents like a small archipelago amid a sea of lean-tos and nomadic structures. \n\nIn the center of this sprawl stands the central fortress of Ja Lama himself - a large, walled and equally grotesquely decorated compound where Ja Lama’s personal ger stood as well as the homes of those closest to him in his retinue. In his massive central tent, adorned with the draped and dried skins of hundreds of his foes, dozens of concubines lavished their liege and pranced about as Ja Lama sat and smoked opium in front of the fire. The walls of his ger were adorned with the pelts, skins, and trophies of his most favored prey, man or beast, as well as his large collection of weapons and firearms. In any available open floor space, piles of plunder and treasure sat stacked in meter-high mounds, and smoke from his hearth and his opium pipe filled the room with a smoky haze.

How he came to be revealed as a tulku and who elevated him to the position of Lama has never been solidly deduced, and even particulars about when either he or his son were born continue to elude both his allies and the wider public. As always, Ja Lama proves to be an unsolvable enigma, and yet now rules all of Mongolia, for better or for worse. \n\nMysteries about his origins are not the only questions or doubts that have been raised against this living folktale, for this legend among men also claims to hold a myriad of powers and abilities. A fierce practitioner of ‘gun magic’, it is said that Ja Lama could cure the ailment of any many by simply focusing on the disease and firing his trusty rifle in the patient’s general direction. Additionally, he has been reported to carve Tibetan letters and runes into his bullets, granting them divine accuracy and magical properties unfathomable to an ordinary human mind. On top of his dabbling in the arts of gun magic, it is said he is immune to bullets, able to read minds, invincible and invulnerable to any Earthly force, ageless and timeless without withering or decay, and able to conjure the powers and abilities of the Buddhist deity Mahakala itself - these fantastical abilities are just a few of the powers and magics ever-ready and at the disposal of the great Ja Lama, or so he and his supporters vehemently claim. These powerful abilities make Ja Lama a practical legend and demigod in the eyes of many, while to others he just comes across as a conman or a lying fool. However, these naysayers are never around or loud for long about their complaints or doubts, for the eyes and ears of Ja Lama are everywhere, and none shall doubt his powers! And who are they to doubt these clearly true claims? These tales, bizarre as they may seem, when told by the light of a campfire, deep in the Gobi eighty miles from any other human beings, are not so easily dismissed, and they are all the more undeniable when one of Ja Lama’s men has a rifle aimed square in the eye."

mon.451.t:0 "Heir to the Last Oirat Hero"
mon.451.d:0 "One of the largest aspects of Ja Lama’s ever-shifting and unknowable identity is his supposed lineage. Long has he claimed to be the great-grandson and reincarnation of Amursana. In the 18th century, Amursana was an Oirat taishi, or prince, who led a righteous revolt against the Qing in hopes of freeing the Mongolic peoples of Dzungaria and Altishahr. Instead of victory however, Amursana was cut down and his people, our people, were slaughtered en masse in what has since been called the Dzungar Genocide. Since this fatal loss, the Chinese have subjugated and oppressed our people, and now centuries have passed under this harsh reality. \n\nWith the ascendance of Ja Lama however, all that can finally change. As the reincarnation and blood descendent of Amursana, many in our nation are confident that he is the prince that has been promised in prophecy and White Faith, and Ja Lama uses this faith to his advantage as he rules over all of Mongolia. It is not known if he truly is what he says he is, or if he even truly believes it himself, but he has gone so far as to name his own son after the famed hero, and has seemingly dedicated his entire life to living in Amursana’s image. Whatever the case or reality may be, Ja Lama is the closest thing we have to the fabled last hero of the Oirats, and under his guidance, maybe the Mongolic peoples can finally be truly free."

mon.452.t:0 "An Avatar of Destruction"
mon.452.d:0 "Of all Ja Lama’s claims and beliefs, none goes as far as his most outlandish idea, yet it is also the one he is more serious about. With his power proving supreme over all others in Mongolia and from his elevated position in the spiritual hierarchy of our Buddhist church, Ja Lama has revealed to the people of Mongolia his ‘true’ identity. Claiming to be the physical embodiment and avatar of Mahākāla, the Buddhist God of Time, Maya, Creation, Destruction, and Power, Ja Lama has heralded the revival of the Dzungar Khanate and declared that Mongolia shall be the heartland of a newly restored Oirat nation. With this declaration, he has recited to his nation in a national broadcast a poem he wrote of such an event: \n\n’I am a mendicant monk from the Russian Tsar's kingdom, but I am born of the great Mongols. My herds are on the Volga river, my water source is the Irtysh. There are many hero warriors with me. I have many riches. Now I have come to meet with you beggars, you remnants of the Oirats, in the time when the war for power begins. Will you support the enemy? My homeland is Altai, Irtysh, Khobuk-sari, Emil, Bortala, Ili, and Alatai. This is the Oirat mother country. By descent, I am the great-grandson of Amursana, the reincarnation of Mahākāla, owning the horse Maralbashi. I am he whom they call the hero Dambijantsan. I came to move my pastures back to my own land, to collect my subject households and bondservants, to give favour, and to move freely. \n\nWith these words, Ja Lama, Avatar of Mahakala and Heir to Amursana, has declared war against modernity and time itself, for from the pages of history and myth and into reality he has revived the dreams of a free Oirat nation. May all the enemies of the Mongolic peoples live in fear and horror, for the God of the Steppe is coming for all who still infect our rightful lands and oppress our kin."

However, none have ever been able to verify where or when he acquired this title and how he came to learn he was a true tulku, or reincarnating custodian of a pure Buddhist soul. Supposedly raised and taught by a lower lama as a boy and raised in the Gelug school long before coming to Mongolia, Ja Lama is the claimed reincarnation of Amursana - a fact never substantiated in any official capacity by other tulkus or priests. Though his claims are wild, this does not mean he is a mere pretender. Real tulku or not, few in Mongolia are as pious and devoted to their faith as Ja Lama, who serves as a champion for both pure Gelug Buddhism and the White Faith."

Once more, these dark riders would dive deep into the heartlands of the Chinese and further spread hell amidst their ranks. \n\nAfter a two hour ride, the horde found themselves their target: a small farming village nestled into the hillside, standing defenceless and unaware of the coming chaos. In a flash, Ja Lama’s retinue descended upon the settlement, and after a bloody cacophony of horrific screams and clashing steel, yet another Gamin village fell to the might of Ja Lama. With their soldiers, some still barely alive, skinned and flayed as their bodies were dismembered and refigured into grotesque shapes and effigies, the stench of death began to spread throughout the still-burning ruins. While some soldiers continued to make their grisly art of flesh and tissue, others raided the few structures left standing and salvaged them for all valuables and plunder. Like vultures or jackals picking over a carcass, Ja Lama’s men ripped through every last pile of debris and corpses, looting anything of value and claiming the skins of the most ferocious enemy combatants. \n\nAfter their haul was complete and their loot sacks filled, these dark riders took flight once more across the prairie back to the lands of their own, carrying with them the next round of plunder that would fuel Mongolia’s economy and desires until the next round of riders returned. Like clockwork, hordes under Ja Lama’s command repeated this horrific routine, day in and day out, carrying with them the future of Mongolia with each haul. "

The people of Mongolia no longer need a beacon to rally behind, for they now have Ja Lama to guide them. The always independent and stubborn Bogd Gegen must be silenced so that Ja Lama’s hold over all of Mongolia can be complete, but to kill a god is no easy task. \n\nIn the quiet of night, agents of Ja Lama shall poison the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu in his sleep, and with this act, their final plan to secure Mongolia’s future shall be put into motion. With the old fool out of the way, all attention shall be diverted to finding his reincarnated replacement, the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. Once this infant is found, Ja Lama and his retinue seek to mold the child to their own will and ideas, effectively puppeting the spiritual leader of Mongolia and their people’s one true link to the gods. This child shall be indoctrinated in both the ideas of Gelug Buddhism and the White Faith, cementing our new religion’s importance within Mongolian society and granting it divine legitimacy from our link to the Buddha himself. None in Mongolia may learn of the true and dark deeds we will have committed to get us to this moment though, so utmost secrecy must be assured. Any and all who let slip a single word of this plan shall be put to death with absolute urgency, for the spiritual future of all Mongolia now hangs in the balance, for Ja Lama and his regime shall now kill a god."

mon.4560.d:0 "When not out slaughtering the enemies of Mongolia and crushing the Gamin parasites under his boot at the barrel of a gun, Ja Lama is a much different man. Inside the confines of his own domain, among the people he works so hard to protect, the hard facade of a crazed killer melts away. A fan of leisure and of relaxation, he is frequently spotted near swimming holes or in eateries, relaxing the day away as he enjoys the fineries of life. Smoking opium has long been a passtime of his, but so has volunteering for the local Buddhist monasteries and entertaining the local children while their parents work their fields or earn their livings. This stark dichotomy shocks many who do not know the true nature of Ja Lama. Though he may be a bloodthirsty warlord who flays his enemies alive, he does so for the good of his people. If it were not for these human connections he keeps with his own kin and countrymen, he would be nothing but a beast."

Like Amursana before him, Ja Lama has led the Mongolic people to throw off their shackles. Under our Khan, our people have been liberated and our enemies, the vile Qing, have been destroyed and forever cast from our lands. The Dzungar Genocide has been avenged and now our people can roam the Steppe peacefully as their ancestors once did, without fear of death or foreign encroachment. \n\nNow that our new Khanate has risen from the ashes and this pastoralist ideal has been returned to our lands, we must decide on a new banner for our resurgent horde, and before us we have a few options."

mongolia.10300.d:0 "Following the failed Revolutions of 1921 and 1924 against the Mad Baron, the MAN Socialists were largely forced to flee, hide, or face the wrath of Ungern-Sternberg’s purges. Numerous major party officials and innocents were brought before the sword, including the main figure of the First Seven and Father of Mongolian Socialism Damdin Sükhbaatar, who was the leading theorist among the MAN’s seven original founders. After shepherding Damdin’s widow and son into safety in exile, Choibalson began to wage a guerilla campaign against the Mad Baron, but alone and disconnected from his comrades, he began to lose faith in the Revolution. However, as he waged his personal war against the Mad Baron, he came to find an unlikely ally in Ja Lama, who was waging his own war against Ungern in Mongolia’s western frontier. \n\nTogether, they forged an uneasy and opportunistic alliance as Choibalson put his experience as a revolutionary to good use in his new life as a bandit. Eventually falling prey to his own hedonistic vices such as drinking, gambling, and whoring, Choibalson transformed from a once-proud Communist and true freedom fighter into the violent and cold-hearted lead lieutenant of Ja Lama’s armed forces. Despite all this, Choibalson still holds onto a small sliver of his former Communist and anti-theist ways, resisting the notion that Ja Lama is truly the reincarnation of Amursana and implementing his own fusion of conservative Socialism within his nomadic camp. Despite these deviations from Ja Lama’s rhetoric, Choibalson’s position is safe, for without his military expertise and the respect he commands among our armed forces, Ja Lama would rapidly find himself without the authority needed to backup his ludicrous ideas."

That question of course being what to do in regards to the spiritual lives of the Mongolian people. While of course our own colonization efforts have indeed begun to bring the light of Christ and His most holy bride the Church to these forsaken lands, those who adhere to the One True Faith still make up a tiny fraction our total population.\n\nThis being the case, an intense debate has broken out within the halls of power on just what to do with in this regard.

They plan to accomplish this viva the use of both increased missionary work and the use of force. One such target of force would be the Bogh Khan, he would be forced to either convert or meet his maker.\n\nThe other side of this debate lies those who wish for a more moderate approach. While they agree that Mongolia must be an Orthodox Christian nation, they believe that only by working with the local religion, the local myths, can we hope to truly bring Mongolia into the faith. While this method would indeed bring about a unique form of Mongolian Orthodoxy, it would also take much longer, a downside none can refute.\n\nBesides these two options, another does in fact exist.

They focus on cooperation with Russia, military strength and anti-socialism. They currently lead the country, working with the Yazgurtan Survaljtan and the Buddyn Zövlöl.\nThe Yazgurtan Survaljtan is the name of the hierarchy of Mongolian princes and nobles, who had been the ruling class of the country for centuries. Focusing on keeping their wealth and power secure, they are larelgely led by the Inner Mongolian Prince Demchugdongrub, who leads a  domineering and ambitious group of Inner Mongolian Princes centered around the region of Xilingol.\nThe Buddyn Zövlöl are a council of high ranking buddhists lamas, tulkus, and monks in Mongolia, which was formed following Ungern’s purge of lamas in 1930. Many members of the council are fanatic buddhists, who wish to turn Mongolia into a truly theocratic society under the Bogd Khan. They are led by the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, a high ranking lama from Inner Mongolia.\nThe Mongol Ardīn Nam, the socialist party who rebelled in 1921 and 1924 remain in hiding, but are still a strong force to be reckoned with. Led by Soliin Danzan and receiving aid from various other Mongolian democratic parties and even the famed Gada Meiren, they have taken some inspiration from Russia and Chinese democratic regimes, and therefore have begun advocating for multiparty democracy under their control.\n\nAside from these main political cliques, the bandit lord and warrior tulku Ja Lama rules from his bandit fortress in Khovd, seeking to restore ancient glories and vengeance against the Chinese. Foreigners besiege our Khanate as well, for the Soyombo Revival Society has once again begun to rise to national prominence, advocating for the transformation of Mongolia into a Russian colonial satellite. Their main opposition comes in the form of the Anfu Club, remnants of the disgraced Anhui Clique that fled to Mongolia following the disastrous Northern Expedition and now seek to use Mongolia as the launching point of their crusade to Beijing. \n\nAs if our inner-politics could not get more hectic, Mongolia also faces many external threats. For many years, border skirmishes have taken place between the Muslim Chinese Ma Clique and Mongolian troops across the border. A similar situation is taking place in the Dzungaria region of the Xinjiang Clique.

mon.658.d:0 "In Medieval Europe, one of the most popular folktales of the Saints was that of Barlaam and Josaphat. In the short, the legend tells the story of an Indian prince who, despite his father's hatred and persecution of the Christian faith, ends up converting thanks to the wise guidance of the mystic Barlaam, a hermit. After a time, his father also converts to the Christian religion, after which he abdicates the throne to Josaphat to live as a hermit. Josaphat, like his father before him, abdicates the throne and goes on to live a life of piety, performing miracles and converting souls with his teacher Barlaam before his death.\n\nTo modern scholars, especially those who study Buddhism, the story of Barlaam and Josaphat is little more then a 'baptism' of one of the many stories regarding the Buddha and his life. While this fact is usually of little consequence, with our government beginning to sponsor the Orthodox Church within Mongolia, many wonder if this ancient story could become a boon to our attempts at converting this land.\n\nThose who support using the legend for our own benefit fall into two camps. The first, made up mostly of the rank and file of the SRS, believe we should use our new found connections with the Church to have Saint Josaphat be formally declared both the Patron of Mongolia.  But more then that, declare he is the actual Buddha, and that stories that he was the founder of Buddhism are later fabrications. While such an action would require quite a bit of push on our end for the Church to agree to it, it would also greatly increase our efforts at converting Mongolia.\n\n The second camp, mostly made up of die-hard loyalists of the Mad Baron, call for a much more radical approach. This second camp wishes for us to in essence fully embrace the idea that Josaphat is Buddha, but not in an Orthodox context. Instead, they wish for us to slowly start phasing out use of Buddha from the Mongolian mind, replaced with St. Josaphat. By doing this, they believe, we will slowly the complete synchronization of Buddhism and Orthodox Christianity. While such a proposal is obviously abhorrent to any true Christian, to the followers of the Mad Baron, it is simply recognizing the truth of Divinity present in all forms of Religion.\n\nWhile both ideas are radical in their own right, [MON.GetLeader] could simply elect to ignore them. After all, would need do we have for causing even more religious unrest?"

Commemorating this coup, the radicals have renamed the capital city of Urga to Ulaanbaatar, meaning ‘Red Hero’, solidifying this new Totalist regime. However, the coalition of extremists and Syndicalists is uneasy, and numerous figures vie for influence within the Party. Should a disagreement too large finally come between them, the whole thing could come crashing down, and the wolves already circle out on the Steppe, waiting for their time to strike."

Now finally cracking under these disagreements over foreign policy, national identity, and theory, the Radical MAN coalition led by Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav and Ulanhu has finally split, reaching an impasse over whether to align with the Socialist movements in Russia or in China, with Ulanhu supporting the KMT while Luvsansharav supports the decrees put forth by Lenin and his loyal Bolsheviks. However, the wider coalition is incredibly split over this decision, with violence and secret purges being carried out to sway positions, causing the deaths of prominent Socialists such as Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. There is a high likelihood that the coalition could reach a deadlock over the decision, possibly giving the Syndicalist minority or some other force a chance to finally rise to save the Revolution, for there are whispers that Nadmid of Clan Mültütü, better known by his nicknames Lou ɣada or Gada Meiren, has begun to ride once again.

Nadmid of Clan Mültütü, as he is truly known, and his horde, backed by the surviving democratic elements of the MAN under Anadyn Amar, Ard Ayush, and Soliin Danzan, as well as by the Bogd Khan, now ride to Ulaanbaatar in an attempt to save Mongolia from foreign ideals and to protect our native, millenia-old nomadic traditions.

In traditional Mongolian culture, there has always been a code of honor when it comes to executions. To spill the blood of another Mongol was seen as dishonorable, for both the executioner and his victim, and as such, only foreigners were executed in such brutish ways. \n\nThe honorable way to execute a fellow Mongol was called ‘death by immurement’, meaning to seal the guilty away in a tight area such as a small room, cave, or small vessel such as a steel or wooden coffin, unable to move much, if at all, and subjected to the whims of their warden. Some were fed through a slit, with the brief seconds of sunlight coming in through the opening being the only sun they would see for days or weeks, and able to survive a terrible life for however long their minds or their bodies could endure it, or however long their captors felt like letting them live. Others would have a far more brief, but infinitely more agonizing experience, left in tight boxes in the most desolate and exposed areas of the great Gobi, only to quickly roast alive during the day or to freeze to death inside their sarcophagi under the harsh and variable weather of our desert, unless of course starvation, dehydration, predators, or the shear stress of it all killed you first. \n\nHowever, we could award this traitor no honorable death, and instead kill him in any number of traditional ways fit for slaying foreigners unfitting of our mercy and respect.

For years he has led Ja Lama’s hordes as his chief general, but with the rise of true Mongolian Communism, Choibalsan has been thrown into mental anguish, drinking himself into a stupor and exclaiming to all that he is the true savior of Mongolia and the Revolution. \n\nGreeting his old comrade on the plains outside the city, Luvsansharav agreed to the duel before both mounted their steeds, drew their traditional sabors, and charged headlong at each other in a showing of traditionalist brutality. Despite his reputation for meekness and cowardice,  Luvsansharav charged the drunken Choibalsan - once esteemed as one of Mongolia’s greatest warriors - and quickly cut him down from his steed in one fell swoop. The upper half of Choibalsan’s torso fell to the ground with a stunned, confused, and tragic look upon his dying face as Luvsansharav wiped the blood from his blade and sheathed it. After years of betrayal, the traitorous son of the MAN and the former Father of the Mongolian Revolution has been cut down by the true herald of this new People’s Republic. All hail Luvsansharav!"

Though rumors that the infamous Gada Meiren, the nomadic bandit warlord who cut off the head of the Mad Baron, aided in the Bogdo Lama’s escape and now protects the disgraced ‘king’ strike fear into the hearts of our more cowardly men, Luvsansharav fears no man, announcing to all that Gada Meiren and the former Bogd Khan will be caught and brought to justice no matter the cost."

Dominated by Anandyn Amar, Ard Ayush, Dogsomyn Bodoo, and their hand-selected clique of loyal liberal Socialists and Mongolian patriots, this Crimson Khuraldai is responsible for managing and overseeing the disorganized web of mobile yurt cities, livestock and horse herds, and nomadic Arat collectives, communes, and cooperatives that now make up the majority of our traditionalist economy built vaguely on Socialism. Anarchist and Democratic in nature, this economy built on distributism, cooperation, and barter is a Socialist form of the ancient Mongolian empire, ensuring that we never stray from our cultural roots. Promoting the health of the people and our natural environment over industrial pursuits and heavily pastoral, agrarian, and nomadic in nature, this unique form of Arat-focused pseudo-Anarchism under the Crimson Muqali Anandyn Amar is form-fit to suit the needs of Mongolia’s new Revolution."

Their target was a group of reactionary bandits and rebels that have been reported to be harassing the local nomadic Arat herders and communalized craftsmen, stealing their tithes meant for the central Crimson Khuraldai. Riding into the bandit camp after hours of riding and under the dead of night, the last thing their victims heard was the thunderous stampede of an approaching horde, the twang of arrows being loosed, the clattering of sabors being drawn, and the fire of jezzails and rifles. Before any of the bandits could even climb up out of their gers and yurts or up from their drunken hazes by campfire light, they were all cut down without remorse.

Fusing shamanstic schools with ideas from the White Faith, from Tengrism, and from Gelug Buddhism, the two have created a new faith for all true sons and daughters of the Great Khan to embrace. Led by these two titanic figures and backed up by the Liberal Socialist and semi-Anarchist government of Anandyn Amar, Ard Ayush, Dogsomyn Bodoo, and Soliin Danzan in order to format it for our new vaguely Socialist reality, this new faith will unite the people and our arats, or nomadic peasantry that make up about 95% of the population, like ever before, and all those that oppose it shall be marked as false Mongols and Gamin parasites."

With Choibalson’s unfortunate death at the hands of Luvsansharav, Bumstend - with his Socialist record still carrying some weight - was offered a choice by Gada Meiren himself: join or die. \n\nSmartly, Bumstend loyally returned to the Party, largely convinced by our new position of Socialist religious syncretism and by Gada Meiren’s threat.

However, after falling in love with our culture, way of life, and new syncretic religion as he lives like a nomadic peasant in our beautiful and tranquil pastoral paradise out on the Steppe, he has often hinted at his desire to stay here within Gada Meiren’s clique. Should we grant him a place within the Great Red Khural and allow his and his father’s brand of Esoteric Buddhist Leninism to begin to influence the state’s new syncretic religion and the identity of our horde, or is it more wise to let George and his family of odd geniuses to merely go on with their globetrotting adventures untethered?"

As he and his forces remove the Chinese filth and the scars they have left upon our land, our clergymen and monks have been busy proliferating a new syncretic faith to help guide our newly freed people. \n\nBeing called the ‘Red Faith’ by many of its practitioners, this new pantheon is partially based on Gada Meirien’s own shamanistic beliefs mixed with Karma Kagyu Buddhism, Tengri, and even some Socialist principles based on the ideas of the Mongol Ardīn Nam. Though it still pales in comparison to the popularity of pure Gelug Buddhism, this new syncretic religion has already outpaced the vile Chinese belief systems, becoming the second most prominent unified faith in Mongolia."

A beautiful and once-pristine grassland that stretched for hundreds of miles and filled with nomadic idealism has now been turned into a hive of Chinese settlement that scars the land and their massive agricultural initiatives that eat away at the once flowing and unbroken seas of long grass that swayed endlessly in these lands. \n\nNestled at the heart of this flowing grasslands is the once wild and free homeland of Gada Meiren himself, in the village of Jam-Un Tokhui where he was born as Nadmid of the Mültütü clan. Once a small, traditional hub for nomadic clans and Mongolian settlers to live in peace while intertwined with their own culture, now an abomination stands in its place. Massive fields of oats and millet crops now stretch over the once verdant prairie, and where traditional gers and yurts once stood, made from animal skins and timber, now stands large Chinese housing complexes of mortar and stone, imposing and permanent new marks that sully this great paradise that is the Mongolian wilderness. These structures and fields stand as an affront to the very Mongolian way of life! The fools that work these lands are nothing more than mindless parasitic drones raping the natural bounty of our land as they make profit for their masters and breed like vermin in an attempt to suffocate the Monglian people in their own lands. However, with the return of Gada Meiren to his ancestral home, this perversion shall finally be brought to an end. This Banner, once his home, shall be razed to the ground, and by the sword and bow of his riders, every Han settler shall be cut down and laid to rot in the Mongolian sun as their structures are torn to the ground and their fields are burned and salted. Only then shall these rats have finally provided something of use to our people, for their blood and bones shall feed the next generation of grasslands that regrow over this accursed settlement. \n\nOnce this dark but all too necessary deed is complete, Gada Meiren’s horde will ride off to yet another Han encampment and repeat this process once more, until all of the Khorchin plains and all of Mongolia are free and repaid for the hardships we have endured."

Already have examples of these paradises been discovered today, proving the righteousness of our faith. In Tibet, great fissures hidden in the Himalayas like Barun Valley and Puyol offer pristine slices of practical Eden long isolated and preserved from the horrors of Man’s world. In Mongolia itself, similar sites exist in the form of the Ten Sacred Mountains of Mongolia: ten centers of Buddhist serenity and naturalistic purity dotted across the expanse of our nation. However, with Gada Meiren’s efforts to restore the true Mongolian pastoralist ideal and natural beauty that our nation has been blessed with, a new idea has begun to form within the ranks of lamas, other tulkus, and monks within our clergy. /n/nThese zealots have begun to see Gada Meiren himself as a dharmapāla of a newly forming Mongolian Beyul. As the dharmapāla, or a vengeful Buddhist warrior deity of wrath tasked with the protection of holy lands, law, and justice, Gada Meiren is said to be the herald of a new Buddhist golden age in Mongolia. As his war against the foreign forces that plague Mongolia continues and as he spreads both his Red Faith and the established Buddhist schools of Gelug and Nyingma, the Steppe is only made more pure and verdant. Soon, all of Mongolia shall be one large and protected Beyul, with Gada Meiren as its holy guardian."

Though it is largely unknown if our hero holds any of these egalitarian and Socialist views himself, it is widely known that he at least is a true champion of the Mongolian people and seeks to see all his people prosper, and this uncertainty has not stopped the MAN from pushing this agenda to the wider nation. \n\nLabeling it as a form of ‘Red Nomadism’, the Mongol Ardīn Nam have begun to influence the younger generations of nomads and riders that still roam the Steppe and the wider Mongolian wilderness. Fusing traditional Mongolia ideals and culture with modern Socialist views, this new strain resembles some Western ideas of anarchism or communalism, without much of the useless theory that has gone into those less forms of living. Our nomadic and commune-like society is not born out of mere fantasy or the ideas of pampered Western nobles - it is instead forged in our own histories and experiences; a proven legacy that has endured for millenia and a way of life that has endured while lesser civilizations have been lost to history. \n\nThese ideas have already become immensely popular with many of the young soldiers that have fallen in with Gada Meiren’s horde, and as he spreads purity across Mongolia, so too does he spread this new school of thought, whether he means to or not. Red Nomadism is the only true future for Mongolia, and Gada Meiren will be the instrument of its proliferation."

Another hero of the Mongolian people patrols the Korchin grasslands, laying waste to both Russian colonists and Han settlers alike in a holy and righteous crusade against imperialism. However, unlike Gada Meiren, a man of low-birth and humble beginnings, his counterpart is no mere nomad or peasant. \n\n Yangsanjab, Prince Öndür, Favored Son of the Borjigin Clan, and Descendant of Hasar, brother of Temüjin himself, is one of the most honored and revered nobles in all of Mongolia. Even before taking up his current exploits, he has been held in high regards by both the former Qing lords that oppressed Mongolia’s people and the Mongolia people themselves, who have long viewed Yangsanjab as one of the more honorable princes in the Yazgurtan Survaljtan. This adoration is both due to his own heroic and noble actions and his high spiritual significance, being a disciple of the Janggiya Khutuktu and a close friend of the 9th Panchen Lama, and as such has risen to be a popular face of the Mongolian nobility. Now, this high level of reverence has been even further elevated, for this proud noble has proven himself time and time again to be a true ally of the Mongolian people, for like Gada Meiren, Yangsanjab has led his own horde of freedom fighters and insurgents against the Han and Russian colonialists, serving valiantly in the wider flight to uproot this foreign presence in Mongolia for good. \n\nThough in theory, these two forces would be opposed to one another, at least ideologically, for one stands as a rich and proud noble while the other stands as a revolutionary, things could not be further from the truth. Despite these surface level differences, these two forces of nature and Mongolia fury have miraculously become fast friends and comrades, with their hordes frequently coopertting as they mercilessly slaughter the Han and salt their fields for the good of all Mongolians.

Leaving nothing but a short note scrapped on a parchment and stuck to the table with a knife, this spirit of the Steppe has disappeared without a trace. \n\nIn his absence, his instructions to the MAN are clear: Gada Meiren is to stay as the de-facto leader of Mongolia, and as the face of the nation and its government, with his absences being largely kept hidden from the people. In his stead, the MAN is to work with the Bogd Khan to continue his work in purifying and safeguarding Mongolia from any outside threat while working to uplift any and all true Mongolians within our borders. Under this arrangement, the MAN would rule as a sort of shadow-government behind the facade of Gada Meiren’s absolute political authority and under the spiritual and moral guidance of the Bogd Khan. This system shall ensure Mongolia’s continued stability and safety as it progresses towards a truly egalitarian, ‘Red Nomadic’ state. \n\nIn the meantime, as these politicians and monks take the reins of rule, the savior of all Mongolia has returned to the lands of his people in secret, out in the far East of Mongolia’s prairie. Here, he rides with his wife Mudan and their children and the people of their clan in peace, continuing their idealistic life now free of foreign encroachment and banditry. If his people ever need him again, he shall ride forth once more, for he is the Red Niō of Mongolia - its protector and guardian, just as the Niō of legend guard the enlightened Buddha himself. As he rides across the grasslands of his birth once more a free man, may all of Mongolia sing praises of his name, for this Last Son of Khorchin is the true savior of Modern Mongolia, and the greatest Mongol to ride since Genghis Khan himself. Our nation and our people shall forever be in his debt, and may we never be in such a dire position to require his aid again.
mon.462.a:0 "A noble guardian of Mongolia, and the greatest rider since Temüjin himself."

### Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav flavor:

tot_mon_flavor.8.t:0 "Accelerating the Divorce"
tot_mon_flavor.8.d:0 "Marching into the recently re-christened Ulaanbaatar with his horde and riding his steed to the steps of the Winter Palace of the Bogd Khan in the heart of the city, Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav prepared to do what finally needed to be done. On top of this tiered pavilion, our leader would put an end to Buddhism in Mongolia once and for all. Finding the Bogd Khan in his hiding place out on the Steppe and dragging him back to the capital for all to witness, Luvsansharav would execute this supposed demigod and link to the divine with a simple swipe of his sabor. \n\nForcing the most revered tulku to his knees before cleaving his head clean off, Luvsansharav ended the reincarnating line of the Bogdo Lama’s spirit before a crowd of thousands, lifting his bleeding head for all to see. Refusing to search for his next corporeal vessel, this line of Gelug Buddhist lama was finally at an end. The religious purges shall accelerate, the monasteries shall all be looted and brought to ruin, and the clergy shall be utterly annihilated in their entirety. Mongolia shall be free from religion, no matter the cost."
tot_mon_flavor.8.a:0 "Mongolia shall entirely forget religion at all costs."

tot_mon_flavor.9.t:0 "The Lenin of Mongolia"
tot_mon_flavor.9.d:0 "Accelerating his consolidation of the state as he progresses to complete democratic centralism under the State Khural and himself, Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav has begun to issue the same decrees Lenin once did during the failed Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Creating a true dictatorship of the Proletariat guided by himself and his vanguard in the radical MAN while purging any and all potential political enemies in a bloodbath to secure the Party and the Revolution, Luvsansharav will stop at nothing to bring Communism with Mongolian Nationalist characteristics to the Steppe. Increasingly totalitarian and pushing for total industrialization, collectivization, urbanization, democratic centralism, militant atheism, and Soviet modernization, Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav is called the Lenin of Mongolia and the New Father of the Revolution by his allies, and the Red Death by his ever-dwindling supply of foes."
tot_mon_flavor.9.a:0 "Luvsansharav Lived. Luvsansharav Lives. Luvsansharav Will Live Forever!"

### Ulanhu flavor:

tot_mon_flavor.10.t:0 "Mongolian-Chinese Societal Syncretism"
tot_mon_flavor.10.d:0 "In order to foster closer ties with out Chinese allies, Ulanhu has moved to allow Chinese immigration and interbreeding, but in a careful form in order to preserve Mongolian culture and identity without letting it get swallowed up by the Chinese wave. We shall build a syncretic Sino-Mongolian identity, culture, and society for all within our state to embrace, supported by our brand of Communism. Families that intermingle between the cultures shall be incentivized and rewarded, and a new cultural program shall begin to spread and popularize this new syncretic national identity. Together, the Pan-Mongolic peoples and the Chinese shall bring a true Communist Revolution to East Asia."
tot_mon_flavor.10.a:0 "Onwards towards a unified Sino-Mongolian identity!"

tot_mon_flavor.11.t:0 "The Red Son’s Fiefdom"
tot_mon_flavor.11.d:0 "Ruling Mongolia like his own Communist fiefdom like he once did in Inner Mongolia during the failed Revolution of the 1920s, Ulanhu holds all of Mongolia in the palm of his hand. Supported by the State Khural and his Red Guard - paramilitaries largely made up of loyal students and peasants frequently of Chinese or Sino-Mongolian descent - Ulanhu is largely free to dictate the direction of the LKMT and Lenin-inspired Revolution he finds himself at the forefront of. Having slain the Bogd Khan in secret after finding him hiding out on the Steppe, Ulanhu has decided to stop the anti-theist purges, for the most part, and has shifted gears. Claiming that the reincarnation of this Bogdo Lama has been confirmed to be a young boy from Inner Mongolia of both Chinese and Mongolian blood, Ulanhu shall be able to effectively dominate and dictate the future of the dwindling Buddhist religion. All in Mongolia and our wider growing People’s Republic shall learn to embrace our sole leader as Communism and Proletarian Paradise come to Mongolia by Ulanhu’s decree."
tot_mon_flavor.11.a:0 "A Communist apparatus fit for Sino-Mongolia!"

tot_mon_flavor.12.t:0 "The Son of a Titan"
tot_mon_flavor.12.d:0 "Chiang Kai-shek, long thought dead until recently, has risen to lead the LKMT movement in mainland China. Serendipitously, his son Chiang Ching-kuo serves with Ulanhu and the Party here in Mongolia, for he has long been a friend of our leader, once sharing a desk with him at their Communist studies in Moscow under Lenin. In order to draw closer to Kai-shek’s new syncretic government, we could raise his son and our loyal minister to be the new face of the MAN as Ulanhu takes a backseat and focuses on our armed forces, or we could simply continue our close relations with the LKMT government under the direction of the Red Son. Who should we choose to lead us into the future of a shared Red China?"
tot_mon_flavor.12.a:0 "Raise Ching-kuo to Chairman of the Party to grow closer to the LKMT."
tot_mon_flavor.12.b:0 "Ching-kuo shall continue to serve as a minister under our leader."

### Syndie Peljidiin Genden and Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj flavor: 

tot_mon_flavor.13.t:0 "The Poet of the Revolution"
tot_mon_flavor.13.d:0 "Borjgin Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj has risen to lead the Syndicalist wing of the MAN, and as such, this poet and playwright has been free to pursue his own syncretic mixture of pastoral and Buddhist Social-Futurism inspired by Proletkultists Mayakovsky and Lunarcharsky and of Ecologically-focused Syndicalism centered around traditional agrarianism. Pulling on ideas created by the God-Builders and by Mayakovsky’s Social Futurists, moderated and de-radicalized to fit the needs of Mongolia and her peoples, Natsagdorj and his regime shall create a pastoral utopia based upon Syndicalism, ecological conservation, and Mongol Steppe-inspired Traditionalist Futurism, synthesizing a unique form of Syndicalism that pulls from both the past practices and future possibilities of Mongolia while also taking care to preserve the natural paradise we live within. Buddhism and Tengrism shall once again be allowed to be practiced and spread, the Bogdo Lama - the former Bogd Khan - is to be pardoned, and the purges and persecutions shall be ceased, though these faiths shall remain mostly separate from the state aside from the Socialist-Spiritual fusion slowly being concocted by our own God-Builders. Centrally, Natsagdorj’s literary works and art, such as his much beloved opera ‘The Three Sad Hills’ that is performed every season at the Ulaanbaatar Opera House, shall help form the foundations of this new culture, and all in Mongolia will prosper for it. We will build a new artistic pastoral paradise here on the Steppe under Syndicalism and under Natsagdorj."
tot_mon_flavor.13.a:0 "Our beloved artisan and theorist."

tot_mon_flavor.14.t:0 "Mongolian Eco-Syndicalism"
tot_mon_flavor.14.d:0 "Going forward with his Eco-Syndiacalist agenda inspired by his love of Mongolia’s natural beauty and by his time running his own artistic trade union, Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj has begun to unveils a series of new natural reserves and ecologically-minded communes, with the crown jewel of these new zones of conservation and Socialism being the new Gün-Galuut Nature Reserve. This stretch of Steppe is just South of the capital, and represents a perfect slice of Mongolian nature, containing high mountains, steppes, rivers, lakes, grasslands, and wetlands while protecting local species such as the whooper swan, the gray wolf, the Przewalski’s Wild Horse, and so much more. Dedicating his beloved poem ‘My Native Land’ to the site and changing the words to fit our new shared Syndicalist reality, Natsagdorj and his clique of Eco-Syndicalist hope that this reserve and others like it shall enable Mongolia to protect its wilderness while fostering the creation of conservationist Syndicalist unions, further progressing our state towards true Syndicalism and natural paradise. Furthermore, Natsagdorj’s long-time contemporary and friend Norman Wallace Lermond from America and his clique of Bellamyite Eco-Socialists have congratulated our leader on the move, stating that together, conservationist groups like ours will truly save Mother Earth."
tot_mon_flavor.14.a:0 "Our native land, beautiful and free."

tot_mon_flavor.15.t:0 "A New Economic Policy for Mongolia"
tot_mon_flavor.15.d:0 "Peljidiin Genden has maintained control over the Syndicalist wing of the MAN along with his clique of Right Communists and Syndicalists, and now is largely free to pursue his own fusion of Liberalized Market Syndicalism and Leninist-Bukharinist syncretic Socialism. Creating a New Economic Policy, or NEP, form-fit for Mongolia based on the writings of the titans before him while ceasing the anti-theist purges that plagued the last administration, Genden seeks to wash away the sins of his past and the past of the MAN by creating a liberalized Syndicalist paradise that brings prosperity, freedom, and Socialist liberty to all within our borders. Taking notes from the Agrarian Market Syndicalist and Proudhounist-inspired Léon Jouhaux - one of the chief Syndicalist theorists from Socialist France and one of the chief benefactors of our coup - Genden hopes to right the wrongs he once supported in order to truly save the Mongolian Proletariat and bring them the standard of living and peace they deserve. Under Genden and this unique fusion of Syndicalism, Capitalism, and Liberalism, Mongolia and her people shall be healed."
tot_mon_flavor.15.a:0 "Fusing the best to benefit the people the most."

tot_mon_flavor.16.t:0 "Genden’s Apology"
tot_mon_flavor.16.d:0 "Once a devout Buddhist before his turn to Communism, Peljidiin Genden has long felt the weight of guilt upon his soldiers, standing by and letting hundreds of lamas and clergymen die during the initial MAN Revolution. Distancing himself from these past mistakes and reaffirming his own Buddhist faith, Genden has declared that Mongolia shall practice total freedom of religion - a sharp reversal of previous positions. Apologizing for his past mistakes and swearing to right these wrongs, Genden has begun to siphon some state funding towards the monastic reconstruction effort, rebuilding and repairing the centuries-old monasteries destroyed by the former radical MAN government. Dedicated to this new shift, he has even gone so far as to pardon the former Khan, the Bogdo Lama, and has allowed him to live in peace in his former palace in the capital so long as he stays entirely within the purview of his spiritual duties. Though many still do not forgive him, Genden has endeavored to fix the mistakes of his past in order to save Mongolia."
tot_mon_flavor.16.a:0 "He shall have to build back trust with his actions."

### Shared Soc Flavor:

tot_mon_flavor.17.t:0 "The Mother of Mongolian Socialism"
tot_mon_flavor.17.d:0 "Sükhbaataryn Yanjmaa - widow of MAN founder and Father of the Mongolian Revolution Damdin Sükhbaatar, and nicknamed the Mother of Mongolian Socialism herself - is being honored today by the State and by [root.getleader] for her decades-long dedication to Mongolian Socialism, even after the death of her beloved husband who was one of the First Seven to bring Communism to the Steppe. A staunch ally of the Revolution, she and her young son were nearly murdered along with her late husband in 1924 after the Second Revolution failed, but were saved by Choibalson before he waged his personal war against the Mad Baron and slipped into Ja Lama’s camp. Since her survival, she has worked with the MAN from exile, guiding the Party as its widely-respected matriarch, and as such, a massive parade is to be held in her honor as a statue of her figure is unveiled in the capital. Though she has shied away from a leadership position herself and focused on less-visible matters since her husband’s execution, that has not stopped her from furthering Mongolia’s Revolution, proving to be a true patriot and hero to the People’s Republic. \n\nRecently, she has begun to spread the ideas of feminism and the woman’s role in the Revolution, creating a series of women’s unions across the nation while working with her Russian contemporaries and friends Clara Zetkin, Khertek Anchimaa-Toka, and Nadezhda Krupskaya. However, despite her hesitations on leading, many within the more liberal factions within the MAN still push for our mauve matriarch to take the reins her late husband should have been holding in order to unite more of the disparate and distrustful Mongolian Left under one banner. Whether this can come to fruition one day is another matter entirely."
tot_mon_flavor.17.a:0 "Let her continue her good works in peace."
tot_mon_flavor.17.b:0 "Urge her to rise as the new face of our Mongolian People’s Republic!"

tot_mon_flavor.19.t:0 "Mongolia’s Esperantist Spymaster"
tot_mon_flavor.19.d:0 "Namjil Hayankhirvaa, or Namzhilyn Khayankhirvaa, is an honored revolutionary within the Radical wing of the MAN, leading the Internal Security Service against reactionary elements with his loyal squads of cronies. Recently making a name for himself after unveiling a totally real counter-revolutionary plot allegedly hatched by Jambyn Lkhümbe and Ajvaagiin Danzan which would have sold Mongolia out to the Japanese and executing all those claimed to be involved, Hayankhirvaa may be a ruthless protector of the Revolution, but he is far from a simple brute. \n\nBorn in Outer Mongolia, he became a monk in his youth and was educated in local monasteries before taking a pilgrimage to Russia and studying at the Kalmyk Theological Seminary. Gifted with a natural affinity for learning languages, he spoke his native Mongolian tongue, and later learned Tibetan, Russian, and Turkish as well. Most interestingly, he would later travel to Istanbul within the Ottoman Empire, studying linguistics and graduating with honors from the International Esperanto School and learning this synthetic language along the way. Later forming his own Esperantist Union during his time in Moscow and Paris, he returned to Mongolia during our rise and now spreads his Esperantist-Right Socialist fusion to any that will listen to him. However, despite his intelligence and skill as a revolutionary and as head of the special service, his strange ideas largely fall on deaf ears. At least he is useful while he babbles about strange tongues."
tot_mon_flavor.19.a:0 "Interesaj!"
tot_mon_flavor.19.b:0 "Give this Mongolian academic a seat within the Trade Khural Union."

tot_mon_flavor.20.t:0 "Honoring the First Seven and Other Socialist Martyrs"
tot_mon_flavor.20.d:0 "Today, we honor the First Seven - the first seven founders of the MAN after the party formed in 1920 as Mongolia’s first political party following the unification of the Socialist anti-Chinese groups called Consular Hill and the Eastern Khure - along with so many other Socialist revolutionaries turned martyrs we have lost in our effort to build our People’s Republic. Though Soliin Danzan and Dogsomyn Bodoo still live and work to progress the Revolution, the traitorous Khorloogiin Choibalson was recently slain as retribution, leaving these two as the last of the MAN Old Guard that still draw breath. Additionally, other key members of the First Seven and the wider MAN now lost to us either due to inter-party violence or during our fight against the Mad Baron, such as Damdin Sükhbaatar, Darizavyn Losol, Dansranbilegiin Dogsom, L. Dendev, Dambyn Chagdarjav, Gelegorjiin Demid, Rinchingiin Elbegdorj, and Jambyn Lkhümbe, will be honored and remembered as well. A national holiday shall be created to cherish them and to honor their sacrifices, a military parade honoring their spirit is to be held under the direction of General Khatanbaatar Magsarjav, and a large statue of the founding MAN members is to be built at the center of Ulaanbaatar. No matter how we progress towards Socialism, we will never forget the giants that carried us here."
tot_mon_flavor.20.a:0 "We stand on the shoulders of these giants."

mon_saneberg_flavor.1.t:0 "A Step Towards a Reawaking of Tsarist Loyalism"
mon_saneberg_flavor.1.d:0 "According to Baron Von Sternberg, within the heart of every Russian, especially those of the Peon class, have an inward and deep love and devotion to the Tsar and the righteous feudal rule that has governed Russia and all mankind since time immemorial. It is only due to the poisonous influence of the Revolutionary and their Judeo–Bolshevik masters that the people lose this great love and loyalty. Thus, the Baron-turned-Regent has made reawakening this lost spirit and removing forever the influences that caused the loss of it to be the government's number one priority. To do this, the government shall work tirelessly to track down the spreaders of this vile poison, and work to rebuilt lost feudal structures. Nobles shall have their land and rights restored. Where no nobility remains to be restored, the most loyal Peons shall be ennobled, and the Baron's most loyal followers shall be given a position to suit their dedication to the cause. While such a radical transformation and undoing decades of failed reforms shall no doubt take years if not longer, in the end it will be worth it. After all, the Restoration is nothing short of a rebuilding of the natural order of things, and yet such an undertaking is worth the wait. For if God is with us, which he surely will be due to us restoring His Law, who is against us?"
mon_saneberg_flavor.1.a:0 "Rome was not built in a day."

mon_saneberg_flavor.2.t:0 "Fate of the Eurasianist Party"
mon_saneberg_flavor.2.d:0 "Of all political parties to rise in the neigh 20 year existence of the feeble Russian Republic, the Eurasianist Party stands out. Unlike the cowardly VNS or the craven Kadets, which sought the restoration of the Tsar along side the Republican system, the Eruasiainsts sought to dismantle the Republic and replace it with a new state, one built under a new, Eurasian, identity. Albeit under an 'Intellectual Council' that would guide the nation to it's Eurasian future.\n\nWhile the Mad Baron has no love of political parties, and especially no love for the Intelligentsia, save for when they can confirm his biases, the Eurasianists are different. Both the Baron and the Party share a wanted to transform Russia from a European power into a uniquely Eurasian one, although how much Asian is within this 'Eurasian' identity differs between the two. Both also share a special hatred for Socialism, along with similar ideas for where the borders of Eurasia end. With this being the case, and with the Baron short on allies across the reclaimed Empire, a few close to the Baron have raised the possbilty of working with them. While such an alliance so to speak would clearly be one sided, having allies we could turn too to help govern the state would greatly come in handy. To this end, three choices have been presenteed to the Baron on the status of the Eurasianists. Firstly, we could simply claim their ideals for our own, and allow them to exist, while working with us. Secondly, we could invite the leader of the Party to government, which would greatly indebt them to us. Lastly, we could simply ban them. The choice lies with the Baron alone."

mon_saneberg_flavor.3.d:0 "Following a beautifully conducted ceremony including the Patriarch himself, Baron Sternberg and several minor Bishops, Tsar Nicholas II and his family have been officially canonized. In a short speech, the Patriarch espoused the virtues of the Imperial Family, as he retold a dramatic retelling of their martyrdom. He told of the struggle of their short few weeks of house arrest, their patience in the face of abuse, and their resilience in the face of death.\n\nShortly after the canonization ceremony, the Mad Baron officially announced a new national holiday, On this day every year, each Russian shall take the day off to attend the Divine Liturgy, and to pay respect to the late Tsar, and remember the evils of Socialism. While some have complained about such a holiday, calling it an abomination of State and Church relations in the modern age. Such naysayers have quickly been silenced, some even by the Baron personally."

mon_saneberg_flavor.4.t:0 "A Great Crusade?"
mon_saneberg_flavor.4.d:0 "Since the dawn of the vile parasite of Revolution and it's Socialistic spawn, the vast masses of the world have been infected and taken away from the path of righteousness, taken in by the Son of Perdition. This being the case, few if any could see and understand this, and even fewer were willing to do anything about it. This was of course until the rise of Baron von Ungern-Sternberg, the Hero of Mongolia and Savior of Russia. In the Baron, even among other whites, was a burning hatred and desire to cleanse the world of Revolutionary fervor.\n\nWith Russia now once more under the control of a holy government, the Baron finds himself in a unique position to see the end of the Revolution. Should he only given the word, his vast armies could swarm forth from the borders of the Empire, not stopping until the revolution is finally and truly dead. While such a campaign would be costly, and some would even say impossible, the era of the Revolution could finally be well and truly over. The Baron has longed for this moment since the Revolution first reared it's head in the revolution of '05, but if he truly believes the time is right remains to be seen."

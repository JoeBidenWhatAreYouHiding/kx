MON_claims_of_greatness_desc:0 "Baron Roman Nicolaus von Ungern-Sternberg is the enigmatic and brutal leader of Mongolia.

Born as Agvaanl Uvsanchoijinyam Danzan Vanchüg, this reincarnation of the spiritual head of Gelug Tibetan Buddhism stands as both the spiritual and, in theory, political leader of Mongolia, but reality is often different from theory. \n\nIn truth, the Bogd Khan’s domain is run by the Bloody Baron Ungern-Sternberg, but this has not reduced the Bogdo Lama to be a mere puppet. Given their similar goals and dreams of a strong and free Mongolia, the two have grown quite close as they endeavor to restore the former glories of the Mongolia people to this sad, run-down state they now found themselves lording over. This relationship has drawn the ire of the the other Lamas, as well as the various democratic and zealous Buddhist groups in our nation, who view this cooperation between the ‘False Khan’ and the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu as a perversion of Buddhist traditions and practices. \n\nRegardless, the ageing Bogd Khan still nominally rules as the monarch and patriarch of Mongolia and the Father of Mongolian Buddhism, and now only time will tell if he strengthens his own positions or lets himself and his nation drift off as puppets of other, more ambitious actors."

Yet, Mongolia did not gain full independence until Baron Roman Nicolaus von Ungern-Sternberg and his Asiatic Cavalry Division invaded Mongolia in 1920 and delivered it from the Russian protectorate. Having then captured a significant section of the resource-rich region of Tuva from the Russians, he was free to consolidate his rule. Sternberg began promoting his political authority in the country, developing a powerful military apparatus too entrenched for anyone to dislodge from his position while he works to make his claims and desires a reality..."

Heavily influenced by the numerous Bolshevik exiles who have hidden away in Mongolia since the Russian Civil War, this more authoritarian and Totalist-inspired wing of the party seeks to emulate the fallen Soviet model of old, creating a Mongolian Union of Soviets to truly free the Mongolian proletariat.

Behind him stand thousands of militiamen and volunteers willing to die for his righteous cause - to oust the infective Chinese and other foreign parasites from Mongolia. Though some of his ideas the West would describe as socialist or progressive, he is also a militant nationalist and more of a storied figure of legend than any true political ideologue, herding his hordes of nomadic followers to steal back the rightful land of the Mongols from nobles, lamas, and foreigners who seek to sully this great Steppe. Gaida Meiren and his followers shall tear down the feudal structures imposed on the Mongolia people by the Chinese and the Mongolian Nobility and finally sever Mongolia’s destiny from that of the Middle Kingdom.

As the largest Socialist force in the nation, their only real competition for support comes from the exploits of Gada Meiren, or would have if it were not for Gada Merien’s forces and the MAN hammering out a deal of cooperation and coalition for the good of Mongolia.

However, this faction seeks to crown either the leading Prince in their coalition, Demchugdongrub, or even the Khan of Kumul as their new King and political leader.

Split internally between those who seek to cooperate with the Mongolians, giving them greater autonomy, and hardliners who seek to Sinicize Mongolia as much as possible and open its lands fully for Chinese settlement. These Gamin, as the Mongolians call them, have few friends in Mongolia, but that will not deter them from their lofty goals.§!"

These mystics and holymen serve as the advisors and aides to the Bogd Khan, and seek to complete the process of making the Bogd Khan a true monarch of Mongolia. They seek to establish a ‘hereditary’ line where the current reincarnation of the Khan is once again put on the throne as the one mortal form dies and another takes its place, with the Buddyn Zövlöl serving as interim regents while each new Jebtsundamba Khutuktu is found, creating a functional dynastic monarchy founded on Buddhist principles. However, this council is not a unified front, and fundementalist influences have been seeping in, driving many of its members to more radical, extremist views. All in all though, the Buddyn Zövlöl merely seeks to create a pure theocratic monarchy here in Mongolia, and will stop at nothing to achieve this dream.§!"

Mon_dev_Tuva:0 "Develop the Tuvan region"
Mon_dev_Tuva_desc:0 "During the Blue Revolution, Tuva and the West were the most sympathetic to the revolutionary cause, with rumors claiming that its leaders were hiding therein. We should develop the region in order to keep the local populace content, at least for now..."

MON_dev_xinjiang:0 "Develop the Xinjiang Region"
MON_dev_xinjiang_desc:0 "After our recent conquest of Xinjiang, many factories and necessary infrastructure within the region have been destroyed beyond repair. It is our duty as their benevolent rulers to help them get back on their feet."

MON_army_money:0 "Increase Military Spending"
MON_army_money_desc:0 "In these times of great strife, Mongolia needs to defend herself. We must therefore ensure that we increase funding for the Armed Forces to the point where our nation can well defend herself. Better to expend capital on defense, than to be left floundering when war comes."

MON_army_supply:0 "Logistics Initiative"
MON_army_supply_desc:0 "Having huge stockpiles of weapons and machinery means nothing if they can't get to our men on the frontlines. This plan would hopefully put us in a position where, at the very least, supplies will get to our men fast."

MON_best_help:0 "Help from the Guard"
MON_best_help_desc:0 "The Baron’s Guard already received the best training and top of the line equipment which mark them out as the elite of our Army. Consequently, some in our High Command suggest that we cement this role by giving them the role of officers in our grand army."

MON_cav_modern:0 "The Modern Cavalry"
MON_cav_modern_desc:0 "As we continue our research into motorized vehicle,s the old cavalry divisions have begun to feel antiquated and obsolete. Though they won't be put out of service for a while longer, it is clear that our men now find their tanks and trucks more reliable than mere horses."

MON_empire_reborn_desc:0 "Our glorious leader of all Mongols, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, has ascended from a common forieng mercenary to a divine crusader leading all who follow to the glories of victory!

MON_brotherhood_alliance:0 "Pact of Brotherhood"
MON_brotherhood_alliance_desc:0 "Sternberg has envisioned an alliance of strong kingdoms loyal to the traditions of Eurasian culture, a brotherhood built off mutual respect and strength.

MON_mad_khan:0 "The Horde Must Expand!"
MON_mad_khan_desc:0 "With chaotic fighting and regimes rising and falling all around us, it is the perfect time to launch expansionist wars on our weaker neighbours.

MON_complete_empire_desc:0 "Our vast conquests have expanded the borders of Mongolia to stretch across Eurasia, the steppe plains and eastern China are under our control.

MON_bribe_nobles_support:0 "Bribe the Princes"
MON_bribe_nobles_support_desc:0 "Though the nobles are opposing our government currently, we can easily take some of the less loyal nobles by bribing them. The princes should be so pliant towards conformity after decades of chinese supression."

MON_impose_authoritarian_ideas:0 "Impose Authoritarian Ideas"
MON_impose_authoritarian_ideas_desc:0 "Many in Urga currently believe that perhaps it is time for democracy. The problem is that they do not realise how wrong they are, and must be disciplined to stop democracy from infesting the whole of the nation."
MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism:0 "Display Ungern's Buddhism"
MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism_desc:0 "Many in Mongolia do not believe Ungern-Sternberg is committed enough to protecting buddhism and acting in a buddhist lifestyle. Some public displays of him and some loyal monks meditating and holding some speeches should convince them otherwise."

MON_the_great_buddhist_icon_desc:0 "Though Ungern-Sternberg is not a tulku like the Bogd Khan, he should still be known as a buddhist figure of almost equal importance in Mongolia. Fortunately foundational work like the Tibetan Agvan Dorzhiev's work 'The Shambhala Prayer' is already well known and easy material to manipulate for propaganda."
MON_the_greatest_dictator:0 "Cult of Personality"
MON_the_greatest_dictator_desc:0 "To make sure Ungern-Sternberg remains in power, the propaganda around his cult of personality should be temporarily increased massively. This cult of personality relies on mythmaking that officer Ossendowski is adept at spinning."
MON_enforce_officer_loyalty:0 "Enforce Officer Loyalty"
MON_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc:0 "The officer class is a hotbed for noble traitors, socialist rebels and buddhist extremists. Their loyalty should be tested and hardened to root out these issues.

MON_urga_military_parade:0 "Urga Military Parade"
MON_urga_military_parade_desc:0 "Nothing gets the peoples support and shows dominance more than a military parade. To the people of Urga, a military parade is more of a holiday than a display of power, owing to the newness of the concept.

MON_ungerns_secures_power_desc:0 "Finally, Ungern-Sternberg and his Russian military clique have defeated the opposition, and have once again taken the reigns of the nation. Renewed by the vigor of military victory, the Russian-led junta is ready to make their postulations into reality."

MON_aggressive_industrialisation:0 "Aggressive Industrialisation"
MON_aggressive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Much of the population lives a nomadic lifestyle, not in the cities or towns. Due to this, the low population, and the harsh conditions, Mongolia's industry is very lacking.

MON_train_the_nomads:0 "Train the Nomads"
MON_train_the_nomads_desc:0 "The nomadic population of the steppes is too disunited and not trained enough to be a strong military force. Great training is needed to be able to make war like we must."

MON_centralised_power_under_sternberg_desc:0 "One of the problems that caused the revolt in the West and the chaos that descended into Urga was because we were forced to share power. The radical buddhists and rich princes had large power in our government. Now, with them defeated, we can centralise power under Ungern-Sternberg, so that he can protect the nation."
MON_propoganda_in_the_cities:0 "Propaganda in the Cities"

MON_statue_in_urga_desc:0 "Though the socialist MAN were unable to take power months ago during the Western Revolt, they still control some small cells, primarily in the hard to reach north of the nation. These cells must be completely destroyed if we are to be safe from the communist threat."

MON_encourage_myths_about_sternberg_desc:0 "Most Mongolians still believe much folklore and myths about history and current life. Many people even believe Ungern-Sternberg to be the reincarnation of Jamsaran, the God of War.

MON_more_mil_expansion_desc:0 "With the lofty ambitions of Ungern’s goals, we will need to dedicate the entire industrial apparatus of the state towards military production, save what few sectors are needed to provide a sustainable existence for our people. We will turn the skies over cities like Urga and Khovd black with the smog of progress as the factories that will fuel our victory spring to life."
MON_spread_orthodxy:0 "Endorse The Holy Trinity Church of Urga"
MON_spread_orthodxy_desc:0 "In order to prepare the people of Mongolia for further interactions with Russia in preparation for our inevitable triumph, we must spread the only other true faith on Earth besides Buddhism: Russian Orthodoxy. These two religions are two sides of the same coin, preaching the same ideals to two different yet kindred peoples. By endorsing the largest Orthodox parish in the nation and allowing more churches to be built around Mongolia, we spread this faith as we spread Buddhism as well."
MON_spread_bhuddism:0 "Buddhist Fanaticism"
MON_spread_bhuddism_desc:0 "Buddhism is the preferred faith of our Baron and most of our population, for it is a righteous and pure faith that is undeniable in its truth and benefits. Across the Steppe, fanaticism and zealotry for the Buddhist faith has exploded as many feel as though this righteous faith is beset by external forces. We must tap into this primal rage and channel it into useful avenues, for Buddhism the one of the two true faiths, and all others are heretical filth."
MON_buddy_with_bogd_khan:0 "The Two ‘Khans’ of Urga"
MON_buddy_with_bogd_khan_desc:0 "Baron Undern-Sternberg and the Bogd Khan have long been close friends and allies, with the spiritual leader serving as Ungern’s guide as he delved further into the Buddhist faith.

MON_spread_monarchism_desc:0 "The Baron is a staunch monarchist by all standards, following the will of his friend and mentor the Bogd Khan here while championing the crusade of the missing but rightful heir to the Romanov throne, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. Though this true son of Russia has not been seen in over a decade, the Baron still holds hope that he shall return to lead Russia to greatness. In his absence, the Baron is his regent, and the herald of the purity of Russian monarchism."
MON_currency_reform:0 "An Authentically Mongolian Currency"
MON_currency_reform_desc:0 "To finance the necessary expansion Mongolia’s economy and industry will need to fuel Ungern’s battlelust, the Baron has devised an ingenious monetary scheme. By creating a new currency tied to the personal herds of livestock of Mongolia’s various farmers, estates, and shepherds, we shall ensure a reliable weight behind this hopefully functional currency for Mongolia’s economy to expand with. In this system, a sheep would be worth 10 notes, a cow 25 notes, a horse 50 notes, and a camel 100. Nicknamed ‘Barons’ after Ungern himself, these notes shall be the building blocks of the new Mongolian financial sector."
MON_expand_trans_siberian:0 "The Iron Veins of Mongolia"
MON_expand_trans_siberian_desc:0 "The Trans-Siberian Railway is the lifeblood of Mongolia, connecting us to the wider world and allowing much needed supplies to flow into our lands.

MON_deal_with_bandits_ungern_desc:0 "Through his time as a raider and bandit that rampaged across the Steppe, the Baron Undern-Sternberg has developed close ties and reliable contacts to numerous bandit groups and warlords across Mongolia. By cashing in on past debts, or paying with new bribes, the Baron shall earn the aid of these brigands as we prepare for our final conquest."
MON_deas_with_nomads:0 "Nomadic Allies"
MON_deas_with_nomads_desc:0 "The Baron has long held close ties with various Mongolian groups of nomads, steppe riders, and other traditionalist Mongolian groups that still adhere to the pastoralist ideal. By ensuring to protect this lifestyle as the rest of the world modernizes around them, we shall sway these forces to join us in our coming crusade."
MON_anti_anti_asian:0 "Pan-Asian Supremacism"
MON_anti_anti_asian_desc:0 "Though a Baltic German by blood and raised as a Russian, the Baron Ungern-Sternberg is a true all to the Pan-Asian cause. Detesting anti-Asian hate and and long promoting Asian supremacist views, seeing himself as an honorary Mongolian, Ungern wishes to spread these ideas across all of Mongolia and eventually all of Russia. The time of the pompous West’s dominance is over, for the sun is rising once more in the East."
MON_prepare_for_war:0 "Prepare for Eschaton"
MON_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "Eschaton, the End Times, is nearly upon us, and we must be ready for it.

MON_take_over_trm_desc:0 "Across the Amur in Vladivostok lies the pretender government led by [TRM.getleader], who has sat licking their wounds since their exile following the Russian Civil War.

We will slaughter these pretenders where they stand, while their backs are still to the icy Pacific."
MON_take_over_russia:0 "Claim the Russian Mantle"
MON_take_over_russia_desc:0 "We must drive for Moscow and claim our rightful position as lords of Russia.

MON_make_fengtian_based:0 "A New Mandate"
MON_make_fengtian_based_desc:0 "The Qing have already lost their mandate, and yet the mandate still requires an Emperor, thus we shall sponsor a new Dynast, backing their (perhaps new)claims over China in exchange for their support."

With most of Central Asia in his hands, Ungern Khan rules all Mongolic peoples and everyone living in a yurt swears allegiance to him alone. A man beyond the capabilities of other mortals, Ungern is thought of by many Mongolians as an avatar of the God of War or in the very least – as a reincarnation of the great Genghis Khan and with his newest victories those doubting these claims have been reduced to a mere handful. Fuelled by the sweet fruits of victory Ungern Khan has convened a grand assembly in Urga to manifest the triumph of Mongolia's recent conquests. The question, however, remains whether or not the Mad Baron will satisfy himself with the establishment of a Greater Mongolia or take his faithful tribal forces and his hardened Savage Division further on the path of ambition, madness and glory?"

mongolia.33.d:0 "A ruthless dictator, Roman von Ungern-Sternberg was never considered an ordinary man and his plans and actions were usually expressive and harsh. However, his officers and generals always waited for the right moment to overthrow him, as they considered him an out-of-control warmonger who had no mercy even for his trusted lieutenants. Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern's demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling. The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government. Commanders loyal to the Khan were arrested without any warning and all major sites in Urga occupied by the putschists. As the rebels stormed the Baron's residence, Ungern viciously defended himself shooting several leading conspirators in a desperate firefight. However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself. Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan came to an end."

Due to the assassination, Russia has fallen into domestic chaos and will thus not be interested nor capable of intervening in domestic Mongolian politics. Roman von Ungern-Sternberg understands that this is the right time to make Mongolia as great as it once was, but he needs a skilled second in command to succeed. Will he choose his loyal general from the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Boris Rezukhin? Or maybe the current head of government, the Mongolian aristocrat Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren to further consolidate his popularity with the Mongol people? Finally the religious leader, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, could be chosen to guarantee Ungern's divine status and prove his direct reincarnation as the God of War?"

The union of the two peoples and the consolidation of Buddhism's two great centres would cement Ungern's claim to a new Mongolian Empire. We should liberate Tibet from the heretical traitors who care more about their moneybags than about their people. Our armies are ready to bring peace and prosperity to Tibet - Genghis Khan II has to unite all Mongolic peoples into one nation. It's our destiny."

mongolia.40.d:0 "The Mongols always held von Ungern-Sternberg in high regards and called him 'Ak Bagatur' – 'The White Warrior'. It was generally believed that he was a reincarnation of Genghis Khan and as such didn't care much about his original Russian upbringing. But when Ungern was overthrown and his generals took power, the Mongol population was deeply disappointed with the successor's behaviour. The former commanders of Ungern's army considered themselves Russians and ruled Mongolia as if were a colony and not their motherland. This oppression combined with the strictness of a military regime caused a wave of riots in the Mongolian army, which consisted of various tribesmen under command of steppe nobility. Leaders of the Mongol tribes under the command of the aristocratic 'noyan' Amagaiin Bajudai started a massive anti-government revolt under the slogan of "Mongolian tribes against the Russian oppressors".

For the second time in history, a force has ridden out from the Eastern Steppe to conquer all of Russia, but this time it was not mere Mongol leading the charge, but a true son of Russia himself! \n\nNow, the Baron shall rule this prize as regent until an official government can be formed and the true Tsar found.

Sternberg, along with his elite russian guard entered the camp of Ja Lama while being tracked with the beady eyes of the Lama’s battle hardened forces and made their way towards the central yurt. There, the Lama sat playing cards with his generals, old and wise and yet completely drunk and surrounded by a horde of plunder and weapons. One such weapon in the Ja Lama’s illustrious collection was a Russian Fedorov, a weapon Sternberg had once also used in a shared struggle with Ja Lama.  As the Baron began to speak, he was swiftly shushed and pushed back by Ja Lama’s guard, not wanting their game to be disturbed or their master to be angered and roused from his drunken stupor. In direct response, the Baron’s men drew their weapons and awaited his orders… \n\nThe Baron thought to himself for a moment. He had two options.

mongolia.106.d:0 "The infamous peasant bandit leader Gada Meiren and his forces have seized a major bridge on the Trans-Mongolian railway, persuading the local garrison to join him in their occupation as they attempt to bring the vital line to a complete halt. Being observed by Sternberg and his men from a ridge, Gada Meiren has fortified his position and he will only further entrench his position with time. Sternberg does not have enough men in his scouting party to overcome Meiren’s forces decisively, meaning a bloody and exceedingly risky conflict would ensue. However, Sternberg does also have his artillery battalion at his disposal, and with their guns in range, he has the ability to destroy Gada Meiren's forces. However, such a barrage would greatly risk the bridge as a result, leaving the Mad Baron with a tough decision to make."

As the structure began to collapse, Gada Meiren and his men attempted to make a hasty withdrawal. However, Sternberg, fueled with vengeance and a desire to slay this bandit lord, ordered for his artillery attachment to loose another volley, hoping to wipe Gada Meiren and his army from the map. \n\nThe second barrage hit heavier than the last, their guns now finding the perfect firing solution and arc after ranging with the first barrage. Hitting with deadly accuracy, this second wave further decimated the bridge's foundation and support beams, but frustratingly missed the bulk of Gada Meiren’s forces. \n\n Enraged, Ungern ordered salvo after salvo until the barrels of his howitzers glowed red hot and his ammunition was largely spent. As the smoke began to clear, the bridge lay in absolute ruins, severing a vital connector of the Trans-Siberian Railway, while Gada Meiren and the last of his surviving forces had long since fled into the countryside in the cacophony. Absolutely enraged, Ungern drew his service revolver and quickly executed the closest artillery officer near him before mounting his horse and riding off back towards Urga, with both the bridge he needed to defend now destroyed and his nemesis once again slipping away."
mongolia.107.a:0 "He won't be a threat anytime soon."

mongolia.108.t:0 "A Great Sacrifice"
mongolia.108.d:0 "Sternberg has led the assault, charging at Gada Meiren’s defensive line on the bridge head on in the hope of overwhelming them. Gada Meiren had anticipated the Bloody Baron’s attack however, and set explosives on the ridge preemptively. With a massive explosion, the mountain face began to fall onto Ungern’s forces, which crushed the majority of Sternberg’s men in rubble and debris. Blinded by rage, Sternberg stormed Gada Meiren’s fortification with his surviving forces, sacrificing more men in order to get even near Gada Meiren. However, the avalanche had provided Gada with enough time to escape with the main body of his forces, leaving the local garrison to buy him time to escape into the countryside wounded and without an army. Enraged, Sternberg slaughtered all those left, realizing he had been humiliated by Gada Meiren with thousands of his men now left dead for nothing."

However, with this victory secured, the question now is now who amongst these loyalists should lead? We could simply set up a new regency council composed of all influential members within the loyalist clique to lead the nation in the Khan’s stead. With Russian generals, Mongolian tulkus, and various other nobles and military figures all having equal say, it would at least ensure no one group rose to dominance and sullied the Khan’s legacy. Alternatively, we could crown one of the more notable standouts within the clique as the political leader of the nation. Of men that fit this bill, we could either go with the honored noble Navaanneren, a true direct descendant of Ghenghis Khan himself, or the Bogd Gegen, our spiritual leader, regranting him the title of Bogd Khan. Finally, and most wildly, we could send a delegation to the Baltics and ask that the Khan’s estranged brother come to Mongolia to rule as the new Khan, taking up his late brother’s mantle and ruling our Khanate in his stead. Who shall we choose?"
mongolia.109.a:0 "A Regency Council shall be made, composed of the Khan’s most ardent loyalists.."

However, the question that is on everyone's mind is who will be his successor? The two most likely candidates are his son, who he has named after Amursana, the famed Oirat hero, and his faithful ally and top military general Khorloogiin Choibalsan. Either would make a fine leader for Mongolia to carry on his vision, though Amursana is far more spiritual of the two, having fallen in the White Faith movement, while Choibalsan is a hard, cold-blooded military man.

Thousands upon thousands of Chinese civilians have been mercilessly slaughtered like animals and defiled, and we must decide how to act. Currently, our regime espouses much anti-Chinese rhetoric and propaganda, with much of it going so far as to fully dehumanize the Chinese people.

These two rival schools of Tibetan Buddhism have long vied for influence in our land, but our state has long been a staunch follower of the Gelug school. To cement national unity, many have called for us to further spread our faith, and even to go as far as to suppress the ‘balck hat’ faith so that religious divisions do not tear our nation apart. However, others have argued that only by embracing both can we achieve true unity and peace. What shall we do?"

However, the question has arisen if we should further this, as Ja Lama is also a staunch practitioner of the syncretic White Faith, while many within our ranks still follow the Tengrist and Shamanistic beliefs of old Mongolia. We must decide, if Buddhism alone shall be our state religion, or if the White Faith, or pure Tengri ideals instead will be spread as well."

In addition to this, we could also fully implement the Soyombo Script of Zanabazar, pleasing the SRS and allowing us to further influence Buddhism itself, slowly manipulating it for use as a tool to control the Mongol people."

Now, with our enemies defeated and our homeland secured, we have a choice to make.

Alternatively, many within our clique still stand as ardent monarchists, but due to the opulence and corruption of the Qing, their only stand one true candidate to rally around. Yuan Keding, son of the infamous Hongxian Emperor Yuan Shi Kai, has been a guest at our court for quite some time, and has been a rallying figure for China’s various surviving monarchist elements.

He could continue the charade that his mental brother truly believed in, rising as the third incarnation of Genghis Khan and the newest avatar of Mahakala. Alternatively, he could drop this act all together, and instead rule Mongolia as a measured, sane, and rational leader, without the fantasy and fanfare attached that Roman oh so craved. Finally, Rolf could simply reign as a figurehead, and allow the Buddhist monks and the Bogd Khan truly run the scenes of Mongolia behind the facade of Rolf’s authority.

The least likely is giving the lands to Kokand, a liberal democratic haven where Jadidist and Kadimist factions battle for supremacy over this blossoming republic. Though having little in common with our regime’s ideals, they’d likely be beneficial in our attempts to pacify these lands post conquest. Alternatively, we could reach out to the more conservative Khiva or especially Bukhara, whose state ideals are more inline with the Khan’s.

Using some of his precious plundered loot he and his hordes have collected and salvaged over his career, the Baron could sway the favor of the princes and have them eating out of his hands. Though by far the most costly of his three options, this would also buy their loyalty permanently, alleviating the Baron of an unnecessary headache that has plague him his entire rule without the need for excessive violence and without causing further unrest in this already teetering nation. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, the Baron could take the most enjoyable option for a man of his pleasures and delights, and choose to have these troublesome nobles hunted down and arrested, with any of those foolish enough to resist meeting the cool justice of a cavalryman’s arrow. Though this option would further drive up the spirits, morale, and plunder of the Baron’s beloved cavalry hordes, it would also likely drive Mongolia further into chaos. \n\nFinally, the Baron could take the most simple and cheapest option available to himself, and simply ignore the princes and their unending chittering. They are just princes after all, and what are mere princes to a man of Ungern-Sternberg’s standing! Besides, if left alive and alone, the Baron’s regime would be better able to focus on far more pressing matters of the state, such as the rioting groups of democratic protestors or bhuddist extremists that gnaw away at our administration’s foundation."

mon_khan.15.d:0 "With our decision to ignore the ever-bickering and complaining princes, our massively overstretched administration has been freed up to focus on one of the other pressing issues that is plaguing our Khanate as we speak. Though there are many metaphorical fires we could put out that currently burn away at the very fabric of our crumbling Khanate, two developments stand out above all others. \n\nAll throughout Mongolia’s largest cities, democratic protests have begun to break out, influenced by foreign ideas flooding into our lands from Western-tainted peoples such as the Russians or Chinese. These protests must be dealt with if we are to consolidate our full control over Mongolia’s few urban centers. As such, one direction we could take could be to dispatch our available forces to major cities such as Urga, Uliastai, Khem-Beldir, Minusinsk,and others to quell the fire of democratic passion before it can get out of hand. \n\nAlternatively, reports have come in from our rural villages and far-off monasteries of Bhuddist extremists desecrating temples and burning villages already sworn to the Baron’s rule. These zealots claim the Baron is a false prophet and a madman sent to distract the Mongolian people from the light of true Buddhism, and have decried Ungern-Sternberg as a fool playing God. These ideas would be very dangerous to our regime if left to get out of hand, and as such, this development would also be worth dealing with as soon as possible, lest these radicals undermine the people’s faith in their Baron."

mon_khan.16.d:0 "The Mongolian people are largely and deeply Buddhist, and have been for centuries. However, many see their dear leader the Black Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg as a tyrant who merely adopted this ancient tradition to satisfy his own morbid curiosities and to quell the people of Mongolia. The people call him a false Tulku unlike the beloved but infantile Bogd Khan, but Ungern-Sternberg has long endeavored to be a figure of equal or greater reverence than a mere child born into the life of luxury. \n\nTo remedy this false public perception, the Baron has participated in a slew of public events with loyal monks and seers, performing all the acts and rituals of a true, practicing Buddhist. However, drawing upon the honored Tibetan monk Agvan Dorzhiev’s work ‘The Shambhala Prayer’, the Baron has created a new prayer, glorifying himself, that shall be taught to all the people of Mongolia. They will all be expected to be able to recite this work of pious art by memory, no matter its length, for faith in Mongolia, faith in Buddhism, and faith in the Baron have all become one in the same. The Baron, or as he slowly has been pusing to be called - the Khan, shall prove to all Mongolians he is a true Buddhist and a true Tulku, not by birth but by earned right.  \n\n’O all-around perfect Khan, Clear Evolved From First of All, who made the great distant lineage widespread in the cities of Shambala, my ever-vigilant sublime guardian, please make these words of truth come true that I request to you...’"

Though this move would likely anger millions of Chinese citizens, they are in no position to argue, bargain, or even fight back.

Alternatively, we could crown the respected Bogd Khan as the new Emperor, as technically Ungern-Sternberg, even with his near-divine status, is still regent to this great Khan and reincarnated tulku. Finally, to appease the Budhists of China, Tibet, and Mongolia, we could take the most radical option and place the 14th Dalai Lama himself on the throne instead.

Upon the beginning of this urgent and sudden meeting, the chief rider of the Mongolian delegation handed the Patriarch a scroll sealed and embossed with the mark of the Khan. Written on this parchment was a simple offer from the Khan: join us on our holy crusade to cleanse all of Asia, or simply be another roadblock for the Khanate’s cavalry to crush underhoof - a simple enough proposal, though one that possibly holds the very fate of our salvationist movement.

However, to all groups, the Great Yuan is known widely as being called dead. The great Mongol-led Dynasty of Kublai Khan withered and crumbled into history before the Qing were even dreams in the minds of the nomadic Jurchens, and has been completely extinct since the 1360’s. That is however, until the righteous crusade of the great Bloody Baron, heir to Ghenghis Khan and avatar of the Buddhist god of war Vaiśravaṇa. This demigod of the Buddhist faith and living effigy of Mongolian retribution and nationalism has seized the Mandate of Heaven and reclaimed the lands of the Middle Kingdom for a Mongolian Khanate once more for the first time in nearly a millennium.

However, an alternative exists to both these camps, though they lack much popular support. This small but outspoken group claims that only though crowning a new monarch that neither side chiefly supports is the only way for China to remain unified, and the only candidates of fitting noble blood are our Buddhist friends to the West."

mon.426.d:0 "The traveling storyteller Damdinbazar has published his notes on Mongolia in a new book, On the Trail of Ancient Man. This book describes a beast in the Gobi Desert.\n'It is shaped like a sausage about two feet long, has no head nor leg and it is so poisonous that merely to touch it means instant death. It lives in the most desolate parts of the Gobi Desert.' "

mon.427.d:0 "From the Oirat mountains, near the land of Chinggis Khaan's birth, comes a revival of his old ways. A shaman, Chet Chelpan, has reported wide seeing a rider in white, the White Burkhan. Chet has organized Buryat churches in order to revoke Buddhism in the land of our ancestors, and is oppressing our history with his claims that the Oirat will be liberated by some white savior. This is obviously referring to the great Baron Ungern himself, and so Ungern's officers suggest inviting Chet to Urga to preach his message of hope.\nThou peopling within thyself, in gold and silver, A nation, White Altai! Thou who illuminest the day— Sun—Burkhan! Thou who illuminest the night— Moon—Burkhan! "

mon.428.d:0 "The former captive Officer Ossendowski has written a book immortalizing Baron Ungern. The book is mostly mythological, and contain the superstitious claim that Baron Ungern's brother, who allegedly died in the Russian Civil War, haunts his enemies and former friends. Despite this candor, Baron Ungern is concerned for the mental well being of his polish commander. The years of steppe life and his inability to return home is reflected in the book, which takes a fatalistic approach to the future of Mongolia."
mon.428.a:0 "I really should see if he's alive"

mon.429.t:0 "Quartermaster Vlad Roerich Deserts Army"
mon.429.d:0 "Quartermaster Vladimir Roerich, brother of famous painter and orientalist Nicholas Reorich, has suddenly deserted his post and taken a hoard of valuables with him. Vladimir was always a rebellious sort, which was initially why Baron Ungern allowed him into his Asiatic Cavalry division. Now Baron Ungern has put a warrant out for his arrest. It is suspected that Vladimir had received help in leaving from underground MAN members. It is unknown where he will head to."

mon.430.d:0 "Quartermaster Vladimir Roerich has found by Ungern's agents in Shenyang, where he was running an agricultural commune called 'The Tri-Artel Commune'. This commune had used stolen funds from Ungern to feed the homeless and destitute.

This has enabled the story of Temujin, Chinggis Khaan, to be authoritatively told. In the spirit of Ungern, Tsendiin Damdinsüren included a forward claiming that the events of the Secret History teach a lesson to all Mongols. This lesson being 'Such a prophetic life as Temujins has happened many times after. In Russia, under Peter the Great, did a great conquest take place that restored the honour of the Mongols.'"

### 424 - 434  Authdem Flavor Events

mon.446.t:0 "Memorial to the Red Hat Rebellion"
mon.446.d:0 "A memorial has been built in Inner Mongolia to memorialize the thousands that died from Chinese persecution and fled Inner Mongolia during the Red Hat Rebellion. This has been coyly referred to as the 'Jindandao incident' by chinese propaganda. Many still living remember the hundreds of thousands that were lost, and to which the western observers celebrated as a triumph against our faith. The Buddyn Zövlöl government promises to avenge their deaths."
mon.446.a:0 "Soon we shall return"

mon.436.t:0 "Renovate Memorial to Chinggis Khaan"
mon.436.d:0 "The long storied history of the relics of Chinggis Khaan is on the rise, recognized by scholars like Zhang Xiangwen, who proclaimed Ejin Horo as the site of the Khaan's burial. It is essential that we recall the relics of Ejin Horo's memorial to Urga, in order to safeguard them from treasure seekers. It is already rumored that the vicious warlords of the south have plundered tombs of lesser emperors and disgraced their names in their own vain bids for immortal fame. However, us Mongols have the will to draw what we hold dear inwards for protection."
mon.436.a:0 "I hope the Buddhist monks do not mind"

mon.437.t:0 "Chinggis Khaan Relics Stolen, Taken to Gansu"
mon.437.d:0 "Disaster has struck our efforts to secure the relics of Chinggis Khan from chinese robberies. It appears that a contingent of rouge Guominjun soldiers have intercepted the relics in transit and have fled with them to Gansu. Gansu, a hive of scum and villainy that received a comeuppance once, and should again if any harm is to befall our national treasures."
mon.437.a:0 "They're just like Feng"

mon.438.t:0 "Guominjun Rouges Ransom Chinggis Khaan's Relics"
mon.438.d:0 "Our infiltrators have entered Gansu and are unable to locate the relics of Chinggis Khaan. Locals reported that most relics that pass through are sold to visiting explorers, officers and landlords, despite none of these groups claiming ownership of any relics currently. A breakthrough came when a Mongol emissary was contacted by a Guominjun defector, who claims that he can arrange a ransom for the relics and a peaceful transaction, for a price."
mon.438.a:0 "Any price is worth our history"
mon.438.b:0 "New deal, the relics or your head!"

mon.439.t:0 "Guominjun Rouges Lied, Search Continues"
mon.439.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to deal with the Guominjun defector, it turns out that he was lying the entire time. Months of effort is wasted, and the infiltration is presumed a failure. [MON.GetLeader], however, has refused to accept this loss. A second, more thorough investigation has been announced that will track down potential agitant elements in the Western Provinces that would have an interest in Chinggis Khaan's legacy."
mon.439.a:0 "We are NOT giving up!"

mon.440.t:0 "Chinggis Khaan's Relics Found in Kumul"
mon.440.d:0 "Our second investigation made a breakthrough in the far western land of Kumul, thousands of kilometers from Inner Mongolia. It appears that the family of the Shah of Kumul had wrestled the relics of Chinggis Khaan from their first buyers, and have claimed it as their own owing to their Chagatai legacy. This offense done by the muslims would have resulted in war, if not for the diplomatic grace of [MON.GetLeader]. For a very large fee, the relics of Chinggis Khaan are recovered finally, and the Shah's family compensated more than adequately."
mon.440.a:0 "An easier deal than expected"

mon.441.t:0 "The Hunt for Japan's Herald"
mon.441.d:0 "Recently, word has spread across Inner Mongolia of an Imam, Muhammed-Gabdulkhay Kurbangaliev, that is agitating muslims toward Fengtian. Long have the banners opposed any political influence of Islam in Inner Mongolia, and until now no institution dared to challenge us in this regard. But coming out of Shanyang are pamphlets called 'Japan's Herald' written in Arabic and chinese calling for muslims to emigrate to Fengtian, promising them a return and holy victory against Buddhism. This is just the threat the Kalachakra tantra predicted, and it is our duty to find and capture the Imam advocating for this apocalyptic conflict."
mon.441.a:0 "Monks must protect ourselves"

mon.442.t:0 "Japan's Herald Found, Imprisoned"
mon.442.d:0 "Our agents have finally located the radical imam Muhammed-Gabdulkhay Kurbangaliev, who has been agitating muslims against Buddhists. The Imam was apprehended by our agents after a mysterious man in Shanyang, Vladimir Roerich, tipped us off. It appears that this Imam was a former ally of Baron Ungern to boot, which only reinforces the idea that Baron Ungern cared not for us Buddhists. The imam Kurbangaliev shall be detained indefinitely, and hopefully the Japanese cannot find another such as him to do their dirty work. Vladimir Roerich has been well compensated and we hope his Tri-Artel Commune continues to help the beleaguered in Shenyang."
mon.442.a:0 "What a curious ally"

mon.444.t:0 "Barchenko's Curious Expedition"
mon.444.d:0 "Though we are extremely wary of further Russian exploration, Alexander Barchenko distinguishes himself from the usual transparent spies. Barchenko claims to be a true believer in Tantric Buddhism, and claims to be writing a scientific paper on the health benefits of a monatic lifestyle. [MON.GetLeader] was ready to approve of his study, only to be stopped by a minister with one of Barchenko's other papers. This paper, entitled 'On the Transfer of Thoughts To A Distance' is some kind of scientific paper on divination. Alarmed at what appears to be another Russian conman's ploy to exploit Mongolia's culture, a deeper consideration of his plan is in order."
mon.444.a:0 "Out! We are not a curiosity"

mon.445.t:0 "The Secret History of the Mongols Rediscovered"
mon.445.d:0 "Mongolian author Tsendiin Damdinsüren has managed to find and translate a copy of The Secret History of the Mongols from it's chinese text into Khalkha Mongolian. This has enabled the story of Temujin, Chinggis Khaan, to be authoritatively told. In the spirit of nationalism, Tsendiin Damdinsüren included a forward cautioning Mongolians from selling this book to foreigners. Damdinsüren's forward states that 'Mongol history must never be warped or stolen by foreigners ever again.'"
mon.445.a:0 "Could we be in another golden age?"

mon.169.t:0 "Our Russia policy"
mon.169.d:0 "For many years now we have aligned close to Russia. Now, however, after they ended their economic assistance to us after the death of President Kerensky, it has come into question whether we should continue to follow the Russians. However, aligning against them would call into question why we, as Russians, are even leading in Mongolia."
mon.169.a:0 "Ally with Russia once again."
mon.169.b:0 "We must go our own way."
mon.170.t:0 "The Constitution of [GetYear]"
mon.170.d:0 "After finally securing control of Mongolia, [MON.GetLeader] made a speech outside the State Great Khural, promising many things, including the redistribution of wealth, a new constitution, and democratic elections. In the following months since, the government has worked hard to set right the injustices caused by the previous government. The peasants now finally feel like they truly have power, and do not work as slaves.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the government has been working on the second promise. Over the period of multiple weeks, full of long meetings and heated arguments, the new constitution has been drafted. This constitution sets out the government form, with the Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu as the figurehead leader of the nation once he comes of age, with much power in the hands of the working class, through voting for the Prime Minister and his government. It also includes points about human and workers rights, and ensures universal suffrage.\n\nWith celebrations of the new constitution echoing through Urga, we must now focus on the last of [MON.GetLeader]'s promises: elections."
mon.170.a:0 "Elections?"
mon.171.t:0 "Ungern's Purge"
mon.171.d:0 "In the past few months, it has become clear to the Baron that his rule is constantly in danger. Therefore, he has declared it time to examine our current military staff, and decide whether they are loyal to Ungern, or whether it is time they saw a bullet."
mon.171.a:0 "We must root out the traitors!"
mon.172.t:0 "Status of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren"
mon.172.d:0 "Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren has fought on the side of Mongolia for decades, taking part in Mongolian independence back in 1911. Though he opened dialogue with the MAN rebels at the time, he was arrested by the Chinese, and almost died in his cell. He would have died had it not been for Ungern's Asiatic Cavalry Division taking Urga from Chinese control and freeing him. Many Mongolians see the old man as a unifying figure; a sign that Mongolians are still able to lead in this Russian-dominated government. However, perhaps his links to the MAN never went away. Though we have failed to find any evidence of this, perhaps he aided the MAN rebels against us, and almost led to our downfall. He constantly makes it clear that he doesn't serve us, rather serving Mongolia directly. Maybe it is time for the old General to meet his end."
mon.172.a:0 "He is trustworthy."
mon.172.b:0 "End him."
mon.173.t:0 "Status of Nikolay Kazagrandi"
mon.173.d:0 "Nikolay Kazagrandi has been working under Ungern-Sternberg after he left Siberia during the Russian Civil War. Ungern almost had him purged back then, but his high skill during the 1921 MAN Revolution made Ungern let him stay. After that, he travelled to the west of the nation, to put down rebellion and to train anti-Chinese forces in the province of Dzungaria. It is clear that in this mission he failed. At the start of the Western Revolt, he was in Dzungaria, rather than doing his job of putting down anti-government activity. Ungerns mistrust of him was obviously justified. However, will his skill save him from being purged this time?"
mon.173.a:0 "He is trustworthy."
mon.173.b:0 "End him."
mon.174.t:0 "Status of Togtokh Taij"
mon.174.d:0 "Togtokh Taij's situation is similar to that of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren. The old man formed an anti-Chinese guerrilla group in Inner Mongolia in 1907, for which he became a Mongolian hero. He was promoted to the rank of general by the Bogd Khan himself, after he came to Urga following the revolution against the Chinese. In expelling Chinese troops, he worked with bandit leader Ja Lama multiple times. This is where the worry about Togtokh Taij lies. It was Ja Lamas Yum-Beise bandits who sparked the start of the Western Revolt just months ago. Perhaps Togtokh Taij organised the bandits into rebelling, so that he could gain power for himself."
mon.174.a:0 "He is trustworthy."
mon.174.b:0 "End him."
mon.175.t:0 "Status of the Officers"
mon.175.d:0 "The officer class have proven their disloyalty over the past few months. With many officers deciding to align themselves with the opposing rebel groups, it is clear many of their loyalties do not sit with us. Perhaps it is time for the officer class to be cleansed of anyone who dared declare themselves for an opposing faction."
mon.175.a:0 "They are fine."
mon.175.b:0 "They must be cleansed."
mon.176.t:0 "Status of Altanochir"
mon.176.d:0 "Altanochir is a prince from Inner Mongolia, who only very recently travelled to Urga from Inner Mongolia, after recommendation from Prince Demchugdongrub. It should already be clear as to why he is on the chopping block. Demchugdongrub pushed to gain power during the chaos of the Western Revolt. It was his clique of princes and nobles who almost led to our downfall. Altanochir, still being quite a low level military leader, should be an obvious one to be purged."
mon.176.a:0 "He is trustworthy."
mon.176.b:0 "End him."
mon.177.t:0 "The Purge has Ended"
mon.177.d_small:0 "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Whether it can even be called a purge is up for debate, due to the relatively minor amount of actions that were taken against possible traitors. The military leaders of Mongolia who survived breathe a sigh of relief, though some may still scheme against us."
mon.177.d_medium:0 "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Many high up military figures were executed throughout the last few weeks, all in the name of safety and justice for traitors. Those remaining breathe a sigh of relief, as the military staff of the nation grows ever smaller."
mon.177.d_big:0 "With that, it has been decided that the purge has come to an end. Many high up military figures were executed throughout the last few weeks, all in the name of safety and justice for traitors. Those remaining breathe a sigh of relief, as the military staff of the nation grows ever smaller."
mon.177.a:0 "It was necessary."
mon.178.t:0 "37 People Die in Factory Explosion"
mon.178.d:0 "Following Ungern's new policy of Aggressive Industrialisation, construction of new factories, sponsored mostly by Russian businessmen, sprung up across the nation. With this new mass industrialisation along with the complete lack of labour rights, all of the workers constructing these factories are in clear danger. A common cause of death nowadays is death while constructing a new factory. The best example of this occurred today, when 37 people were killed in an explosion during the construction of a factory outside Mörön. The factory is to become a textile factory, owned personally by Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man. Due to the lack of any safety regulations whatsoever, a poorly build bit of construction machinery failed, causing a fire which led to the explosion. Rezukhin commented that it was the fault of the workers doing poor work, a statement Ungern agreed with."
mon.178.a:0 "They should be more careful next time."
mon.179.t:0 "Mongol Ardīn Nam Cell Destroyed near the Russian Border"
mon.179.d:0 "After receiving information from one of our informants placed in the MAN, we learned the location of a major MAN cell, just on the Russo-Mongolian border. So, under the command of Boris Rezukhin, a battalion was sent out from Urga up north to the location. After travelling and searching for a few days, they eventually found it. A large complex of gers of all sizes, surrounded by a quickly put up wooden fence. Patrols of men armed with rifles and wearing MAN symbols on their caps travelled around the complex every few minutes. It is clear that the camp is struggling to keep together, following the failure of their now third revolution. After surrounding the camp, Rezukhin moved his troops in, and took the complex. There was a small firefight, but nothing major; it seems most of their actual fighting soldiers died during the revolution. Rezukhin rounded up everyone else that was left, primarily older men or women, and either shot them there or took them in for questioning. After going through all the papers in the gers, the locations of multiple, smaller MAN cells were discovered, as well as some of their future plans which included a plan to assassinate Ungern-Sternberg. After getting all the decent information out of the area, Rezukhin burned the complex to the ground, and brought back his prisoners for questioning through out secret police."
mon.179.a:0 "Finally, peace can be secured."
mon.180.t:0 "Hundreds of Soldiers Imprisoned for Refusing to Pledge Allegiance to Ungern"
mon.180.d:0 "With new measures implemented recently, forcing every soldier to pledge their full allegiance to Ungern-Sternberg, hundreds have refused to do so. Many of them claim that they do not serve Ungern, but rather serve the nation of Mongolia. However, what they fail to see is that these are one in the same. For this betrayal, these soldiers have been imprisoned, so that they cannot spread dissent against us."
mon.180.a:0 "Traitors everywhere!"
mon.181.t:0 "Battle Between Princes Guard and Mongolian Revolution Army"
mon.181.d:0 "Many of the rich nobles and princes of Mongolia have their own guard with them at all times, almost like a private army. After hearing that they were going to have their lands seized to be distributed to the populus, a few princes decided to unite their guards to protect their lands. After refusing to cede their land to the government, the newly created Mongolian Revolutionary Army were sent in, under the leadership of Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. After approaching the princes lands once again, the princes guard stood firm, and refused to allow the MRA in. Dogsom said that they had the choice now to either surrender now or face death. Though a handful of guards put down their arms and were let go, the vast majority stood their ground and refused to move. With that, Dogsom gave the command to open fire. The princes guard put up a strong fight, but they were eventually beaten by the MRA. The few that remained surrendered and were arrested, as were the princes whose troops they were."
mon.181.a:0 "Those who refuse to follow the revolution must be forced."
mon.182.t:0 "Russia has Fallen"
mon.182.d:0 "It appears the worst has happened. Our great allies in the north, the Russian Bear, has fallen. Taken down from the inside by German spies and Bolshevik agents no doubt. Now, we are forced to go it alone. Someday, perhaps, we might free the people of Russia, and perhaps restore the rightful Romanov rulers to their throne. For now, however, we will struggle to survive."
mon.182.a:0 "We must go alone."

mon.55.t:0 "Assassination attempt on Ungern-Sternberg!"
mon.55.d:0 "While riding his horse in a parade through Urga, a sudden noise deafened the crowds. A shot that echoed through the city, that missed Baron Ungern by two inches. The assassin, a twenty three year old man, was shot almost immediately. Ungern ordered the marching army to fire on the crowd, frenzied by the attempt on his life. The crowd dispersed in a panic as civilians, or possible MAN agents, were killed by Ungerns troops. After the city had calmed down, the assassin has been identified as a member of the Mongol Ardīn Nam, however many peasants in Urga claim this to be fabricated by our government. Though the Baron survived, this attempt showed weakness, and the chaos Ungern caused by killing the possible MAN agents can’t be good for our popularity."
mon.55.a:0 "At least the Baron survived."
mon.56.t:0 "[MON.GetLeader] asks for weapons"
mon.56.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader] has asked our government for weapons, to help him defend Mongolia from its enemies. Mongolia is our foothold in China, and it might be best to keep it on our side."
mon.56.a:0 "Send them arms."
mon.56.b:0 "We are too busy."
mon.57.t:0 "Russia agreed to send arms"
mon.57.d:0 "Russia have sent us a shipment of guns, and have agreed to do this every year so long as we remain in power."
mon.57.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.58.t:0 "Russia refused to send arms"
mon.58.d:0 "Russia have decided to no longer send us any arms."
mon.58.a:0 "Damn."

mon.63.t:0 "Mongolia asks for guarantees"
mon.63.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader], currently leader of Mongolia, has requested that we guarantee their nation, to keep them safe from outside threats. This will cement them as our influence in the region."
mon.63.a:0 "Guarantee them."
mon.63.b:0 "We don't want to be pulled into Chinese affairs."
mon.64.t:0 "Russia has agreed!"
mon.64.d:0 "Russia has agreed to give us guarantees, to keep us safe from outside threats."
mon.64.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.65.t:0 "Russia has refused!"
mon.65.d:0 "Russia has refused to give us guarantees. We are left alone."
mon.65.a:0 "Damn."

League_of_Eight: "League of Eight Provinces Focus Tree"


### Leaders ###
POLITICS_LEP_SUN_CHUANFANG_DESC: "Like many of his peers who flaunt a variety of colourful monikers, Marshal Sun Chuanfang is known as 'The Smiling Tiger'. His greatest strength lies in careful cultivation of personal relationships, as he is a master of navigating local webs of influence and intrigue; leveraging everyone from old army friends, to wealthy bankers, to foreign dignitaries. It is this last category in particular that has proven to be his best asset, and his German connections have become indespensible.\nHowever, his nickname also carries sinister undertones. Beneath a mask of smiles he is known to be hard to read, and he has executed former friends and former enemies alike after assurances to the contrary. These qualities have left Sun sitting at the head of a vast bureaucratic pyramid, and one of the most powerful men in China."
POLITICS_LEP_QI_XIEYUAN_DESC: "Political Career:§L\nAt the academy Qi earned a reputation for short height, masterful calligraphy, and cunning. As a soldier only one of these served him well, but it nontheless catapulted him to prominence in Eastern China, his rise only cut short by a combination of invasion and allied betrayal in late 1924.\nFor the next several years Qi remained in exile, plotting his return, and in the aftermath of the Shanghai Conference he secured German sponsorship, giving him leave to set up shop in the city of Wuxi. Sun Chuanfang tolerated his presence, perhaps feeling that enemies were best kept close; a feeling he may have since come to regret."

POLITICS_LEP_SUN_CHUANFANG_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 17th, 1885\nTaian, Shandong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLike many of his peers who flaunt a variety of colourful monikers, Marshal Sun Chuanfang is known as 'The Smiling Tiger'. His greatest strength lies in careful cultivation of personal relationships, as he is a master of navigating local webs of influence and intrigue; leveraging everyone from old army friends, to wealthy bankers, to foreign dignitaries.

These qualities have left Sun sitting at the head of a vast bureaucratic pyramid, and one of the most powerful men in China."
POLITICS_LEP_QI_XIEYUAN_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1879\nNinghe, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAt the academy Qi earned a reputation for short height, masterful calligraphy, and cunning. As a soldier only one of these served him well, but it nontheless catapulted him to prominence in Eastern China, his rise only cut short by a combination of invasion and allied betrayal in late 1924.\nFor the next several years Qi remained in exile, plotting his return, and in the aftermath of the Shanghai Conference he secured German sponsorship, giving him leave to set up shop in the city of Wuxi. Sun Chuanfang tolerated his presence, perhaps feeling that enemies were best kept close; a feeling he may have since come to regret."
POLITICS_AOG_ALEXANDER_VON_FALKENHAUSEN_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 29th, 1878\nGut Blumenthal, Silesia, German Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nSince fighting as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900, Alexander von Falkenhausen has possessed a keenly cultivated interest in oriental affairs. With his thorough grasp of both the Japanese language and the Asian political situation, his former service as a Military Attaché in Tokyo made him a prime candidate to lead the military intervention against the Northern Expedition in 1926. A year later he went on to assist Wu Peifu against the Fengtian Clique in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War, after which he became the primary military consultant for Sun Chuanfang's administration in Nanjing. Currently, not only has he been helping Sun's Army to eliminate NRA remnants in Fujian, but he has also worked to ready China for a future war with Japan, making use of his ample experience and keen strategic mind."
POLITICS_LEP_CHEN_YI_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 3rd, 1883\nShaoxing, Zhejiang, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLike many among his generation of officers, Chen Yi graduated from the Rikugun Shikan Gakko military academy in Japan. More unusually he has also served as the chairman of a bank. Chen joined Sun Chuanfang's Southern Zhili faction in 1924, and rose to prominence through his brutal suppression of Chinese Syndicalists in the Shanghai Uprising of 1932. As a reward for his unquestioning service he was appointed governor of Zhejiang Province, replacing Lu Xiangting.\nUnder his regime, Zhejiang might be considered the geographic and economic inverse of Jiangsu, with a small but wealthy north and desperately poor southern regions. Though Chen himself is not particularly susceptible to bribes, he routinely ignores his subordinate’s abuses in order to quench dissent, and only a few regiments of soldiers could be considered truly loyal to his person despite his reputation as a harsh disciplinarian."
POLITICS_LEP_ZHENG_JUNYAN_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YMilitary Career:§L\n As governor of Jiangsu, Zheng Junyuan has built his stronghold in the city of Xuzhou, located at one of China's most crucial railway junctures, and far from Sun Chuanfang’s seat of power in Nanjing. As a result of his positioning, he has managed to secure a fair amount of autonomy by playing Sun, Wu Peifu, and the Germans off of each other for safe and reliable access to the railroad. He also maintains a rivalry with Zhang Zongchang over control of the north-south line and is known to have sent a number of notices to Nanjing concerning a troubling spread of the Yiguandao faith. Under Zheng's rule Jiangsu is known as a province of contrasts, its poorest regions bordered by Shandong to the north, and some of China's wealthiest districts in its south along the banks of the Yangtze."
POLITICS_LEP_DENG_RUZUO_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1888\nFuyang, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nUnder Deng's regime, Jiangxi shares a number of traits with Anhui to its north, chief among them a predominantly poor and rural population. Much of the province has never truly recovered from the widespread destruction of the Taiping rebellion, and even after seventy years the ruins of abandoned cities can sometimes be glimpsed amid the mountains. Unlike Anhui Jiangxi has not quite escaped German attention. With virtually nonexistent infrastructure and few direct paths to the coast, the city of Nanchang and its surrounds are the planned terminus of the new Zhegan Railway, linking the city to Shanghai, opening up significant new markets and resources in the Chinese interior. Of particular interest to the Germans is the city of Jingdezhen, the porcelain from which has been able to fetch high prices in Berlin, along with other less-legitimate pursuits such as the stolen antiquities trade. So far, the new railway has been built primarily with German financing, though there are rumors that the Germans mean to purchase the railway in its entirety; rumors likely lending strength to the KMT’s supporters hiding in in the province’s south."
POLITICS_LEP_ZHOU_YINREN_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1887\nWuqiang, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA long-standing subordinate to and former classmate of Sun Chuanfang, Zhou Yinren and the League-Marshal share a personal bond. Perhaps this is why Zhou was trusted with governorship of Fujian, the most mountainous and impoverished of the Eight Provinces. A narrow band of coastline constitutes the majority of the area under direct rule, and every port of Fujian shows a heavy German presence. Though generous aid from Nanjing has helped Zhou establish a greater degree of control over the province than he and his predecessors had last decade, much of it remains in a state of near-anarchy, and parts have fallen to an agrarian-socialist remnant of the KMT. These rebels, occasionally raiding the coastal settlements, have so far resisted two punitive expeditions aiming to dislodge them."
POLITICS_LEP_SHANGGUAN_YUNXIANG_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1895\nJinan, Shandong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAlthough born into a moderately wealthy family, Shangguan Yunxiang spent his youth amid austerity as funds were split between his numerous siblings. After graduating from Baoding in 1919 he was sent to join Sun Chuanfang's Hubei Army, and by 1923 followed Sun into Fujian. Shangguan soon established a reputation for himself as a highly capable general.\nHis greatest achievement was the defeat of the NRA's 4th Army, which previously defeated Wu Peifu's army at Tingsi Bridge. Even today Sun Chuanfang considers this proof of his coalition's inherent superiority to Wu Peifu’s directly controlled divisions."
POLITICS_LEP_ZHOU_FENGQI_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1879\nChangxing, Zhejiang, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nZhou Fengqi began his career as a late-Qing confucian scholar, but turned against the ruling dynasty when he joined the anti-Qing Guangfuhui through Qiu Jin's introduction. He has consistently opposed central government overreach and supported the "Zhejiang Ruled by Zhejiang People" and "Independence of Ningbo" campaigns. After helping Sun Chuanfang take over Zhejiang, he secured a promotion to garrison commander of Nanjing.\nHe can be considered a loyalist of Sun Chuanfang's Nanjing faction, and joined the suppression of Syndicalists during the 1932 Shanghai Uprising."
POLITICS_LEP_TANG_ENBO_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 20th, 1900\nJinhua, Zhejiang, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nTang Enbo was sent to the Imperial Japanese Army Academy by Chen Yi in order to become a staff officer, and the two can be considered sponsor and protégé. At the Academy Tang focused intensely on infantry doctrine, and his resultant competence has earned him Sun Chuanfang's respect.\nNotably Tang prefers to direct his forces with the use of modern communications equipment instead of from the front."
POLITICS_LEP_SHI_YOUSAN_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1891\nJiutai, Jilin, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nShi Yousan started his military career in 1908 under Wu Peifu’s command, but in the tumult following the Xinhai Revolution he was left wandering Beijing. In 1912 he joined Feng Yuxiang’s army and became a trusted subordinate. Not long after he deserted, persuaded to do so by Yan Xishan. He went on to serve in the National Revolutionary Army, but deserted there too amid the failure of the Northern Expedition. Subsequently he participated in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War, this time as a member of Feng Yuxiang's Guominjun, but again Feng's trust was misplaced. As soon as the Zhili Clique's victory became apparent he deserted as usual, and returned to Wu Peifu’s forces again. However by this point his trend of disloyalty had become hard to ignore. Wu Peifu directed him to serve under Sun Chuanfang instead. Within the LEP, Shi Yousan has come to appreciate the personal benefits of working with German sponsorship, but who knows when he might desert again..."
POLITICS_LEP_LI_SHENGCHUN_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLi Shengchun is the Deputy Commander of Fujian Province, serving under the command of Zhou Yinren, the military governor of Fujian. Under Zhou, he fought the NRA's 17th Army led by He Yinqing during the Northern Expedition.\nHowever, Li's relationship with his superior is poor. He has frequently disobeyed orders, and repeated failures to purge Kuomintang forces from the JiangFu Insurgent Zone have called his competence into question."
POLITICS_LEP_YANG_SHUZHUANG_DESC: "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nFuzhou, Fujian, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\n"

POLITICS_AOG_BOARD_DESC: "The Board of Directors is a council of the largest businesses in the AOG. They meet monthly to discuss the policy of the nation and decide on the future of the Concessions. While legally the board of directors is representative of all companies within the AOG, Krupp has the lines-share of influence, and many believe that the Board of Directors to be a complete front for Alfred Felix Alwyn von Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach’s and his company. And despite its vast influence, the Board of Directors is shrouded in deep secrecy, something representative of its elitist nature; but despite it’s secrecy, the power held by the Board of Directors is immeasurable. Even if the Board acting as head of state is a cover for Krupp’s ambitions."

POLITICS_WILHELM_II_CHINA_DESC: "Though still sitting on his throne thousands of miles away in Berlin, Kaiser Wilhelm has also ascended to the role of Emperor of China. With the Mandate of Heaven thinly backing up his claim to rule and the might of both the AOG and the Chinese Expeditionary Force behind him, Kaiser Weilian’s rule has been solidified and his position on the Dragon Throne cemented. From abroad and deep within the Forbidden Palace, this Kaiser of the Chinesisches Kaiserreich has become the symbol of German dominance in Asia for all the world to bear witness to."

### Ideas ###

LEP_Conspicuous_Kleptocracy: "Conspicuous Kleptocracy"
LEP_Conspicuous_Kleptocracy_desc: "Late last decade, Sun Chuanfang opened vast swaths of Eastern and Southern China to exclusive German economic exploitation. Soldiers and officials at almost every level, many already predisposed to corruption, have become complicit in everything from arms smuggling to the stolen antiquities trade. This reflects poorly on the League as a whole."

LEP_Provincial_Armies: "Provincial Armies"
LEP_Provincial_Armies_desc: "The League is large, but its sizable army is in fact a collection of semi-autonomous provincial forces united by their leaders’ personal loyalties to Marshal Sun. This eases recruitment, but presents serious logistical and organizational handicaps."

LEP_Nanking_Kommission: "The Nanking-Kommission"
LEP_Nanking_Kommission_desc: "The Nanking-Kommission, advising the League’s leadership on behalf of Berlin, includes an officer-corps intended to reorganize Chinese divisions along German lines. So far they have seen some success in equipping and training the Marshal’s personal divisions, as well as imparting the Weltkrieg’s lessons to their officers."
LEP_Nanking_Kommission1: "The Nanking-Kommission"

LEP_Yangtze_Special_Taxes: "Yangtze Special Taxes"
LEP_Yangtze_Special_Taxes_desc: "The meandering Yangtze River runs through the country’s heart, bringing coastal commerce inland, and inland produce to the world market. Paired with China’s largest industrial base toward the river’s mouth, the Yangtze is a veritable river of gold, and the cities along its banks are common targets for extensive taxation."

LEP_Low_Level_Unrest: "Sporadic Unrest"
LEP_Low_Level_Unrest_desc: "The recently announced consolidation of the Central China Railway has triggered a series of street protests and other popular demonstrations across the League. Though there is talk of boycotts, unrest is nothing new, and is expected to fizzle out within a few weeks."

LEP_Spreading_Unrest: "Spreading Unrest"
LEP_Spreading_Unrest_Desc: "Instead of dying down, unrest has continued to spread, taking root in almost every major city across the League. So far, this still remains nothing unprecedented, and the government response will almost certainly be as it always has been; violent and resolute."

LEP_Anti-Concessions_Movement: "The Anti-Concessions Movement"
LEP_Anti-Concessions_Movement_desc: "The events surrounding the creation of the Central China Railway have led to a violent outburst of patriotic agitation, directed against governmental figures and foreigners alike, the sort of which hasn’t been seen since the May Fourth Movement over a decade ago. This naturally plays into the hands of the Nanjing Clique’s enemies."

LEP_Rampant_Disorder: "Rampant Disorder"
LEP_Rampant_Disorder_desc: "The rise of the Anti-Concessions Movement and the death of Sun Chuanfang has led to a new period of “Hunzhan” - confused or chaotic fighting, as general turns against general, soldier against soldier. The markets have collapsed, the police are overwhelmed, and chaos spreads in the streets, as seemingly the whole of society turns against itself. A great deal of blood may be spilled before any semblance of peace returns to Eastern China."
#LEP_Continued_Disorder: "Continued Disorder"
#LEP_Continued_Disorder_desc: "Marshal Qi Xieyuan has united the Five Provinces, proving that he does in fact rightfully rule over Eastern China. While this means that the situation of the Five Provinces will not worsen, it still has not fully recovered. Qi will have to continue to consolidate if he wishes for complete order to return."
#LEP_Continued_Disorder1: "Continued Disorder"
#LEP_Continued_Disorder1_desc: "Marshal Qi Xieyuan has united the Five Provinces, proving that he does in fact rightfully rule over Eastern China. While this means that the situation of the Five Provinces will not worsen, it still has not fully recovered. Qi will have to continue to consolidate if he wishes for complete order to return."
#LEP_Continued_Disorder2: "Continued Disorder"
#LEP_Continued_Disorder2_desc: "Marshal Qi Xieyuan has united the Five Provinces, proving that he does in fact rightfully rule over Eastern China. While this means that the situation of the Five Provinces will not worsen, it still has not fully recovered. Qi will have to continue to consolidate if he wishes for complete order to return."
#LEP_Continued_Disorder3: "Continued Disorder"
#LEP_Continued_Disorder3_desc: "Marshal Qi Xieyuan has united the Five Provinces, proving that he does in fact rightfully rule over Eastern China. While this means that the situation of the Five Provinces will not worsen, it still has not fully recovered. Qi will have to continue to consolidate if he wishes for complete order to return."

LEP_Crippled_Industry2: "Disrupted Industry"
LEP_Crippled_Industry2_desc: "Recent events have heavily disrupted ordinary industrial operations. Many of our leading businesses fear for the worst."
LEP_Crippled_Industry: "Crippled Industry"
LEP_Crippled_Industry_desc: "With the general breakdown of order, our economic and military industry has ground to a halt. Our production capabilities are severely diminished as entire supply lines have broken down."

LEP_Questionable_Authority: "Questionable Authority"
LEP_Questionable_Authority_desc: "Qi Xieyuan claims he is Sun's rightful successor and has all rights to the title of League-Marshal, but not everyone agrees. Many governors and local governments are skeptical of his authority. His rule also barely extends outside the range of his military garrisons, making his authority over the League outright questionable."
LEP_Damaged_Industry: "Damaged Industry"
LEP_Damaged_Industry_desc: "Our military factories and civilian economy have been damaged significantly by the fighting. Supply chains are still in disarray and much of the machinery is broken. Until all this is restored, we will not have optimal industrial output."

LEP_Widespread_Destruction: "Widespread Destruction"
LEP_Widespread_Destruction_desc: "The war has had a permanent impact on the Five Provinces, which are now scattered with ruined buildings, dead bodies and broken infrastructure. Repairs and reconstruction will be the primary focus of most local governments, leaving us with much less industry for our own purposes."

LEP_yiguandao: "Yiguandao Unrest"
LEP_yiguandao_desc: "The general unrest in the north, combined with the civil war, has caused unrest under Yiguandao religious adherents to skyrocket. They are congregating en masse and are causing great chaos in our northern provinces. If we do not work to suppress them quickly, the disorder will only get worse."
LEP_kuomintang: "KMT Unrest"
LEP_kuomintang_desc: "While the Left KMT government has been finally broken as they poured all their remaining resources into the insurgence, many of the deserters and bandits who were once among their ranks continue to stir up trouble. Left KMT supporters will continue to cause trouble in the south if we do not mop up their final remaining hideouts."

LEP_Chaotic_Order: "Chaotic Order"
LEP_Chaotic_Order_desc: "While Qi is now unquestionably the League-Marshal, the lands he rules are still ripe with chaos and instability. A lot of work will be required to bind the Provinces back together into a cohesive League. Many local leaders still flagrantly disobey orders from Qi's Nanjing government and the roads remain unsafe and plagued by bandits."

LEP_Coercive_Rule: "Coercive Rule"
LEP_Coercive_Rule_desc: "The collapse of the League taught Qi Xieyuan one thing: Tolerate no opposition. League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan will not shy away from brazen abuse of power in order to achieve his goals. From now on, the League rules its citizens through coercion"

LEP_Honest_Rule: "Moralistic Government"
LEP_Honest_Rule_desc: "While the League presents itself as a moral and just government that safeguards the people of East China, in reality such goals have not been among the government's priorities for many years. The in the interest of the survival of himself and his power, Qi has decided and that it shall be to the benefit of himself to clean out those enabling such corruption and dishonesty from the nation. Intending both to consolidate his power against these powerbrokers and endear himself to the people."

LEP_nationalist_morale: "Nationalist Face"
LEP_Honest_Rule_desc_desc: "While certainly still a hated nemesis in the eyes of the anti-concessionists of China, the League has managed to endear itself to more moderate and pragmatic nationalists who find themselves willing to forgive our German Collaboration to the end of achieving our vision of a strong and moral China."

LEP_Dishonest_Government: "Dishonest Government"
LEP_Dishonest_Government_desc: "While the League presents itself as a moral and just government that safeguards the people of East China, in reality such goals are not among the government's priorities. The only thing that matters for Qi is the survival of himself and his power, and he is more than willing to achieve that through dishonest means."

LEP_Coercive_Government: "Coercive Government"
LEP_Coercive_Government_desc: "Through many years of hard work, Qi Xieyuan has re-engineered the League under his rule. He tolerates no dissent to his directives, does not shy away from dishonesty and is not afraid to abuse his power to achieve his goals. Under Qi, the League has become an oppressive place."

LEP_Local_Development: "Local Development"
LEP_Local_Development_desc: "Qi's government is unpopular in the cities, which has led him to look toward the interior and the small, local communities in which the vast majority of Chinese live. By helping them, and the local landowners, he hopes to win the support of rural China if the cities ever revolt."

LEP_Kommission_Sponsorship: "Kommission Sponsorship"
LEP_Kommission_Sponsorship_desc: "The League occupies a special position among Germany's Chinese partners. It allows significantly more freedom to German businesses, in exchange for special attention in its industrialization. This special attention comes in the form of the Nanking-Kommission soliciting investments, research aid and more for the League."

lep_idea_extensiveconcessions: "The special interest the League receives from Germany comes at a price, namely in the form of extensive concessions.

LEP_qi_rules_nanjing: "Qi Rules Nanjing"
LEP_qi_rules_nanjing_desc: "Qi Xieyuan, a well respected general and controller of many of the troops around Nanjing, has seized control of the city. This makes him Sun's nominal successor. Qi now rules the Nanjing Clique. However, chaos reigns in what was previously the LEP and it is not certain that all the former LEP governors recognize Qi."
LEP_north_south_west: "North, South or West"
LEP_north_south_west_desc: "The Nanjing Clique has enemies in the north, the south and the west. Our territory is divided, with the Anqing Clique close to our heart. We must choose which enemies we will focus on first. We also need to reestablish contact with the former governors of the LEP provinces, in order to ensure their loyalties."
LEP_jiangnan_loans: "Jiangnan Loans"
LEP_jiangnan_loans_desc: "The AOG has been hit hard by Black Monday and has been unable to pay the rent on many of their concessions to us. This is unacceptable, but right now there is nothing we can do as we depend on their support. The Jiangnan Consortium has been somewhat isolated from the crisis and have offered us loans, which we should take in order to finance our armies and government."
LEP_aog_gun_shipments: "AOG Gun Shipments"
LEP_aog_gun_shipments_desc: "While the AOG does not yet have its finances under control, it has begun to stabilize somewhat. They have large amounts of guns available and we must make sure that these are sent to us, as we are dealing with serious gun shortages. Furthermore, our own production capacities are limited, making their support even more valuable."
LEP_consolidate_the_heartland: "Consolidate the Heartland"
LEP_consolidate_the_heartland_desc: "Now that we have begun to stabilize our situation, it is paramount we make a large effort to consolidate our heartland around Nanjing and the surrounding provinces. This will make sure we have a strong core area from which we can strike. However, if we make this effort before dealing with some other problems, it might not be as effective. We must find the right time in order to focus on consolidation."
LEP_qis_central_command: "Qi's Central Command"
LEP_qis_central_command_desc: "The disorganized, decentralized nature of the current governor armies on which we rely is not sufficient for the current conflict. We need to make an effort to establish a unified central command. The governors will retain their authority, but important decisions will now be made in coordination instead of separation."
LEP_enforce_officer_loyalty: "Enforce Officer Loyalty"
LEP_enforce_officer_loyalty_desc: "Our officers are all of dubious loyalty. We have a core force that has followed Qi for years, but now that we control much of Sun's former forces as well as the forces of the governor's forces, we cannot be so sure. The KMT and Shanqing also continue to secretly recruit, so we must make sure our officers are loyal to the cause of the Nanjing Clique, and no other."
LEP_emergency_industry_reallocation: "Emergency Industry Reallocation"
LEP_emergency_industry_reallocation_desc: "Much of our limited industry is in disarray. We need to coordinate the industry we have available to focus on military production. As we do not have the resources for this ourselves, we must rely on the Jiangnan Consortium and AOG to help us with this effort. We will leave some assets under their management to ensure that our own incompetent officers will not cause problems."
LEP_price_controls: "Price Controls"
LEP_price_controls_desc: "With the collapse of the LEP, our money notes have become nearly worthless and inflation is rising at a breakneck pace. While price controls are not an ideal solution, we must make sure there is at least a temporary stop to the devaluations in order to properly pay our soldiers. It will hopefully also calm the countryside and put a halt to rising food prices, at least for the time being."
LEP_suppress_student_unions: "Suppress Student Associations"
LEP_suppress_student_unions_desc: "The so-called 'patriotic' student associations have been a thorn in our side for a while now. They were the key force behind the anti-concessionist protests and continue to make trouble in the cities. If we shut down their means of organisation, we will hopefully suppress the movement as a whole."
LEP_enforce_media_controls: "Enforce Media Controls"
LEP_enforce_media_controls_desc: "The media are complicit in the collapse of the League and they continue to publish negative reports about our administration and continue to slander Qi's name. We must seize control of much of the media in order to put an end to the spread of dangerous information that could compromise our goals."
LEP_government_by_coercion: "Government by Coercion"
LEP_government_by_coercion_desc: "We now rule the League and we must, at all costs, prevent its renewed collapse. We will not make the same mistakes Sun Chuanfang made. Instead, we will build a strong government, based not on weakness, but on strength. We will not shy away from harsh methods in order guarantee its survival."
LEP_finish_sun_investigation: "Finish the Sun Investigation"
LEP_finish_sun_investigation_desc: "We have waited long enough with presenting the results of our investigation into the assassination of the former leader of the League, Sun Chuanfang. It is time to finish up the work and release the results to the public. Hopefully we can spin these results in such a way to strengthen our position."
LEP_undermine_sun_loyalists: "Purge the Complicit"
LEP_undermine_sun_loyalists_desc: "Currently there are still many people in our government of which we cannot be sure that they will support us. Using our release of the results of the Sun assassination investigation, as well as by painting our enemies as complicit in the collapse, we should be able to make many arrests and purge our ranks of their presence."
LEP_university_oversight_board: "University Oversight Board"
LEP_university_oversight_board_desc: "We have seen how dangerous students can become if they organize. They were key players in the Anti-Concessionist Movement and will continue to be dangerous if we do not properly keep an eye on them. Therefore we must establish the University Oversight Board, which will make sure that any 'dangerous' individuals within universities are neutralized."
lep_governor_1: "Now that we again control Zhejiang and Anhui, the governors of which both traitorously rose up against us, we must decide who to replace them with. We must make sure that they are our close allies and will not repeat the mistakes of their predecessors. Furthermore, we should also finish formalizing relations with the other governors, not all of whom agree with Qi's ascension."
lep_governor_2: "After the traitorous uprising of the Governor of Anhui, Chen Tiaoyuan, we now once again control his province. We must decide who replaces Chen as Governor of Anhui and make sure that our replacement does not repeat Chen's mistake. Furthermore, we should also finish formalizing relations with the other governors, not all of whom agree with Qi's ascension."
LEP_governor_question: "The Governor Question"
LEP_governor_question_desc: "[getlepgovernor]"
LEP_track_down_kmt: "Eradicate KMT Cells"
LEP_track_down_kmt_desc: "While we might have driven KMT military units out of Fujian, partisans continue to operate within our territory. We also fear that some KMT members may have infiltrated our ranks. We must track down the remaining Kuomintang bases and eliminate the various active KMT cells."
LEP_crack_down_yiguandao_sects: "Crack Down on Yiguandao Sects"
LEP_crack_down_yiguandao_sects_desc: "Yiguandao adherents continue to terrorize our citizens. While we might have warded off Shanqing, many followers still stir up trouble. We must begin a large crackdown on various Yiguandao sects in order to cripple their movement."
LEP_reconstitute_baojia_system: "Reconstitute Baojia System"
LEP_reconstitute_baojia_system_desc: "The baojia system envisioned local control of local militias. It aimed to increase stability and assign local responsibility. While the system failed in the past, it can now be very useful as it allows us to effectively patrol the countryside and allows us to circumvent the governors."
LEP_xiangyong_inspections: "Xiangyong Inspections"
LEP_xiangyong_inspections_desc: "If we want the baojia system to become a success, we must ensure that the xiangyong, the local baojia units, behave nicely. Inspections will also allow us another method of control over these local militias without having to worry about the governors."
LEP_water_infrastructure_commission: "Water Infrastructure Commission"
LEP_water_infrastructure_commission_desc: "The war has damaged an enormous amount of critical infrastructure designed to protect our cities from the rivers. Dams, dikes, levees have all been damaged. We need to set up a special commission with adequate funding to repair these immediately. If we wait, floods can potentially endanger millions of Chinese."
LEP_peace_in_countryside: "Peace in the Countryside"
LEP_peace_in_countryside_desc: "Now that we have dealt with the most seditious elements that started the war, we can begin the last efforts to fully restore peace to the countryside. For months now, people were afraid to go out and travel, as roads were infested with bandits and rebels. But with our measures and reforms, we have increased security and peace has returned to the countryside."
LEP_selective_enforcement: "Selective Enforcement"
LEP_selective_enforcement_desc: "It is not through the law that will achieve legitimacy as a government. We can only achieve this through achieving a stable government that is not questioned. Therefore, we can afford to selectively apply the law as we see fit. By allowing certain companies and individuals extralegal rights, we can be sure of their support, as we will crack down hard on their enemies."
LEP_reform_public_security: "Reform Public Security"
LEP_reform_public_security_desc: "One of the problems Sun Chuanfang faced, was that he had no dependable network of agents that maintained security in his name. With Qi's Nanjing Guards, this will now change. With these reforms, Qi will have agents everywhere, which will allow him to react quicker and keep the peace."
LEP_redoubts_for_revenue: "Redoubts for Revenue"
LEP_redoubts_for_revenue_desc: "With the recent war still fresh in the minds of our governors, combined with the general instability beyond the borders, means that our governors will be very much occupied with security. We will offer them help in constructing fortifications and other defenses, in exchange for them allowing Nanjing to raise additional taxes from their territory."
LEP_tackle_local_corruption: "Tackle Local Corruption"
LEP_tackle_local_corruption_desc: "Local corruption is a serious issue. It harms our ability to extract taxes from the local level of government, it takes an unnecessary toll on the local farmers and it fills the pockets of those who do not need it. For this reason, we should begin dealing with this issue. The inspectors we will use for this will also allow us greater control over local governments."
LEP_green_gang_dealings: "Green Gang Dealings"
LEP_green_gang_dealings_desc: "We must solicit the help of the Green Gang in Shanghai. These crime lords, major players in the drug trade, will allow us to exert influence on potential investors in the Legation Cities. Using the Green Gang, we will surely be able to expand our influence within the Legations."
LEP_public_media_campaigns: "Public Media Campaigns"
LEP_public_media_campaigns_desc: "Our government is viewed negatively by many. We are seen as the ones who sold out to the Germans and cracked down on the patriots who aimed to kick them out. We must ensure that this image disappears by using our control of the press to spread positive messages about our government, while spreading negative messages about our critics."
LEP_appoint_civilian_magistrates: "Appoint Civilian Magistrates"
LEP_appoint_civilian_magistrates_desc: "Many of the provinces and local governments are headed by military men, who depend on their armies for their political power. It is difficult to force them to do anything without fighting. Therefore, we should begin appointing civilian magistrates to positions in local governments and slowly allow them more power, as we can control them more effectively than military men."
LEP_public_repression: "Public Repression"
LEP_public_repression_desc: "We do not deceive ourselves by saying we are a friendly and free government. No, we admit that there is only one way to offer the people law and order, and that is through harsh repression of those who speak or act against us. Only if those seditious elements are eliminated, can the people be confident of their safety."
LEP_shut_down_intellectual_circles: "Shut Down Intellectual Circles"
LEP_shut_down_intellectual_circles_desc: "Various groups and circles of highly-respected intellectuals, many of whom supported the Anti-Concessions Movement that lead to the downfall of Sun Chuanfang, continue to speak out against us. We can no longer tolerate this insubordination and must act immediately by prohibiting the meetings of these intellectuals and making sure they remain isolated."
LEP_crush_urban_unions: "Crush Urban Unions"
LEP_crush_urban_unions_desc: "Just like the student associations, unions of urban workers have always caused problems. Their strikes undermine our industries and we can never be sure that they do not cooperate with the Left KMT. We must use our authority in the cities to crush these unions and make sure workers do not organize."
LEP_pacification_commissioner_qi: "Pacification Commmissioner Qi"
LEP_pacification_commissioner_qi_desc: "It is customary to give yourself many different positions and titles to create authority in new areas. Qi Xieyuan is therefore no longer just the League-Marshal, but also Pacification Commissioner. This new position gives him the authority to shut down any seditious act in any area of the League with his own forces, which will allow us to respond much faster in emergencies."
LEP_pressure_jiangzhe_caifa: "Pressure the Jiangzhe Caifa"
LEP_pressure_jiangzhe_caifa_desc: "The Jiangzhe caifa, meaning the Jiangsu and Zhejiang zaibatsu, is a group of powerful bankers who control the major banks in the Legations. Using our newly acquired connections, we should attempt to pressure the Jiangzhe caifa to provide us with loans and resources, like they have done to others in the past."
LEP_solicit_legations_investments: "Solicit Legations Investments"
LEP_solicit_legations_investments_desc: "The Legation Cities are a great source of wealth. Often now, foreign investors choose to invest in these cities and many rich Chinese move their businesses there. We must present ourselves as an attractive target for investment, something which, considering our new influence in the Legations and our open economy, should not be difficult."
LEP_buyout_chinese_assets: "Buy Out Chinese Assets"
LEP_buyout_chinese_assets_desc: "The Native Chinese have presented a challenge to our monopoly on power for too long. We must buy out all of the native assets that present an even slight threat to us. This included small businesses, as well as the factories run by the locals. We must take all of them and keep the German Monopolies on top over anything else. "
LEP_expand_jiangnan_arsenal: "Expand the Jiangnan Arsenal"
LEP_expand_jiangnan_arsenal_desc: "The Jiangnan Arsenal is the linchpin of our military industry. As we further develop our general industry, a special effort to expand the Arsenal would be prudent, as it would allow us to further ramp up our domestic production of military hardware."
LEP_lower_yangtze_development: "Lower Yangtze Development"
LEP_lower_yangtze_development_desc: "The heart of the Five Provinces, and thus Qi's power base, lies in the Lower Yangtze region. Developing this area will lead to the greatest gains for Qi, as he effectively taxes and controls the area directly. Furthermore, it is located in a perfect position, which will surely attract much investment."
LEP_eastern_railway_construction: "Eastern Railway Construction"
LEP_eastern_railway_construction_desc: "Railways are the lifeblood of China. Without them, industrial transportation comes to a standstill. We must invest heavily in the construction of additional railways and in the renovation of existing ones. The Germans will most definitely want in on this, so we need to decide exactly how we will carry out these plans."
LEP_heavy_industrial_investments: "Heavy Industrial Investments"
LEP_heavy_industrial_investments_desc: "Currently, China's industry is mostly for its own consumption. Much of it is also only light industry, as we lack the capability and expertise to produce heavier industrial equipment. If we wish to advance our economy, this must change. With the help of German expertise and new government investments, we will make sure that heavy industry will also be developed in China."
LEP_new_economic_development: "New Economic Development"
LEP_new_economic_development_desc: "As the League stabilizes and industrial development reaches new heights, we must make optimal use of this. With our opening to the rest of the world, we are in a unique position to develop at a faster pace than any other part of China. We must do all we can to invest in industrial development and the development of this new economy."
LEP_subsidize_local_communities: "Subsidize Local Communities"
LEP_subsidize_local_communities_desc: "We have lost support of much of the urban population. Eventually, if our economy develops enough, they will come around. But until that moment, we need the support of another portion of the population, the peasants. For this reason, we must introduce new subsidies for local communities, which will be specifically aimed at rural development. This should help secure their support."
LEP_revitalize_the_tea_trade: "Revitalize the Tea Trade"
LEP_revitalize_the_tea_trade_desc: "The tea trade used to be much more common in southern and eastern China. Furthermore, many of the Chinese peasants lack any kind of monetary income. If we revitalize the growing and selling of tea, we can provide them a new source of income. This will integrate them into the new, modern economy and should spur further growth and development."
LEP_patronize_xiangshen: "Patronize the Xiangshen"
LEP_patronize_xiangshen_desc: "The xiangshen, the local landowners, are incredibly valuable allies. If we can secure their support, we can also secure the support of the peasants. We should use our newly acquired control over local governments in their favor, which will show them that we are their strongest ally, not the provincial government. This will also provide us with additional leverage over our governors."
LEP_modern_agriculture: "Modern Agriculture"
LEP_modern_agriculture_desc: "While China was once renowned for its efficient farming methods, which in part helped develop our enormous population, we have long since lost that edge. We need to introduce modern methods from the West into our agriculture if we wish to ever escape the dire times of the past century. We can no longer afford to remain behind."
LEP_cult_of_personality: "Cult of Personality"
LEP_cult_of_personality_desc: "If Qi Xieyuan, our League-Marshal, wishes to truly entrench his power and influence, he must develop somewhat of a mythical persona. If he achieves an almost cultist following, no man will dare speak up against him. Therefore, we should publish various stories about his life, including his miraculous birth and his personal achievements during the war, such as the destruction of an enemy airplane with only his rifle."
LEP_network_of_allegiances: "Network of Allegiances"
LEP_network_of_allegiances_desc: "No man rules alone. For that reason, Qi must maintain a network of allies throughout the League. This network has to be carefully managed, lest it fall apart, which would be disastrous for Qi and the League."
LEP_dubious_practices: "Dubious Practices"
LEP_dubious_practices_desc: "If Qi wishes to remain in power, he must use any method as his disposal. While Sun Chuanfang often claimed a moral high ground, in reality most of his actions were guided by securing his leadership. Qi should do the same. In fact, with his tighter control, especially in Nanjing, and with support from the Germans, Qi can possibly afford even more."
LEP_tsingtau_collaboration: "Tsingtau Collaboration"
LEP_tsingtau_collaboration_desc: "Our greatest advantage over the other warlords, is that we have the full support of the Germans. Collaboration with the Germans allows us more rapid industrialization, more advanced technology and more effective armies. We must safeguard this relationship at all costs."
LEP_german_reconstruction_crews: "German Reconstruction Crews"
LEP_german_reconstruction_crews_desc: "The League is damaged. The war saw destruction on an unprecedented scales, with thousands upon thousands of dead. Railways were destroyed, cities burned to the ground and factories torched. While the League possesses the manpower to begin reconstruction efforts, it lacks expertise and money. For this reason, specialized German crews should be invited to oversee reconstruction work in many places."
LEP_krupp_industrial_methods: "Krupp Industrial Methods"
LEP_krupp_industrial_methods_desc: "If China wishes to modernize, it needs to adopt the methods of those were successful. Krupp is one of the more powerful German conglomerates, active in both the Legations and the AOG. We should invite them to educate our engineers and entrepreneurs of how to develop new industry. We must make sure that China adopts German industrial methods, if we wish to have any chance at all in this world."
LEP_german_research_aid: "German Research Aid"
LEP_german_research_aid_desc: "German technology far exceeds our own. We could significantly ramp up our research capabilities if we would have access to cutting-edge German research. We must establish cooperation between universities and research groups in China and Germany."
LEP_nanjing_university_expansion: "Nanjing University Expansion"
LEP_nanjing_university_expansion_desc: "Nanjing University is small and underfunded and mostly provides antiquated forms of education. This must change if we want to advance our technological capabilities and innovation. We must expand Nanjing University and ensure a new generation of students will be educated with modern methods."
LEP_westernized_school_curriculum: "Westernized School Curriculum"
LEP_westernized_school_curriculum_desc: "Chinese education is backward and outdated. Not only our universities are antiquated, our school system in the smaller cities and towns is as well. Children are educated using useless facts and are in no way prepared for the real world. We must develop a standardized education curriculum based on what is taught in the West, which will hopefully help us advance our studies of modern technologies."
LEP_deutsch_asiatische_loans: "Deutsch-Asiatische Loans"
LEP_deutsch_asiatische_loans_desc: "Deutsch-Asiatische Bank has greatly expanded in the past years and has become a major vehicle for AOG and German investment in China. We are currently not utilizing this as much as we could. The bank is internationally valued and trusted and could provide us with significant loans for industrial expansion and railway projects."
LEP_opening_the_interior: "Opening the Interior"
LEP_opening_the_interior_desc: "The interior has always remained relatively resilient to foreign influence. This has also meant that its many resources have gone mostly unused. We are sure that the Germans are extremely willing to tap into this potential source of resources and we should make an effort to open up the interior to German investments."
LEP_improved_tungsten_extraction: "Improved Tungsten Extraction"
LEP_improved_tungsten_extraction_desc: "There are several locations that currently produce tungsten and other valuable metals. We should cooperate with the Germans in improving extraction methods and significantly expand mining operations and production."
LEP_AOG_supremacy: "Defer To The AOG"
LEP_AOG_supremacy_desc: "While the German Empire had already long sunk it's claws into China, they had never had enough pull to claim a true fiefdom in China outside of the concessions. However with the shattering of China into warlord cliques, and the substantial eruption of their influence in the League, it would appear the time is ripe for them to make of themselves a realm of their very own."
LEP_damngirlyoulivelikethis: "Reshape the League Bureaucracy"
LEP_damngirlyoulivelikethis_desc: "While we are in control of the League, we are still forced to be frustrated by the inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy set up by the warlord, set upon by political cronies and countles other nuisances to get nearly anything done. It is long overdue to clean out this rat's nest they call an administration and build one up to German standards, our power will grow by degrees!, and we suppose the Chinese population should benefit too."
LEP_german_economic_reforms: "Kommission Tax Reform"
LEP_german_economic_reforms_desc: "A New Tax code is in order, the old league administration set up their old tax code around their corrupt and nepotistic interests, inefficient and oriented around filling their own pockets before the state, not to mention the uncomfortable payments many German firms had to work around before doing business. This new Tax Code will ensure that every dollar will go into our coffers instead of the pockets of local kingpins, while also ensuring German corporations are free from the burden of heavy tax to develop at greater speed, bringing vast riches to the League and fatherland alike."
LEP_gamer_general_staff: "A German General Staff"
LEP_gamer_general_staff_desc: "With the ascendancy of the AOG within the league, the Reichskolonialamt has seen fit to transfer a number of German Generals to support our cause, as well as offer support to implement reforms that Falkenhausen had long seen fit to enact, but had been frustrated by Zhili politicking. And as well they raise the issue of those Governors responsible, and suggest perhaps we might be prudent to consider taking action against any "fifth columns"."
LEP_limited_self_rule: "Limited Self Rule"
LEP_limited_self_rule_desc: "A state cannot exist against the wishes of its people. In these trying times of revolution, that saying couldn’t be truer. So, to keep the discontent of the natives within the cities from boiling over, we will grant them limited democratic rights within their respective areas. So, they have enough imagined self determination to be happy, but not to challenge our hold on China."
LEP_the_union_in_forty_years: "Make No Pretense"
LEP_the_union_in_forty_years_desc: "No matter how the people whine and moan about us, they do not know what is best, the revolutionary and the fanatic bear their daggers at every corner. We cannot allow such innocent and naive notions as "self determination" jeopardize progress toward the civilizing ideals of the German homeland, nor the efforts with which we take to protect it. Let us declare that if we have to stamp over the misguided and malcontent, so be it."
LEP_ostasia_direktorum_victory: "The Kommissioner's Triumph"
LEP_ostasia_direktorum_victory_desc: "Triumphant over all obstacles that the AOG's tumultuous rise to power could muster, Falkenhausen is now free to cement his rule over the league, and perhaps one day, all of China."
LEP_krupp_victory: "The Krupp Supremacy"
LEP_krupp_victory_desc: "Krupp's gambit for the League has borne fruit and awarded him the position of Komissioner in the place of Falkenhausen. With him at the helm of the AOG, the fortunes abundant in these lands shall fall under his sway. Heedless of what the Chinese have to say about it."
LEP_schantung_eisenbahn_expansion: "Schantung-Eisenbahn Expansion"
LEP_schantung_eisenbahn_expansion_desc: "The Schantung-Eisenbahn railway company has made plans for extensive railway renovations and expansions around our heartland. We should allow them to make their plans a reality. They will be an effective vehicle for railway development in the north, as having the AOG fund and control these railways directly would most likely not be well-received."
LEP_eastern_resources_commission: "Eastern Resources Commission"
LEP_eastern_resources_commission_desc: "China holds many resources. Too many, in fact, to just develop randomly. We should establish a joint Sino-German Eastern Resources Commission which will oversee the search and development for additional resources. It will have far-reaching authority and should significantly speed up the process, as currently the exploitation of our steel and coal develops at a much too slow pace."
LEP_tolerate_vice: "Tolerate Vice"
LEP_tolerate_vice_desc: "Gambling, prostitution and opium are all morally reprehensible. However, they are also extremely valuable sources of income. While we do not wish to indulge in it ourselves, these vices are too valuable to prohibit entirely. While we do not wish to make it publicly know we will be tolerating these vices, we can still implement certain 'taxes' if those who wish to exploit these vices wish us to look the other way."
LEP_facilitate_german_prospecting: "Facilitate German Prospecting"
LEP_facilitate_german_prospecting_desc: "With our interior more open to German investments, we should aid local governments by facilitating German efforts to prospect for additional resources. Especially our poorer inner provinces would be greatly benefited by the exploitation of additional resources."
LEP_inland_development_zones: "Inland Development Zones"
LEP_inland_development_zones_desc: "If we want to facilitate interior development in a way that does not impact China too negatively, we should introduce special 'Inland Development Zones'. These will be unburdened by local regulations and other measures local governments might think up to impede development. By concentrating the foreign presence in such a way, we can more easily protect them as well."
LEP_special_road_taxes: "Special Transit Taxes"
LEP_special_road_taxes_desc: "Implementing special transit taxes would allow us to raise additional revenue for our central government. We control many of the roads in the League and thus can use this privilege to raise money. Furthermore, the taxes allow us another way to give benefits to our s8pporters, as we can exclude them from the taxes."
LEP_revenue_tax_stamps: "Revenue Tax Stamps"
LEP_revenue_tax_stamps_desc: "If we wish to create a more modern and standardized system of tax collection, we should introduce a new system of special tax stamps that we can use to check if trade goods have fulfilled all the necessary requirements."
LEP_friendly_monopolies: "Friendly Monopolies"
LEP_friendly_monopolies_desc: "If we want to safeguard our regime, we must things good for our allies and partners. By allowing certain businesses and groups to practically exercise free reign in certain sectors, we can be sure of their support. Furthermore, they will be much more likely to invest within our borders."
LEP_five_provinces_one_marshal: "Five Provinces, One Marshal"
LEP_five_provinces_one_marshal_desc: "The Five Provinces can now be truly declared to be simply under the rule of a single Marshal, Qi Xieyuan. After the chaos following the death of Sun, Qi re-engineered the League and united the Five Provinces under his rule. The Nanjing Clique rules the Five Provinces once more."
LEP_nanjing_army: "Falkenhausen's Reform"
LEP_nanjing_army_desc: "Our power derives from our military, which means it is vital to build a competent army. The armies of the former league were divided and weak. We must unify them under Nanjing for a strong and coherent fighting force, to give pause to any enemy within or without our homeland. Luckily, the lead of the Nanking Kommision, Falkenhausen has already drafted a plan for just that."
LEP_air_naval_command: "Air and Naval Command"
LEP_air_naval_command_desc: "Previously, we have relied almost completely on the strength of our army. We must diversify our forces into the theatres of air and water. Our navy has always been weak and it is time to modernize it. We also need to take control of our skies if we want to prevent fire raining upon us when we meat more modern enemies."
LEP_new_nanyang_fleet: "A New Nanyang Fleet"
LEP_new_nanyang_fleet_desc: "One of the greatest fleets of China was the Nanyang Fleet, based in Shanghai. We will build a new Nanyang Fleet, this time based in Nanjing. It will make sure we can properly defend ourselves from all enemies coming from the seas."
LEP_nanjing_naval_yard: "Nanjing Naval Yard"
LEP_nanjing_naval_yard_desc: "It is time to begin investment into a new and expanded naval yard for our shipbuilding in Nanjing. It will be capable of assembling also the great ships of today and will be necessary if we wish to modernize our fleet."
LEP_naval_officer_training: "Naval Officer Training"
LEP_naval_officer_training_desc: "In order for our new fleets to operate in a modern way, we need well-trained naval officers. Without these, coordination will be lacking and any manoeuvrer will fail. We need to improve the training of our naval officers in order to tame these massive steel beasts of the seas."
LEP_green_water_navy: "Green Water Navy"
LEP_green_water_navy_desc: "We know that we cannot build a fleet that will project power in the oceans. We simply lack the technology and industry. Instead, we must protect our coasts and prevent any enemy from landing on our shores. We will therefore invest in the types of ships best suited for this purpose."
LEP_nanjing_air_corps: "Nanjing Air Corps"
LEP_nanjing_air_corps_desc: "Rare among warlords, a dedicated Air Corps may make the decisive difference in battle, a purchase of weltkrieg era airframes has already been arranged as well as some light instruction. Laying this foundation for a proper airforce will certainly serve us well."
LEP_expand_daijaochang_airbase: "Expand Dajiaochang Airbase"
LEP_expand_daijaochang_airbase_desc: "The Dajiaochang Airbase is a prime location for new expansions. We will greatly expand its size so it can house far more planes than before. Dajiaochang will allow us to properly control the skies in a large radius."
LEP_eastern_aviation_school: "Eastern Aviation School"
LEP_eastern_aviation_school_desc: "In order for our Air Corps to function, we will need pilots. Experienced and well-trained pilots. Currently we lack the capability to train enough pilots and it is necessary to build a dedicated school to greatly increase the amount of graduate pilots to crew our planes."
LEP_heinkel_airframes: "Heinkel Airframes"
LEP_heinkel_airframes_desc: "Germany has an outstanding aircraft industry. If we wish to build a strong Air Corps, we need advanced and modern planes. The Germans know we will stand with them, so they must surely be willing to help bolster our new Air Corps with new Heinkel airframes."
LEP_domestic_fighter_production: "Domestic Fighter Production"
LEP_domestic_fighter_production_desc: "In order to truly achieve critical mass, we cannot fully rely on foreign assistance. We will need to establish reliable domestic fighter production in order to replenish our losses and further augment our air force."
LEP_northern_school_doctrine: "Adapt to the Northern School"
LEP_northern_school_doctrine_desc: "To proceed with the completion of the Falkenhausenplan, which emphasises a superiority in equipment and artillery and better-prepared and trained divisions. It has been developed in practice by the warlords of the north, who often fought on the North China Plain."
LEP_southern_school_doctrine: "Adapt to the Southern School"

LEP_raising_fallen_flags: "Raising Fallen Flags"
LEP_raising_fallen_flags_desc: "In the last ten years, many elite Chinese divisions were disbanded or destroyed. In order to strengthen our forces, we can rally these old divisions and build our new forces around these cores. They will serve as a solid foundation on which we can readily expand."
LEP_study_modern_doctrines: "Adapt Western Doctrines"
LEP_study_modern_doctrines_desc: "We must extensively modern Western doctrines and adapt them for our own situation. Only if we truly know how to wage war, can we effectively compete with the rapidly modernizing world."
LEP_german_rifles: "German Rifles"
LEP_german_rifles_desc: "German rifles have always been critical to any warlord army. Now that we have the support of the German government, we have direct access to their newest firearm technology. We must adopt their rifle standards and standardize our equipment across the board in other to increase the fighting power of our infantry."
LEP_support_unit_training: "Support Unit Training"
LEP_support_unit_training_desc: "In the modern day and age, it is no longer possible to survive with purely infantry. We must train units to take on specialized support tasks, such as engineering or support artillery in order to greatly increase the effectiveness of our divisions."
LEP_krupp_artillery: "Krupp Artillery"
LEP_krupp_artillery_desc: "Heavy artillery is rare in China. Now that we have direct access to the German war industry, we must make use of this opportunity and start the mass adoption of artillery within our forces. The Germans will surely help us modernize our forces."
LEP_modernize_jinling_academy: "Modernize Jinling Academy"
LEP_modernize_jinling_academy_desc: "The Jinling Academy in Nanjing is in heavy need of modernization. Sun neglected to introduce modern strategy and tactics and many of its graduates know only how war was fought decades if not centuries ago. We must modernize the theories of the Academy and make sure that its graduates will be officers capable of operating in modern warfare."
LEP_officer_initiative: "Officer Initiative"
LEP_officer_initiative_desc: "We need our officers to be creative in the field. They need to adapt to the rapidly changing circumstances of the field and increase their chances of victory. This requires initiative. We need to train our officers to be forward-thinking. This does mean they sometimes must let go of how things were done in the past."
LEP_unified_command_headquarters: "Unified Command Headquarters"
LEP_unified_command_headquarters_desc: "While we established a temporary Central Command under Qi's authority during the civil war, establishing a unified command headquarters will help to further unify the divided forces of our governors. The unified headquarters will make sure decisions are made in coordination and under more direct control of Qi."
LEP_german_instructors: "German Instructors"
LEP_german_instructors_desc: "If we really want to adopt modern ways of warfare, we cannot do this alone. We must make use of the experience of men who have truly fought at the forefront of modern warfare and who know how advanced armies operate. We must invite German instructors to teach at the Jinling Academy and within our army."
LEP_modern_officer_corps: "Modern Officer Corps"
LEP_modern_officer_corps_desc: "We have improved the way of thinking of our officers and made sure that they are educated with modern strategy and tactics. We must make sure that our new officer corps is truly modern and continue to make sure it adopts all the requirements of a modern army."

LEP_greed_is_good_desc: "With the troublesome Zhili leadership out of the way, now the vast riches of China's untapped wealth is open to us, and no expense shall be spared to harnessing them for the sake of progress. Where once we were obstructed by small, backwards villages of peasants or petty land disputes, now we are free to do things our way, and all of China shall benefit, not least those destitue villages who can be moved to where we need them most instead."
LEP_optimize_production: "Lessons from Fordism"
LEP_optimize_production_desc: "With the curious "Fordism" emerging from the new world, we cannot pass by this chance to revolutionize productivity within the league. With it's approach to optimizing the use of unskilled labor, and austere efficiency, it is a perfect fit for our vision of China."
LEP_investers_paradise: "An Investor's Paradise"
LEP_investers_paradise_desc: "Having done away with the backwards and petty restrictions of the old Zhili, now the League is not merely a factory but the entire industrial district. Investors in Germany flock to our borders, knowing that every Mark they spend here, is well spent indeed."

LEP_I_am_the_law: "Fit our Face to the Mask"
LEP_I_am_the_law_desc: "If Qi wishes to remain in power, he must use any method as his disposal. While Sun Chuanfang often claimed a moral high ground, in reality most of his actions were guided by securing his leadership. While Qi would ordinarily be inclined to do the same, in the wake of the Sun investigation and League war, the opportunity to consolidate his power against his once peers has opened the gates for a change in strategy. With his immediate rivals gone, he may have the room to solidify enforcement of the supposed morality the league claims, shutting out the corrupt practices others may use to climb the ranks of power against Qi."
LEP_populist_overtures: "Curry the People's favor"
LEP_populist_overtures_desc: "Where once the Zhili relied on clandestine and underhanded means to attain political power, relying on the few. Since Qi's decision to crack down on the underhanded powerbrokers infesting the league, these rats have begun lashing out at the regime. However in contrast, once an obstacle to be danced around, this sudden commitment to uprightness, regardless of true motivation has not gone entirely unnoticed by the public, and slowly some voices have spoken in favor of Qi's "reforms". As once old allies hace become enemies so should we put on the face of populist reform, as the support of the masses will drown out the leeches infesting the league."
LEP_no_more_traitors: "Dominate Opportunists"
LEP_no_more_traitors_desc: "With the great success of our attempt at weakening and driving out the underhanded and corrupt within the league, now they are at our mercy, and the Zhili will be much richer for it. This newfound "confiscation" of wealth, shall cement our position as masters of the Eastern Coast even further."
LEP_reconcile_moderate_nationalism: "The Moderate Nationalists"
LEP_reconcile_moderate_nationalism_desc: "While we certainly have not earned ourselves any love from most anti-concessionists, some nationalists, formerly foes of our regime have seemingly warmed to Qi's rule after his crackdown on vice and corruption. While they still resent our collaboration with the Germans, it would appear that they are willing to see us as more than Hanjian traitors provided we continue building up our regime for the supposed sake of a strong and moral China, while an unusual turn of events, we are not ones to refuse support for the league."
LEP_zhili_consolidation: "Consolidate the Zhili Position"
LEP_zhili_consolidation_desc: "The Southern Zhili has many enemies, from republican insurgencies, nationalist rebels to millenarian fanatics and even the encraoching influence of our German benefactors, the league's stability is tenuous at best. In the face of such adversity, we cannot allow ourselves to be unseated by any, the future of the Southern Zhili will be either end in it's ascendency or the end of a Cannon."

LEP_despoil_krupp_desc: "In his gambit to overtake Falkenhausen's authority, the sniveling Krupp has overextended himself, destroying the confidence of his shareholders in China. This marks a golden opportunity to acquire many of his assets to be used for the good of the League. State of the art manufactories, heavy machinery and so much more, at distressed prices no less, it is not as if he will miss them anyhow."

LEP_primacy_of_profit_desc: "When we seized the reins of power, they called us greedy, opportunistic, spineless. They got one thing right, we do need capital, and power, fuel for which to remake China, Germany, the world in our image. When Krupp is finished, the naysayers in Berlin, in Beijing will be silent when they see our works, Falkenhausen was unwilling, unprepared to do what was needed, what was right for Germany, for Krupp! We by comparison, will not fail, let profit pave the way forward."

LEP_securing_our_grip_desc: "Southern China has gone astray, we must restore order to the warring states of the South to ensure stability and order under our rule. It is time to tighten our grip around Nanking and eradicate those who want to see China descend into Anarchy. The Federalist and the Kuomintang Governments are a direct threat to our power and the power of Nanking, and they must be taken out."

LEP_buck_break_dissent_desc: "Krupp's bid for power has not gone unnoticed within the League, and in the aftermath, remnants of the opposition within the AOG as well as the wider population seem to have taken the opportunity to make one final bid to resist our rule. We will show these snakes that we are here to stay, and a reinforced polciing force should demonstrate this without fault."
LEP_wat_nou: "A Goose-step into the future"
LEP_wat_nou_desc: "With the restoration fo League lands under German hands, the question of the future remains in the minds of all, where to from here? Conservative members of our government see fit to remain in our holdings of the south, away from the bickering and foolishness of the warlords, forging the League into a colony truly fitting of our Empire."

LEP_ZIP_AOG: "Our Own ZIP"
LEP_ZIP_AOG_desc: "After Black Monday, leading economists within Germany proposed the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan to rebuild and develop the civilian and especially heavy industries within Germany, adapting such a plan to our Realm in China could see the rich but underdeveloped lands be turned into the factory of the Reichspakt."

LEP_import_machinery_desc: "While the Chinese economy is hardly destitute, it remains powered mainly by the slow and tiring hands of many laborers, hands not strong enoigh to push Eastern China into modernity, these backwards lands will burn in the fires of industry, the warlords will fall, a new order will rise, we will drive the machine of war with the rifle and the cannon and the iron fist of the Teuton. To that end, we will see to the mass delivery of industrial equipment and tools, while this will command a extravagant price, it is an investment that will pay many times over for the us as well as the Fatherland."

LEP_balans_industry_desc: "While we must stive still toward the prosperity that we have so long desired for our Empire, covetous eyes are drawn to us, and the spectre of war looms, the League must remain ready to leap into action if the Kaiser calls, or our realm is threatened, even if at the cost of paltry sums."

Living in these interesting times, there are no lack of foes to be wary of, and no time better to commit ourselves further toward the defense of the Kaiserreich, whether from revolution or revanchist.

LEP_enemis_desc: "The Chinese have betrayed us for the last time. The treachery of the Zhili Clique has cast the German Influence from Peking, and betrayed the agreement made between our nations even though the weak and pathetic rats could not unite the nation for even 10 years with our blessing, and more petty, greedy warlords nip at our heels with every step. Germany must restore influence over all of China, whatever the pathetic and backwards rulers of this land have to say about it."

LEP_frens_desc: "While our Zhili "allies" have failed to keep their realm in check, they remain amicable at least, if not subservient to our objectives. With this in mind, it is best we focus on greater issues, and cooperate with the Northern Zhili, for now."

LEP_spheres_of_influence_desc: "With our commitment to our own territory within the league, we cannot concern ourselves with foolish dreams of petty expansion when we have plenty on our hands as is.

LEP_xuantong_propaganda_desc: "It is hardly a secret that monarchism as a phenomenon in China remains on weak knees, and even now the Qing has sweaty palms dealing with discontent even within it's own domain. For the sake of order in China, and the wishes of the Kaiserreich, we will do our part to strengthen the public face of the Xuantong Emperor."

LEP_qing_extended_attache_desc: "While we fight to maintain order in China, we do not do so alone, our allies in the Zhili clique struggle too against warlord and scoundrels. It would not be amiss to lend advice to them, especially since this would get us further acquainted with the intricacies of maneuvering in their politics."

LEP_slander_peifu: "Venom for the Jade Marshal"
LEP_slander_peifu_desc: "While we cannot openly move against the Zhili as a whole, a vital lynchpin of their power is the Jade Marshal, Wu peifu who holds great sway within the political spheres of Beijing. While such a dragon of a man cannot be slain, yet... he, or rather his public image can be poisoned, a few whispers here, bribes there and he will soon lose face, leaving a vacuum we will be more than able to fill."

LEP_AOG_pacification_of_china_desc: "We have restored German Hegemony over China, the Anti-Concessionsists have been dealt with, Nanking has been completely absorbed into our sphere, and the South is once again under our complete control.

LEP_air_exercizes: "Air Games over Nanjing"

LEP_big_planes: "Sweep Across the Sky"
LEP_big_planes_desc: "China is a vast land, and an invading force may be able to strike anywhere at any time, if we are to contend with this reality we cannot have our airforce stretched thin protecting all of our domain, larger planes that can reach anywhere they are needed without the great inconvenience of swapping bases or more prove necessary. And of course if the fight is ever taken into enemy lands, they will be able to lay waste to our enemies deep in their territory as well, they will think twice about matching us when their homes and works are turned to ash."

LEP_smol_planes: "Achieve Local Superiority"
LEP_smol_planes_desc: "While covering airspace is well and good, we still need planes able to dominate the sky when and where it matters most. To this end, it is entirely clear that lighter aiframes claim greatest supremacy of the skies, from Dive Bombers bringing bombs down upon enemy troops with a precision not imagined possible in days past, to agile fighters able to harry enemy aircraft. We must further our design in this field lest the Japanese or any other invader be able to dominate the heavens in war, and then our enemies  will learn to fear the skies when the League flies."

LEP_steal_rommels_homework: "A Concept of Mobile Warfare"
LEP_steal_rommels_homework_desc: "From their experiences in the weltkrieg, general staff in Germany have been concocting plans for a new form of combined arms warfare, one reliant on breaking the enemy in swift and decisive maneuvers as compared to the attritional warfare of days past. While of course it would be no small undertaking, the idea of rolling combined arms formations crushing enemy armies in elegant and brutal fashion entices the imagination of many among the league."

LEP_clear_sky: "Clear Sky"
LEP_clear_sky_desc: "With an increasingly competent artillery park at our disposal, it has become rather apparent that for all the virtues of big cannons, that any setup of field artillery finds itself frighteningly vulnerable to being spotted or even destroyed from the air. Fortunately, flak cannons and all sorts of similar implements to swap the enemy's loathesome locusts from the sky are becoming a greater focus of our design bureaus, we should put some of these works to the test."

LEP_big_guns_never_tire: "Big Guns Never Tire"
LEP_big_guns_never_tire_desc: "War is changing, from the rise of Air warfare to the Weltkrieg Tank, new implements of destruction roll forth by the day. But the more things change the more they stay the same and bestride infantry, who grow weary with battle, vehicles who grew temperamental with wear, the cannon, howitzers, mortars and more, artillery are indefatigable and remain the king of the battlefield, and we will prove that it remains true in the coming age."

LEP_big_numbers: "Expand the Baojia Conscription"
LEP_big_numbers_desc: "The Baojia system of conscription has served the League well, but as the tribulations of the age have shown, we cannot have too large a reserve in case of trouble. We need more men to defend China, and more guns with which to arm them. We cannot let happenstance like that of Tiaoyuan find us scrambling for soldiers again."

LEP_sentry_goin_up: "The Engineer's Cause"
LEP_sentry_goin_up_desc: "What tool can compare to the infantryman's rifle? Only the Shovel, it is universal in application, defensive or offensive works spring from the end of the shovel so long as it's user has the will to use it, and even now a simple ditch is a man's best shield against bombs and bullets alike. The engineer thus is indespensible in warfare, with tools like the shovel he crosses redoubts, rivers, ravines and more, he is the backbone of any operation."

LEP_there_is_such_a_force: "There is Such a Force"
LEP_there_is_such_a_force_desc: "When we find ourselves matched with our enemies, we will be asked how we have prepared, some will ask us for millions, maybe tens of millions, but we will show them that our host is lacking neither blood nor resolve. The spirit of the infantry will endure, and triumph as it has and will continue to do, regardless of how many terrible implements of destruction are thrown our way. The rifle held by a good soldier will prove enough."

LEP_new_age_cataphracts: "The Cataphract of Tommorow"
LEP_new_age_cataphracts_desc: "In the time of the weltkrieg, horses still rode astride the armies of the world, as they did in ages past. But now a new age dawns on war, no longer does the horse prove the axis upon which a battle can be turned, the beating of horses' hooves gives way to the roar of tanks' engines , metal beasts with skin of steel and breath of fire. This is the cataphract of tommorow, and we will prepare for it's coming today."

LEP_flesh_in_steel: "Flesh Bound in Steel"
LEP_flesh_in_steel_desc: "As powerful as the Tank may prove, like the cavalry of old they cannot dominate in every circumstance without the accompanyment of supporting elements. Thus we may wish to apply the virtues of the tank, it's speed and armor to a method of transporting the infantry. These two modes of mobile warfare make an ideal fit as the infantryman, flexible and numerous and the tank, powerful and unwieldy can cover the pitfalls of one another in elegant fashion."

LEP_iron_pagodas_return: "Charge of the Iron Pagoda"
LEP_iron_pagodas_return_desc: "Old texts tell the tale of the Jin Dynasty, led by Jurchens, their cavalry was mighty indeed, but none more so than the legendary Iron Pagoda. Clad in armor so great that they resembled metal golems more than men, the shock of their fearsome charge could not be withstood by dense ranks of men nor contested by lesser horsemen. Now, with our resplendent host of armor and men, we bring to life a reenactment of their martial prowess, let all fear the armies of the League!"

LEP_pay_them_more: "Pay Them More"
LEP_pay_them_more_desc: "Of all the places where perhaps the outrage against German control manifests greatest is at the barracks. Short of already existing career soldiers or the particularly destitute and loyal, desertions have skyrocketed and many rectuiment centers find themselves with more staff than intakes. The only way it seems apparent to find ourselves returning to pre takeover recruitment numbers would be to take a slice out of our  pie so to speak to lavishly reward those willing to bleed for the Kaiserreich. Such a direct method though effective will not lack downsides however, this certainly breeds a very mercenary attitude among the army, and if their wage ever looks in doubt, it is quite certain that the army will not be fighting to the bitter end."

LEP_pride_of_service: "Lean upon Duty"
LEP_pride_of_service_desc: "Recruitment intakes are more and more slim within the league since the our seizure of the levers of power, but this state of affairs suits us just fine, an unhappy citizen is less of a concern than a disloyal or outraged soldier, and with them weeding themselves out, the AOG will be able to pick wheat from wheat without chaff to complicate matters. It is not after all as if honeyed words will not recoup the losses otherwise, we will have a strong military more than a large one, just as Kaiser intended."

AOG_junta: "The Military Mandate"
AOG_junta_desc: "Our colony's attempt at a civilian administration has failed. Their petty bickering and indecisiveness led this vital strategic outpost to the brink of oblivion. Now with the tact and brutal efficiency the feckless bureaucratic rats lacked, the German Garrison has decided to take matters into its own hands. With the tacit support of our glorious Kaiser we have secured our slice of China, rounded up those leeches and thrown them into the fires of hell where they belong! Now we shall recover our precarious position and secure for the Kaiser his vaunted Ostasien outpost!"

AOG_willy_nilly: "The Prussian Eagle Conquers the Heavens"
AOG_willy_nilly_desc: "When the Prussian Eagle first landed in China in the 1920s few would’ve expected it to stay, yet it had. In the 30s as the world careened towards war few expected the Chinese concessions to remain in German hands, yet they had. Then, when we announced the commencement of Operation Ostdolch, our invasion of China, few expected us to succeed. Yet German troops now parade past the Forbidden Palace and the Warlords that once plagued this land have been sent reeling into the countryside, their bandit armies collapsing around them. Over Peking the rotting carcass of the Qing dragon has been put down and the flag of the new Ostasien Kaiserreich has been raised. Preparations are being made at a frantic pace as Kaiser Wilhelm begins the arduous trek East. Once he arrives in his new Eastern Capital he will claim a title no European has ever dreamed of possessing, the title of the Mandate of Heaven and the Chinese throne. Es lebe Wilhelm! Es lebe die Chinesisch-Deutsche Union!"

AOG_new_mandate: "A Mandate Reforged"
AOG_new_mandate_desc: "After a monumental shedding of blood and the exertion of a truly herculean effort the German garrison of the AOG has subdued China. From the Yellow Sea to the Pearl River Delta stunned European onlookers and Chinese peasants alike, some of whom had never seen a white man, watch as German troops parade through the ancient cities of Peking, Canton and Shanghai. With such an unexpected and even implausible outcome it was anybody’s guess what our plan was for the Chinese. While our administration was finely tuned to rule our limited concessions, it has been stretched to near disintegration trying to govern all of the new lands. That is why we have decided to not rule them, at least not directly. In Peking we shall hold a grand coronation as a Chinese Emperor of our choice be hoisted upon the Dragon Throne. Of course he will be kept locked away in the Palace while our administration works to build a new and lasting German order in the East. Der Adler und der Drache, vereint!"

AOG_stratocratic_devotion: "Stratocratic Elan"
AOG_stratocratic_devotion_desc: "While many in our administration are more than willing to fight for the Kaiser, few outside of it are. Most of the civilians in the concessions if not actively hate us, at the very most do not care for us. However through a careful use of propaganda and extreme physical violence we will inspire a new martial spirit within our population. If they don't want to die for the Kaiser they will die for something else but they will most certainly die."

AOG_military_exploitation: "Military Exploitation"
AOG_military_exploitation_desc: "While our military grows and our administration continues to grow more efficient by the day we have run into a familiar problem. We simply do not have the guns necessary to outfit all of our new soldiers. However the solution is rather easy. The only reason it was not found sooner is the previous administration was too weak willed to do what was necessary for the nation. China has an abundance of people and many of them are little more than animals groveling the gutters for scraps. We shall round them up in grand sweeps of every one of our cities and put them to work. In exchange for us giving them a home and food they shall work in the factories day in and day out. They shall make guns, bullets, artillery guns and tanks, anything our army may require by the truckload. Maybe, if they work hard enough, we may set them free. That however is far and away down the line."

AOG_elimintate_nationalism_desc: "While constant crackdowns have kept them in check, the nationalists, tenacious as ever have used the de facto declaration of official German rule to rally their number one last time. With our strangehold over the nation, they have nowhere else to hide and now this presents one final opportunity to root them out once and for all."

AOG_buck_break_nobility: "Quell the Nobility"
AOG_buck_break_nobility_desc: "While very much at odds with most of the former nationalist cliques, who were festooned with republican beliefs, much of the Chinese nobility are hardly blameless, nor are they harmless, as there is much reason to suspect their collaboration with our former enemies. Making an example of the greatest perpetrators in view of the rest should set them straight, lest they do something unwise."

AOG_native_image: "A Chinese Face"
AOG_native_image_desc: "The League has always been seen as having been stained by the machinations of Germany to one end or another, but no more than after the AOG seized the reins of power in the League. But with the Emperor as our face, we can finally distance ourselves somewhat from the terrible stigma, hanging over our government like a pall, all shall know the Emperor as a sign that the benevolent German guidance is finally handing back power into Chinese hands, whether or not the truth is quite so peachy."

AOG_subvert_nationalism: "Cultivate "Nationalism""
AOG_subvert_nationalism_desc: "While it is all well and good to have the puppet Emperor be the face of our regime, any competent facade requires constant maintainance lest it fall apart. Fortunately, there is an ideal way to outsource much of this bothersome task, with the sweeping away of most of the old nationalist opposition, there is left a vacuum for patriots that can be filled with those subservient to our aims, straw nationalists in essentiality. With such compromised groups blossiming in the absence of our opponents, we would have turned bane to boon."

AOG_end_republicanism: "Sink Daggers into Republicanism"
AOG_end_republicanism_desc: "Ever since the 1911 Xinhai Revolution China has been rotting from the inside. ‘Republicans’ rallied under the KMT and deposed the old Emperor and shattered China into a myriad of petty fiefdoms and warlords. While German help in the 1920s helped the Emperor regain his throne, even now Republicans of all shades hide away in the vast lands of China. This filth even finds it's way into our holdings. The Ost-Abwher has reported that KMT agitators pop up on street corners like weeds. Every time one is executed several more take his place. If we are to destroy this perverse idea and secure our rule we must do so in one swift strike. Already the military and secret police reel back like a prize fighter readying a knockout blow. Once it is thrown, it shall shatter the Republican movement once and for all!"

AOG_lifeguards: "Call Upon the Prussian Life Guards"
AOG_lifeguards_desc: "While not lacking spledour, the so called "Imperial Guard" of China is woefully underequipped, trained and manned. Resembling more a formation of napoleonic era fighters at times than anything to match modern infantry. To this end we will take steps to align the outdated formation closer to the model of the Kaiser's Life Guards, a professional formation to meet any other on equal terms, only the best to protect our Emperor."

LEP_fate_of_LEC_desc: "Since the beginning of the age of Humiliation, China has had foreign powers greedily pluck away it's priceless trade ports, festering tumors from which poisoned our nation and siphoned it's life. But now having broken the reign warlords with the aid of our Benefactors from Berlin, it is time to put an end to the unsightly Legations, only two powers need have sway in our court, and we will keep it that way."

Gone are the traitors, the fanatics and the revolutionary biting at our heels, we have proven ourselves the greater, we stand at the gates to all of China, and it shall be our prize. We have shown China that we don't need Wu Peifu, lets show it again what we can do without him."

China is whole again, and Nanjing is the birthplace of our new found unity."

LEP_join_germany_desc: "The whole world shall tremble at the unified might of the German Eagle and the Chinese Dragon. No longer shall the islander emperor, supposedly a spawn of a 'sun goddess' threaten both of our glorious domains. No longer shall the reds have free reign to corrupt the globe. No longer shall the vestiges of the Anglo empire carve out small lumps of their imperialist cancer within our sphere. China and Germany, the last guardians of the world order."

LEP_help_germany: "A Moderate Outlook"
LEP_help_germany_desc: "While some in our administration and back in Berlin, especially among the most ardent militarist cliques, wish for nothing more than all of China to fully join the Pakt. But our officials, deeply attuned to the mood of the native population, know it would end with nothing but a massive crisis tearing our new domain apart. For now we shall cooperate with the Kaiserreich on economic grounds, and exchange light military cooperation, with such measured cooperation shall much fruit be borne."

LEP_zhili_republic: "Rebirth of a Republic"
LEP_zhili_republic_desc: "It was not an unlikely prediction that Republicanism was the future for a Modern China, however it would appear fortune has granted Qi and Nanjing the keys to this future before the foolish ideologues of the Kuomintang and Federalists. While the age of dynasties and lords comes to it's final end, much to the potential trepidation of the German Kaiser, this shall serve as a new spring for China, led by us standing at the helm of a new China for a new century!"

LEP_qing_restoration_desc: "The Qing were once weak and rotting, easy pickings for foreign vultures resulting. However through Qi's peerless leadership, we have reforged the once dying dynasty through the trials and tribulations of the warlords, and come out of it with a storng and united empire. With the Emperor once again ruling in Beijing under our watchfl guidance, Nanjing will accomplish what the Self-Strengthening Movement and 10 years of weak ryule could not. Make way, for the Qing Dragon flies again!"

LEP_han_restoration: "A Chinese Empire"
LEP_han_restoration_desc: "The Germans get one thing right, China needs an Empire, however it cannot be under the decadent, aloof Jurchens of the Qing dynasty. With a final blow against the traitorous central government in Beijing, the Manchu Yoke is broken, and now China is led again by an Emperor of Han stock, as decreed by Heaven and carried out by Qi. Under this new mandate, the realm is made new again, and China is given it's chance to flourish anew, though some narrow minded fols may decry such an "outdated" government, they will find that within this old nation, we will make a modernity of our own."

### Events ###
lep.1.t: "The Imperial Cornerstone"
lep.1.d: "Forged amid last decade's wars, and expanded to its current size following the defeat of the Northern Expedition, Sun Chuanfang's League is a loose confederation of provincial governments oriented around his stronghold in Nanjing. Though united by its members' fear of central government control, the League is nonetheless a cornerstone of the Empire, buttressing Beijing against both external threats and internal challengers by virtue of shared heritage.\n\nThis tenuous arrangement has brought years of peace, and with them relative prosperity. Foreign industrial methods have proven transformational, and Sun’s armies now include several German-trained and equipped divisions at their core. The League-Marshal has come to sit atop a vast bureaucratic pyramid, a position he is more than happy to keep, despite the cracks that have begun to appear at its base. German material aid, necessary to offset pressure from Beijing and the League's fractious southern members, has not served as a source of strength alone. German money trickles into every level of the League’s hierarchy, feeding an already ingrained and unhealthy taste for corruption, with officials complicit in everything from embezzlement to the stolen antiquities trade.\n\nThis has gradually stoked the fires of popular discontent, increasingly harnessed by nationalistic agitators, and fueled by the elusive remnants of the Kuomintang. For all Sun’s efforts to draw the fragmented League together, it may be drifting all the further apart. Still, these domestic squabbles are outshone by the rising sun, which looms large in the east. Beset by internal conflicts, the League must rise to this challenge, or else risk annihilation.\n\nBriefings are available on the League's special mechanics, its relationship with the Germans, and internal politics."
lep.1.a: "Brief me on the Central Government"
lep.1.b: "Brief me on the Germans"
lep.1.c: "Brief me on our internal concerns"
lep.1.e: "The League will endure!"

lep.2.t: "The Central Government"
lep.2.d: "Together with his old mentor Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang stopped the Kuomintang’s Northern Expedition in its tracks, and reversed the Fengtian advance onto the Northern Plain. Together they came to control all of China proper, but the peace that followed soon brought a new dilemma. Would Sun continue to bow to his old master in the North, and could Wu permit his old protege to disregard his authority?\n\nThe years since have seen both Wu's Beijing Government and Sun's League hold to an awkward status-quo, guaranteed by their shared enemies to the north and east; the Fengtian Government and Japan. Sun is free to do as he likes within the League, so long as he holds to ceremony and maintains the appearance of a unified country. Whether this can last remains to be seen."
lep.2.a: "Brief me on the Germans"
lep.2.b: "Brief me on our internal concerns"
lep.2.c: "The League will endure!"

lep.3.t: "The Germans"
lep.3.d: "Germany's significant role in the 1927 destruction of the Northern Expedition left Berlin with a great deal of leverage in China, tempered only slightly by the 1928 international Shanghai Conference, which claimed to give all nations equal access to the Chinese market. In order to ensure a favorable position in spite of these 'restrictions', German officials proposed a series of agreements with League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang and our constituent governors. By sidestepping both international agreements and Beijing's authority, German strength helps hold together the League and maintain autonomy from Wu Peifu's Northern Zhili, in exchange for an ever increasing spread of German influence.\n\nThis arrangement has gradually lost its luster. As German control grows and the people watch the fruits of their labor line the pockets of generals and foreigners alike, many have come to question its necessity.\n\nThe nature of the League's relationship with Germany may need to be reconsidered going forward."
lep.3.a: "Brief me on the Central Government"
lep.3.b: "Brief me on our internal concerns"
lep.3.c: "The League will endure!"

lep.4.t: "Internal Vigilance"
lep.4.d: "German influence and the somewhat decentralized nature of the League has often lead to localized unrest, and though this is often quickly dealt with, it can be seen as indicative of a greater malaise. The League is pestered by numerous subversive forces, and though they may be seen as no threat, they must not be allowed to escape control.\n\nA number of Kuomintang holdouts, remnants of the failed Northern Expedition of 1926 and a second smaller uprising in 1932, remain just outside our reach in the mountains of Fujian and the major coastal concessions. Yiguandao adherents, committed to expunging foreign influence and returning China to its long-held traditions, have been moving south from Shandong and making inroads among the eastern provinces. To the south Guangdong and Guangxi, together referred to as Liangguang, as well as Hunan, operate de-facto autonomously and may even harbor ambitions of formal independence.\n\nAll will have to be watched closely."

lep.4.c: "The League will endure!"

lep.5.t: "The Sun Investigation"
lep.5.d: "Following the assassination of Marshal Sun Chuanfang, chaos has continued to plague the League. Thousands have already died, and many more deaths will follow. Although there were many factors that lead to this, the shooting of Sun was the nail in the coffin for the League of 8 Provinces. \n\nWith enemies on all sides, Qi has decided to start an investigation into his murder. Most do not believe this assassin was working alone, and people want answers. Some have suggested she was a Kuomintang agent, others believe she was part of the Yiguandao. Some think she was an agent of Chen, others argue she simply wanted revenge. Some even suggest that it was Qi himself who ordered the killing! An investigation must be started to find the answer. \n\nWith this investigation, there must of course be an investigator. Someone who will lead the case and will find the truth, or at least, whatever Qi needs the truth to be. There are four options for lead investigator. We could choose a man who was close and loyal to Sun, who will know him best and know where to look. However, he may not show Qi in the best light, as many loyal to Sun believe Qi was willing to push Sun aside a little too enthusiastically, and have suspicions of him. Another option is to choose someone loyal to Qi, whom will make sure the results will not harm out administration, but some will not trust the results. Another option is to call in a German investigator, which will have far more credibility than one of ours. The final option is to choose someone from the Northern Zhili Clique, for they won’t have many conflicting loyalties."
lep.5.a: "The Qi loyalist will lead the investigation."
lep.5.b: "Sun's friend will investigate."
lep.5.c: "Ask for a German investigator."
lep.5.e: "The Northern Zhili will investigate."

lep.6.t: "A Sense of Direction"
lep.6.d: "Although the investigation into Sun’s death is independent from our government, it may be best to give the investigator our initial speculations and opinions on what occurred that day. This will assist the investigation, and allow us to keep some sort of control over the findings of it. However, the investigator may simply ignore our initial direction, but it may at least sway them slightly."
lep.6.a: "An Yiguandao agent."
lep.6.b: "A Kuomintang agent."
lep.6.c: "A friend of Sun's."
lep.6.e: "An agent of Chen's."
lep.6.f: "The woman sought revenge."

lep.7.t: "The Report is Almost Complete"

lep.7.a: "Interesting..."

lep.8.t: "The Yiguandao are guilty"
lep.8.d: "The investigators have concluded that the Yiguandao are guilty of the assassination of Sun Chuanfang. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a devout member of the Yiguandao, who had lived in Shandong just a few years ago. She met with Zhang Tianran personally, whom sent her to Nanjing to act as a spy. As the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railway and unrest increased, Zhang Tianran saw it as the perfect opportunity to end Sun and collapse the league."
lep.8.a: "Interesting..."

lep.9.t: "The Kuomintang are guilty"
lep.9.d: "The investigators have concluded that the Kuomintang are guilty of the assassination of Sun Chuanfang. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was an avid member of the Kuomintang, who had worked in the undergrounds of Nanjing for years. She was in contact with Wang Jingwei, whom commanded her to act out the assassination after seeing the unrest caused after the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railway."
lep.9.a: "Interesting..."

lep.10.t: "Sun's associate is guilty"
lep.10.d: "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by one of his close associates. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a spy for a friend of his, and had been working for him for years. Although he did not show it himself, Sun's friend was power hungry, and saw Sun as an obstacle that needed to be removed for him to move forward. Though the report does give a few suggestions as to who this man might be, including Chen Yi or Tang Enbo, it says it does not have enough evidence to make any conclusions of his exact identity."
lep.10.a: "Interesting..."

lep.11.t: "Chen is guilty"
lep.11.d: "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by Chen Tiaoyuan. According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a spy for Chen, and had been working for him for years. Chen had always been power hungry, and wished to see the downfall of the League. When the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railway, and unrest ensued, Chen saw it as his time to make his move, and roll the dice."
lep.11.a: "Interesting..."

lep.12.t: "The woman wanted revenge"
lep.12.d: "The investigators have concluded that the woman who assassinated Sun Chuanfang was doing it out of revenge. According to the report, no real political connections were found with the woman, however, multiple people in her family were killed in wars led by Sun. The report concludes that the woman was thus acting for revenge for her family."
lep.12.a: "Interesting..."

lep.13.t: "The Germans are guilty!"
lep.13.d: "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by the Germans! According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was working for the Germans in Nanjing as a political spy. The report then goes into what can only be described as a conspiracy theory, claiming Germany made the AOG purchase the Zhegan Railway to sow dissent, then commanded the lady to kill Sun. Apparently, the Germans feared that Sun was drifting away from the idea of using German concessions, and wanted someone more favourable to their interests.\n\nIf we released the report like this, it would alienate our German allies in the AOG."
lep.13.a: "What..."

lep.14.t: "Qi is guilty!"
lep.14.d: "The investigators have concluded that Sun Chuanfang's assassination was organised by Qi Xieyuan! According to the report, the woman who killed Sun was a spy for Qi, and had been working for him for years. It claims that the great Qi was always power hungry, and always wanted the League-Marshal role for himself. After the AOG purchased the Zhegan Railways, apparently Qi saw his opportunity and had Sun killed, so he could take the leadership.\n\nObviously, this report is full of lies, and the investigators will likely never see the outside of a cell ever again. We cannot release the report like this."
lep.14.a: "Lies!"

lep.15.t: "Time to release the results"
lep.15.d: "Finally, it is time to officially complete the Sun Investigation and release the results. However, with the report in our hands, it may be best if the results were changed a little more to our liking. We must make sure we control the narrative around Sun's death."
lep.15.a: "We must stand by the results."
lep.15.b: "It was the Yiguandao of course!"

Shi was quickly apprehended by Sun's bodyguards, and Sun was rushed to medical assistance. However, he lost blood very quickly, and so passed from his coma a few weeks later.\n\nEvidence collected by an investigatory body has concluded that Shi Jianqiao was an agent for Qi Xieyuan, who saw the viewed the instability of the time as an opportunity to take power for himself.''"
lep.16.d_chen: "''At 6:23 a.m. Marshal Sun Chuanfang awoke and was served his morning breakfast. At 6:51, he got out of bed and put on his Marshal uniform and went to a meeting with some of his officers. At this point, Shi Jianqiao, the assassin, had put on her disguise as a serving woman, and had infiltrated Suns serving staff. Following Sun's meeting, Sun then went out to the courtyard, where some troops were being trained. As he watched the training exercise, Shi approached from behind him, drew a German Luger pistol, and shot at Sun three times; once in the centre of his back, once in his shoulder, and one bullet firing past his head. Shi was quickly apprehended by Sun's bodyguards, and Sun was rushed to medical assistance. However, he lost blood very quickly, and so passed from his coma a few weeks later.\n\nEvidence collected by an investigatory body has concluded that Shi Jianqiao was an agent for the traitor warlord Chen Tiaoyuan, who saw the viewed the instability of the time as an opportunity for personal gain.''"
lep.16.a: "Finally, this can be put to rest."

lep.17.t: "Qi's forces control Nanjing Arsenal"
lep.17.d: "In the early hours of this morning, Qi's forces were able to fully capture the Arsenal in Nanjing. Following the death of Sun, and the 'coup' of Qi, Nanjing's forces were split between Sun loyalists and Qi loyalists. Many of these troops and their commanding officers still believe Qi is not fit to rule, with some even suggesting that Qi had Sun killed so he could take the role of League-Marshal for himself. Since Qi took power, fighting in Nanjing has been widespread, with Sun loyalists mainly being based around the arsenal in Nanjing. The arsenal is a very important military and logistical structure, allowing Sun's forces to hold it for days. However, with it finally now in our hands, our control in Nanjing is all but assured."
lep.17.a: "Excellent."

lep.18.t: "Rioters in Nanjing disperse"
lep.18.d: "After our forces gained control of the Nanjing Arsenal, troops loyal to Sun mostly dissipated. However, many of the troops joined the rest of the citizens in Nanjing, who protested against Qi. Many wanted an end to the warlordism that has faced China for years. Many even feel that perhaps the Kuomintang might be a better option than Qi! Thankfully, with the arsenal in our hands, our troops had the weapons to easily disperse the crowds of protesters. The citizens have gone back into their homes as our troops march through the streets, and Nanjing is ours."
lep.18.a: "Nanjing is ours."

lep.19.t: "North, South, or West?"
lep.19.d: "With the way the war is currently going, it is clear we must choose to focus on one of our targets first, so that out troops are not as spread out as currently."
lep.19.a: "North to Shandong!"
lep.19.b: "South to the Kuomintang!"
lep.19.c: "West to the traitor Chen!"

lep.20.t: "Disloyal Officers purged"
lep.20.d: "With the betrayal of Chen Tiaoyuan, it has become clear that many of the ranked officers are in fact not loyal to Nanjing at all, but rather hold their own loyalties. How is our military supposed to function when the officers serving do not hold absolute loyalty to Qi Xieyuan and Nanjing? To solve this, over the last few days, a massive purge has occurred across our whole officer staff. A committee titled the Military Loyalty Committee was formed, filled with investigators who review all of our officers histories and past ties, and questioned many who were in Nanjing. The Military Loyalty Committee ordered the arrest of many officers, who were found to have links to the Kuomintang, Yiguandao, or some military warlord. All of the treacherous officers have either been imprisoned indefinitely, or have already been taken care of."
lep.20.a: "Excellent."

lep.21.t: "Newspaper writers arrested"
lep.21.d: "Just this morning, multiple groups of military police raided multiple newspaper offices, and have arrested hundreds of writers, editors and company owners. It is clear that the newspapers were complicit in the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, and though we are faced by many enemies, they continue to write lies and slander against League-Marshal Qi, ironically even blaming him for the Leagues collapse. However, it cannot be ignored how much potential these newspapers have for propaganda. Therefore, new writers and editors have been offered to the newspaper companies, who have already been checked to make sure they will remain loyal and will write in favour of Nanjing."
lep.21.a: "Treachery must be punished."

lep.22.t: "Purge the Complicit"
lep.22.d: "Now that Marshal Qi's power has been secured against enemies from the outside, we must make sure we are secure internally. Many people throughout the population, from the peasant class all the way to the highest offices were complicit in the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces. Therefore, the only answer is to purge the complicit. In doing this we must focus on one of the main groups currently opposing us. The young students of China is where dissent and rebellion spreads. The Kuomintang and the Yiguandao remain in secrecy, and must still be destroyed. Even Sun Chuanfang's old friends and associates have shown they are not to be trusted."
lep.22.a: "Dissent spreads between the students."
lep.22.b: "We must destroy the Kuomintang from the core."
lep.22.c: "The Yiguandao are the true threats to the peace."
lep.22.e: "Sun is gone, his friends must go too."

lep.23.t: "How harsh shall we be?"
lep.23.d: "Before we execute the purge of the complicit, we must choose how brutal were are going to be to those who are arrested. In this group will be criminals and rebels whom, given the chance, will bring about the end of stability and society as we know it."
lep.23.a: "Exile or a prison cell for traitors."
lep.23.b: "Execution will be necessary."

lep.24.t: "The Complicit has been purged"
lep.24.d: "After many days of investigations, police raids, and even some military shootouts, the purge of the complicit has taken place. Qi's power becomes more and more secure by the day."
lep.24.a: "Excellent."

#lep.25.t: "Eradicate KMT Cells"
#lep.25.d: "It is time now to destroy the last Kuomintang cells in our nation. We had previously received the location of the main Kuomintang cell in the south after torturing a KMT officer. After finding this information, a small force of military police and infantry units was organised in Longyan, led by Li Shengchun, which then moved south to the location given. There, in the mountains a few miles from Longyan, scouts found the massive Kuomintang base. After surrounding the compound, Li moved in all units, and were faced with little resistance. After arresting and interrogating multiple KMT members at the base, it became clear that all the soldiers and military leaders had already escaped, apparently planning on going into hiding again in the North of Vietnam. After all the KMT members were arrested or killed, any documents inside were seized and the base was burned to the ground. With this main headquarters of the Kuomintang now in ashes, the Kuomintang itself has been pushed back years in organisation."
#lep.25.a: "Socialism shall never live in China."

#lep.26.t: "Crack Down on Yiguandao Sects"
#lep.26.d: "Throughout our territory, the Yiguandao still has millions of followers. These cultists regularly harass and attack innocent civilians, and destroy infrastructure. If we are to end their terrorism, we must strike at their core: the large Yiguandao Sects, from which everything is organised. Therefore, military police have been sent into all the major Yiguandao monasteries, who have arrested the heads of these monasteries. These religious leaders have been executed and replaced with new leaders, who hold a far more favourable opinion of Qi Xieyuan, with some even declaring Qi the true Master of the Yiguandao."
#lep.26.a: "They won't be a problem anymore."

lep.27.t: "Talks with Du Yuesheng"
lep.27.d: "After weeks of arrangements, Du Yuesheng, a main leader of the criminal gang in Shanghai, the Green Gang, recently met with Qi Xieyuan and a few other high level officers. Talks went on for hours, in a quiet hall in a small street in Wuxi. Only minimal guards were present, and most high level officials didn't even know of the meeting. At the end of the talks, the result is a plan they unofficially titled \"The Du Nanjing Scheme\". Trhough this plan, Du will use his high level and shady business connections to funnel more capital through Nanjing, and will help keep Qi supplied with weapons through backroom dealings. To pay for this, Nanjing will pay Du directly, with the agreement that 40% of this money will be used in pushing pro-Chinese business in the Legation Cities. Hands were shaken, witnesses were dealt with, and payments were made."
lep.27.a: "A profitable arrangement."

lep.28.t: "Influence from Nanjing"
lep.28.d: "We have began to notice that multiple major businessmen, most of whom have links to the Green Gang, have began favouring investments in Nanjing. It is quite clear that these businesses are being bribed to favour Nanjing. At the same time, many Chinese businesses have made better than expected profits, showing possible sneaky investments from Nanjing itself."
lep.28.a: "Interesting."

lep.29.t: "Green Gang Develop in Nanjing"
lep.29.d: "The Green Gang has always remained an organisation primarily based in Shanghai. Though they have a few dealings in the other Legations, Shanghai is the main hub of the gang. However, with the recent agreements made between Du Yuesheng and Qi Xieyuan, the Green Gang has began to develop in Nanjing. Though the Nanjing police would normally step in to try to curb illegal gang growth, it seems the Nanjing police commissioner has stopped this from occuring, stating the polce should focus on beating \"enemies of the state\". Many assume that he was payed off by the Green Gang. However, the truth of the matter is that the Green Gang themselves never bribed the police commissioner. Perhaps the fact that Qi recently had the police commissioner replaced with his personal choice might have some relevance..."
lep.29.a: "Welcome to Nanjing!"

lep.30.t: "Anti-Qi activist groups grows in popularity in Nanjing"
lep.30.d: "In Nanjing, tensions are growing once more. Due to the rise of multiple anti-Qi activist groups, violence is beginning to erupt once more, with police clashing with anti-Qi protestors. Qi Xieyuan has made no public comment on the rise of violence in Nanjing, though there are rumours he has plans to deal with it properly."
lep.30.a: "This violence must end."

lep.31.t: "Anti-Qi activist leaders found dead in Nanjing!"
lep.31.d: "13 high level members of the anti-Qi groups in Nanjing were found dead today in a warehouse. 5 were shot, 6 stabbed and the other two were beaten to death with blunt objects. Later on that day, another 2 bodies were found dumped on the street in the slums of Nanjing. These other deaths have been identified as more high level anti-Qi activists. They were also beaten to death, and rope marks on their hands and the extent of the beating implies that they were tortured before death. 8 men were arrested in suspicion of committing the crimes, all members of the Green Gang in Nanjing. However, they only sat in a cell for 5 hours, as Qi quickly informed the Nanjing police commissioner that the prisoners should be released immediately, as they are not connected to the murders at all. Qi himself announced that he would form a team to investigate these deaths, however, progress on this is very unlikely. With these activists' deaths, the anti-Qi protests in Nanjing have dispursed, and the city is safe once again."
lep.31.a: "Perfect."

lep.32.t: "Business Investments from the Legations"
lep.32.d: "After working out some deals with Du Yuesheng months ago, and not seeing any benefit of our money, has had some in our administration worried that we may have been scammed. However, recently the amount of investments from Legations businessmen in Nanjing has increased massively, opening new factories and boosting production."
lep.32.a: "Cheers Du!"

lep.41.t: "Soldiers Ambushed"
lep.41.d: "While on a regular patrol today, a group of soldiers were ambushed by a band of Kuomintang guerillas near [getlepattacklocationkmt], who quickly overpowered them and killed them. Further war parties have been sent out to track them down, with little success."
lep.41.a: "Damn"

lep.42.t: "Train Bombed in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
lep.42.d: "While stopping to load more supplies onto a train in [getlepattacklocationkmt], multiple KMT agents snuck up to the train, and placed multiple bombs beneath it. When they went off, they completely destroyed the train, all the supplies, and the railway it was on. These terrorists have still not been tracked down, most likely having taken refuge in some of the peasants' houses."
lep.42.a: "When will it end?"

lep.43.t: "Officers Assassinated in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
lep.43.d: "Tensions remain high in the South, as we are forced to send more and more troops and military police over to keep the region secure. During some training of new military police in [getlepattacklocationkmt], multiple Kuomintang agents infiltrated the barracks and shot multiple officers before being killed by the training troops. Following the death of those agents, multiple small bombs went off around the barracks, injuring three and costing lots to repair."
lep.43.a: "Damn them"

lep.44.t: "Factory Bombed in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
lep.44.d: "Even though the factory in [getlepattacklocationkmt] was thought to be secure, it still fell victim to Kuomintang agents. Just around midnight, suddenly explosions echoed throughout the area, as a bomb were set off in the industrial district, damaging a factory. This is sure to be bad for business."
lep.44.a: "Damn them"

lep.45.t: "Gunfight in [getlepattacklocationcitykmt]"
lep.45.d: "Since the defeat of Chairman Wang Jingwei, tensions have remained high in [getlepattacklocationcitykmt]. The military presence and Kuomintang sympathies have remained very high. It was bound to boil over eventually, as it has today. A man, dressed as a regular peasant, was walking past a group of soldiers, when suddenly he drew a pistol and began to shoot at them. Though that man was killed quickly by the troops, it was in fact a distraction, as while the man was being killed, a large group of Kuomintang troops charged at the soldiers from the other side, and shot them all. As the day went on, more loyal soldiers joined the fighting, but were countered by more Kuomintang attacks. Dozens, maybe hundreds were killed, but thankfully, by the evening, the fighting had dwindled, and order was secured."
lep.45.a: "I'm sure it won't be the last"

lep.46.t: "Heavy Factory Bombing in [getlepattacklocationkmt]"
lep.46.d: "Though the KMT have been defeated on the field, their terror campaign rages on. Today, multiple bombs were set off in [getlepattacklocationkmt], centred around the main industrial complexes. Though there were no casualties, the factory has been very badly damaged, and will be unable to work for a while. From what the Kuomintang have said, we should probably get used to events like this, until we have rooted them out for good."
lep.46.a: "Damn them"

lep.47.t: "Battle in [getlepattacklocationcitykmt]"
lep.47.d: "[getlepattacklocationcitykmt], still a hotbed of Kuomintang activities, has faced a massive confrontation by the KMT. Around 400 Kuomintang troops went into the main square of the city, killed any police and soldiers in it, and quickly entrenched themselves with hastily put together fortifications. It took multiple pushes from hundreds of our own troops to be able to get back into the square and clear it of their guerillas, who quickly retreated back into the back streets, eventually harboured in the homes of many of the peasants living there. However, the officer leading the attack decided that these KMT must be rooted out of [getlepattacklocationcitykmt], and so sent out around 200 soldiers on a killing spree throughout the city. Hundreds of civilians were lined up and shot, and the houses of many were burned to the ground. When Qi heard of what some are calling the [getlepattacklocationcitykmt] Massacre, he had the officer arrested, but that was too little, too late."
lep.47.a: "The Quanzhou Massacre was the KMT's fault"

lep.48.t: "Mass Railway Bombings in the South"
lep.48.d: "Early today, multiple bombs were set off on a railway across the south of our territory. This was a very well organised attack, due to the amount of bombs spread out across multiple provinces. The attack has crippled the railway and will be felt throughout, greatly hurting our abilities to move troops and deal with the KMT, not to mention repair the damage. This is a disaster."
lep.48.a: "They must be dealt with"

lep.49.t: "Multiple Factory Bombings"
lep.49.d: "In the very early morning, multiple factories were bombed across the south in our country. The attacks were obviously coordinated closely and can have only come from the KMT. However, this time, there were already many workers present and dozens have been killed. This has been among the most brutal attacks the KMT have perpetrated."
lep.49.a: "This must end immediately"

lep.50.t: "KMT Headquarters Encirclement"
lep.50.d: "Months of tracking KMT activities, months of frustrating their efforts and months of planning have finally paid off. The new headquarters of the few terrorists that remained after Wang Jingwei's defeat has been located and completely razed to the ground. Now that we have worked against them for so long, their resources are completely exhausted and we can finally call the movement of the Left KMT destroyed. Their traitorous rebellion is no more."
lep.50.a: "Finally"

lep.51.t: "Opium Storage Warehouse in Xuzhou Destroyed"
lep.51.d: "Yiguandao followers, who are weirdly upset over opium use in Shandong and Jiangsu, have attacked and destroyed an illegal opium storage warehouse in Xuzhou. While having less opium isn't necessarily bad, they also killed everyone nearby. When soldiers arrived, they then continued to resist. We cannot let the Yiguandao religion continue to exist, as its followers cause too much chaos."
lep.51.a: "Barbarians"

lep.52.t: "Assault on Merchant Caravan in the North"
lep.52.d: "Yiguandao adherents have robbed a merchant caravan and killed dozens that were travelling along with the caravan train. Again, this shows the kind of violence and brutality adherents of that crazy religion are capable of. We must root out the strange delusions of these people or things will get worse."
lep.52.a: "Disgusting"

lep.53.t: "Soldiers attacked in Northern Village"
lep.53.d: "Soldiers on patrol in a northern village were attacked out of nowhere by a large band of dozens of homeless Yiguandao followers. These people, whose association with their religion has caused them to already lose everything, reverted to robbing and looting, which had caused the village to institute a patrol. But still the village wasn't safe, as nearly twenty have now been killed."
lep.53.a: "Those rats"

lep.54.t: "Town Invaded by Yiguandao Adherents"
lep.54.d: "Again the Yiguandao have caused massive chaos by invading and occupying an entire town. After the Yiguandao expelled all the former owners, soldiers were sent out to investigate, only for them to see the entire town barricaded. A large amount of soldiers were required to drive away the Yiguandao adherents before the village people could return home. Hundreds of Yiguandao were killed, and many soldiers too. Things are getting too crazy."
lep.54.a: "That is bad"

lep.55.t: "Yiguandao Fanatics Take Over Military Barracks"
lep.55.d: "In response to recent military actions against the Yiguandao, they have no chosen to attack and take over a military complex at the edge of a city in Jiangsu. Hundreds swarmed the barracks, killing many soldiers, after which barricaded themselves within. Soon, the city fell into chaos as looting became widespread. There are even reports of rapes. The military action required to take back the barracks was brutal, leaving nearly a hundred dead."
lep.55.a: "Things are getting worse"

lep.56.t: "Railway Occupied in Jiangsu"
lep.56.d: "The Yiguandao, again showing their anger at their treatment, have barricaded and occupied an entire railway, even destroying it at some parts. The action required to take it back left many dead. While before they mostly left the infrastructure alone, they have now begun to also attack the lifeblood of our country, on which much of our economy rests. The Yiguandao have proven to be a major threat."
lep.56.a: "Our railroads must be protected"

lep.57.t: "Massacre of Yiguandao Followers"
lep.57.d: "A stand-off between Yiguandao adherents and soldiers in a Yiguandao camp has escalated into a massacre. After the religious fanatics refused to leave, which they had been ordered by the soldiers as they were harassing nearby city folk, the soldiers began doing this by force. This lead to a counter-attack, which made the officer in charger decide to begin shooting. However, the shooting didn't stop until their was not a single Yiguandao follower left. Nearly a thousand are dead. While Qi Xieyuan has fired the officer for this excessive use of force, Yiguandao unrest is likely to only get worse."
lep.57.a: "This doesn't look good"

lep.58.t: "End of the Yiguandao"
lep.58.d: "The Yiguandao threat can finally said to be neutralized as the last sect was destroyed, its members thrown into jail. It took a lot of policies and military action, but now the northern countryside can finally be declared safe again. The damage that the rotten religion of the Yiguandao did to our country will long live in infamy. But now they are gone and we won't let them come back."
lep.58.a: "Finally peace"

lep.59.t: "Qi Meets with Jiangzhe Caifa"
lep.59.d: "Compared to the shady low down meeting with Du Yuesheng, Qi's meeting with the bankers of the Jiangzhe Caifa was a breath of fresh air. Meeting in one of the bankers' mansions in Shanghai, Qi and a few of his officers were treated to delicious food served by the bankers' maids and servants. Armed mercenaries stood guard around the building while the bankers arrived. Preliminary discussions were nice and calm, however the attitude changed when the group got to business.\n\nLeague-Marshal Qi made his stance clear: for the Jiangzhe Caifa to continue to do as much business as they do throughout the League, they must offer Nanjing resources and loans to be used \"to protect their business interests for them\". Of course, the bankers did not react well to this, claiming that they could protect their own financial institutions, and anyway, their profits from the League were minor compared to the profits they've found in the Legation Cities. Qi was ready for this line though, as he stated clearly that should they not give these resources to Nanjing \"the Green Gang will make sure you never do business in Shanghai ever again\". Several of the men were shocked at what they heard. Perhaps Qi had made a mistake. It was an open fact that many of these bankers were also paying off the Green Gang, and most likely have better relations with their leaders than Qi, who's only met Du Yuesheng once.\n\nAs the bankers began to discuss the resources to be sent to Nanjing, though, a wave of relief flowed through Qi. After another couple of hours of discussion it was decided, and the loans and resources will start coming in soon."
lep.59.a: "What a fine businessman Qi is."

lep.60.t: "Supplies from the Jiangzhe Caifa"
lep.60.d: "Finally, we have received a large shipment of money and weapons, sent from the Jiangzhe Caifa in Shanghai."
lep.60.a: "Wonderful."

lep.100.t: "Nanjing Lives On"
lep.100.d: "After many months of fighting, we have finally been able to crush the enemies that oppose us. Traitors, Kuomintang and Yiguandao, all have been crushed by the iron fist of Qi Xieyuan. However, his leadership is still not secure. Though the Kuomintang have been beaten in the field, reports have came back stating they will continue to fight a guerrilla war against us. The Yiguandao seem to have issued a similar statement. Also, as proven by Chen's betrayal, even those who claim to be loyal to us may be waiting to betray us. We must remain diligent."
lep.100.a: "Ah, victory."

lep.102.t: "The Governor Question"
lep.102.d: "League-Marshal Qi never trusted Chen Taioyuan. He was anti-German, refusing to see the benefit from our European friends, and his loyalty shifted many times, most between Sun Chuanfang and the Fengtian Clique in Manchuria. It was no surprise, then, when Chen rose up against the League, and brought it to the edge of ruin. It is clear that, due to his anti-German policies, his province of Anhui is in severe need of investment and development. Therefore, the question of who shall become the next governor of Anhui is paramount.\n\nReally, there are two main options. The first is Xie Hongxun, a relatively minor military officer and bureaucrat in Nanjing. However, his main appeal as governor is the relatively close relationship he had to Sun Chuanfang. Many still see Qi as a usurper, so placing a Sun loyalist to such a high level position would be a popular move, and he is weak enough that he will be easy to control.\n\nHowever, there is a second option. With the problem all starting from Anhui's breakaway, perhaps it is time to centralise the League slightly more. League-Marshal Qi Xieyuan is always an option, so that Anhui can be kept on a closer leash to Nanjing, though it might not be that popular with the population at large."
lep.102.a: "Xie Hongxun will do."
lep.102.b: "Qi extends his power."

lep.111.t: "Return of Alexander von Falkenhausen"
lep.111.d: "After working in Nanjing for the regime of Qi Xieyuan, Alexander von Falkenhausen has returned to work with us."
lep.111.a: "Excellent."

lep.112.t: "Support our Chinese friends?"
lep.112.d: "For many years we have greatly profited from the situation in China. Though we worked with the Qing, most German deals were done through their more receptive southern counterpart: Sun Chuanfang's League of Eight Provinces. However, the situation in the League is clearly unstable, and to make matters worse Sun himself has been shot. Thankfully, his replacement in Nanjing, Qi Xieyuan, is likely to become even more reliant on us than Sun was. The admiralty is recommending that we send him equipment immediately, to prop him up amidst what appears to be a rapidly worsening crisis in eastern China."
lep.112.a: "Send them guns."
lep.112.b: "We have better things to be doing."

lep.113.t: "Arrival of German Weapons"
lep.113.d: "Recently, we have received a shipment of infantry equipment in Nanjing, sent straight from our German friends in Singapore. No doubt they understand we must keep the peace across the League, for the prosperity of both of us."
lep.113.a: "Excellent."

lep.114.t: "New Governor for Zhejiang"
lep.114.d: "With both Shangguan Yunxiang and Chen Yi both no longer governors of Zhejiang, a new governor is needed to replace them. There are three main candidates:\n\nFirst is Zhou Fengqi, garrison commander in Nanjing and Sun Chuanfang loyalist. Though he is not truly loyal to our regime, perhaps such a promotion might convince him to stay in line.\n\nSecond is Zhang Qingxu, a low level bureaucrat originally from Beijing, who joined Sun's government only a few months before his assassination. Though he is relatively minor, his organisational skill is notable, and the skills he got from working in Beijing will help him develop the province.\n\nThird is Xia Chao, a minor commander with no real notable victories to his name. Really, he has one main positive, that being his loyalty to League-Marshal Qi. Having worked under Qi for years, he might be the best choice if we want to keep Zhejiang closely linked to Nanjing."
lep.114.a: "Zhou Fengqi."
lep.114.b: "Zhang Qingxu."
lep.114.c: "Xia Chao."

lep.115.t: "Governor for Fujian"
lep.115.d: "Throughout the League War, Fujian was ruled by Zhou Yinren. Zhou, a competent general, over the years has brought a level of control to Fujian that was not achieved by governors of previous decades. However, Zhou has one main negative, that being his extreme loyalty to the previous League-Marshal Sun Chuangfang. Having been classmates many years ago, their relationship was always a close one. It was this friendship that got Zhou to his position, not any sign of impressive skill or ability. Though Fujian has developed decently under Zhou, it still remains the most impoverished province in the League. We must make the choice of whether to keep Zhou, or whether to put in someone new.\n\nThe other option for governor of Fujian is Kong Zhaotong, a relatively minor military leader from Fujian. However, Kong's main appeal is his close relationship to Qi Xieyuan, wiht Kong acting as one of Qi's commanders directly in Fujian. Kong showed decent ability while fighting the Kuomintang, and his anti-socialst credentials are up to standard. His close links to Qi means he must be far more competent than the Sun loyalist Zhou. However, perhaps experience is better than loyalty..."
lep.115.a: "Zhou Yinren will remain governor."
lep.115.b: "Governor Kong has a nice ring to it."

lep.116.t: "Governor for Jiangxi"
lep.116.d: "With Governor Deng Ruzhou dying during the fighting of the League War, we are left with no choice but to replace him. For his replacement, there is only one option. Fang Benren, after graduating from Beijing Military Acadenmy, worked in the Guangdong army, eventually as its commander-in-chief, then eventually as a high level commander and general in the League army. Having had strong links to Sun Chuangfang, and a suspicion of Northern Zhili leader Wu Peifu, he has gained lots of influence in League politics. Not appointing him to this position would be very dangerous for our regime, so he is the only choice."
lep.116.a: "We pray for Governor Fang's success."

lep.117.t: "Governor for Jiangxi"
lep.117.d: "Jiangxi, a poor, underdeveloped province of the League, has been under the leadership of Deng Ruzhou for many years. Under him, Jiangxi has become a hotbed for German investments, with much of the province being dependent on German cash. Deng has got comfortable in his position, perhaps too comfortable. Importantly, another man wishes to become Jiangxi's governor. Fang Benren, after graduating from Beijing Military Acadenmy, worked in the Guangdong army, eventually as its commander-in-chief, then eventually as a high level commander and general in the League army. Having had strong links to Sun Chuangfang, and a suspicion of Northern Zhili leader Wu Peifu, he has gained lots of influence in League politics. Not appointing him to this position would be very dangerous for our regime, even though Deng has held it for years."
lep.117.a: "We pray for Governor Fang's success."

lep.200.t: "Nanking-Kommission Requests we Intervene in the Fengtian-Qing War"
lep.200.d: "While we were grateful for Wu Peifu's support during the League Collapse war, we have avoided the current conflict engulfing the north in favor of focusing on developing our territory. Now, however, the Nanking-Kommission has expressed 'severe dismay' at our lack of support for the conflict and urged us to intervene. To sweeten the deal they have promised to supply some German weapons and capital. While we can refuse, accepting seems like the far better choice."
lep.200.a: "Of course! To war!"
lep.200.b: "No."

lep.201.t: "Wu Peifu Requests we Intervene in the Fengtian-Qing War!"
lep.201.d: "Historical ties of animosity between the Northern and Southern Zhili Cliques have prevented us from working much together. That changed, however, this morning, when a telegram from Marshal Wu was delivered to Marshal Qi requesting he join the war against the Fengtian and their Japanese backers. Should we put aside our differences for the good of China?"
lep.201.a: "Of course! Down with the Japanese!"
lep.201.b: "No."

lep.203.a: "We have only a short time to prepare."

lep.204.t: "The [FROM.GetName] calls for Aid!"
lep.204.d: "News has come by telephone straight from [FROM.Capital.GetName], our allies in the [FROM.GetName] are about to be attacked by [LEP.GetName]! Already their forces are mobilizing, but they cannot confront this foe alone."
lep.204.a: "We must prepare!"

lep.205.d_ger: "According to our spies in [LEP.Capital.GetName], [LEP.GetLeader] and his senior command staff are currently considering opening a new front in our war against [QIE.GetName]. Reportedly the German Nanking-Kommission is footing the bill for a major weapons shipment in preparation, but [LEP.GetLeader]'s tenuous relationship with the Central Government is well known.\n\nWhatever decision is made in [LEP.Capital.GetName], we must be ready."
lep.205.d_noger: "According to our spies in [LEP.Capital.GetName], [LEP.GetLeader] and his senior command staff are currently considering opening a new front in our war against [QIE.GetName]. Should the [QIE.GetName] fall the [LEP.GetName] is certain to be next, but [LEP.GetLeader]'s tenuous relationship with the Central Government is well known.\n\nWhatever decision is made in [LEP.Capital.GetName], we must be ready."

lepcollapse.1.t: "Sun Chuanfang meets with Governors"
lepcollapse.1.d: "League-Marshal Sun Chuanfang met today with the governors of the Five Eastern Provinces who, the public has been told, discussed matters of regular governance and administration. \"The rice crop in Jiangxi has been poorer than expected this year\", said Governor Deng Ruzuo, \"it's important that taxes are adjusted appropriately to compensate.\"\n\nThe absence of officials from Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan, as well as the presence of purely military figures like General Qi Xieyuan, has led some to believe that the meeting actually concerned more serious matters of state security."
lepcollapse.1.a: "Interesting"

lepcollapse.2.t: "The Zhegan Railway"
lepcollapse.2.d: "Today marks the long-planned opening of the Zhegan Railway, the latest extension to which finally connects Shanghai to Nanchang, a city deep in Jiangxi Province. The opening is noteworthy for a few reasons, first among them the prominent involvement of Chinese engineers in the construction despite its significant funding by the Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung, also known as the AOG, which has turned the work into something of a cause celebre.\n\nThose less optimistic have been quick to point out the AOG's newfound access to rich mineral deposits, as well as Jingdezhen Porcelain, which has been able to fetch high prices in Berlin.\n\nDespite concerns, a threatened attack upon the opening ceremony by Kuomintang agents did not take place."
lepcollapse.2.a: "Railways bring prosperity!"

lepcollapse.3.t: "An Unexpected Announcement"
lepcollapse.3.d: "Late this morning, to the surprise of many, the AOG publicly announced its plans to purchase and consolidate a number of eastern railways on behalf of the Schantung-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, one of its component concerns. Among them is the new Zhegan Railway.\n\nThe AOG already possesses controlling shares in a number of lines across Eastern China, several of which it directly financed, but this dashes the hopes of those who believed the new railway might represent a more equal future for Germans and Chinese. While Chinese management will be permitted to remain, they will now answer to a German directory board. Though scarcely admitted to the public, few authorities in the League seem to have been forewarned of this development, and the police response to protests has been slower than normal."
lepcollapse.3.a: "An unpleasant surprise..."

lepcollapse.4.t: "Unrest Spreads"
lepcollapse.4.d: "Unsurprisingly, the consolidation of the Central China Railway under AOG management has met with widespread criticism. Intellectuals have condemned the move in domestic papers, followed by prominent Anglo-American publications out of Shanghai, and echoed by Syndicalist party periodicals found on factory floors. More troubling however, the news has spread rapidly by word of mouth, and has grown all the more outrageous and fantastical in the process.\n\nTales now describe extensive webs of conspiracy, disappearances of outspoken individuals, and the supposed transfer of millions of Yuan into the League-Marshal's own pockets. The publics reaction has been predictably furious, and protests have already spread from Zhejiang and Jiangxi to the major coastal cities, including the foreign settlements."
lepcollapse.4.a: "Do peasants have nothing better to do?"

lepcollapse.5.t: "Attacks on Foreigners"
lepcollapse.5.d: "Beginning with assaults on prominent German citizens, and having grown to become virtually indiscriminate, attacks on foreigners by emboldened "patriotic" citizens are spreading like wildfire. The German consulate in Nanjing has advised the Kaiser's subjects to arm themselves, and travel only when necessary. The consulates of most other nationalities may soon follow suit.\n\nThe impact of these attacks on business and investment remains to be seen, but recent history suggests the Shanghai Stock Exchange will not remain unaffected."
lepcollapse.5.a: "Troubling"

lepcollapse.6.t: "Boycotts and Beijing"
lepcollapse.6.d: "Talk of a boycott on German goods has accompanied growing protests throughout Eastern China, provoked by an assortment of Kuomintang agents, religious cultists, and nationalist ideologues. More disturbingly, some local garrisons have stepped back and allowed the unrest to grow, unwilling to risk being labelled 'Hanjian' or 'race traitors'. In order to ward off intervention from Beijing, advisers from the Nanking-Kommission have suggested that League-Marshal Sun publicly declare that the situation is under control.\n\nElements of several divisions based in Nanjing stand ready to be deployed to cities along the lower Yangtze, where protests are largest, and provincial garrisons could be given the green light to take whatever action they deem necessary to quell the open dissent."
lepcollapse.6.a: "Use maximum force"
lepcollapse.6.b: "Punish only the violent"

lepcollapse.7.t: "Railway Bombings"
lepcollapse.7.d: "Explosions have rocked several stations and rail lines slated to become part of the Central China Railway, with one bomb shredding a train car in a crowded station at Hangzhou, leaving dozens killed and injured. The deaths and delays have brought transportation to a standstill in many areas, and has slowed the deployment of additional forces to quell the growing unrest.\n\nBlame for the attacks has been levelled against various targets, from bandits, to the KMT, to Japanese agents. Some especially conspiracy-minded individuals have suggested German involvement, who they suggest are targeting their own possessions to set the stage for an intervention."
lepcollapse.7.a: "Terrorism!"

lepcollapse.8.t: "Reports from North and South"
lepcollapse.8.d: "Troubling reports have reached Nanjing from both Xuzhou and Quanzhou.\n\nIn the Jiangfu Insurgent Zone, KMT guerillas have staged a series of increasingly bold raids, striking around the inland cities of Yongding and Longyan. Governor Zhou Yinren has long struggled to assert control over his mountainous province, with control often limited to the coast and the larger inland cities, and now his grasp grows all the more tenuous.\n\nMeanwhile in Jiangsu, governor Zheng Junyan reports increased agitation by Yiguandao adherents, spreading over the border from Shandong. These religious fanatics have been a point of long-standing frustration for the Governor, but their involvement may well be encouraging the rising unrest."
lepcollapse.8.a: "Temporary setbacks..."

lepcollapse.9.t: "A Telegram from Beijing"
lepcollapse.9.d: "A telegram has been received from Beijing, apparently sent at the direction of Imperial Commissioner Wu Peifu, who sits as Qing Army Minister and the undisputed head of the nation's central military apparatus. The message inquires about the current chaotic state of affairs, clearly worded with the intent to force League-Marshal Sun to admit some weakness or hardship.\n\nThe Central Government, under Wu's direction, has repeatedly attempted to extend its direct authority south, but so far such efforts have been in vain. Our response must be careful and measured, demonstrating that we need no Central Government assistance to disperse these insurrectionists."
lepcollapse.9.a: "Everything is under control"

lepcollapse.10.t: "The Wuhu Incident"
lepcollapse.10.d: "This afternoon protests in the city of Wuhu, bolstered by striking workers from nearby German-owned factories, quickly escaped police control. The garrison, itself reinforced by a section of German-trained troops from Nanjing, attempted to restore order, but in the confused melee someone started shooting. Within a matter of minutes police, the garrison, and their reinforcing troops had begun firing on the crowd and each other. Over two hundred are already confirmed dead, with four times as many likely wounded, and the resultant outrage has already sparked protests in surrounding areas.\n\nThe situation is made all the worse by the presence of a small foreign settlement within the city. Many are already claiming that lethal force was only used in order to protect these foreigners, and the killings will most likely feature in international newspapers by tomorrow morning."
lepcollapse.10.a: "Could things get any worse?"

lepcollapse.11.t: "Anqing Refuses Further Cooperation"
lepcollapse.11.d: "Citing the recent incident at Wuhu, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan has issued an ultimatum calling for the withdrawal of all non-provincial forces from Anhui, as well as the immediate hand-over of those officers responsible. Though Chen assures the league that his own soldiers will continue to quell the spreading unrest and disorder, he refuses further cooperation with League authorities and denounces the creation of the Central China Railway, which he blames for \"pushing patriotic citizens to the edge of despair\".\n\nUnder normal circumstances this behavior would be unacceptable, but Chen's stance has already proven popular and decisive action could serve to further divide the now fragile League."

#Black Monday 2.3.36 February 3rd 1936

lepcollapse.12.t: "Black Monday reaches the East"
lepcollapse.12.d: "Although it began a world away, Black Monday's fallout has already reached China. The Shanghai Exchange plummeted before closing at numbers unseen since the financial tumult of 1925, and local institutions are already doing what they can to mitigate the damage. Fortunately, the average citizen is unlikely to feel any immediate impact, but the AOG, already staggering under an extensive retaliatory boycott, faces dire financial circumstances.\n\nIts clerks have already issued notice that it may be unable to pay the usual rents for its various concessions, and that the final payment promised for the Zhegan Railway has been \"indefinitely postponed\". Without this planned revenue, we will be forced to enact major budget cuts."
lepcollapse.12.a: "How will we pay the troops?"

lepcollapse.13.t: "Dissension in the Ranks"
lepcollapse.13.d: "Word of suspended pay has already spread as far as the League's junior officers, and the reaction has been predictably negative. For some this will mean an end to lifestyles of vice and extravagance, at least for the time-being, but for many a common soldier it's the difference between life and starvation.\n\nThe officers' grumbling is made all the worse by a small but vocal clique of officers sympathetic to Chen Tiaoyuan's cause, arguing that the League should never have become so dependent on German 'handouts'. In the barracks and in the streets, soldiers are being riled up by Yiguandao adherents, seeking converts and preaching against foreign 'wickedness', while the Kuomintang and other leftist groups hide in the shadows, disseminating propaganda and denouncing 'imperialist collaboration'. Nothing has yet come of these activities, but what was once routine unrest is now threatening undermine the very foundations of the League."
lepcollapse.13.a: "Rebellion will be punished!"

lepcollapse.14.t: "A Heinous Crime"
lepcollapse.14.d: "Sun Chuanfang lies mortally wounded, shot from behind by an assassin disguised as a serving-woman. His brave bodyguards were able to quickly overpower and imprison the woman, but rumors have already begun to spread and swirl.\n\nThe incapacitation of the League's only widely recognized leader is an unprecedented disaster, and unless he recovers soon a successor is unlikely to be chosen without considerable bloodshed. Without effective leadership and with political fragmentation all but a certainty, the ongoing crisis will surely spin out of control.\n\nThe League's fate lies in the balance."
lepcollapse.14.a: "Who could be responsible?"

lepcollapse.15.t: "Spreading Insubordination"
lepcollapse.15.d: "Telegrams have been flooding in all morning, accompanied by the din of ringing telephones throughout the League-Marshal's Palace, together describing a rapidly deteriorating situation across much of the League. With no promise of pay, soldiers in Xuzhou, Nanchang, Quanzhou, and several other cities are either refusing to act or outright joining the spreading violence and looting, while police and garrisons in Hangzhou and Wuxi have gone on strike. Riots there and elsewhere are gradually escaping all semblance of control, made all the worse by Sun Chuanfang's incapacity.\n\nTroublingly, telegraph lines south of Fujian appear to have been cut, leaving us entirely in the dark as to the likely worsening situation in Guangzhou and Guangxi, while Nanjing itself is now practically in the throes of violent revolution."
lepcollapse.15.a: "Marshal Sun must wake soon..."

lepcollapse.16.t: "Riots reach the Marshal's Palace"
lepcollapse.16.d: "The Nanjing Police have been unable to contain one of many riots spreading across the capital, as officers defect or sit idle, and onlookers join the chaos; looting and burning homes, businesses, and now government offices. The hasty arrival of military units under the command of general Qi Xieyuan, already deployed nearby, seems enough to protect the Marshal's Palace, but the roar of flames and the burgeoning crowds are audible even within the chamber where Sun Chuanfang lies, deep in a coma.\n\nLike rats fleeing from a sinking ship, officials have been observed scurrying away into back streets and alleyways, arms burdened by silver coins, papers, and perhaps government secrets."

The Jiangfu Insurgent Zone was already known to be a danger, but with the chaos now gripping the League there is every possibility that they will cut a path to the coast, opening the way for aid from their Syndicalist allies.\n\nAt present governor Zhou Yinren is known to have several divisions in and around Quanzhou, but this is unlikely to be enough to stem the tide."

lepcollapse.19.d: "Following a closed meeting lasting nearly four hours, Qi Xieyuan has emerged to declare himself acting League-Marshal, and promises to restore order to the fractured League. Already his forces have begun asserting control over Nanjing's arsenal, military headquarters, and major thoroughfares, broadcasting the news by megaphone and clearing the streets with enfilades of rifle fire. Cities along much of the Lower Yangtze have already begun declaring for Qi, but communications with several provinces have broken down.

The General denounced the League's 'disregard for the rights and needs of the people' and singled out the Acting League-Marshal for special criticism, but stopped short of outright declaring hostilities. With Anhui Province already openly subordinate, this turn of events is disastrous, and in most cases would merit a response.\n\nThe news was received by way of telegraph from Hong Kong, which also reported the public humiliation and execution of numerous League officials in Huizhou, but exact details remain scarce."

lepaog.4.d: "Large amounts of the Central China Railway were damaged during the League collapse, whether by protestors or defectors. With the dust settled, we should request AOG support to rebuild this railway lines, seeing as they're the reason we ended up in this catastrophe in the first place."
lepaog.4.a: "Request funds for repairs."
lepaog.4.b: "They can repair it themselves."

lepaog.5.t: "Unpaid Concession Leases"
lepaog.5.d: "While black Monday was a disaster for everyone, especially the AOG, all charity has to end sometime. With the continue failure of the Germans to pay concession fees, it is looking like we will have to take up with the AOG directly."
lepaog.5.a: "Let it be."
lepaog.5.b: "Demand a full repayment."

lepaog.6.t: "Control of the Concession Factories"
lepaog.6.d: "Due to AOG retraction after Black Monday, we were able to fill in the vacuum left and gain a modicum of control over the concession industries. While this situation is not likely to last long, it is appreciated, none the less."
lepaog.6.a: "They seem to be managing well."
lepaog.6.b: ""

lepaog.7.t: "German Investment Council"
lepaog.7.d: "With the interior now officially up for grabs, the AOG has decided to head off the inevitable chaos of this veritable gold rush and establish an investment council to regulate German businesses in the region. While this is undoubtedly a boon, it is somewhat unfortunate that it is the Germans, and not us, who are in direct control."
lepaog.7.a: "Wonderful."
lepaog.7.b: "Their assistance is not needed."

lepaog.8.t: "German Reconstruction Imports"
lepaog.8.d: "The loss of our southern territories has caused somewhat of a resource disaster in our country, with many traditional internal industries now cut off from us. To allievate this, the AOG has suggested a relaxation of regulations on German imports into the country, only until our internal economy has righted itself, of course."
lepaog.8.a: "We can afford to relax our regulations."
lepaog.8.b: "No deal."

lepaog.9.t: "Battling Inflation"
lepaog.9.d: "The League Yuan has suffered both from Black Monday and the League collapse. To prevent a complete financial meltdown, the AOG has pledged the support of the DAB in backing up the Yuan, in return for various financial concessions."
lepaog.9.a: "How generous of them."
lepaog.9.b: "We can manage on our own."

lepaog.10.t: "DAB Loans: Begin"
lepaog.10.d: "The Deutsch-Asiatische Bank is the largest surviving financial institution in the region, and under the thumb of the AOG. Economically speaking, their support would be enough to reinvent the League's economy. But the political cost might very well ruin us regardless."
lepaog.10.a: "We can trust the banks, right?"

lepaog.11.t: "DAB Loans: Size"
lepaog.11.d: "The first order of business is deciding on the extent of the loans we are taking out. While a larger loan may be more cost-effective, we may only need a small financial investment to reinvigorate our economy. "
lepaog.11.a: "Go big or go home."
lepaog.11.b: "A reasonably sized loan is needed."
lepaog.11.c: "We only need a small financial boost."

lepaog.12.t: "DAB Loans: Destination"
lepaog.12.d: "Not all of our industry is suffering to the same extent. To maximise the effect of the loans, we need to decide what industry should benefit from the DAB loans."
lepaog.12.a: "Prioritize Production"
lepaog.12.b: "Prioritize Construction"
lepaog.12.c: "Prioritize Military Industry"

lepaog.13.t: "AOG Demands Early Repayment!"
lepaog.13.d: "As a shocking but perhaps not unexpected surprise, the AOG has requested that we repay our DAB loans early, ostensibly due to increasing financial tensions in the region. While this is both frustrating and a detriment to our economy, there is nothing we can do but agree to the new terms."
lepaog.13.a: "Really?!"

lepaog.14.t: "AOG Banking Expands"
lepaog.14.d: "The German century continues for the AOG, it'd seem, as the DAB has used the aftermath of Black Monday to further expand its financial monopoly in China. While this may be a long-term concern, right now it is a direct benefit to our own economy."
lepaog.14.a: "Good for them."

lepaog.15.t: "DAB Buys out League Banks"
lepaog.15.d: "In a rather awkward turn of events, the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank has begun to buy out failing League banks across the country. While there is nothing we can do to challenge this, it continues to undermine our authority when it comes to our own economy."
lepaog.15.a: "Fine by us."
lepaog.15.b: "We'd prefer that they remain in Chinese hands."

lepaog.16.t: "Opening the Interior: Begin"
lepaog.16.d: "It is time to make German access to the League interior official. While small independent ventures have already made their way to the region, a fullscale German investment still requires our sign off, and the settling of several key logistical and political questions before it can begin in earnest."
lepaog.16.a: "This can't go wrong."

lepaog.17.t: "Opening the Interior: Status of the Chinese"
lepaog.17.d: "The first order of business is the fate of Chinese businesses in the interior. Several key business leaders are requesting assurances of protection in the case that German investments destroying their livelihoods, while others are outright demanding right-of-privilege over german businesses."
lepaog.17.a: "Our own businesses will always take priority."
lepaog.17.b: "We can surely find a balance here."
lepaog.17.c: "They must learn to coexist with the German presence."

lepaog.18.t: "Opening the Interior: Status of the Germans"
lepaog.18.d: "The second question pertains to the status of German citizens in the region. While Germans already possess considerable advantages over other foreign nationals, such as embassy rights and passport expiditing, the Nanking-Kommission has 'suggested' that we formally elevate the status of German citizens, as a show of goodwill to our new trading partners."
lepaog.18.a: "Issue new laws for German citizens."
lepaog.18.b: "Germans and Chinese shall be equal under League laws."
lepaog.18.c: "They shall be treated as privileged guests."

lepaog.19.t: "Opening the Interior: German Arrival"
lepaog.19.d: "With outstanding matters concluded, German entry into the interior has begun in earnest. While the full fruits of this decision may take a while to be felt, we are already receiving a benefit from the modest economic boom happening in our country."
lepaog.19.a: "Let's hope they enjoy their stay."

lepaog.20.t: "Opening the Interior: Business Conflicts!"
lepaog.20.d: "It seems that nothing ever goes off without a hitch. Several Chinese businesses have filed complaints, alleging German exploitation, monopolisation, and financial bullying in regions where German investment has grown thickest. In response the AOG has sent a counter-claim, arguing that Chinese officials and businesses are not sufficiently cooperating and on occasion downright frustrating the actions of German business interests in the region."
lepaog.20.a: "Our Businesses should take priority."
lepaog.20.b: "The Germans should take priority."
lepaog.20.c: "Who's to say?"

lepaog.21.t: "Opening the Interior: Finish"
lepaog.21.d: "With the first rush of investment having finally settled down, our interior has entered a state of new 'normal.' While the full ramifications of our decision will only be felt over the coming decades, we can already see the beginnings of such changes taking route in our economy."
lepaog.21.a: "Glad that's over with."

lepaog.22.t: "Schantung-Eisenbahn Expansion"
lepaog.22.d: "While the Schantung Eisenbahngesellschaft is not directly controlled by the AOG, they are still effectively a German proxy. There is debate amongst our government whether, as such, they should be trusted with complete control of the rails, or whether some level of Chinese control is required."
lepaog.22.a: "We must respect the German buyout."
lepaog.22.b: "We Demand equal ownership!"

lepaog.23.t: "Railroad Payments"
lepaog.23.d: "Railroads aren't cheap. While the work of the SEG has proven quite profitable, it hasn't been delivered gratis. The Nanking-Kommission has politely reminded us that a reasonable repayment is expected, and soon."
lepaog.23.a: "Repay them."
lepaog.23.b: "Repay them with influence."
lepaog.23.c: "What payments?"

lepaog.24.t: "The Schantung-Eisenbahn Expands"
lepaog.24.d: "Following our economic support of the project, the SEG continues to make tracks inwards into the League. While there is a general disquiet about such proceedings, nobody can deny that the Germans are good at making the trains run on time."
lepaog.24.a: "Excellent."

lepaog.25.t: "Rail Taxes?"
lepaog.25.d: "An idea has been floated in the central government about a new rail tax on the general populace to pay for our continued expansion. While unpopular, it may be necessary to find a new temporary source of income to help continue our industrialisation."
lepaog.25.a: "A smart idea."
lepaog.25.b: "Raising taxes pleases no one."

lepaog.26.t: "Germans Ask for Tax Exemption"
lepaog.26.d: "In a display of arrogance, the AOG has request that all German businesses be exempt from our new rail tax. The fact that we raised this tax to pay for their railroads hasn't seemed to register, and they are quite insistent on this demand, what should we do?"
lepaog.26.a: "Fine."
lepaog.26.b: "Yeah, no."

lepaog.27.t: "Eastern Resources Commission: Introduction"
lepaog.27.d: "The Eastern Resources commission, primarily drawn from Chinese business interests and AOG monopolists, have managed to put aside their many differences in the pursuit of a shared goal: profit. While Chinese interests provide the location and manpower for resource extraction, the Germans provide the technical know-how and equipment to proper extract such resources."
lepaog.27.a: "Let's hope they find something worthwhile."

lepaog.28.t: "Status of Germans on the Commission"
lepaog.28.d: "Apparently dissatisfied with the current status quo, the AOG has demmanded a reshuffle of the Eastern Resources Commission, arguing that German interests 'are not adequately' represented by the commission. By this, they presumably mean that they do not have full control of the board, and want to rectify this. While it is a blazen grab for power, without AOG backing, the commission itself is almost functionally useless."
lepaog.28.a: "Allow a German majority."
lepaog.28.b: "Acquiese, but try to curtail their influence."

lepaog.29.t: "AOG Requests Renegotiation of German Rights"
lepaog.29.d: "With the continued success of the Eastern Resources Commission, the AOG has once again called for an elevation of German interests in the region. While German citizens and businesses already receive ample privileges, the AOG has asked that we elevate these rights in perpuity, to 'solidify the successful Sino-German Relationship.'"
lepaog.29.a: "A reasonable request."
lepaog.29.b: "The situation as it stands is fine."

lepaog.30.t: "German Industrial Expansion"
lepaog.30.d: "Just as before, our business with the Germans has proven fabulously profitable. With new resource deposits being opened and their wealth within flowing (mostly) into our collars, we once again have our friends in Tsingtau to thank."
lepaog.30.a: "Business is booming."

lepaog.31.t: "AOG Implements Exclusive Economic Zones"
lepaog.31.d: "Seizing upon their disproportionate influence in our country, the AOG has implemented a policy of economic exclusivity for German Interests, effectively cinching their monopoly on League investment. While mostly a simple acknowledgement of the present reality, it is concerning that the AOG holds such formidable power inside our own government."
lepaog.31.a: "This is for the Good of China."

lepaog.32.t: "AOG Implements Free Trade Policy"
lepaog.32.d: "Once again flexing their political muscle, the AOG has overruled our officials and instituted a free trade policy for German goods. While this might not be too damaging, it is dangerous to our own internal stability that we are so beholden to the AOG's whims."
lepaog.32.a: "This is for the good of China, we swear..."

lepaog.33.t: "German Economic Takeover"
lepaog.33.d: "In a final economic coup-de-tat, the AOG has successfully Germanized our economy. German banks, factories, and shops throng the streets, and the Mark is more used than the Yuan. Our economy is now effectively that of a German client state."
lepaog.33.a: "Oh dear."


lepaog.50.t: "League-Ostasien Relations"
lepaog.50.d: "The Ostasien administration is the chief backer of the AOG in Asia, and AOG interests are heavily tied to theirs. In a show of collaboration, the AOG has asked that we extend formal diplomatic overtures to the administration, to cement our shared economic interests."
lepaog.50.a: "Better friends than enemies."

lepaog.51.t: "AOG Requests Our Support!"
lepaog.51.d: "With Indochina in open revolt, the AOG has requested that we support Ostasien in quelling the rebellion, both to help a friend in a time of need, and to safeguard against a possible syndicalist threat in future years."
lepaog.51.a: "They shall have our full support!"
lepaog.51.b: "Send some equipment their way."
lepaog.51.c: "They're on their own."

lepaog.52.t: "Ostasien Border Agreements"
lepaog.52.d: "With Ostasia and the League once again bordering each other, the AOG has suggested an semi-open border policy between our nations, as a show of goodwill and further economic collaboration."
lepaog.52.a: "There are no borders between friends."
lepaog.52.b: "Let's keep things professional."

lepaog.53.t: "League-Ostasien Connection Deepens"
lepaog.53.d: "As AOG influence grows, so to does our relationship with Ostasia. To wit, a new economic trade agreement has been drafted by AOG businesses to boost trade between us."
lepaog.53.a: "Always good to have friends."

lepaog.54.t: "AOG Requests Ostasien Docking Rights"
lepaog.54.d: "While Ostasia already has sizable dockyards in Tsingtau, the AOG has requested that we allow German ships dock in League cities also, as a simple precaution in the case of chaotic naval actions in the China Sea."
lepaog.54.a: "Granted."
lepaog.54.b: "Let them keep their ships in Tsingtau."

lepaog.55.t: "AOG Requests Ostasien Military Access"
lepaog.55.d: "In a rather audacious request, the AOG has asked for us to give military access to Ostasien troops to protect German interests in our country. While this would be a dramatic ceding of sovereignty, the level of AOG influence in our government makes it difficult to refuse."
lepaog.55.a: "A reasonable request."
lepaog.55.b: "We must keep some level of distance."

lepaog.56.t: "AOG Requests a Full Military Guarantee"
lepaog.56.d: "With tensions with Japan on the rise, the AOG has demanded that we make a full showing of support to the German colonies in Asia, and that we guarantee a League response in the event of any attack on German territories. This would effectively throw our lot in with the Reichspakt in the event of war, but may be an inevitable conclusion if war reaches our borders."
lepaog.56.a: "Their safety is ours."
lepaog.56.b: "This has gone too far!"

lepaog.57.t: "Transferring of the Concessions"
lepaog.57.d: "In a demonstration of power, the AOG has decided to transfer direct control of the concessions out of our hands, and into those of the Ostasien administration. As humiliating as this is, it was an inevitable conclusion to the almost complete German control of our nation."
lepaog.57.a: "It was inevitable."

lepaog.58.t: "Von Falkenhausen Returns to Active Duty"
lepaog.58.d: "With the fight against the secessionists threatening the safety of the German concession cities, the leader of the concesion defense force, Alexander Von Falkhenhausen, has returned to active duty to help our fight, and has offered his leadership to our troops. The assistance of such a competent general, and the implicit support in our fight, is a great boon to our war effort."
lepaog.58.a: "Any help is welcome."

lepaog.59.t: "The AOG Asserts it's hold on the League"
lepaog.59.d: "Today the result of years of Nanjing leaning on the AoG has come back to bite them. After paying millions in bribes to thousands of administrators, police and army officers and social keystones, they have finally made their move. As Nanjing awoke they found much of the city in lockdown including the government quarter. When Qi attempted to enter his office, he was met by Falkenhausen. It was calmly explained to him that he no longer had a job. He ranted and raved and swore that all of China would rise against them, but in the end he knew he lost. He marched off while swearing to ‘make you foreigners pay’ but, with all the country in our pocket, there is no real worry. By noon it was over, life in the city returned to normal and a new and exciting opportunity for Germany in Asia had begun."
lepaog.59.a: "Für Gott und Kaiser und unsere Aktionäre!"

lepaog.60.t: "Administrative Reservations"
lepaog.60.d: "As we have begun our major reforms of the crumbling administration of the League we have been asked a serious question, shall the Chinese stay within the high eschelons of bureaucracy or do away with them. To keep the Chinese might be advantageous. They know the people and are more acceptable to them as opposed to administrators from the homeland. Not only that but they could give us a Chinese perspective on the happenings within and outside our country. However, corruption runs deep within their ranks, their loyalties suspect to many. On the other hand we could just send for bureaucrats from Germany. They will be much more reliable, less corrupt in ways that could threaten the state. However, we are always in need of experienced administrators and our rule is already unpopular. If we do away with the Chinese within it we might shred what little legitimacy we have in the eyes of the populace."
lepaog.60.a: "Only Germans can be trusted to handle paramount positions"
lepaog.60.b: "Leave them be so long as they serve"

lepaog.61.t: "Krupp attacks Labor laws"
lepaog.61.d: "While laxly enforced on the best of days, the old Nanjing Clique did have substantial labor protections. However they used it mostly to get in the way of good German business and as desperate pandering to otherwise would be revolutionaries. Whenever we did anything they didn’t like they’d use some provision or another to shutter some of our factories in retribution. WIth us going over laws and making what changes we feel necessary our... "friends" in Krupp have asked us to do away with these laws. They point out that they were and still are a hindrance to business and make costs almost too high to properly work in the country. While Falkenhausen knows it’s just their executives blustering over making a few less million he does admit the regulations are quite generous and do raise costs for running a business here to levels that could put smaller companies at risk. But on the other hand, keeping them and using them like the Chinese once did could be useful, both as a tool to keep companies in line and to preserve order in the league. Krupp is nothing if not powerful and keeping this club in the closet could be a good way to keep them in line."
lepaog.61.a: "There is no longer a need to prostitute ourselves to laborers"
lepaog.61.b: "We should not risk the fury of the Chinese"

lepaog.62.t: "The Disloyal Generals"
lepaog.62.d: "While our roster of Generals is bolstered by transfers from Deutsch Ostasien, concerns over the existing staff have been raised, many having  suspect loyalties. These generals are from the old Chinese govenors, allegedly having histories of opportunism and ill practice. They may turn on us anyway if they see weakness, or more plausibly, a bag of gold on the other side, made easier if they are offered a chance to shed the label of Hanjian. While doing away with them would remove their questionable influence in our state, this would lose us additional experience which may prove necessary for a struggle against our enemies. There are no real right answers."
lepaog.62.a: "Give them a nice retirement, one way or another"
lepaog.62.b: "They will keep in line"

lepaog.63.t: "Krupp makes his move"
lepaog.63.d: "Today Falkenhausen has received a notice from the office of the Reichskolonialamt that Krupp has opened a complaint against Falkenhausen. They have been lying in wait, gathering binders of so-called evidence that he has not acted in the interest of Germany. They accuse him of rampant corruption, Chinese sympathies and anti-Kaiserreich feelings. Everyone, the Reichskolonialamt included, sees this for the naked power grab that it is. Yet, the Kaiser has demanded an actual investigation into Falkenhausen’s alleged wrongdoing. In response Falkenhausen has carted over dozens of binders of his own evidence of his loyalty to Germany. The investigation has begun, and nobody knows how it will end."
lepaog.63.a: "He grasps at straws"
lepaog.63.b: "The League is shaken!"

lepaog.64.t: "Krupp is disgraced!"
lepaog.64.d: "After an extensive investigation, some say the most thorough in German history, the Reichskolonialamt has made it's decision and has ruled in favor of Falkenhausen. The ruling announced that Falkenhausen has done nothing to make his loyalties suspect. This ruling has been met with jubilation by Falkenhausen and his office. His position is now secure and he can be done with the once seemingly endless run around of testimonials, document transfers, interviews and investigators. Meanwhile Krupp has come out of this whole thing embarrassed and discredited. They spent money hand over fist to unseat Falkenhausen and have failed. With their shareholders in an uproar, Chinese operations sagging and company profits underperforming Falkenhausen can rest easy knowing that the Steel Magnate's petty machinations are no longer a threat."
lepaog.64.a: "We are loyal forever"

lepaog.65.t: "The AOG hangs in the balance"
lepaog.65.d: "The AoG stands on unsteady legs today as Berlin finally weighs in on the crisis. Some weeks ago the Reichskolonialamt issued it's report. Within, it stated that that while Falkenhausen had not done anything plainly treasonous, some of his actions were valid reasons to suspect him of "Chinese sympathies" and asked Berlin to intervene, sparking another round of investigations. Everybody sits on the edge of their seat over what the German's ruling will show. If they remove Falkenhausen it's almost a certainty that Krupp will move in to fill the vacuum by influencing the board of directors. This worries many, both within Falkenhausen’s administration and in Berlin. Krupp is a company and a state entirely under their control could be unpredictable if even viable long term. At the same time Falkenhausen may be compromised and if he is, there is no telling if he would lead the AoG in a path against the interests and well being of the Kaiserreich. As over a million people halfway across the world hold their breath, a secretary in Berlin issues the press release..."
lepaog.65.a: "Falkenhausen's dedication is sufficient"
lepaog.65.b: "Falkenhausen must step down from leadership"

lepaog.66.t: "Was ist das Beste im Leben?"
lepaog.66.d: "With the AOG ascendant over the League, a great question looms over the nation, What next?. Some desire to consolidate our position, the AOG and League after all they say is meant for the enrichment of the Kaiser's people and realm, not to entangle them into unncessary and destructive entanglements, and for the most part these voices are dominant, what cause have we to pay for the desolation and devastation of war now? But a few see otherwise, they say the league has potential, and like the Jurchen horde we should sweep over the decaying mass of a broken China to establish a new, glorious order in our image. The allure of ambition proves a great temptation, but to maintain our senses and serve the Kaiser within our means proves more persuasive among many, we must choose."
lepaog.66.a: "Let the primitive warlords squabble beyond the pale, while we sow peace and prosperity"
lepaog.66.b: "We will crush our enemies, and see them driven before us"

lepfp.1.t: "Turning our gaze upon Hunan"
lepfp.1.d: "So as we have broken the Kuomintang insurgents and Anhui traitors, we have finally been given the chance to look outward. With the former province of Hunan having slipped from our grasp amidst the chaos of confusion, we now seek to collect our due. We could simply seek to coerce Hunan into rejoining the league, or dispense with diplomacy in favor of a show of strength, the choice lies with our League-Marshal."
lepfp.1.a: "Send forth an ultimatum"
lepfp.1.b: "Traitors and Rebels deserve no pretense"

lepfp.2.t: "At the gates of Liangguang"
lepfp.2.d: "So as we have broken the Kuomintang insurgents and Anhui traitors, we have finally been given the chance to look outward. With the former provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi having slipped from our grasp amidst the chaos of confusion, we now seek to collect our due. We could simply seek to coerce Liangguang into rejoining the league, or dispense with diplomacy in favor of a show of strength, the choice lies with our League-Marshal."
lepfp.2.a: "Let them join or Perish"
lepfp.2.b: "The time for talk ended with their defiance"

lepfp.3.t: "The League at the door"
lepfp.3.d: "It was only a matter of time once the German collaborators of the Nanjing clique beat back it's enemies that they would come for us, but that time has come as a messenger from Nanjing, demanding that we either disband our clique and submit to their authority or face their wrath. While surrender would mean the clear end of any ambitions we lay claim to, we must also consider whether it should be possible with our current position to withstand their onslaught, and whether the cost in blood and fire is worth it."
lepfp.3.a: "We have little choice"
lepfp.3.b: "We stand defiant!"

lepfp.4.t: "The [FROM.GetName] submits"
lepfp.4.d: "Another triumph, seeing the futility of resistance the [FROM.GetName] has disbanded, and handed over complete control of their territory to our control."
lepfp.4.a: "If only all our foes were this sensible"

lepfp.5.t: "The [FROM.GetName] defies us"
lepfp.5.d: "Not recognizing what is best for them, it appears that the [FROM.GetName] have refused our demands, their foolish resistance will be surely be short lived."
lepfp.5.a: "We will crush them under our bootheels"

lepfp.6.t: "Qi's China"
lepfp.6.d: "After the illusion of a united China was broken, few predicted it would not find itself in strength again. After the League was divided by the fires of war, and the Northern Zhili abandoned us, fewer still believed we could survive. But now, none doubt our might, surpassing the Jade Marshal in all his hubris, surpassing the myriad and numberless warlords and naysayers, now they say nothing as Qi Xieyuan stands at the gates of Beijing, unbroken and triumphant under heaven. China's fate is now is his hands alone."
lepfp.6.a: "We shall remake China as a Republic in the image of the League"
lepfp.6.b: "The time of Kings and Emperors is over, Qi leads the restored Republic"
lepfp.6.c: "Puyi shall have his throne again under our guidance"
lepfp.6.e: "The Qing are restored under Pujie, as Qi wills it"

lepfp.7.t: "The Dragon Throne"
lepfp.7.d.puyi: "Today Aisin-Giorio Puyi, the latest in the venerable line of Qing Emperors, has been coronated again in a grand ceremony in Beijing. Meant to reflect the rebirth of the Qing Empire under new leadership,  in his coronation Emperor Puyi was flanked on both sides by leaders of the Zhili Clique whose military campaigns subjugated much of China and facilitated Puyi’s return to the throne. While the officers have made public declarations of loyalty to the Empire it is clear to many observers who is the real power behind the throne. Though rumors speak of Puyi's apparent discontent with this arrangement as he accepted the offer to take the throne on the understanding that he would control China domestically while leaving the military and foreign policy to the Zhili. Meanwhile the Zhili are busy locking down their power structure and preparing for their next campaigns. While the generals partied after the coronation, they did so knowing that their work in uniting China was far from over. While they had a ruler, their ruler barely had a country to rule. Plans have already begun to be drafted concerning the annexation of the hinterlands and the ‘secessionist territories’ of Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang.."
lepfp.7.d.pujie: "Today Aisin-Giorio Pujie, Brother of Emperor Kangde, of the latest in the venerable line of Qing Emperors, has been crowned in a grand ceremony in Beijing. Upon his coronation Emperor Kangde was flanked on both sides by leaders of the Zhili Clique whose military campaigns have already subjugated much of China and facilitated the return of the Qing. While the officers have made public declarations of loyalty to their new Emperor it is clear to many observers who is the real power behind the throne. Meanwhile the Zhili are busy locking down their power structure and preparing for their next campaigns. While the generals partied after the coronation, they did so knowing that their work in uniting China was far from over. While they had a ruler, their ruler barely had a country to rule. Plans have already begun to be drafted concerning the annexation of the hinterlands and the ‘secessionist territories’ of Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang. Meanwhile troops have taken to the streets and have begun to round up known Republicans and dissidents."
lepfp.7.d.ming: "As the Zhili stormed Beijing many wondered what they would do to the nation they now ruled. They could easily cement themselves as the new leader of China, they had already conquered most of it. However public discontent with military rule was growing even before the Zhili Army began its victorious campaign. The newly annexed lands have only thrown fresh fuel on these fires. It is now abundantly clear that if the Zhili are to continue their rule they must do so indirectly. In comes the new monarch to be, Zhu Yuxun. Zhu does not look like much standing a bit shorter than normal, wearing rags and living in an alley near one of Beijing’s city gates. However his pedigree is prestigious, some would say even more so than the Kaiser. Zhu is the last man standing of the prestigious House of Zhu which founded the ancient Great Ming dynasty of China, the last Han Chinese dynasty in Chinese history. His ancestors ruled lands from the Pacific to the mountains of Tibet and from the Mongol steppe to Vietnam. Since the Ming were overthrown by the Qing they were placated, as is tradition, with a lofty title. Yuxun’s title is the Marquis of Heavenly Grace. However this is purely ceremonial and Yuxun has largely been forgotten about. In fact he had been so thoroughly left by the wayside that it took a battalion of men three weeks to find him as in the chaos of the capture of the city, nobody had bothered to secure the soon to be Emperor. However, despite being a peasant with less material goods to his name as most other Chinese Yuxun has accepted the offer with dignity and grace. After a thorough washing and frantic planning, Yuxun has been crowned in the Forbidden City but even as he plays at his new role, the real rulers of China, The Zhili Clique are already planning new campaigns against China’s many enemies."

lepfp.8.t: "Eyes on the Legations"
lepfp.8.d: "Ever since the century of humiliation, the many great powers of the west poisoned China, before picking at it's flesh like vultures circling above a dying man. But with the aid of our new German benefactors, the influence of these foreign dogs, not least the English and Japanese can soon be at an end. And it remains in our hands to decide how."
lepfp.8.a: "The Legation Cities shall be subject to us alone"

lepfp.8.c: "There can be no peace with them, to war!"

lepfp.9.t: "The [FROM.GetName] demands our Subjugation!"
lepfp.9.d: "When the League of Eight provinces collpased under the strain of rebellion few thought they could survive, much less recover. However it seems that the tenacity of Nanjing has outdone it's rivals, and not only have they claimed their former territory but laid claim to Beijing and soon all of China! Now they look to us, demanding that we subject ourselves to their overlordship, while the Legation council obviously has little like for this idea, with the alternative being war with an ascendant Nanjing, many question whether we truly have a choice."
lepfp.9.a: "If this preserves the Legation cities, so be it."
lepfp.9.b: "We will not yield to such outrageous demands."

lepfp.10.t: "The [FROM.GetName] bends the knee!"
lepfp.10.d: "Great news!, the Legation cities have submitted themselves to us, their independence reduced to a mere formality, now only we and our benefactors from Berlin will sway here."

lepfp.11.t: "The [FROM.GetName] defy our demands!"
lepfp.11.d: "The Legation Cities have ignored our demands, insistent that whatever powers that be can safeguard their weak and patry forces from our armies, the cowards, the FOOLS!. We will take away their Precious cities."
lepfp.11.a: "Muster the Troops!"

lepfp.12.t: "The [FROM.GetName] demands our Subjugation!"
lepfp.12.d: "When the League of Eight provinces collpased under the strain of rebellion few thought they could survive, much less recover. However it seems that the tenacity of Nanjing has outdone it's rivals, and not only have they claimed their former territory but laid claim to Beijing and soon all of China! Now they look to us, demanding that the Legation cities dissolve, handing over possession of any and all territories to Chinese authorities, while the Legation council obviously has little like for this idea, with the alternative being war with an ascendant Nanjing, many question whether we truly have a choice."
lepfp.12.a: "It is not worth dying over."
lepfp.12.b: "We will not yield to such outrageous demands."

lepfp.13.t: "The [FROM.GetName] accept our rule"
lepfp.13.d: "Recognizing the supremacy of our position, the Legation Cities have disbanded, accepting annexation by us. It is a red letter day, the leeching of the Anglo, American and Japanese is at an end in our ports.."
lepfp.13.a: "Was there ever any doubt?"

allost.1.t: "The Chinese Triumph"
allost.1.d: "Since we began our war with the Chinese, our foothold in the region has been completely destroyed, many cry out for the German government to end this lost cause of a war and bring our boys home before more German lives are wasted grasping at lost glories."
allost.1.a: "We must fight on!"
allost.1.b: "We cannot afford it"

allost.2.t: "Germany withdraws from China"
allost.2.d: "Since we began our war with the Germans, their foothold in the region has been completely destroyed, and with their tails between their legs, German forces in China demand an armstice recognizing the loss of all German possessions in Asia."
allost.2.a: "The century of Humiliation suffers a crippling blow"
allost.2.b: "Peace with the vile Teutonic imperialist is impossible"

allost.3.t: "The Burning of the League-Marshal's Palace"
allost.3.d: "At 21:15 last night, a fire station in Nanjing received an alarm call that the League-Marshal's Palace, the now assembly location of the Ostchina-Direktorum, was ablaze. Despite the rapid response of the fire department, the fire quickly spread throughout the building and into neighboring blocks, with over 21 confirmed dead and more still missing, including a dozen German nationals. A Chinese Nationalist by the name of Lee-Hom Ren was arrested at the scene of the blaze two hours later, follwing his capture, the arsonist confessed after three hours of enhanced interrogation, but refused to name any accomplices."
allost.3.a: "This is an Outrage!"

allost.4.t: "The New Marshal's Palace"
allost.4.d: "The former Marshal's Palace of the League is now but smouldering rubble. The man who was responsible has been dealt with on the gallows, as he deserves, but even with this quick and just retribution, punsishing him does not raise back the palace from the ashes. And so now we are left to solve the question of where the Ostchina-Direktorum will hold their meetings as the new de facto capital of the nation."
allost.4.a: "Rebuild the New Palace right where the former one stood"
allost.4.b: "A fine opportunity to return to the former Head Office in Tsingtau"
allost.4.c: "Guangzhou, the Industrial capital of Southern China"
allost.4.e: "Nantong, The Agricultural Capital of Southern China"

allost.5.t: "The AOG makes their move"
allost.5.d: "Today, many of our administration report unusual maneuvers from the AOG, albeit not military ones, but of diplomats and officials. A surge of alleged attempted briberies and political machinations have accordingly been brought to our attention, all concerning League officials, and most alarmingly of all, oone state servant has reportedly, overheard talk from an AOG officer to a Ostasien officer that the intention is to bring the entirety of our nation into the control of the AOG! While we can do little but weather the storm of their well prepared political assault, advisors to Wu Peifu point out hopefully that the vast undertaking being carried out by the AOG may in a sense, overextend them and could eventually lead to them being vulnerable to our influence instead."
allost.5.a: "A Battle of Wits!"

allost.6.t: "The Zhili fall under our sway"
allost.6.d: "This day is great cause for celebration, virtually all branches of the Qing government find themselves within the left hand of the league, and Wu Peifu has found him self no choice but to formally cede control of foreign policy to the League, and by extension, us. Now let all understand who really calls the shots in China."
allost.6.a: "A death knell to warlords"

allost.7.t: "The Empire strikes back"
allost.7.d: "A black day indeed, not only has our constant effort to subjugate the Zhili failed but in a twist of fate, the Zhili government has made like a phoenix, and dealt to us a shocking turnabout!. Now it is us who have become subject to the Qing, and the League once again falls into Chinese hands. Undoubedtly, the Zhili intend for us to fully integrate into their Empire, and knowing this, already German staff, officials and more make for Ostasien, it seems that in the face of Chinese cunning, defeat was snatched from the Jaws of victory."
allost.7.a: "I will have someone's head for this!"
allost.7.b: "Ostasien will have to carry our legacy now..."

allost.8.t: "The AOG have seized control!"
allost.8.d: "Despite our best efforts, in a political battle with the encroaching German influence from the AOG, under assault from all angles we have fallen completely under their sway. Today the AOG Komissioner has marched into the capital, and compelled Wu Peifu himself to sign an accord effectively granting the AOG complete control over our foreign policy, it thus seems that our complete independence is at an end. One hope lasts though, with the circumstances as they are, it would be unfeasible for them to move against us openly more than they already have, at least we will remain, even if under their thumb. Right?"
allost.8.a: "The future of the Nation darkens"

allost.9.t: "A Reversal of Fortunes!"
allost.9.d: "Heaven smiles upon us!, the Zhili triumph this day! The wicked AOG, looking to subjugate all of China had spared no expense in drawing us into the clutches of their Imperialistic amibitions. But we have outlasted them and what is more, in a series of multiple simultaneous and devastating defensive poltical maneuvers, have instead reclaimed control of the league. Seeing little reason to linger, already the German presence in the league is disintegrating, and fleeing back to the strongholds of their empire though some remain, to uphold the previous obligations our German "benefactors" still hold to us. "
allost.9.a: "It is we who have the last laugh!"

allost.10.t: "End of Aufsichtsrat"
allost.10.d: "Recently, the League which had fallen under German control had found itself in the grand ambition of bringing all of China into the sway of the Kaiserreich, however it seems by either some miraculous blunder or a Chinese Tour de force, the opposite has occured and the League now rests in Zhili hands once again. Already most German staff who had swelled the ranks of the AOG are once again returning, whether to Ostasien or elsewhere in the Kaiser's domain. But unless there is an external intervention, German ambitions to overtake China directly seem at an end."
allost.10.a: "Redolent of the parable of Icarus"

allost.15.t: "Two Wrongs into a Reich"
allost.15.d: "Since our subjugation of the Zhili, while they are now de facto beholden to our demands, we cannot move openly against their hold of Beijing without significant risks to ourselves and the nation, making an attempt to properly secure German Hegemony of the Middle Kingdom a difficult propostion indeed. And with our ascendant influence over Zhili clique affairs the tensions between existing rebel groups in Northern Zhili lands and Wu Peifu's government are reaching a fever pitch, fearing that we would not only make inviolable the hold of the Qing order but end Chinese sovereignity entirely. However, with the right nudges these problems could be turned against one another, and could be the very opportunity we so desire, the army has already drafted a plan, we will give these rebels a golden opportunity to "Capture" a particularly large league arms shipment, and with some underhanded aid, they will be given a chance to strike at Wu peifu's hold, or so they think."
allost.15.a: "A cunning yet brutal plan, let us see how it plays out."

allost.16.t: "Embers over Peking"
allost.16.d: "It went like clockwork, the rebels believing themselves to have backing from "German dissident groups" took to Beijing streets, taking local law enforcement and Zhili garrisons by surprise in concert with bombings of several key locations including Wu Peifu's office. Yet as soon as they had subdued the Zhili, they were themselves thrown into confusion when yet more explosions, now unexpected were heard and then German soldiers, who they had thought distant and irrelevant flooded Beijing, scattering the now helpless rebels as many of their own turned against them. When the smoke cleared, in the dusty streets of Peking, bodies littered the streets, and only we held sway as control of was secured and the Kommissioner declared Marshal law over the North, our rule now unable to be contested."
allost.16.a: "Our equals can be none."

allost.17.t: "The fate of the Qing"
allost.17.d: "With control of Peking secure, the Zhili out of the picture, China is now ours to shape. A primary question concerning this however would be what should be done with Puyi, long a subservient puppet of the Zhili, he can do little harm, and could be useful as a legitimizing face for our rule. However, he may hold enough sway to weaken our dominion over China all the same, after the takeover of the Zhili, his whereabouts are still unknown, at least, to the world. After all, with him in house arrest in the forbidden city, it would be no great undertaking to send him away, as "missing"."
allost.17.a: "He will do just fine."
allost.17.b: "So sad that Emperor Puyi remains missing."

allost.18.t: "To fill a throne"
allost.18.d: "Puyi is now for all intents and purposes a non factor, sequestered anonymously in a remote palace within the vast and wide empire of the Kaiser. With his absence, and our announcement of his "death" the world knows the facts to be as such, and yet all must still ask what happens to China now that the Dragon throne appears vacant. The most prevalent suggestion among our ranks is to simply enstate the Qing Prince Pujie, who is expected to be more pliable to our ends, alternatively there is some talk of letting the Marquis of extended grace, a Ming pretender sit on the throne to distance ourselves from the foreign perception of the Manchu, or even the doomed Honxian Emperor's son who especially will have little to complain about given his current plight. Yet marginal talk exists of doing away with the need for an immediate replacement, organizing China along the lines of Ostasien or Mittelafrika as a de jure military government commited to supporting Germany, but the most radical of all suggestions would be having our own beloved Kaiser be declared the Emperor of China directly, a notion to undoubtedly boil the blood of any Chinese citizen."
allost.18.a: "The Qing will remain under a new face."
allost.18.b: "Call up the Marquis of Extended Grace, the Ming rise again under us."
allost.18.c: "Yuan Keding shall be a fine representative of our stewardship."
allost.18.e: "Declare a Junta, bereft of an Emperor let Deutsch China serve."
allost.18.f: "Perhaps even these distant lands can bear witness to our Kaiser’s grace."

allost.19.t: "A Chinese Kaiserreich?"
allost.19.d: "With the triumphant rise of German influence in China and it's conquest of the lion's share of it's lands, we have seized total control of the nation and its people. As more and more Chinese citizens are entangled into the German sphere, the dominance of the Kaiserreich has only grown more apparent, and as a result more of our citizens see the Germans as the true rulers of the land, albeit resentfully. Many within our administration have now begun to push this situation to what they consider its natural conclusion the formal declaration of German rule in China. Though most would rather place ourselves behind a figurehead Chinese Emperor, others still go further and declare our own Kaiser to have the Mandate of Heaven in tradtional fashion, a nation that most find absolutely preposterous, though with our dominance and power it would be hard for anyone to stop us. The choice shall be left up to our administration and the Kaiser himself to decide."
allost.19.a: "As succession demands, keep Puyi atop his throne."
allost.19.b: "Let the Qing survive, Puyi can be replaced with someone more cooperative."
allost.19.c: "The old Ming Empire lives again, the Jurchens have outlived their usefulness."
allost.19.e: "Yuan Keding shall be a fine representative of our stewardship."
allost.19.f: "Declare a Junta, bereft of an Emperor let Deutsch China serve."
allost.19.g: "Perhaps even these distant lands can bear witness to our Kaiser’s grace."

allost.20.t: "A New Face Sits Atop the Dragon Throne"
allost.20.d: "Deep within the hallowed and ancient halls of the Forbidden City, a lavish and majestic ceremony is being held. As the fiery sun rises in the East, so too does a new leader rise for these Eastern lands to bear witness to. China now lies as a domain of the Kaiserreich, and as such, Kaiser Wilhelm has personally seized the Mandate of Heaven, meaning he alone bears the divine right to rule these lands. With his coronation ceremony, Kaiser [GER.getleader] shall take on the additional title as Weilian, Emperor of the Chinesisches Kaiserreich! He shall take the regal dynastic name of ‘Wǔ Dé’, as is tradition for his new role due to the different naming conventions of the Far-Eastern dynasty. Long may he reign as the sovereign of these foreign lands and may his rule usher in an era of true peace and prosperity for the Chinese people."
allost.20.a: "Wilhelm Hohenzollern has seized the Mandate of Heaven!"

allost.22.t: "The Dragon Throne"
allost.22.d.puyi: "The AOG has settled on establishing Puyi as a figurehead for the newly reformed Chinese Empire due in large part to his willingness to work with us. Upon hearing of the request for him to return to the Dragon Throne, Puyi reportedly "went wild with joy", perhaps misinterpreting how important his position really is. While formally being head of state of the newly unified country, our government will ensure he has minimal influence in the daily functions of the state to make certain that German control doesn't fade any time soon."
allost.22.d.keding: "With the tense discussions regarding the future leadership of German China finally over, the stage is set for the coronation of the new Emperor Yuan Keding. A decadent ceremony funded by Berlin and the AOG's increasingly large coffers has seen the son of Yuan Shikai restored to his rightful throne, with Keding taking his father's title as the Hongxian Emperor in honor of his bloodline. Despite the heavy German guidance in government, having a true monarch restored to the Chinese throne will unify our formerly divided subjects. As the new Han ruler takes the mostly ceremonial reigns of the Chinese monarchy, a new age of strength and prosperity has surely dawned in the Empire. Long live the Hongxian Emperor!."
allost.22.d.pujie: "Following our brave conquest of the distant Chinese lands and the capture of the thousand-year-old capital Beijing, and after much deliberation, it was finally decided by the AOG and the German government to place Pujie, brother of the previous Emperor Puyi, as the nominal figurehead of a reformed Chinese Empire loyal to German interests, in order to use his Mandate of Heaven to legitimize even stronger German control of these lands.\n Pujie has accepted Germany's offer and seems happy to work with us, no doubt overestimating the powers of such a position, as Germany has ensured that Pujie has only a very limited role in the governance of his country.\n A sumptuous ceremony took place in Beijing, largely financed by Berlin, where Pujie officially became the Emperor of the vast China, he could take advantage of the occasion to interact with his cheering subjects. However, some people noticed the presence of the German Foreign Minister at the ceremony, a symbol of German domination over the country and its wealth."
allost.22.d.ming: "Today the victorious Ost-Heer marches through the Forbidden City on parade for their new monarch. After their rapid and astounding conquest of much of China, the Allgemeine Ostasien Gesellschaft began to form from a governing council of a multitude of cities along the Chinese coast, to a true government to rule over China in the Kaiser’s name. While some industrialists like Krupp suggested that the Kaiser be named as monarch of this new German China the AOG administration has rejected the idea as they fear it may raise too much domestic resistance. Instead, they have decided to enthrone a loyal Chinese monarch. While the obvious choice would be the former Emperor Puyi, now under house arrest in Beijing, the Germans have surprisingly dismissed him as well. They fear that the Chinese would not accept a return of Qing hegemony since they overthrew the Qing once before. Instead they have found a truly radical option. Zhu Yuxun is the last member of the venerable house of Zhu, the ruling family of the ancient Ming dynasty. The Ming were the last truly Chinese dynasty to rule China and the failures of the Qing have largely left the failures of the Ming to the dustbin of history in many uneducated Chineses eyes. Yu had long abandoned any serious attempts at reclaiming the throne, as has his family, and in the chaos of the German conquest his location was lost. After much searching Zhu Yuxun, the last living descendent of the Great Ming and the Marquis of Extended Grace, was found sleeping in an alley near the Dongzhimen gate in Beijing. He had nothing but rags to wear and lacked shoes yet he accepted his call to rule gracefully. Now he stands before his Army in full Imperial regalia, living fat and happy off the Germans tit while the real rulers of the country prepare for their next move."
allost.22.a: "Long live the Son of Heaven!"

aogdeathevent.1.t: "Kaiser Wilhelm III Takes the Throne"
aogdeathevent.1.d: "With the death of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Wilhelm Kronprinz has taken his throne worldwide. The coronation in China occurred in the Forbidden City, and the new Son of Heaven was declared Weilian II. Cheers from the royal guests erupted, and the Kaiser of Germany only tightened their bond with the Chinesisches Kaiserreich."
aogdeathevent.1.a: "Wansui shengli zhe de guiguan!"

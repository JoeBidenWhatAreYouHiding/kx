# Country Leaders 
POLITICS_BOB_MINOR_DESC:0 "Bob Minor, known as 'Fighting Bob' was an old socialist cartoonist. Though his family once rubbed shoulders with Texan high society, they had lost their silver spoon by the time of Minor’s birth. Living in San Antonio, he only received education from age 10-14 before seeking work to support his family. While working in a series of jobs, Bob began to develop his artistic skills in his spare time with what spare time he had, and eventually became a renowned political cartoonist. It was through these cartoons that he expressed his developing radical views, especially his fondness for revolutionary industrial unionism. His life would be forever changed in 1907, when Minor joined the Socialist Party of America. Given the weakness of the party in the state of Texas, Minor did not take part in the sort of major riots or strikes that occurred in the Red Belt. Instead, Minor went abroad, covering the Mexican Revolution and making a trip to Paris where he fraternized with revolutionary intellectuals, further radicalizing his views. Upon returning home, he was horrified by the persecutions of leftists by the Wilson and Palmer administrations, and from then on dedicated his life's work to preserving grassroots socialism in Texas, and appealing to the revolutionary states for aid to the SPA. When the Civil War erupted, Minor, instead of taking refuge in Chicago, elected to remain in his native home of Texas, regardless of the danger. His refusal to leave spread his fame around the state, and Minor was soon helping to found the Socialist Party of Texas, in determined to bring the revolution to the state. Now in power, only the future will tell if he can complete the transformation of Texas into a red paradise."
POLITICS_MARTIN_DIES_DESC:0 "While Martin Dies Jr. is a politician, those who look at him as just another bureaucrat in a suit would be mistaken. Originally just another Texan Democrat in the House of Representatives, Dies rose in prominence for his passionate opposition to syndicalism. By the time of the 1936 election, he was Chairman of the House Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities and a key ally of John Nance Garner. Once Texas declared its intent to break away from the union, Dies returned to his home state, taking with him his authoritarian tendencies. Hungry for power in the young Texan nation, Dies turned away from Garner to Huey Long and the America First Party. After gaining the favor of New Orleans, Dies became the head of the Texan branch of the America First Party, and now serves as Governor following Texas’ decision to bow to the Union State. Dies is quickly emerging as an important figure within the right wing of the America First Party and is even reputed to privately support the Christian Party. Meanwhile, he suppresses opposition to his authority, and is carefully working to shape Texas in his image as much as Long will allow."
POLITICS_EAKER_DESC:0 "Ira C. Eaker began as a bright young man from a little town in Texas. Despite earning a Bachelor’s Degree in journalism, he found that the Army was his calling. In October 1918, he became a pilot and would subsequently serve in the Philippines until 1922. Upon returning to the states as a Captain, he commanded the 5th Aero Squadron and later was post adjutant. Captain Eaker next entered the bureaucracy, eventually being named Executive Officer of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War. His career skyrocketed after piloting a Loening float plane in a 22,000 mile trip around South America, earning the Mackay Trophy. Before long he earned himself the Distinguished Flying Cross for setting a world flight endurance record after piloting the Question Mark for seven days straight. s. In 1930, he made the first transcontinental flight entirely with instruments. In the summer of 1935, he was detached for duty with the Navy and participated aboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington, on maneuvers in Hawaii and Guam. His experiences in the autocratic Territory of Hawaii helped to shape his views, and gave him a new affinity for authoritarian rule’s ability to maintain order and efficiency. Promoted to Brigadier General by the President during the Bleeding Texas incident in the hopes of securing his loyalty, Eaker nonetheless sided with his home state when it seceded from the Union. Upon his arrival, he was promoted once more to a General, responsible for the command of the Texan Air Corps. While Eaker initially supported the dictatorship of Texaco, he became disillusioned by Rieber’s fondness for the Constitutional American Republic and willingness to involve Texas in the affairs of the Civil War. Following Eaker’s key role in the coup deposing Texaco, he has secured himself as the dictator of the young nation. Eaker is determined to keep the plane of Texas flying high and steady, and he is more than happy to stamp out any and all who threaten to crash his beloved home."
POLITICS_NIMITZ_DESC:0 "Admiral Nimitz has become Texas' new Commander-in-chief. He is a navy man, a man who commanded a fleet in Pearl Harbor, where he gained significant experience in his craft and was able to impress his superiors. Despite his extensive travel, he is a native Texan, and recently, he has fled to his home state following the collapse of the Federal Government. He has served Texas as best he could since that time and protected the Gulf of Mexico from enemy incursion. Now that he is in charge, he plans to keep the state safe from invasions from the land or sea, and to do this, he hopes to build up the military so it will be a match for any who dare to attack Texas. First and foremost though, he is a supporter of the Navy, and will make sure it is funded and bolstered enough that it will make Texas a force to be reckoned with on the waves."
POLITICS_CACTUS_JACK_DESC:0 "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas. Now, he is the new President of Texas. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, fiercely loyal to his home state: Texas. He abandoned the U.S. when he saw them sell out his beloved homestate, and fled to be with his family and his home. This Texan judge sees no reason in compromise with either the left or the right, though some of his policies teeter on authoritarianism."

POLITICS_FRANK_HAMER_DESC:0 "Rough, tough, and used to hardships, Frank Hamer might be the greatest lawman of the century. Beginning as a humble ranch wrangler, Hamer became a rising star in the Texas Rangers for his intelligence, competence, marksmanship, and loyalty. Hamer has battled bootleggers, bounty hunters, and Klansmen over the years, and conquered every single one. Notoriously skeptical of politicians, even quitting when Ma Ferguson was elected Governor, Hamer was recalled around the time of the 1936 election to combat rowdy strikers and lynchers, to great success. Credited for saving numerous lives during the leadup to the election and subsequent Bleeding Texas incident, Hamer was hailed for keeping law and order in the state, and when his pro-independence views came to light, his popularity soared further as Texas’ great protector from the corrupting influences of the rest of America. In the infant years of the young Republic, his success only continued to climb, culminating in his successful Presidential run, defined by promises of securing the peace of Texas and a fresh start from the elitist politicians only bringing Texas down. President Hamer means business, and he isn’t afraid to step on the toes of others to protect his beloved Republic."
POLITICS_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The National Committee of State. A boring name given to such an...interesting group. Regardless, it is also known as the "Shotgun Regency", a committee of the most influential men in Texas. This is not a council designed to benefit the people; it is designed to benefit Texaco. The council is not here to stay, it is not something permanent. Rather, it is just something to provide the facade of a democratic presence while the corporations take over the country. In reality, the Oil Barons couldn't care less about Democracy, and while their plans are unknown, what is certain is that the profits of Texaco and others will never be higher."
POLITICS_TORKLID_RIEBER_DESC:0 "Nobody expected Torkild Rieber to end up in the plains of Texas. He was after all born in Norway, thousands of miles away from our shores. However, through his career making a living as a sailor, Rieber found himself in Texas. He eventually found himself managing a Texaco cargo ship, and eventually, his competence would see him rise to lead the entire company. Upon gaining Texaco's highest position, Rieber’s underlying motives began to reveal themselves. An outspoken admirer of radical right-wing leaders such as Codreanu, Reiber was a prominent donor to William H. Murray's presidential bid, and is alleged to have funded Latin American dictators as well. While the United States became embroiled into civil war, Reiber was moving behind the scenes and playing what strings he could to secure control over the young Texan nation, while working to aid the cause of the Constitutional American Republic. Now that he is firmly in control of Texas, little stands in the way of the oilman’s crusade against syndicalism, and threats to his monopoly. Rieber is Texaco, and Texaco is Texas."
POLITICS_WOODIE_GURTHIE_DESC:0 "Born to a conservative, middle class family in Oklahoma and named for Woodrow Wilson, a figure he now despises, Woody Guthrie has had an eventful life shaping him into the beloved revolutionary leader of Texas. His father was a Klansman, his mother was ravaged by Huntington’s Disease that drove her insane, his sister accidentally burned herself to death, and Woody was begging for meals and depending on friends for shelter. Though bright, he dropped out of high school to become a street performer. Guthrie was blessed with a natural talent for music, and became an instant smash hit in Texas, which became his adopted home state. But Guthrie aspired to be more than just a folk singer; he was to be a crusader against the injustice of the greedy America of old. His songs, especially “This Land is Your Land”, have launched him to become one of the loudest voices for socialism in the United States. Guthrie was torn by the Texas Independence movement, but ultimately decided to side with the young Texan nation when it seceded from the Union, in the hopes of being able to help shape it into a truly fair and free frontier. His populist calls for “cowboy socialism” and “frontier revolution” struck a chord with the young people of Texas, who, already loving him for his music, came to love him that much more for his working class charm and youthful spirit. Before he knew it, the young revolutionaries of Texas had carried the Red Cowboy into the highest office in the frontier at age 25. Now, young Woody fills the massive boots of leading Texas into the future, but he vows that his Texas will be for you and me."
POLITICS_LBJ_DESC:0 "In 1937, Lyndon Baines Johnson successfully campaigned in a special election for Texas's 10th congressional district, that covered Austin and the surrounding hill country. Running as a populist Democrat, and co-operating with Huey Long and Richard Russell, he served in the House until Texas seceded from the Union. In the young Texan state, former supporters of Long or progressive Democrats came to rally around Johnson, with his charisma and charm making him a crucial advocate for social democracy in the young state. Now that he is at the helm of the Texan nation, Johnson will do his best to build a populist ang egalitarian society, and is not above making deals with the devil to achieve this."
POLITICS_JAMES_ALLRED_DESC:0 "James V Allred has had a long and fascinating career in Texas. Initially aligned with the Democratic Party's establishment, the breaking up of the Democrats into divergent factions, and the rise of Huey long, drove him further to the left, and Allred carved out a status as a progressive Democrat, a rare sight in a South dominated by the ODP. When Texas was plunged into chaos, Allred grew weary of America's failings and inadequecies, causing him to grow increasingly sympathetic to the nascent movement for Texan independence, to which he eventually hitched his wagon. He eventually gained the traction to hold a referendum, one that overwhelmingly passed. With Washington having failed in its duty to protect the Texan people, Allred finally abandoned the Democratic Party, and led Texas's secession at the head of the new Texan Independence Party. However, many are discontented with Allred's rule, and his days at the top may be numbered."
POLITICS_WL_ODANIEL_DESC:0 "Wilbert Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel, described by some as the “most Texan man alive”, is not one by birth. It was, in fact, only his work with the Burrus Mill Flour Company that brought him to the state, and that made him a household name. Responsible for the Company’s radio advertising, O’Daniel hired multiple musicians to help him market the business. What resulted was the smashing hit Light Crust Doughboys band behind such classics as Beautiful Texas. Before long he had his own radio show that captivated Texan listeners with his Christian and political messages. Within a divided America, O’Daniel became beloved as a charismatic symbol of wholesome Texan values. This motivated O’Daniel’s entry into politics, where he flirted with the America First Party until the rise of the Texan Independence movement, where he broke with Long and backed his rival, Governor Allred for leaving the Union. With Texas free, O’Daniel used his charisma, radio, and fame to defeat Allred in the bid for the Presidency. Now that O’Daniel calls the shots, he seeks to transform Texas into a haven of prosperity, hospitality, and Christian values, free from the horrors of civil war or division."

Texas.0.t:0 "Electors Defy Majority"
Texas.0.d:0 "News out of Texas today has caused outrage among its populace. Specifically, the news that the state’s appointed electors had defied the will of the people and cast their votes for John Nance Garner instead of Huey Long, who had won the state’s popular vote. While they are technically within their rights to go against the will of the populace, many have attempted to sue them, and the case looks like it is going to the Supreme Court. "
Texas.0.b:0 "The case is taken to the Supreme Court!"
Texas.0.a:0 "The Electors Back Down!"

Texas.1.t:0 "The Supreme Court's Decision"
Texas.1.d:0 "The Case of Citizens vs. the State of Texas has now gained nationwide coverage, as almost everyone weighs in on this failure of the democratic system. Anger in Texas is brewing over this, despite the fact that the Electors really do not have any mandate to go along with the Popular Vote. At the end, the verdict is: "
Texas.1.b:0 "They have no obligation"
Texas.1.a:0 "The Electors must vote in accordance to the popular vote!"

Texas.2.t:0 "Violence in Texas"
Texas.2.d:0 "The outcome of the Supreme Court case has angered almost everyone in Texas, a state that voted overwhelmingly for Huey Long. Many AFP chapters in Texas have denounced the descicion, and many Democrats such as Martin Dies Jr. have switched lines and joined the AFP. As riots spiralled out of control, Minutemen and SPA-aligned militias clashed in the street, and the National Guard refused to take any action. "
Texas.2.a:0 "Terrible!"

Texas.3.t:0 "Bleeding Texas"
Texas.3.d:0 "After weeks of sporadic violence in Texas, a new term has been keyed. “Bleeding Texas” is what it’s called, and what it is the vast amount of bloodshed that has taken hold in the state. The Police have been powerless to stop them, as even they have joined in the rioting, and the Texas National Guard; split on party lines has refused to take any action to calm the situation. "
Texas.3.a:0 "Damn..."

Texas.4.t:0 "Dealing with Texas"
Texas.4.d:0 "The situation in Texas has gained national attention, as bystanders and Politicians alike call for action from the state and federal governments. President Huey Long has been reluctant to act so far, but now seems like a good time to act. Of course, he could just let the situation sort itself out. "
Texas.4.a:0 "Declare Martial Law!"
Texas.4.b:0 "This is too much work, let them sort it out"
Texas.4.c:0 "Work with the AFP"

Texas.5.t:0 "The Oil fields Burn!"
Texas.5.d:0 "Horror in the Texan oil Industry, as the operators of the Oil Wells woke up to their rigs being burned. This has crippled the oil industry in Texas, but has left oil wells operated by Texaco completely unharmed"

Texas.6a:0 "Finally"

Texas.7.t:0 "James Allred is considering resigning"
Texas.7.d:0 "Faced with a crisis on his hands, Texas Governor James V. Allred has considered fleeing the sinking ship that is the Texan Government. Numerous assassination attempts have also made him fear for his life in recent weeks, and the deadlocked Texan Senate has made it impossible to govern solidly. Of course, if he can guide Texas through this crisis he could score major political points. "
Texas.7.a:0 "Allred stays."
Texas.7.b:0 "Allred Resigns."

Texas.8.t:0 "Support for Texan Independence Grows"
Texas.8.d.long:0 "The quickly unfolding situation in regard to President Long in Texas has led to certain unexpected movements gaining prominence. One such movement is a movement supporting the idea that Texas should leave the Union once more and forge its own path as an independent nation. While the idea of Texas going it alone may have seemed silly 20 years ago, the disillusionment that many Texans feel with the Federal Government and with the entire United States has caused many Texans to support leaving once more. While support now is not enough to cause concern, it is a worrying sign of things to come. "

Texas.8.d.murray:0 "The chaos of Murray’s failed invasion and pacification has caused no shortage of backlash in the state of Texas. Nearly everyone in the state views this as an unjust trampling of Texan Rights, an illegal invasion. In the minds of the citizens of the State of Texas, such a brazen defiance of the rights of the State will not stand. This has led to many pro-secessionist movements taking root, movements supporting the idea that Texas should leave the Union once more and forge its own path as an independent nation. While the idea of Texas going it alone may have seemed silly 20 years ago, the disillusionment that many Texans feel with the Federal Government and with the entire United States has caused many Texans to support leaving once more.

Texas.8.d.homerule_intervention:0 "The failed crackdown by President [USA.GetLeader] in Texas has caused many in the state to turn against the Federal Government, even to the point of turning on the United States all together. This has led to a surge in movements that would have been unpopular years ago, but have now gained prominence . One such movement is a movement supporting the idea that Texas should leave the Union once more and forge its own path as an independent nation.

Texas.8.a:0 "Worrying"

Texas.9.t:0 "Huey Long sits on Texas' Throne"
Texas.9.d:0 "Once Allred resigned a snap election was held, and the result of that election was the America First Party winning handily. Both the Senate and the Governor’s office is secure for the AFP, and now the AFP can focus on fixing the crisis that plagues Texas alone. "
Texas.9.a:0 "Another Ally of New Orleans"

Texas.10.t:0 "Horrific Acts of Violence across Texas"
Texas.10.d:0 "With the local police powerless to enforce Laws in Texas, many criminals normally kept at bay have come out in full force. And not just standard robbers and drunks, killers who have been locked away for years, only to be freed after various Prison Riots. Now these sick individuals strike again, killing at their hearts content without anyone to stop them or enforce the law of the land. "
Texas.10.a:0 "My God!"

Texas.11.t:0 "Looting Spree"
Texas.11.d:0 "As the Texan Government falls apart, so does Texan society. One sign of this is mass sprees of riots and looting, which have taken the state by storm after the collapse of social order. These riots often escalate quickly, as the police are powerless to stop them. As well, in major cities such as Dallas, Austin and Huston looting is commonplace, where every shop is robbed of everything that isn’t nailed down. "
Texas.11.a:0 "Another Symptom of a larger problem"

Texas.13.t:0 "Texas Plunged into Anarchy"
Texas.13.d:0 "The decision made by the supreme court has angered many Texans, who have taken to the streets in protest. Violence, Looting, and Chaos has erupted across the state" 
Texas.13.a:0 "Everything is falling apart"

Texas.12.t:0 "Riots in Texas"
Texas.12.d:0 "The massive upheaval in the face of the Supreme Court's decision, and the failure of law enforcement to contain the problem has plunged Texas into Anarchy. Law enforcement has no effective control of the state, and the streets are under Mob Rule. Regular protests can turn violent at the flick of a wrist, and often many are left dead after alterations with armed opponents. "
Texas.12.a:0 "What did you expect?"

Texas.14.t:0 "Longist Riots in Texas"
Texas.14.d:0 "The outcome of the Supreme Court case has angered almost everyone in Texas, a state that voted overwhelmingly for Huey Long.

Texas.14.b:0 "Appease the Longists, the ODP is a bigger threat."
Texas.14.a:0 "Use a Hard Line against the Longists!"

Texas.15.t:0 "Violence in Texas"
Texas.15.d:0 "With violence increasing in Texas, President Garner must act fast to keep the situation in Texas from spiralling into a larger crisis. While the logical conclusion would be to step back and negotiate with Huey Long, President Garner has also proposed going harder on the Longists, however this could lead to more violence in Texas."
Texas.15.b:0 "There is too much bloodshed already."
Texas.15.a:0 "Use any means necessary to displace the Longists."

Texas.16.t:0 "Bleeding Texas"
Texas.16.d:0 "After weeks of sporadic violence in Texas, a new term has been keyed. “Bleeding Texas” is what it’s called, and what it is the vast amount of bloodshed that has taken hold in the state.

Texas.16.b:0 "God Help Texas."

Texas.17.t:0 "Long refuses to condemn Texan Terrorists."
Texas.17.d:0 "The recent crackdown in Texas by President Garner has caused the Longists in the state to take an even more violent stance in opposing Garner. Huey Long himself has refused to condemn this violence, however many would guess that if Long was approached with a deal for the President, the violence in the state could be dealt with in a peaceful manner. "
Texas.17.a:0 "Go Harder on the Longists."
Texas.17.b:0 "Enough is Enough!"
Texas.17.c:0 "We will end the violence by any means, negotiate with Long!"

Texas.18.t:0 "Texans grow tired of Violence."
Texas.18.d:0 "President Garner’s position of being hard on the Longists has done little but turn Texas into a practical warzone. The uncompromising position of the President and of Long has made many Texans grow tried of the Federal Government, and of Longist Terrorists, and some are proposing radical means to end the violence in the state. "
Texas.18.a:0 "How could Texas abandon America?"

Texas.19.t:0 "Settling an Old Score."
Texas.19.d:0 "Before William H. Murray was elected President for the Old Democrats, Murray served as Oklahoma’s Governor. Famous for the number of times he declared Martial Law, and notable for the brief skirmish between the State of Texas and the State of Oklahoma on the Red River Bridge. Now that Murray has been elected President, he can use his executive power to settle the score once and for all, however that would anger the Texan government in the process. "
Texas.19.a:0 "I'm not that damn Petty"
Texas.19.b:0 "The Red River Bridge is Oklahoman!"

Texas.20.t:0 "A Demand to Governor Allred."
Texas.20.d:0 "President Murray has decided to use his new executive power to settle an old score with the Texan Government, officially recognizing the Red River Bride as part of the State of Oklahoma. While a minor change in borders, Governor Allred is a firm critic and opponent of Murray, and could always take a page out of the President’s own handbook to resist Old Democrat forces. "
Texas.20.a:0 "Very Well, step back."
Texas.20.b:0 "Not a chance."

Texas.21.t:0 "Klan Crackdown in Texas."
Texas.21.d:0 "The Old Democrat Victory in the recent U.S Presidential Election has emboldened the Ku Klux Klan across the United States, especially in the south. Governor Allred, unlike many other governors has taken a hard line against the KKK, famously being tough on them during his time as a judge. This has angered President Murray and the ODP, who view Allred as another sellout to America’s enemies. President Murray could take time to act on the Texas Situation, or leave the state alone for the time being. "
Texas.21.a:0 "Give Allred a “Strongly Worded Letter”."
Texas.21.b:0 "Tell that sommabitch to quit it!"

Texas.22.t:0 "Skirmishes on the Red River."
Texas.22.d:0 "Governor Allred has refused to step back from the Red River, saying that President Murray has overstepped his bounds and that the Federal Government has no right to intervene in the Red River dispute, especially an old dispute. Allred’s recent actions have infuriated President Murray, who is considering taking drastic means to ensure that Texas is loyal to the ODP and Federal Government. "
Texas.22.a:0 "Enough is Enough, issue an Arrest Warrant for Allred."
Texas.22.b:0 "We tried."

Texas.23.t:0 "Allred Defies the President."
Texas.23.d:0 "The recent arrest warrant issued for Governor Allred by President Murray has been unilaterally defied by the State of Texas, who declare the warrant invalid and illegal, and call Murray an aspiring dictator. This has infuriated President Murray, who sees this as none other than an act of rebellion, and is considering sending in the Army to enforce the warrant and bring Texas back into the fold. "
Texas.23.a:0 "Whatever happened to States Rights?"

Texas.24.t:0 "The Army Invades Texas."
Texas.24.d:0 "The recent defiance of the Texan legislature has caused Murray to declare Texas an area in active rebellion and has sent the Army into the state to enforce the arrest warrant on Allred’s head. This is almost universally seen as an illegal act, and many of the soldiers tasked with the invasion have flat out refused to follow the order. As well, the Texan National Guard has refused to step back, leading to the looming possibility that Texas could be turned into an active warzone. Murray’s grip on America is increasingly fragile, and the crisis in Texas seems to be just another precursor to a Civil War. "
Texas.24.a:0 "Murray Displaces Allred."
Texas.24.b:0 "The Army Mutinies, the National Guard fends off the ODP!"

Texas.25.t:0 "Home Rule plan in Texas?"
Texas.25.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] has introduced the so-called “Home Rule Plan” to increase autonomy to the states and allow for greater self-governance. Implementing this across the nation has led to an unexpected side-effect; regional separatism growing across the nation, notably in Texas where the secessionist camp has surged in popularity. The Texan secessionists view America as a nation on its deathbed, and that the only way for Texas to survive is to go it alone. While there is no legal process for succession, the collapse of Law and Order in the US could negate any legal means to leaving the union for Texas. "
Texas.25.a:0 "Let's not light that fire again..."
Texas.25.b:0 "What’s the worst that can happen?"

Texas.26.t:0 "Secessionism Grows in Texas"
Texas.26.d:0 "The President's plan in Texas has backfired significantly in an unexpected way, notably leading to Texan Secessionism growing as a political force. Crowds now demand an independence referendum and a way for Texas to legally exit the union, demands so far met with deaf ears by the Federal Government. While this may be a solidified movement, most see it as a temporary movement that will burn out once the situation in America has stabilized. "
Texas.26.a:0 "It is nothing to worry about."

Using their connections and wealth, the Texaco Oil Barons have been slowly trying to push the Texan Populace towards the view that Texas needs to be independent again. This is motivated by Texaco CEO Torklid Rieber’s hatred of Syndicalism and [USA.GetLeader]. In Rieber’s mind, the only way to save Texas from Syndicalism is to ensure that Texas no longer has to rely on America, allowing Texas to remain stable as America burned. "

The vote was a formality, as Texas has been on the road to succession ever since America began to fall apart. With other factions staking their claims and Civil War on the horizon, Texas has elected to go it alone; not fighting for any faction. As Texas transforms from a State into a Republic, Governor James Allred has become President James Allred, and the Republic of Texas has been born anew. No faction currently recognizes the Second Republic of Texas, seeing its succession as Illegal, however if one thing has become clear, it is that the law doesn’t matter in America anymore. "

Some of the more notable moments in the transcripts had Johnson Saying – “ Yeah. Now, another thing: the crotch, down where your nuts hang, is always a little too tight. So, when you make them up, give me a inch that I can let out there, because they cut me. They're just like riding a wire fence.

This has resulted in AFP-Aligned Militias committing acts of terror in the name of the American Union State.  With the KKK and other factions engaging in political violence, this has done little but add fuel to the fire. Texas’ fragile political scene is pushed further towards its breaking point, and many worry that Texas will not be spared from the violence engulfing America. "

TXS.115.d:0 "The Decision of the Texan Government to formally align with the American Union State has been highly controversial within the Texan Political scene, with many pro-Independence factions criticizing how the government has “Sold out to Long”. The fact that many within Texas openly call for complete independence has strained the Texan Government’s relations with the Union government in New Orleans, with some suggesting that Huey Long take a harder line against separatists. They suggest appointing Martin Dies Jr. to oversee Texas and ensure that the nation is fully loyal to the American Union State, with Dies being given a large amount of leeway to crush opposition. "

In these films, corrupt, greedy bankers, entrepreneurs and lawmen seeking to exploit the untamed west are resisted by simple vigilantes and ranchers from poor backgrounds using frontier justice to resist the spread of avarice in the west.  These heroes Older, existing westerns have also been modified for propaganda purposes, with the romantic themes and heroes slightly altered to be more in line with socialist doctrine. While some have denounced the films as revisionist, the Texan government has been quick to clarify the truth that these “Red Westerns” are more accurate depictions of the history of the Wild West than anything seen prior. Already, several of these films have been smashing successes, with the Texan people quickly coming to love the incredible retellings of their history, with many finding that the messages help them to understand and appreciate better than ever before!"

Now, with his position secure, the members of the band expect some sort of reward for their loyalty, and O'Daniel is happy to give it to them. However, we must decide how we wish to go about this. We could grant them even more power in the government than they currently hold, meaning more positions for them in the cabinet. Alternatively, we could make them fabuously wealthy, and keep sending them on tours around the country. Do we need these men in government, or around the country?"

TXS.118.t:0 "Collected Western Stories of Robert E. Howard"
TXS.118.d:0 "The current revival of American culture has been followed by the renaissance of Westerns as a genre of literature. One interesting case of this is a collection of short stories by Texas writer R. E. Howard, which have just been released. These stories, like 'The Pride of Bear Creek' or 'Pistol Politics', focus on describing adventurous life in the American Frontier. Stories about gunslingers such as the Sonora Kid are especially popular in this genre, appealing to a wide swath of readers. This does not mean, however, that the author wrote Western stories only in this narrowly understood subgenre. Literary works such as the adventures of the Texan traveler Francis Xavier Gordon in 'The Coming of El Borak', 'Hawk of the Hills' or 'The Country of the Knife' or even horrors stories such as 'Black Canaan'  or 'Pigeons from Hell' are all part of the Western genre, even if they are less traditional. Meanwhile, the popularity of Howard's Westerns is now so great that no one remembers the rest of the literary attempts to create other pulp heroes, such as the boring Conan the Barbarian or the naive puritan Solomon Kane."
TXS.118.a:0 "Robert E. Howard will be remembered as the Father of Westerns"

TXS.119.t:0 "The Debate over Pensions"
TXS.119.d:0 "One of O'Daniel's most persistent promises to his supporters was the implementation of old-age pensions for the nation's elderly population. As such, he has been eager to push this proposal and codify it into law, but it seems that his political inexperience has limited him in this pursuit. O'Daniel failed to even gain the support of some of his fellow Texan congressmen, with the questions of how this pension system will be funded still unclear. For his part, the Texan leader is apparently frustrated at this setback, but he pledges to carry on with his agenda nonetheless. Instead of an old-age pension system, he has instead begun to formulate a plan for post-war America, in which pensions will be granted to veterans as a way of easing the country, or more acurately, his fellow politicians, into the idea of pensions for all elderly citizens. This "Dependent and Disability Act" will be just what O'Daniel needs to push old-age pensions forward."

After disavowing the Federal Government and strongly coming out in favour of Texan independence, Garner announced his entrance into Texan politics.\n\n Even though the Democratic Party was split in two, Garner and the Democratic Party managed to unseat James Allred, the first President of the Republic of Texas.\n\n Now, the world waits for what ‘Cactus Jack’ will do with Texas; however many fear that his policies are becoming more and more authoritarian.

His Texan Independence Party gained much traction during the Bleeding Texas Crisis, however it lost significant momentum following Texas declaring independence, as the Texan Democrat Party re-surged. But it appears that President Allred will rule for another day, remaining the President of the Reborn Republic and keeping Texas a haven for Liberal Democracy in the chaos of the American Civil War. With Allred in power, he seeks to institute a broad series of reforms known as the “New Deal” to help Texas recover from the last effects of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. "

Allred) Resigned and joined the Texas Independence Party.\n\n Even though the part split on ideological lines, ‘Pappy’ managed to pull through and gain the majority of support from the voters.

His Party was formed from more radical leftists who were too moderate for Allred’s mainstream left. Many in this coalition are further left than Johnson, though they so far hold little sway. Johnson’s grip on power is fragile, as his party only holds on to the government by the skin of their teeth. To stay in Power Johnson may even have to make deals with more radical Socialist subsets of the party. But for now, Johnson and his Vice-President Ralph Yarborough are focusing on brining Equality to Texas, and breaking down old barriers such as segregation and Poll Taxes. "

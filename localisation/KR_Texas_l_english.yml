POLITICS_BOB_MINOR_DESC:0 "Bob Minor, known as 'Fighting Bob' was an old socialist cartoonist. Though his family once rubbed shoulders with Texan high society - even being long descended from Thomas Jefferson's campaign manager General John Minor on his father's side and to General Sam Houstom himself on his mother's side, they had lost their silver spoon by the time of Minor’s birth. Living in San Antonio, he only received education from age 10-14 before seeking work to support his family. While working in a series of jobs, Bob began to develop his artistic skills in his spare time with what spare time he had, and eventually became a renowned political cartoonist. It was through these cartoons that he expressed his developing radical views, especially his fondness for revolutionary industrial unionism. His life would be forever changed in 1907, when Minor joined the Socialist Party of America. Given the weakness of the party in the state of Texas, Minor did not take part in the sort of major riots or strikes that occurred in the Red Belt. Instead, Minor went abroad, covering the Mexican Revolution and making a trip to Paris where he fraternized with revolutionary intellectuals, further radicalizing his views. Upon returning home, he was horrified by the persecutions of leftists by the Wilson and Palmer administrations, and from then on dedicated his life's work to preserving grassroots socialism in Texas, and appealing to the revolutionary states for aid to the SPA. When the Civil War erupted, Minor, instead of taking refuge in Chicago, elected to remain in his native home of Texas, regardless of the danger. His refusal to leave spread his fame around the state, and Minor was soon helping to found the Socialist Party of Texas, in determined to bring the revolution to the state. Now in power, only the future will tell if he can complete the transformation of Texas into a red paradise."
POLITICS_MARTIN_DIES_DESC:0 "While Martin Dies Jr. is a politician, those who look at him as just another bureaucrat in a suit would be mistaken. Originally just another Texan Democrat in the House of Representatives, Dies rose in prominence for his passionate opposition to syndicalism. By the time of the 1936 election, he was Chairman of the House Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities and a key ally of John Nance Garner. Once Texas declared its intent to break away from the union, Dies returned to his home state, taking with him his authoritarian tendencies. Hungry for power in the young Texan nation, Dies turned away from Garner to Huey Long and the America First Party. After gaining the favor of New Orleans, Dies became the head of the Texan branch of the America First Party, and now serves as Governor following Texas’ decision to bow to the Union State. Dies is quickly emerging as an important figure within the right wing of the America First Party and is even reputed to privately support the Christian Party. Meanwhile, he suppresses opposition to his authority, and is carefully working to shape Texas in his image as much as Long will allow."
POLITICS_EAKER_DESC:0 "Ira C. Eaker began as a bright young man from a little town in Texas. Despite earning a Bachelor’s Degree in journalism, he found that the Army was his calling. In October 1918, he became a pilot and would subsequently serve in the Philippines until 1922. Upon returning to the states as a Captain, he commanded the 5th Aero Squadron and later was post adjutant. Captain Eaker next entered the bureaucracy, eventually being named Executive Officer of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War. His career skyrocketed after piloting a Loening float plane in a 22,000 mile trip around South America, earning the Mackay Trophy. Before long he earned himself the Distinguished Flying Cross for setting a world flight endurance record after piloting the Question Mark for seven days straight. s. In 1930, he made the first transcontinental flight entirely with instruments. In the summer of 1935, he was detached for duty with the Navy and participated aboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington, on maneuvers in Hawaii and Guam. His experiences in the autocratic Territory of Hawaii helped to shape his views, and gave him a new affinity for authoritarian rule’s ability to maintain order and efficiency. Promoted to Brigadier General by the President during the Bleeding Texas incident in the hopes of securing his loyalty, Eaker nonetheless sided with his home state when it seceded from the Union. Upon his arrival, he was promoted once more to a General, responsible for the command of the Texan Air Corps. While Eaker initially supported the dictatorship of Texaco, he became disillusioned by Rieber’s fondness for the Constitutional American Republic and willingness to involve Texas in the affairs of the Civil War. Following Eaker’s key role in the coup deposing Texaco, he has secured himself as the dictator of the young nation. Eaker is determined to keep the plane of Texas flying high and steady, and he is more than happy to stamp out any and all who threaten to crash his beloved home."
POLITICS_NIMITZ_DESC:0 "Admiral Nimitz has become Texas' new Commander-in-chief. He is a navy man, a man who commanded a fleet in Pearl Harbor, where he gained significant experience in his craft and was able to impress his superiors. Despite his extensive travel, he is a native Texan, and recently, he has fled to his home state following the collapse of the Federal Government. He has served Texas as best he could since that time and protected the Gulf of Mexico from enemy incursion. Now that he is in charge, he plans to keep the state safe from invasions from the land or sea, and to do this, he hopes to build up the military so it will be a match for any who dare to attack Texas. First and foremost though, he is a supporter of the Navy, and will make sure it is funded and bolstered enough that it will make Texas a force to be reckoned with on the waves."
POLITICS_CACTUS_JACK_DESC:0 "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas. Now, he is the new President of Texas. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, fiercely loyal to his home state: Texas. He abandoned the U.S. when he saw them sell out his beloved homestate, and fled to be with his family and his home. This Texan judge sees no reason in compromise with either the left or the right, though some of his policies teeter on authoritarianism."

POLITICS_FRANK_HAMER_DESC:0 "Rough, tough, and used to hardships, Frank Hamer might be the greatest lawman of the century. Beginning as a humble ranch wrangler, Hamer became a rising star in the Texas Rangers for his intelligence, competence, marksmanship, and loyalty. Hamer has battled bootleggers, bounty hunters, and Klansmen over the years, and conquered every single one. Notoriously skeptical of politicians, even quitting when Ma Ferguson was elected Governor, Hamer was recalled around the time of the 1936 election to combat rowdy strikers and lynchers, to great success. Credited for saving numerous lives during the leadup to the election and subsequent Bleeding Texas incident, Hamer was hailed for keeping law and order in the state, and when his pro-independence views came to light, his popularity soared further as Texas’ great protector from the corrupting influences of the rest of America. In the infant years of the young Republic, his success only continued to climb, culminating in his successful Presidential run, defined by promises of securing the peace of Texas and a fresh start from the elitist politicians only bringing Texas down. President Hamer means business, and he isn’t afraid to step on the toes of others to protect his beloved Republic."
POLITICS_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The National Committee of State. A boring name given to such an...interesting group. Regardless, it is also known as the "Shotgun Regency", a committee of the most influential men in Texas. This is not a council designed to benefit the people; it is designed to benefit Texaco. The council is not here to stay, it is not something permanent. Rather, it is just something to provide the facade of a democratic presence while the corporations take over the country. In reality, the Oil Barons couldn't care less about Democracy, and while their plans are unknown, what is certain is that the profits of Texaco and others will never be higher."
POLITICS_TORKLID_RIEBER_DESC:0 "Nobody expected Torkild Rieber to end up in the plains of Texas. He was after all born in Norway, thousands of miles away from our shores. However, through his career making a living as a sailor, Rieber found himself in Texas. He eventually found himself managing a Texaco cargo ship, and eventually, his competence would see him rise to lead the entire company. Upon gaining Texaco's highest position, Rieber’s underlying motives began to reveal themselves. An outspoken admirer of radical right-wing leaders such as Codreanu, Reiber was a prominent donor to William H. Murray's presidential bid, and is alleged to have funded Latin American dictators as well. While the United States became embroiled in the civil war, Reiber was moving behind the scenes and playing what strings he could to secure control over the young Texan nation, while working to aid the cause of the Constitutional American Republic. Now that he is firmly in control of Texas, little stands in the way of the oilman’s crusade against syndicalism, and threats to his monopoly. Rieber is Texaco, and Texaco is Texas."
POLITICS_WOODIE_GURTHIE_DESC:0 "Born to a conservative, middle class family in Oklahoma and named for Woodrow Wilson, a figure he now despises, Woody Guthrie has had an eventful life shaping him into the beloved revolutionary leader of Texas. His father was a Klansman, his mother was ravaged by Huntington’s Disease that drove her insane, his sister accidentally burned herself to death, and Woody was begging for meals and depending on friends for shelter. Though bright, he dropped out of high school to become a street performer. Guthrie was blessed with a natural talent for music, and became an instant smash hit in Texas, which became his adopted home state. But Guthrie aspired to be more than just a folk singer; he was to be a crusader against the injustice of the greedy America of old. His songs, especially “This Land is Your Land”, have launched him to become one of the loudest voices for socialism in the United States. Guthrie was torn by the Texas Independence movement, but ultimately decided to side with the young Texan nation when it seceded from the Union, in the hopes of being able to help shape it into a truly fair and free frontier. His populist calls for “cowboy socialism” and “frontier revolution” struck a chord with the young people of Texas, who, already loving him for his music, came to love him that much more for his working class charm and youthful spirit. Before he knew it, the young revolutionaries of Texas had carried the Red Cowboy into the highest office in the frontier at age 25. Now, young Woody fills the massive boots of leading Texas into the future, but he vows that his Texas will be for you and me."
POLITICS_LBJ_DESC:0 "In 1937, Lyndon Baines Johnson successfully campaigned in a special election for Texas's 10th congressional district, that covered Austin and the surrounding hill country. Running as a populist Democrat, and co-operating with Huey Long and Richard Russell, he served in the House until Texas seceded from the Union. In the young Texan state, former supporters of Long or progressive Democrats came to rally around Johnson, with his charisma and charm making him a crucial advocate for social democracy in the young state. Now that he is at the helm of the Texan nation, Johnson will do his best to build a populist ang egalitarian society, and is not above making deals with the devil to achieve this."
POLITICS_JAMES_ALLRED_DESC:0 "James V Allred has had a long and fascinating career in Texas. Initially aligned with the Democratic Party's establishment, the breaking up of the Democrats into divergent factions, and the rise of Huey long, drove him further to the left, and Allred carved out a status as a progressive Democrat, a rare sight in a South dominated by the ODP. When Texas was plunged into chaos, Allred grew weary of America's failings and inadequecies, causing him to grow increasingly sympathetic to the nascent movement for Texan independence, to which he eventually hitched his wagon. He eventually gained the traction to hold a referendum, one that overwhelmingly passed. With Washington having failed in its duty to protect the Texan people, Allred finally abandoned the Democratic Party, and led Texas's secession at the head of the new Texan Independence Party. However, many are discontented with Allred's rule, and his days at the top may be numbered."
POLITICS_WL_ODANIEL_DESC:0 "Wilbert Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel, described by some as the “most Texan man alive”, is not one by birth. It was, in fact, only his work with the Burrus Mill Flour Company that brought him to the state, and that made him a household name. Responsible for the Company’s radio advertising, O’Daniel hired multiple musicians to help him market the business. What resulted was the smashing hit Light Crust Doughboys band behind such classics as Beautiful Texas. Before long he had his own radio show that captivated Texan listeners with his Christian and political messages. Within a divided America, O’Daniel became beloved as a charismatic symbol of wholesome Texan values. This motivated O’Daniel’s entry into politics, where he flirted with the America First Party until the rise of the Texan Independence movement, where he broke with Long and backed his rival, Governor Allred for leaving the Union. With Texas free, O’Daniel used his charisma, radio, and fame to defeat Allred in the bid for the Presidency. Now that O’Daniel calls the shots, he seeks to transform Texas into a haven of prosperity, hospitality, and Christian values, free from the horrors of civil war or division."
ROBERT_COLE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Robert G. Cole was born at Fort Sam Houston, in San Antonio, Texas, to Colonel Clarence F. Cole, an Army doctor, and Clara H. Cole\n§YMilitary Career:§WCole graduated with the class of 1937 and returned home to marry Allie Mae Wilson. He was appointed a second lieutenant to the 15th Infantry at Fort Lewis, Washington in 1937, and remained there until his transfer to the 501st Parachute Infantry Battalion at Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1936. In March 1936, he earned his jump wings. Rapidly advancing through the ranks at Fort Benning as the parachute infantry battalions were expanded to regiments, he was a lieutenant colonel commanding the 3rd Battalion of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment on June 6, 1937 - the date of his unit's first combat jump. When Texas seceded, he was promoted to General, as Texas had little to no military staff. But, he has served his post with distinction.\n§YImportant Notes:§W-He specialises in Paradrops and Paratroopers"
ARMY_WILLIAM_GRAVES_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W William Sidney Graves was born at  Mount Calm, Texas on March 27 , 1865\n§YMilitary Career:§WGraves, the son of a Baptist Minister, attended the West Point Military Academy and graduated among some of America’s most distinguished officers. Graves would go on to fight in the Spanish-American War, serving in the Philippine Battle of Caloocan as a company commander during the insurrection. he was given command of the 8th Division and sent to Siberia under direct orders from President Wilson. His orders were to remain strictly apolitical amidst a politically turbulent situation.As a result, he was frequently at odds with his peers and the State Department, as well as various Russian groups. Given some 7,000 soldiers in what was called the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.), and aided by Joseph D. Leitch as his chief of staff, he settled on the idea of making sure the Trans-Siberian railroad stayed operational and brought in a number of railroad experts to run the railway. His troops did not intervene in the Russian Civil War despite strong pressure brought on him to help the White army of Admiral Kolchak, as early on, Graves developed a strong distaste for Kolchak and his government. U.S. forces operated the Trans-Siberian railroad for almost two years, while bandits roamed the Siberian countryside and the political situation turned chaotic. After the military accomplished its objectives the expedition evacuated, with the last U.S. soldiers leaving Siberia by April 1, 1920. By 1925 Graves had been promoted to major general, with him retiring in 1928. Initial content with his retirement, Graves returned to the line of Duty upon Texas’ declaration of independence; intent to help with the defense of his home in any way he could. "

With the sitting elected government gone, Rieber and the Texaco Board of Directors have assembled a committee to oversee the Texan State for the time being, however this provisional committee is fully owned and controlled by the Texaco Oil Barons.

Allowing for more elite special forces to defend our soil at an immediate monetary cost appears to be the new strategy of the Texaco controlled Texan Armed Forces, but as of now it is unknown if their program will have any long-term success.

This soft coup was a long time coming ever since Johnson made backroom deals with the Socialist Party of Texas, with more hardline reds slowly taking command of the Broad Progressives. It was only a matter of time before Johnson lost any even semblance of control, as he was reduced to just a walking puppet for the SPT.

In this conversation, he gave very specific orders to the local tailor, some of them being rather noteworthy. Some of the requests were to make the crotch area larger and increase the size of the pockets so his knives and change don’t fall out. Some of the more notable moments in the transcripts had Johnson Saying – “ Yeah. Now, another thing: the crotch, down where your nuts hang, is always a little too tight. So, when you make them up, give me a inch that I can let out there, because they cut me. They're just like riding a wire fence. These are almost--these are the best that I've had anywhere in the Republic of Texas.” And “But when I gain a little weight they cut me under there. So leave me . . .You never do have much margin there, but see if you can't leave me about an inch from where the zipper ends around under my—back to my bunghole.”\n\n For a few day the public had a laugh at the transcript, while the President issues no comment."

TXS.94.d:0 "In an effort to create a truly Texan national mythos, several new 'Texas-themed' programs have taken to the airwaves with government funding. One such radio program that has taken the nation abuzz is the popular radio situational comedy known as 'King of the Hill'. This radio show details the rather mundane exploits of one Hank Hill, a Propane Gas salesman from the fictitious midland Texas town of Arlen. As a narrative with relatively low-stakes, much of the storytelling and plot lines revolve around the Hill family's interaction with other characters throughout the town, with their activities framed in a traditionally 'Texas' way. From backyard barbecues to friends standing in alleyways drinking beer, this show is far detached from the carnage and chaos of the Second American Civil War, and can show all of Texas that even in dangerous times like these, the ability to indulge and find joy in the simpler aspects of life is not lost. Of course, the show is not without controversy, with many finding some of the show's character motivations and plot points to be scandalous. As well, there are those who view the repeated inclusion of the main character's line of work as a subtle jab at Texaco."

President James Burr V Allred, long an opponent of Conservative and 'Dixiecrat' factions of the Democratic Party, has finally announced his departure from the Democratic Party.

These heroes older, existing westerns have also been modified for propaganda purposes, with the romantic themes and heroes slightly altered to be more in line with socialist doctrine. While some have denounced the films as revisionist, the Texan government has been quick to clarify the truth that these “Red Westerns” are more accurate depictions of the history of the Wild West than anything seen prior. Already, several of these films have been smashing successes, with the Texan people quickly coming to love the incredible retellings of their history, with many finding that the messages help them to understand and appreciate better than ever before!"

One interesting case of this is a collection of short stories by Texas writer R. E. Howard, which have just been released. These stories, like 'The Pride of Bear Creek' or 'Pistol Politics', focus on describing adventurous life in the American Frontier. Stories about gunslingers such as the Sonora Kid are especially popular in this genre, appealing to a wide swath of readers. This does not mean, however, that the author wrote Western stories only in this narrowly understood subgenre. Literary works such as the adventures of the Texan traveler Francis Xavier Gordon in 'The Coming of El Borak', 'Hawk of the Hills' or 'The Country of the Knife' or even horrors stories such as 'Black Canaan'  or 'Pigeons from Hell' are all part of the Western genre, even if they are less traditional. Meanwhile, the popularity of Howard's Westerns is now so great that no one remembers the rest of the literary attempts to create other pulp heroes, such as the boring Conan the Barbarian or the naive puritan Solomon Kane."

As such, he has been eager to push this proposal and codify it into law, but it seems that his political inexperience has limited him in this pursuit. O'Daniel failed to even gain the support of some of his fellow Texan congressmen, with the questions of how this pension system will be funded still unclear. For his part, the Texan leader is apparently frustrated at this setback, but he pledges to carry on with his agenda nonetheless. Instead of an old-age pension system, he has instead begun to formulate a plan for post-war America, in which pensions will be granted to veterans as a way of easing the country, or more acurately, his fellow politicians, into the idea of pensions for all elderly citizens. This "Dependent and Disability Act" will be just what O'Daniel needs to push old-age pensions forward."

The activities of the whole gang involve mainly robberies, sometimes even of banks, but increasingly members of law enforcement are getting gunned down, partly due to the heavy firepower the gang is packing.

From Coughlin Cocktails to new developments like Frag Grenades, and all manner of improvised devices in between, it seems every American is taking their half-baked ideas for new weapons to the battlefield. One strangely effective yet innately simple improvised weapon that has become popular with Texan soldiers is the ubiquitous ‘Pocket Sand’, a method of temporarily disabling enemies that involves no more than throwing sand in their face. This simple means of incapacitating a foe has been used to great effect by members of the Texan National Guard, mostly as a means to disarm assailants. This strategy, developed by a mysterious Mercenary in the Texas Government's employ has become standard for members of the Armed Forces as method of defense that is both free and easy to utilize, leading to its widespread popularity in the sandy plains and deserts that scatter the Texan countryside."

TXS.128.d:0 "Though short-lived, only lasting for about 11 months within the year of 1840, the Republic of the Rio Grande - or the República del Río Grande - was the most important of the many failed attempts at creating an independent state in northeastern Mexico that eventually led to the final, successful attempt which resulted in the creation of Texas as we know it, formed from the amalgamation of the Republica de Texas, Coahuila y Texas, and the lesser Rio Grande republic all previously under the jackboot of Mexico City. Founded in response to the tyrannical unitary government headed by the vile Santa Anna, the Rio Grande republic may have fallen, but we shall always remember their brave sacrifices that led to the birth of our free and brave state of the Lone Star. Ever the land rife with jingoism, patriotism, national chauvinism, and revanchism, many militarist warhawks and Texan nationalists have pushed for the idea of reclaiming this former legacy - and all the land and bounty that comes along with it. Should we listen to these dreamers of a grander past and pursue the reclamation of our former lands to the south in Mexico along with the proclamation of the second Republic of the Rio Grande, or should we leave the heat-blasted desert wastes of northern Mexico to their own fate?"

Should we keep the capital in the historical Texan capital of Austin, or should we move it to the original capital of the Rio Grande in Laredo, or maybe the originally-planned capital in Monterrey that once was the capital of the Republic of the Sierra Madre, or maybe the sight of our last stand against Santa Anna’s demented dream at the Alamo, or perhaps we could move it somewhere of note like Washington-on-the-Brazos, the the original site of the Texan Capital, or perhaps along the old Mexican-American border closer to the border zone at El Paso?"

However, another suggestion is to use the flag of Laredo, the old capital of the Republic of the Rio Grande - a white and black bicolor with a red bar canton going down the hoist adorned with three white stars.

TXS.131.d:0 "With the situation in what was once United States deteriorating rapidly in recent years, many old movements were born anew. One of such sentiments was Texan nationalism, born out of fond memories of the past and the independent streak of the Lone Star citizens. While the vast majority of the population would have been content with remaining within America, the events following the 1936 election have swayed vast swathes of the public to support the secessionist  movement. With Texan electors being defied by the newly elected President and rule of law breaking down Governor James V Allred decided to finally act. In a radio broadcast heard across all of Texas and the neighbouring states, Governor Allred declared the birth of the Second Texan Republic, free from the tyranny of Washington.

With Texas triumphantly stepping into the world as an independent and legitimate force, many within our government and military have begun considering the possibility of hitching our wagon to one of the many major players that collectively influence world politics. Aligning with one of the major factions could guarantee our continued independence even when the other American governments are too busy killing each other to concern themselves with Texas, and would allow a major power to back us up if the need would ever arise. On the other hand, there are some who fear that siding with a player in global politics could lead to Texas getting entangled in a potentially destructive global war.\n\n When all said and done, President [TXS.GetLeader] has decided that..."

They represented our values and lived the lives we now try to emulate and live ourselves, all without theory or the writings of politicians or philosophers to guide them. They were real men and women of the earth, true workers without a care in the world other than to provide for their families and to live fulfilled lives, and that is how we must live once again. \n\nWe will spread this truth to the masses through our new forms of Leftist and communalist education, and we will recreate a Vaquero-styled culture here in Texas dyed the red and black of true freedom. Rodeo, horsesports, cattlesports, bull fighting, hog wrestling, and so much more are to be popularized throughout the nation as a new breed of music created by our Mexican citizens called Ranchera shall melodically move the masses towards Cowboy Anarchism. Our state and county fairs will spread this tradition to the masses during times of celebration, and our communities will spread it during times of work on the ranches and in the fields. The masses will embrace the idea of the Red Vaqueros, and so too will every aspect of our society, for we are the last true cowboys, and we must live as they did so our culture and origins do not fade away into the desert sands."

While the restoration of the 'Historical' borders of Greater Texas has been cause for celebration by nationalists of all stripes, there are still many who are more weary of claiming these vast swaths of new land as part of Texas' natural domain. They propose that instead of directly annexing these territories, a new 'Western American Republic' ruled from Austin would be formed, encompassing both Texas and the territories newly under our control.

TXS.135.t:0 "The Johnson City Windmill"
TXS.135.d:0 "It has been recently suggested to Lyndon B. Johnson that he fly around in one of our newly-procured prototype helicopters sourced from contacts up north in order to drum up support for his campaign and platform across the Lone Star Republic, owing to the size of Texas and because many Texans live in highly isolated small towns where the roads were usually just mud tracks. Finding the prospect of such an endeavor to be a rootin’ tootin’ adventure, President LBJ jumped on board immediately with gusto as Johnson's campaign dubbed the new aircraft - a Sikorsky R-4 helicopter - the ‘Johnson City Windmill’. Johnson has since made campaign appearances all around Texas six days a week from dawn to dusk and the spectacle has drawn large crowds to fairgrounds and other impromptu landing sites. Due to their experimental nature and recent invention, most people in Texas had never seen such a flying machine as Johnson’s heli, making the aircraft an instant draw with any and all from every walk of life in Texas. One newspaper spoke of Johnson ‘flitting around in a strange sort of flying machine’ that had never been seen in Texas before while others likened him to a modern angel made manifest. Attached to the helicopter was a giant loudspeaker, which allowed Johnson to speak to any audience he could fly over, famously announcing to farmers working their fields as he hovered above them ‘’Hello, down there! This is your friend, Lyndon Johnson, your candidate for the President of the independent Republic of Texas. I hope you'll vote for me on Primary day. And bring along your relatives to vote, too’’. As Johnson campaigned in the Rio Grande valley, one journalist wrote: ‘Johnson brought people rushing out of their homes and places of business as he circled cities in the thickly populated valley, waving his hat and urging people to come and see him’, and with stories like these spreading across the state, there is no doubt that LBJ is more popular, more well known, and more widely beloved than ever as he reaches his widest audience yet. Whether he can turn this popularity into prosperity and political harmony, however, remains yet to be seen. \nCuriously, our armed forces have also shown an interest in Johnson’s Windmill, and have since begun to quietly procure a small fleet of these helicopters while working to set up some form of domestic production for the experimental craft, all in order to help defend the skies of Texas forevermore."

Winning a long-shot victory over the various other factions vying for control, Texaco now finds iself in posession of the entire Lower '48, from San Francisco to Washington. However while many are celebrating our nearly impossible triumph, others worry that going from controlling solely the State of Texas, which itself was no means an easy endeavor, to controlling 3,119,884.69 square miles of former America will wreak havoc on our profit margins. To remedy this, several of the other oil companies in the former United States have approached CEO Rieber with an interesting offer: put the contiguous United States up for sale. While Texaco is outwardly hostile to most competition, this hostility is mainly to ensure their monopoly within the State of Texas. Rieber is happy to leave the rest of the American Oil Market up for grabs, leaving them to their own individual operations, or even cooperating with them, as is currently the case with companies such as Chevron and CALTEX. Others have stoutly refused to water down Texas' historic victory, and wish to stamp out all competition within the United States, or at the very least keeping control of the vast oilfields in the rest of America."

At 6:00 AM today, the former United States went up for sale. Texaco Inc., the overlord of the once-United States, fielded countless lucrative offers from some of the richest and most powerful petroleum companies on the face of Planet Earth. Texaco CEO Rieber, whether out of patriotism or pragmatism, only accepted bids from American concerns.\n First to go was the Pacific, bought up quickly by Chevron, officially Standard Oil Company of California (SOCAL). As a close ally of Texaco, even operating a joint venture by the name of Caltex, SOCAL has been given a favorable price for the Pacific States as a gesture of friendship. \n Much of the territory of the former Western Command Center was purchased by Wyoming-based Sinclair Oil, who in addition to controlling their home state, are now the proud owners of Montana, Idaho, Utah and parts of Colorado. As they assume control of their newly-bought lands, the green Brontosaurus logo adopted by the company now flies above much of the American Rockies, even going so far as to distribute a promotional line of rubber brontosaurus, complete with wiggling heads and tails to their new citizenry. \n Acquiring America's heartland is the Oklahoma-based Marland Oil Company, who have gained much of the former Louisiana Purchase for a fraction of what Thomas Jefferson paid. While Marland's support for the American Union State was frowned on by CEO Rieber, our business is business, and we aren't one to turn down paying customers\n Scoring the South for a very affordable price is Hunt Oil, the company started by Texas Native H.L. Hunt. Hunt, while not on the friendliest terms with Texaco, has been given a steep discount on the Southern United States, mainly owing to his status as a virulent racist and ODP sympathizer.\n Snapping up the Steel Belt is Getty Oil, chaired by Anglo-American Oil Magnate Jean Paul Getty. Getty, famously a miser, has haggled for every mile of territory, even if Texaco was more than happy to part with much of America's Syndicalist Heartland.\n Finally, Standard Oil has obtained New England, as well as their home state of New Jersey and New York City. While Texaco has always maintained a mistrust of the 'Carpetbagger' Standard Oil, Rieber is more than happy to conduct business with them in their own territory.\n Opting to take over control of America's former capital is Texaco themselves, who have aimed to exert their control over the new America by holding on to Washington. The instruments of governance for the old United States have been re-used by a new 'American Oil Consortium', a group representing the Oil Companies presiding over this new America. Together, the Petrol Giants who have come to dominate America will bask in untold profits together, free from the clutches of regulation and government oversight.  "

Standing at 3 feet 9 inches (114cm) tall, Lockhart was born in Dallas County in August 1876 to John C. R. and Lucretia Lockhart before moving to Snyder, Texas as a family in 1898. Later elected to be Scurry County treasurer in 1900 thanks to his charm, kind heart, and skill, Lockhart became known as a dependable, ingenious, and honest civil servant, being re-elected to county office 8 times in a row as proof of his popularity with his constituents. In 1919, he went to Austin to work with the sergeant-at-arms of the Texas House of Representatives, furthering his career until finally being elected in 1930 as state treasurer - a position he has maintained since Texan Independence was achieved. \n\nIn 1931, Ripley's Believe It Or Not featured a drawing of Lockhart under the caption 'Texas, the largest state in the Union, has the smallest treasurer, Charley Lockhart, 45 inches tall.', which put him in the national spotlight while making him a household name and Texan icon of the Lone Star State. The Houston Post interviewed Lockhart when he entered the race for the state treasurer's office, and he was quoted as saying, 'I want you to make it perfectly clear that I am fighting this battle on manhood alone,' he said. 'I don't want the votes that are given me through a feeling that life has not handed me a square deal. Life has been good to me. I have filled public office, earned the confidence and friendship of my fellows and educated my children...I'm simply a little man with big ideas and sufficient experience and ability to carry my ideas out...'

However, among the warlords and ideologues, eager to defile the ideals of liberty for their own twisted ends, one faction, the Pacific States, held true to that vision. They denounced the destruction of democracy and American values, which the rest of America so easily discarded and decalred itself a bastion of those same ideals to which Texas held true. Despite this initial promise however, in a turn of events no sane man could have predicted,  they have discarded republicanism and declared themselves an Empire, with Norton II as its figurehead! This absurdity produced no end of controversy, both among those dedicated to the ideals of a republic and from those who urge us to emulate this otherwise inconcievable turn of events in Texas. While many wish for us to denounce this "Pacifican Despotism" and go it alone, others posit instead that even with a crowned emperor, the Pacific State's values remain true to ours but the most radical, but no less, significant voices say that we must find ourselves a similar monarch who can solidify our ties with the Pacifican movements by association, as they have shown us the way into the future for all true American states."

While in years past this would have been an absurd proposal, more and more people in our nation flock to the banner of this growing monarchist movement. However the president has already expressed promises to retire and hold open elections, and having no real monarchist sympathies of his own previously, it is certainly unclear whether he intends to follow the wishes of this admittedly fringe movement or step down as he always had intended"

TXSKING.4.t:0 "King of the Texans"
TXSKING.4.d:0 "With the decision to hold a referendum on the idea of monarchism in the Lone Star State, the nation came alive with talk. While much of it was whispers and jeers from those inclined toward the republic and loyal to the democratic ideal, they could not match the adoring cries and enthusiasm of those who supported the President. Mere days later, the result to the referendum had become clear - a near uncontested victory for the pro monarchy option, and the day after, President Houston attended a ceremony in front of the Governor's Mansion, where in front of the nation, he declared the end of the Republic of Texas, and the birth of it's first Kingdom. While the ceremony lacked the splendor and grandeur of those of similar Empires and Kingdoms, with no precedent to hold itself to nor jewels and lavish palaces, it remains a defining moment for Texas. May it be the start of something truly great."
TXSKING.4.a:0 "Long live the King!"

TXSKING.5.t:0 "Jewels Fit for a King"
TXSKING.5.d:0 "Texas has never been a monarchy itself, and as such has had no real crown jewels to speak of. The closest thing to such an idea would either be the Crown Jewels of Spain due to New Spain once dominating this area, or the local war bonnets and headdresses worn by the Comanche chiefs. In order to establish a truly Texan monarchy, we shall move to create our own set of crown jewels utilizing the local minerals of our beloved state. Adorned with the only verified diamond ever found on Texas soil - a small, brown thing found in 1911 - along with other locally sourced gemstones such as amethysts, amber, augite, fluorite, epidote, gadinite, garnet, labradorite, microcline, opal, obsidian, pearl, and jasper, and centered with a large blue topaz - the national mineral of our beloved state - this new crown shall become the icon of our new dynasty and throne, made entirely of precious minerals only found here in our Texas."
TXSKING.5.a:0 "It might be gaudy, but it's ours."

TXSKING.6.t:0 "Aspiring to Splendor"
TXSKING.6.d:0 "With our monarchy being established, we will need a place to seat the throne and the Crown. We could either renovate the Governor’s Mansion for such a purpose, being the historic estate of Texas’ executive since 1855, or we could petition local architects and builders to construct a new, unique palace truly fitting of our new king. While the latter option would be far more expensive, it would also be far more prestigious, though the Governor’s Mansion itself is a sight to behold as well with deep historic significance all its own. What shall we decide?"
TXSKING.6.a:0 "Renovating the Governor's Mansion should suffice."
TXSKING.6.b:0 "Our King deserves a true palace, not some republican dormitory!"

TXSKING.7.t:0 "Whoooowee, Would Ya Look at That!"
TXSKING.7.d:0 "With our decision to construct a new palace for our monarch, work began right away, and now after weeks of waiting, it would seem that the task is finally done. Built in a fusion of European noble styles and the plantation architecture of Southern icons such as Andrew Jackson’s The Hermitage,  this new palace is the perfect seat of power for the new Crown to rule from. With a mighty new throne being erected within its central hall, our king shall soon be able to move into this work of architectural art, bringing us one step closer to the coronation."
TXSKING.7.a:0 "Job well done."

TXSKING.8.t:0 "A Proper Coronation"
TXSKING.8.d:0 "With his own set of crown jewels, a new palace to call his own, and a new kingdom ready and waiting before him, Andrew Jackson Houston - son of the great Texan hero Sam Houston - has been officially crowned as the King of Texas. Coronated in a lavish ceremony similar in style to the German ceremonies used during the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm in stark contrast to his initial, rough, and dirty ‘coronation’ he had when he declared the end of the Republic, Andrew Jackson Houston now leads our infantile monarchy while emulating the noble and charismatic strongman hero of the people image his own father displayed. A military man of high education, having attended West Point and Baylor University among other prestigious academies and being a practiced lawyer himself, Houston is expected to rule as a wise, measured, and military-minded academic with a soft spot for lily-white Republicanism and Texan conservatism. May the House of Houston under this new Crown serve Texas and her people for centuries to come."
TXSKING.8.a:0 "All under a lone crown in the Lone Star State."

TXSKING.9.t:0 "A Drive Around the Capital"
TXSKING.9.d:0 "After another day of guiding the nation, the King simply wished to engage in some rest, recreation, and relation - a luxury long denied to him over the recent months of nonstop work and pageantry. Sneaking out of the old Presidential Mansion, [root.getleader] got in the driver's seat of his personal vehicle - a jet black 1936 Chrysler Six sportscar - and took off, touring the city alone while trying to enjoy the peace of anonymity and solitude. These hopes were quickly dashed though as His Majesty was recognized by local citizens walking around Downtown Austin, who all called out to their cruising king. Seeing enough of the city, [root.getleader] turned round and began to take the slow, easy cruise home when fate rolled its die. Just as his Chrysler roadster began crossing at a green light, his peaceful train of thought was derailed by the gut-wrenching sounds of blaring horns and the shrill squeal of burning rubber as a large delivery truck ran the red light, barreling through the intersection and directly at the King’s automobile."
TXSKING.9.a:0 "SWERVE!"

TXSKING.10.t:0 "Tragedy Strikes"
TXSKING.10.d:0 "This evening, a tragic car wreck occurred in Downtown Austin near the Austin Book Depository Building between the Chrysler sportscar of our beloved king and the truck of a drunk transportation worker who had been drinking on the job off smuggled whiskey. While the worker was largely unharmed, the King himself was gravely wounded and has since been rushed to the Austin State Hospital. Now, the nation waits in agony as we await the news of our King’s ultimate fate."
TXSKING.10.a:0 "Despite their best attempts, our beloved king is declared dead at midnight."
TXSKING.10.b:0 "After a miraculous surgery, he survives, albeit needing months of recovery"

TXSKING.11.t:0 "A Question of Succession"
TXSKING.11.d:0 "As the nation grieves for its King the unenviable question of who should succeed him remains to be answered. While the King himself had no rival claimants, he had also had no sons, just one daughter named Adriane. A regency council made up of former royal advisors and military loyalists have gathered to discuss the question. Many want to crown King Houston’s oldest child Adriane T Houston as Queen, pointing out that nowhere in the Kingdom’s Constitution does it specifically declare that women could not inherit in any circumstance. Another group however has denounced the proposition. While they admire Adriane, they feel, for various reasons, that she is unfit to rule. Instead she must give way to another ruler, most likely a foreigner. As the debate rages through the night and early hours of the morning a decision is finally reached."
TXSKING.11.a:0 "Adriane T Houston is the King's own, she must be allowed to rule"
TXSKING.11.b:0 "She is not fit to rule, another must be found"

TXSKING.12.t:0 "Coronation of the Queen"
TXSKING.12.d:0 "Today Queen Adrianne has received the crown in a glorious coronation. In front of a crowd of thousands of public spectators and every person of import in the Kingdom she was crowned Queen Adriane I of Texas. She has pledged to uphold her father’s vision of a strong and independent Texas and to bring the Kingdom nothing but peace, prosperity and wealth through her reign. While some fringe elements of the nation still protest her coronation, by and large her ascension has been met with wild cheers and patriotic fervor. Texas has entered a new, prosperous age."
TXSKING.12.a:0 "Long live the queen"

TXSKING.13.t:0 "Regency"
TXSKING.13.d:0 "With the direct descendants of the late King Houston disqualified the debate has now shifted to just who will have the crown. As with everything, camps have formed. While there are numerous minor proposals, surprisingly the largest camp of the councilmen have come out in favor of a Bohemian King. Texas’s Bohemian minority have already become rich and influential in the Kingdom, by catering to them we could assure their continued support for the monarchy. Alternative proposals also suggest Kings that could draw us closer to alliances of signifance to better preserve Texas, but without such preexisting ties, such notions are certain to be fringe at most."
TXSKING.13.a:0 "It is decided that a Czech noble would best endear themselves to Texas"
TXSKING.13.b:0 "In solidarity with our German allies ,the Kaiser is chosen"
TXSKING.13.c:0 "Wishing to strengthen Entente ties, Stanley Bruce is nominated"

TXSKING.14.t:0 "A Question of Dynasty"
TXSKING.14.d:0 "Now that we have chosen to crown a Bohemian King a final question has been raised. There are currently two major contenders for the throne in Bohemia and now Texas. There is Adolph Schwarzenberg and Maximilian Lobkowicz. Preliminary discussions with both potential Kings have been received favorably and things look to be all set. All the Council has to do is decide on one, which is easier said than done apparently. The more traditional supporters want Maximilian as his family is one of the oldest in Bohemia with prominent members dating back to the 1500s. The other camp supporting Adolph pointed out his more modern outlook and support for liberal movements in Europe and the world as a whole."
TXSKING.14.a:0 "Lobkowicz"
TXSKING.14.b:0 "Schwarzenberg"

TXSKING.15.t:0 "The Czech Coronation"
TXSKING.15.dlobkowicz:0 "As Maximilian Lobkowicz stepped off the plane he was met with an enthusiastic crowd. An enthusiasm Maximilian returned in spades. While never having been to Texas before being offered the newly minted Texan crown he had done his reading and had hired a Texan to teach him English. While he is still plainly early in his studies of the local culture, his determination has still won him the admiration of many who were at one time suspicious of a foreign King, much less a Bohemian. As he was driven to the Houston Palace to receive his crown Lobkowicz waved at the crowds who had gathered to watch him pass. When he arrived and was crowned, all knew they were witnessing history in the making. With the crown firmly on his head, Maximilian rose with the cheers from the crowd and all in attendance were sure they were witnessing the start of a new golden age."
TXSKING.15.dschwarzenberg:0 "Today Adolph Schwarzenberg landed in Houston to an adoring crowd. The King’s private plane had brought him all the way from Bohemia where he probably expected to rule, to a land he had no ties to, has no monarchist tradition and is completely alien to his home. However, in a short speech given to the crowd at the top of the stairs Adolph promised to give Texas a monarch they could be proud of and to respect the unique and powerful Texan culture. The resultant cheers threatened to deafen those in attendance. Adolph then proceeded to the Houston Palace, the former home of the short lived Houston dynasty, and received his crown in a ceremony that was equal parts simple and elegant. As he rose Adolph looked out upon his land and realized he had a lot of work to do if Texas was to be given the Golden Age he had promised."
TXSKING.15.a:0 "Long live the King!"

TXSKING.16.t:0 "A Kaiser for Texas"
TXSKING.16.d:0 "Today Kaiser Wilhelm landed in Houston to find a crowd of Texans eagerly awaiting him. He left his plane and entered into a wall of cheers for him, for Germany and for his new Kingdom. The Kaiser, clearly taken aback by this outpouring of monarchist support from a nation that had, until recently, a history of anti-monarchist republicanism, seemingly recovered quickly and led the crowd in three loud “Hurrah!”s for the new Kingdom he was to lead. As he walked the few dozen feet to the car he was bombarded with questions from the crowd in both German and English, questions he had no time to answer. Instead he was rushed to the Houston Palace to be crowned. After the short and precise ceremony, which Wilhelm would later remark was preferable to the overly long European ceremonies, the Kaiser gave a speech to his new subjects. In it he thanked them for trusting him with the new Crown and swore that he would lead Texas into a new era of prosperity, hand in hand with their newl brothers in Berlin. This was given another three hurrahs by the crowd of aristocrats and public officials. Texas loved the Kaiser, and the Kaiser was quickly learning to love Texas."
TXSKING.16.a:0 "Lang lebe der Kaiser!"

TXSKING.17.t:0 "A British Coronation"
TXSKING.17.d:0 "In a style reminiscent to the British coronations at Westminster, Sir Stanley Melbourne Bruce was sworn in as the new King and Sovereign of the Kingdom of Texas, sealing our fate and tying our once fully independent kingdom permanently to that of the wider Anglosphere. Long despising his own given names, our new monarch affectionately goes by the name of King S., flagrantly flying in the face of standard British royal customs. Though from a relatively elite family, Bruce is a rough and tough true son of the Outback, and has taken to the ranching life of Texas quite while, adapting to local culture and customs with relative ease. Even seen walking around in cowboy boots and a ten-gallon hat in his off-time when not in full regalia, King S. is sure to be the down to earth, conservative man’s man that Texas truly needs to tame this wild new outback for the renewed Entente."
TXSKING.17.a:0 "God save the King!"

TXSKING.31.t:0 "Brothers in Arms"
TXSKING.31.d:0 "With so many Czech industries setting up shop here in Texas, our economy has begun to boom like never before, rapidly healing the damage wrought by the chaos surrounding our independence. However, with foreign companies like Skoda and Moser establishing factories and stalls here with little knowledge of how our businesses operate, there has been some friction. Breaking from this pattern, one company making a near-seamless transition to Texan life is the firearms manufacturer Ceska Zbrojovka, or CZ for short. \n\nHaving long held business ties with the Connecticut-based gun company Colt, CZ has understood how to operate and deal with American businesses for quite some time. Utilizing their contacts with various firearms manufacturers with shops here in Texas, including Colt, CZ has quickly risen to become one of the single most popular gun-makers in Texas - quite a feat in one of the most gun-saturated markets on Earth. However, no one quite loves guns like a true Texan, and as such CZ has been taken in and respected as if it were another American company itself."
TXSKING.31.a:0 "Perhaps one day they can even propose a merger."

TXSKING.32.t:0 "The Moravian Church of Texas"
TXSKING.32.d:0 "As more and more Czechs and other Catholic Slavs come to our Texas, Protestantism has become increasingly less dominant in the Lone Star Kingdom, but that has not stopped certain groups from trying to stem the tide. One such group, shockingly not native Texans themselves and instead some of the Czech immigrants, have brought the teachings of Jan Hus, Petr Chelcicky, and the Moravian Brethren - formally the Unitas Fratrum - to our nation, establishing the official Moravian Church of Texas with deep links to the central Moravian Brethren back in Czechia. Though seemingly foreign, Hussite religion has a long history in America, with some of the first colonists bringing it over as America was first settled, with New Yorker Moravians even converting the local Mohican tribes before being expelled. With Moravian Church head Gustav Adolf Prozchazka even coming to visit the first of the new churches being established in the name of the Lamb of God, this new religious movement is sure to continue and preserve Texas’ proud Protestant history."

But it appears that President Allred will rule for another day, remaining the President of the Reborn Republic and keeping Texas a haven for Liberal Democracy in the chaos of the American Civil War.

His Party was formed from more radical leftists who were too moderate for Allred’s mainstream left. Many in this coalition are further left than Johnson, though they so far hold little sway. Johnson’s grip on power is fragile, as his party only holds on to the government by the skin of their teeth. To stay in Power Johnson may even have to make deals with more radical Socialist subsets of the party. But for now, Johnson and his Vice-President Ralph Yarborough are focusing on brining Equality to Texas, and breaking down old barriers such as segregation and Poll Taxes. "

TXS_centralism_desc:0 "As a close ally of many of America's top Communists such as Earl Browder, Jay Lovestone and Israel Amter, as well as to other more moderate Leftist groups like Farmer-Labor, Bob Minor has taken influence from a great many competing ideals, fusing ideas like Browder's broadly democratic 'big tent' focus of inclusive Leftist Unity and the Browderist philosophy of Americanist 'Apple Pie Socialism' form-fit for the American people with a non-authoritarian form of Lovestone's American take on Bukharinist Market Socialism all mixed with Minor's own progressive Texan patriotism with a twist of Farmer-Labor agrarianism and even some influences from his political start as an anarchist and trade unionist. And while many of the new 'Top Dogs' in Chicago are less than welcoming to the concept of Texan independence, Minor's passion has convinced the likes of Red America that Texas' declaration of independence, while brought on by reaction, is also the natural expression of revolutionary liberation."

Indeed, under the Socialist Party's watch Texas' once corrupt and rotten-to-the-core Political scene has firmly been redeemed. Our President, a truly gifted and powerful cartoonist, has renounced art for politics, and has made a gesture of total subservience to politics after years as an anarchist despising and denouncing politics."

With this being the case, the Monarchy has begun a great campaign to honor the legacy of one of the greatest men of the 19th century.

Doing this via tact use of the newly acquired funds from wealth seizures, Texas shall soon be a beacon of populist thought. Not only does doing this greatly increase the people’s well being, it reflects greatly on the Monarchy itself, which still struggles to connect with the people.

###Tooltips###
KTX_darkest_hour:0 "The Texan Kaiserreich"
KTX_darkest_hour_desc:0 "Forced from our homeland and made to flee like rats from the Syndicalist Hordes. This is truly the darkest hour our nation has ever experienced. Let us rally those who remain loyal to our cause, the promise of reclaiming our lands a rallying cry."
KTX_kili:0 "Der Schuss am Kilimandscharo"
KTX_kili_desc:0 "When we fled our homeland we did not manage to bring much of our infrastructure or equipment. What we did manage to salvage was our vital nuclear research. We shall conduct a test at El Paso to help us maximise the potential of these weapons to help us to return us home."
KTX_air:0 "Fünf Wochen in der Luft"
KTX_air_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly our air force was all but lost in the flight to Texas. We must retrain and drill the former Texan air force to our imperial standards or else retaking the mainland will prove to be a near-impossibility."
KTX_exiled_eco:0 "What Little We Have Left..."
KTX_exiled_eco_desc:0 "What little we have left we need to maximise and use to its full capability. 110% production quotas and squeezing every drop of productivity out of our workforce will go a long way towards achieving this."
KTX_exiled_mil:0 "... We Need To Make Great"
KTX_exiled_mil_desc:0 "Old guns, new guns, it doesn't matter. If it can kill a Frenchman we will build it and use it as effectively as we are able. We have no other choice."
KTX_exiled_eco2:0 "... We Need To Make More"
KTX_exiled_eco2_desc:0 "Our previous initiatives have been successful in providing us with a greater industrial base, but it is simply not enough. We must expand our industries even further if we are to take back the Fatherland."
KTX_exiled_infra:0 "... We Need To Bring Together"
KTX_exiled_infra_desc:0 "Our African domain is vast and hard to traverse making it difficult to pool our limited resources together. We need to improve our infrastructure situation in order to amend this problem."
KTX_exiled_total:0 "Waste Not, Want Not"
KTX_exiled_total_desc:0 "While our industrial programs have borne fruit we are always in need of more production to help us reclaim the birthright. We shall order all factories and local officials to redouble their efforts."
KTX_spirit_of_resistance:0 "The Spirit of Resistance"
KTX_spirit_of_resistance_desc:0 "The Fatherland is lost. In this time of absolute crisis we must place our faith in Kaiser and Country. Already the people are uniting around the Lion of Afrika, Lettow-Vorbeck, and many are seeing the return of a Weltkrieg-style burgfriedenspolitik truce in party politics."
KTX_afrikakorps:0 "German Cowboys"
KTX_afrikakorps_desc:0 "Cowboys are a essential part of Texan Culture, but with Germany arriving, the cowboys have become a vital tool to reclaim the birthright"
KTX_the_way_home:0 "Our Only Way Home"
KTX_the_way_home_desc:0 "Attempting to restore and replenish the Kaiserliche Marine would go a long way in helping us return to Berlin. This is our only goal and all other objectives must be cast aside in pursuit of it."
KTX_walking_over_water:0 "Walking Over Water"
KTX_walking_over_water_desc:0 "We must travel long and far to return to the Fatherland, and as such we must plan and prepare accordingly. A determined effort to produce and requisition troop transports is an absolute must."
KTX_old_enemies_new_allies:0 "Take the Panama Canal"
KTX_old_enemies_new_allies_desc:0 "The Panama Canal is a vital port to control if we want to retake the Vaterland. We need to buldoze the pathetic microstates that stand in our way"
KTX_our_continent:0 "Our Dominion"
KTX_our_continent_desc:0 "Ever since the continent's fate was decided at the Berlin Conference in 1884 we have held certain affinity for it as part of our desire for a Place in the Sun. Now that we reside on the dark continent we shall make sure our ties to the land are borne out in practice, at both a national and local level."
KTX_crush_france:0 "Crush France"
KTX_crush_france_desc:0 "While there is a cruel irony in that we and the French have both been exiled from Europe, it is the only affinity that we share. We should crush them, seize their holdings and adapt their industries to better forge the way for our homecoming. There can be no mercy."
KTX_afrikakorps2:0 "Museum Pieces"
KTX_afrikakorps2_desc:0 "No longer can we let our old arms sit in glass cabinets to be ogled by gentlemen in their hunting lodges. Every musket and elephant gun we have must be thrust into the hands of those capable of bearing them. After all, they did help win us one Weltkrieg. They shall win us a second."
KTX_afrikakorps3_1:0 "A New Berlin"
KTX_afrikakorps3_1_desc:0 "We will grant the exiled Germans further powers in return for their loyal service to the Vaterland in its time of despair. Hopefully this will encourage more to sign up."
KTX_afrikakorps3_2:0 "Texas Forever"
KTX_afrikakorps3_2_desc:0 "Though there have been calls to throw our principles to the wind in order to sign up more Native Germans, they should be ignored. We will not return to Berlin by any means necessary, and extending suffrage and protections to Afrikans is intolerable to any good German."

KTX_business_desc:0 "Canada has been a useful ally in helping us to reclaim the homeland, and for this they have our respect. This does not however mean that they are no longer a threat to our Empire, and realpolitik comes before all other concerns. After all, it is only business."
KTX_aog:0 "Retake the A.O.G"
KTX_aog_desc:0 "The Loyal forces of the AOG have been figting on in our abscence. It is time to intergrate their forces back into the Vaterland"
KTX_gea:0 "Ingtergrate the East Asian Command"
KTX_gea_desc:0 "The Loyal forces of German East Asia have been figting on in our abscence. It is time to intergrate their forces back into the Vaterland"
KTX_dei:0 "Take the East Indies"
KTX_dei_desc:0 "The Dutch East Indies have been abandoned, but, we cannot let them survive as an independent nation. They are weak, and we need to pick them off. They just have too many valuable rescoursces to let go"
KTX_eyes_south:0 "Eyes South"
KTX_eyes_south_desc:0 "Our gaze now turns south, to Mexico. They have threatened our border for too long. They must be desroyed"

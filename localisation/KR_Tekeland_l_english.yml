### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_FULBERT_YOULOU_DESC:0 "Abbé Fulbert Youlou has risen to become the first President of an independent state in the lands of the former French Congo. Born in 1917 and training to become a priest from a young age, this devout Catholic has increasingly evolved both a love for free market capitalism, economic liberalism, and conservative nationalism, and over the course of his young political career, Youlou has espoused a deeply anti-socialist sentiment that has grown to deeply anger the far more Socialist-orientated Northern regions of the nation. Now, this holy-man turned national father serves as the bastion of anti-leftist thought in the Tekeland Clique, with his rule supported by a junior officers clique from the nation’s newly formed military, which has been created from the ashes of the former Franco-German colonial administration."

### Ideas ###

TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea:0 "Defense Against Portugal"
TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea_desc:0 "With German rule shattered in this region, the Portuguese have begun to eye our lands. We must bolster our defences against these colonials and their allies under the Manikongo while still keeping tabs on the bubbling French and German remnants within our own borders, lest our nation be re-colonized before we can even attempt self-rule."
TKE_power_struggle_idea:0 "Pressures of Factionalism"
TKE_power_struggle_idea_desc:0 "Within our infantile government, a great deal of political forces are at war with one another. From anti-democratic Socialists under Alphonse Massamba-Débat, Republican elements centered around Jacques Opangault and Fulbert Youlou, tribal Bateke monarchists rallied around Queen Ngalifourou, and various pro-colonial elements, both European and native, the stage has been set for great conflict or debate. This varied and dynamic political climate has cast a great shadow over our future, and now only time will tell who shall come out on top."
TKE_Queen_Ngalifarou_I_idea:0 "Ngalifarou I"
TKE_Queen_Ngalifarou_I_idea_desc:0 "Despite our republican form of government, which was declared shortly before our independence, our regime still shares power with the local Teke monarchy which served as an autonomous protectorate under Germany. Together with Queen Ngalifarou, Prime Minister Fulbert Youlou and his democratic regime hope to bring true parliamentarism to our new state. However, the Queen’s European contacts and nativist supporters may not be too keen on sharing power with a bunch of democrats, especially when the spectre of Socialism looms on the horizon."

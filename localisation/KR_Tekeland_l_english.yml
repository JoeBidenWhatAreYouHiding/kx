### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_FULBERT_YOULOU_DESC:0 "Abbé Fulbert Youlou has risen to become the first President of an independent state in the lands of the former French Congo. Born in 1917 and training to become a priest from a young age, this devout Catholic has increasingly evolved both a love for free market capitalism, economic liberalism, and conservative nationalism, and over the course of his young political career, Youlou has espoused a deeply anti-socialist sentiment that has grown to deeply anger the far more Socialist-orientated Northern regions of the nation. Now, this holy-man turned national father serves as the bastion of anti-leftist thought in the Tekeland Clique, with his rule supported by a junior officers clique from the nation’s newly formed military, which has been created from the ashes of the former Franco-German colonial administration."

TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea_desc:0 "With German rule shattered in this region, the Portuguese have begun to eye our lands.

TKE_power_struggle_idea_desc:0 "Within our infantile government, a great deal of political forces are at war with one another. From the socialist Mikalé of the messianic André Matswa, Republican elements centered around Jacques Opangault and Fulbert Youlou, tribal Bateke monarchists rallied around Queen Ngalifourou, and various pro-colonial elements, both European and native, the stage has been set for great conflict or debate. This varied and dynamic political climate has cast a great shadow over our future, and now only time will tell who shall come out on top."

TKE_Queen_Ngalifourou_idea_desc:0 "Despite our republican form of government, which was declared shortly before our independence, our regime still shares power with the local Teke monarchy which served as an autonomous protectorate under Germany. Together with Queen Ngalifourou, Prime Minister Fulbert Youlou and his democratic regime hope to bring true parliamentarism to our new state. However, the Queen’s European contacts and nativist supporters may not be too keen on sharing power with a bunch of democrats, especially when the spectre of Socialism looms on the horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n £GFX_Portrait_TKE_Ngalifourou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

### Focuses ###

TKE_coalescing_our_coalition:0 "Coalescing our Coalition"
TKE_coalescing_our_coalition_desc:0 "If we are to truly secure our independence as the colonial construct once called Mittelafrika collapses around us, the various disparate political factions of the French Congo centered around Brazzaville must come together, if only temporarily, in order to create a united front dedicated to the anti-imperialist pursuit of a free Equatorial Africa. The head of this new coalition shall be the honorable statesman Fulbert Youlou, who has campaigned for autonomy or independence first under the French and later the Germans for years, and who also has the favor of the Makoko who still holds great sway over much of the population. Although he may be a bit of a dubious figure given his apparent lust for total control of the wider independence movement, this devout Christian conservative shall be the face of the Free Congo, at least for now, and this fragile coalition shall see us to freedom!"
TKE_meeting_the_makoko:0 "Meeting with the Makoko"
TKE_meeting_the_makoko_desc:0 "The Makoko is the given title to the monarch of the Teke Kingdom, also known as the Anziku Kingdom, the Tio Kingdom, or simply the Great Makoko, and although this once-great kingdom has been reduced to a rump state centered in Mbé near Brazzaville, it still holds great sway over the local political situation even as more modernizing elements wish to break free from their traditionalist influence. The current Makoko is Ngalifourou, queen of Tekeland, who is known as a devout spiritualist devoted to the traditional Teke folk faith and a conservative anti-colonial that has only begrudgingly worked with the imperialists since their arrival, instead favoring a free French Congo where she holds great sway over her own lands, and with Fulbert Youlou - leader of the coalition - being her preferred candidate to lead a wider national government. No matter our attitudes towards Her Highness, we must meet with her all the same."
TKE_courting_democratic_cliques:0 "Courting the Progressive Cliques"
TKE_courting_democratic_cliques_desc:0 "Outside the conservative bloc centered around Youlou and the Makoko, the local political scene is mostly Left-leaning, with both radical and democratic Leftist elements being active and prominent in Brazzaville and beyond. The largest and most moderate of these Leftist political associations is the Parti Progressiste Congolais, or PPC, divided into cliques headed by competing visionaries Pierre Goura, Robert Stéphane Tchitchelle, and party founder Gérald-Félix Tchicaya, and it is these figures that we must now court if our coalition is to be much of a big tent coalition at all. Let compromise and peaceful cooperation guide us, at least until independence is achieved."
TKE_amiable_amicale_alliance:0 "An Amiable Alliance with L'Amicale"
TKE_amiable_amicale_alliance_desc:0 "L'Amicale - short for the Société Amicale des Originaires de l'Afrique Equatoriale Française - is an anti-German, anti-imperialist, and openly Leftist political association with open ties to the Commune of France created by the labor organizer turned messianic independence activist André Grenard Matswa. Tied to the nascent trade union movement in Brazzaville, L'Amicale positions themselves as heralds of the Equatorial African revolution while using spiritualist populism, various Socialist rhetoric, and grassroots activism to spread their message throughout the downtrodden masses. Popular with urban workers and the poor, L'Amicale and the wider Matswanist movement are obvious allies, even if only temporarily, in our push for freedom."
TKE_linking_with_libreville:0 "Linking Up with Libreville"
TKE_linking_with_libreville_desc:0 "Just across our northeastern border lies Gabon, another recently independent nation set loose from the collapse of Mittelafrika. Currently under the command of our fellow francophile the conservative strongman Leon M’Ba, Gabon could be a strong ally in these trying times, for we both seek to weaken the Portuguese-backed Manikongo to the South and the German-backed Belgian Congo across the Congo River. Hopefully, those in Libreville feel the same way."
TKE_arms_from_old_masters:0 "Arms from our Old Masters"
TKE_arms_from_old_masters_desc:0 "Although the Kaiserreich has been our colonial overlord since the Great War, or at least was until Mittelafrika’s sudden collapse, it was the French that first colonized this land back in 1882, and it was these French that laid the cultural and political foundations that we build from today. Always holding links to the French, and even still largely speaking their language, for Germany never really caught on here in the decade and a half or so they controlled the colony, we shall instead reach out to our old colonial overlords, whether it be the governments in Algiers or Paris, as we seek arms and supplies to win this war for our independence."
TKE_rally_political_militias:0 "Rally Political Paramilitaries"
TKE_rally_political_militias_desc:0 "Colonialism breeds many things, primarily resentment and resistance from the local inhabitants if given enough time and grief. As such, the French Congo is rife with locally-organized political paramilitaries from across the spectrum all with different ideological systems in mind, but all holding one thing in common - the burning desire for a free nation to call our own. We shall tap into these zealous radicals and dedicated militants to form a loosely-organized and decentralized military vanguard of sorts - a politically-educated officer class with members from across the aisle all dedicated to anti-colonialism and the pursuit of our complete sovereignty, no matter the cost. These men shall help train our militias and our infantile armed forces alongside the few actual officers we have that served in the colonial corps."
TKE_settle_old_scores:0 "Settle our Score with the Manikongo"
TKE_settle_old_scores_desc:0 "The time has come to march against the treacherous Manikongo to the south! The historic rivals of the Anziku Kingdom, the once formidable Kongo has been reduced to a pathetic lapdog of the Portuguese far past their prime with deluded aspirations of uniting the Kongo river basin under his foreign-tainted rule. The Manikongo and his government shall fall, freeing the Bakongo people from the clutches of European imperialism and brainwashing at long last while securing our southern border and the lucrative Congo river basin and its ports for ourselves. To arms!"
TKE_victory_against_lapdogs:0 "Prevailing Against the Portuguese Pretender"
TKE_victory_against_lapdogs_desc:0 "We have finally been proven victorious over the foreign-backed government of the Manikongo, and with it, the Portuguese will have a say in Congolese affairs no longer. Now, we must work to consolidate our hold over the Congo River Basin and prepare our infantile government for the nation building challenges that are to come. Freedom has been achieved at long last, at least for now, but it shall be a long road to stability and prosperity, and the wolves are already circling both abroad and domestically. We must be prepared."
TKE_fate_of_coalition:0 "Fate of the Crumbling Coalition"
TKE_fate_of_coalition_desc:0 "In a move that was not unexpected but also certainly not helpful, the fragile coalition formed around Fulbert Youlou with support from Queen Ngalifourou has begun to crack and crumble seemingly beyond repair, threatening to fully collapse lest a political miracle can occur to pull the disparate factions of the French Congo’s diverse political movement together once more. However, with the threat of total annihilation and continued foreign oppression no longer directly looming overhead now that independence has been won, this shall be harder than it sounds. What shall become of the coalition is not sure, but we shall soon decide its fate once and for all..."

TKE_beyond_brazzaville:0 "Beyond Brazzaville"
TKE_beyond_brazzaville_desc:0 "After the initial reforms of our government begin to bear fruit, the Congo now breathes a sigh of relief as we finally recover from both our bloody independence war and the bitter factionalism that had shook the young nation to its very core. With these domestic issues at rest, we shall look outwards to defend our newfound independence as well as exert our influence across Africa. By utilizing our unique position at the heart of Africa, we will use our geography as a springboard to become an important player in African affairs."
TKE_unite_moyen_congo:0 "Uniting 'Mittelkongo'"
TKE_unite_moyen_congo_desc:0 "Following our war of independence against the crumbling giant of Mittelafrika and the armies of the Manikongo and his Portuguese backers, we have brought the former colony of Moyen-Congo under the administration of Brazzaville once more. We were able to expel these colonial forces through an alliance with Gabon, another French-speaking nation fighting to secure its independence. Although we faced a common foe, this conflict has left Libreville and Brazzaville to compete for influence over the region of Mittelkongo, the former German colony comprising Gabon and Moyen-Congo. Either through means of war or leveraging with our allies, we will make sure that our designs for the post-colonial order are fully realised."
TKE_new_allies:0 "New Allies, Old Adversaries"
TKE_new_allies_desc:0 "The emergence of new states from the carcass of Mittelafrika has led to what can be described as a second Scramble for Africa. With its vast resources free from the grip of German industrialists, foreign powers have restored to more indirect means to exert their influence over these new nations. With this new post-colonial world taking form, we must choose our new allies wisely. Shall we return to the fold of our old masters on equal footing, join the Internationale in their struggle against colonialism, or forge a new path alongside our African brethren?"
TKE_towards_equatorial_africa:0 "Towards Equatorial Africa"
TKE_towards_equatorial_africa_desc:0 "For decades, Brazzaville has played a central role for both the French and German colonial administrations. Serving as the capital of both French Equatorial Africa and later the entirety of Äquatorialafrika, our city has grown rapidly to administer such an expansive and diverse territory. As we move to secure our nation's newfound independence, we shall look to expand Congolais influence into our northern frontier. Hosting an array of rival governments ranging from the German redoubt in Kamerun to the socialist revolutionaries of the Adamawa Clique, Islamic chiefdoms to the far north, and the unstable government of [CEA.getleader] in Ubangi-Shari, we will work diligently to establish a foothold in Equatorial Africa."
TKE_towards_congo_basin:0 "Crossing the Mto Kongo"
TKE_towards_congo_basin_desc:0 "With the fall of Mittelafrika, the delicate balance of power in the former Belgian Congo has utterly collapsed. With colonial holdouts, mercenaries, rogue capitalists, and native cliques each vying for power, there seems to be no end in sight for this conflict. To secure our eastern flank, we will play our hand and cross the Congo River to help restore order to this vast and resource rich land. We must plan accordingly, either achieving our goals through forging strong alliances with these upstart cliques or escalating our intervention by claiming the mantle of a free Congo for ourselves."
TKE_restoring_mittelafrika:0 "Restoring the Behemoth"
TKE_restoring_mittelafrika_desc:0 "After our victorious military campaigns across Equatorial Africa, the forces of the Queen Mother have accomplished the impossible. Once a curious statelet at the edge of the Congo, the Tiyo Kingdom has risen to become the sole giant of Equatorial Africa. As we reach the zenith of the Anziku golden age, our colonial benefactors have insisted that Queen Mother march her warriors towards the kingdom’s ultimate goal, the restoration of Mittelafrika. With the tantalizing prospect of Africa’s vast mineral wealth under our joint ownership, only time will tell if we can retain our overlordship over this reforged colonial monolith."
TKE_unite_bas_congo:0 "The Realm of the Bantu"
TKE_unite_bas_congo_desc:0 "After outmanoeuvring his rivals both domestically and abroad, Abbé Youlou has triumphed over his enemies and has emerged as the unquestioned master of Equatorial Africa. While the young priest could simply bask in this already impressive victory and amass a fortune from his current graft, Youlou is a man of great ambitions. The young Abbé shall make preparations to lead his flock towards the realization of his ambitious dream, the unification of not only the Bas-Congo region, but all Bantu peoples under his righteous leadership. Youlou’s proposed unification of his Bantu brethren shall not only serve as an African bulwark against the siren song of socialism, but also allow the Abbé to expand his kleptocracy and line his cassock with new opportunities for wealth."
TKE_unite_latin_africa:0 "Uniting Latin Africa"
TKE_unite_latin_africa_desc:0 "In our fellow Francophone nation of Ubangi-Shari, the young firebrand Barthélemy Boganda has made a name for himself in democratic circles. The uncle of the mad Askari, Jean-Bédel Bokassa, Boganda has used his familial ties to advocate for the unification of the Latin nations of Equatorial Africa under one banner. This proposal for pan-Latin unity has swept through the PPC, with its fervent adherents wishing to co-op Boganda’s beliefs in Brazzaville and march towards Latin unity under our leadership."
TKE_unite_french_africa:0 "Uniting Francophone Africa"
TKE_unite_french_africa_desc:0 "Although we have liberated our brothers in the Congo and Equatorial Africa from the clutches of imperialism, large portions of our diasporic kin continue to languish under colonial rule. Utilising our ties to our parent organization, Mikalé, we will make contacts across West Africa to make preparations for a final blow to bring an end to French reactionism in Algiers. From the bustling cities of Dakar and Ouagadougou to our far-flung Malagasy brothers in Madagascar, we will not rest until our kin are free from the shackles of colonialism."

TKE_revival_of_the_kingdom:0 "Triumph of the House of Makoko"
TKE_revival_of_the_kingdom_desc:0 "The eternal squabbling of the republicans and socialists proved without a doubt that their ideologies and modern nonsense would lead to nothing more than chaos and confusion here in the Middle Congo. With these agitators and false prophets swept aside, the new Kingdom of Teke will rise to greatness, guided by the benevolent and wise Man Ounko Ngalifourou and her loyal supporters. There is much work to be done until the devastation wrought by the internal conflict and the wider collapse of the German colonial behemoth can be undone, but under the crown we are likely to succeed and thrive once more!"
TKE_deal_with_socialists_and_republicans:0 "Strike at Socialists and Republicans"
TKE_deal_with_socialists_and_republicans_desc:0 "The socialists of Mikalé and the republicans of PPC may have served a purpose in the war against the German colonials and the Portuguese lapdogs, but their constant blabbering about outlander ideologies and supposed promises of freedom, equality and stability are little more than lofty ideals at best and outright falsehoods and lies at worst, meant to deceive the traditional populace of the Teke territory. The Republicans would sell our traditions and customs away for profit and vainglorious prestige, while the socialists would make the Teke territory little more than a protectorate of the French, merely coated crimson. If our nation is to thrive and pursue true glory here in the heart of Africa, we cannot allow such serpents to make their nest among our people. Loyal men of the Man Ounko will go from village to village and get rid of these troublemakers by any means necessary until only those with love for the Kingdom in their hearts remain to serve. Only then may we know peace, unity and prosperity."
TKE_collaborate_with_colonial_officers:0 "Collaborate with Colonial Officers"
TKE_collaborate_with_colonial_officers_desc:0 "The French colonial administration existed in the lands of the Teke from the first treaty in 1880 to the end of the Weltkrieg, and elements of it persisted even throughout the German reorganization of these territories. While many French colonists left to Algiers to fight alongside the Petainist republicans and nationalists, for many the Moyen-Congo territories had become a home in themselves, and they formed a part of the German administration, some no doubt hoping that one day the French tricolour would once more fly over these lands. The Germans introduced a whole host of new laws and directives to their freshly acquired colony, but while there was a degree of colonist outflow, they relied extensively on existing French treaties and colonial outposts to rule these primitive lands. With the collapse of Mittelafrika, we now have both French and German colonists in our lands, confused and directionless. Most have of course once again left for greener pastures in the remaining pockets of German or French colonial order, but plenty have also stayed behind. We should offer these vagabonds jobs in the running of the new Teke Kingdom, to ensure as smooth a transition as possible."
TKE_teke_spiritualism:0 "Teke Spiritualist Revival"
TKE_teke_spiritualism_desc:0 "It is no secret that Queen Ngalifourou and her late husband and king Iloo I were big proponents for the Teke to get closer to the French, and in fact, it was Ngalifourou who signed the first treaty between French authorities and traditional African royal house, and while the situation between the French and Teke would vex and wane depending on who was ruling in Paris at the time, the relationship between the tribes of our territory and the colonialists remained rather good. However, one line that Ngalifourou was never ready to cross was the adoption of the Christian faith. Catholic missionaries and local colonial officials, and later German Protestant ones, all attempted to convert the tribes of our land to their Western faith, but thanks to the intervention of Man Ounko, this never came to pass. To this day, our faith is our own, and under the guidance of the Queen Mother, it shall remain so. Queen Ngalifourou maintains a highly important position in the faith as she embodies the spirit of Nkwe Mbali, associated with the crown. In addition to her role as the monarch of our nation, she receives pilgrims from all around our kingdom, standing as the greatest beacon of the old ways in our small state. With the Queen’s rule solidified, we will revive the spiritualist ways of the Teke Kingdom to the fullest extent, and attempt to sway as many converts to Christianity back to the light of old faith."
TKE_power_to_the_queen_mother:0 "All Power to the Queen Mother"
TKE_power_to_the_queen_mother_desc:0 "After the death of former king Makoko, or Iloo I, in 1892, Queen Mother Ngalifourou has continued to rule as the mother of all Tekes. While she has married other kings of the kingdom, belonging to the thirteen different vassals of the main kingdom itself, Ngalifourou holds supreme authority in matters of the state and spiritual realm. This stems from the local Teke tradition of vesting both kings and queens with equal amounts of power, and as Ngalifourou succeeded the latest king, her influence on the realm remains the strongest. This is partially also because of her strong control of the territory of Ngabé and the city of Mbé, the capital of the kingdom, though the queen’s excellent qualities as a sovereign have not been ignored by the populace of nation. With the opponents of the regime swept away, we must now set to work to ensure that the Man Ounko of the Teke has the main authority in these diverse territories of ours, and that all the kings of the Teke will fall in line with the new monarchist system."
TKE_return_to_french_authority:0 "Return to Foreign Authority?"
TKE_return_to_french_authority_desc:0 "Since the 1880s to the end of the Weltkrieg and the collapse of the French Republic, the Teke Kingdom had been a protectorate of the French. This agreement was brokered between Makoko Iloo I and the French officer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. The kingdom became Moyen-Congo, nominally a territory of France but in reality, thirty French companies were sold much of the colony’s land. These companies would engage in large resource extraction projects in hopes of making the territory a veritable gold mine, but most soon found their coffers emptier than before with little to show for the lost investments. To the local Teke, these projects were costly as the tribesmen and -women were treated like slaves, but given the financial setbacks the French experienced, the territories of the Teke were more often than not left completely untouched by the white men. Despite the harsh treatment on behalf of the companies of France, Ngalifourou and her supporters hold a certain degree of hesitancy towards fully detaching from foreign rule. The new situation in the heart of Africa is violent and chaotic, and even if the French may have mistreated our people in the past, it is perhaps better to deal with the devil you know than the ones stalking the jungles of former Mittelafrika. However, the decision lies with Man Ounko as always, and her people look to the Queen for guidance."
TKE_woman_of_the_whites:0 "Ngalifourou, the Woman of the Whites"
TKE_woman_of_the_whites_desc:0 "Queen Mother Ngalifourou has earned many a moniker during her long reign, given by both her most ardent supporters to celebrate this venerable beacon of Teke might, and by her many bitter enemies in pointless attempts to sully said might. One that is shared by both however is the nickname ‘women of the whites’, given to Ngalifourou due to her prowess in dealing with the Europeans. Since Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza first visited these lands, Ngalifourou has remained the one constant in European-Teke relations, and our Man Ounko left such a lasting expression on de Brazza that the French officer even gifted a high-end sabre to the Queen. With the Queen leading with a strong hand, her expertise in dealing with the Europeans will surely help the Teke people reach their rightful place in the world."
TKE_a_modernized_tribal_monarchy:0 "Modernize our Tribal Monarchy"
TKE_a_modernized_tribal_monarchy_desc:0 "Modern world requires modern solutions, and this applies even to the Kingdom of Teke, as much as some traditionalists wish to resist the wheels of human progress. Man Ounko Ngalifourou has never been one to excessively push for change, and most of her supporters would be content with simply continuing the status quo that the heirs of Anziku have maintained since first emerging as a force in the region. Still, keeping our tribal monarchy as primitive as can be would only invite more Europeans, who would love to add Teke territories to their ever-hungry colonial machines.

Still somewhat of a foreign concept to much of the nation, Kikhounga-Ngot and his clique of Syndo-Matswanists will have to work tirelessly to bring syndicalism inspired by the messiah to Moyen Congo while also making it approachable and palatable to the working masses by utilizing the legacy of our own national father and populist prophet."

teke.1.t:0 "Formation of the 'Teke Clique'"
teke.1.d:0 "After so many years under the boot heel of French and German colonials, the time has come for the Congolais people to rise up in arms for their collective freedom. The German colonial behemoth of Mittelafrika has met its gruesome end, falling to the pride and hubris of the Teutons, and now it is the task of Africa’s sons and daughters to pick up the pieces and forge something new out of the great beast’s smouldering form. The people of Middle Congo have emerged from their villages and towns to fight for liberty, and despite their stark differences, a coalition of different political groups has managed to negotiate a temporary alliance on the matter of independence. Republican Congolais parties such as Union Démocratique de Défense des Intérêts Africains and Parti Progressiste Congolais have largely taken the moderating role in the coalition, trying to keep the battle going and their two allies, the monarchists rallying around queen Ngalifourou and the socialists of André Matswa, from being at each others’ throats all the time. However, the ambitions of UDDIA’s leader Fulbert Youlou are suspicious to many, and the coalition is at best a council for the coordination of military action between the various militias commanded by the different groups. However, even this is a small victory, for the newly dubbed Teke Clique is assailed on all sides by the treacherous Manikongo, a Portuguese puppet state of Kongo down to the south, as well as the unpredictable and maniacal Gabonese tyrant Léon M’ba. Unity, even in the form of a very shaky coalition, is very much needed for the Clique to survive against the odds, and while none within the front for freedom are ready to fully bury the hatchet, for the sake of all Congolais people, they must put their internal conflicts aside for the war effort."

teke.2.t:0 "Requesting Foreign Arms"
teke.2.d:0 "As the coalition of different interest groups and political parties attempts to forge a path for true Teke independence, the diverse alliance has run into its first major debate that transcends the usual ideological bickerings of its members. This new roadblock is a conventional one, for the fight of the Teke people for survival of the fledgling nation is not one that can be won with just our traditional weaponry. If the Teke Clique is to triumph over the Portuguese puppets of the Manikongo and the mad president M’ba of Gabon, then true modern leadspitters are required. However, sourcing these weapons is bound to be a difficult affair, and while there are depots and storage locations scattered throughout these lands that still house colonial era weapons of German and French origin, finding and seizing these weapons is no simple task. To make matters worse, many local militias, tribesmen, colonial remnants and bandits have taken the initiative to take these weapons for themselves. As such, there are cliques within the coalition that call for closer cooperation with the global powers to secure arms, rather than press the locals for guns. Queen Ngalifourou and her supporters have suggested greater cooperation with the nationalist French regime in Algiers, for our old connections to them are bound to be an useful tool in negotiations and their ever-growing desire for men and resources could drive them to support us. However, the socialists of Mikale have been adamant on the matter as well, calling for the coalition to seek support from the French Commune instead. They claim that the Internationale’s anti-colonial commitment could prove useful for us, especially given that our enemies are reactionary despots little better than the colonial masters of Mittelafrika. Both of these alliances for weapons would likely come with strings attached, and should we accept their demands, it would greatly empower either Ngalifourou’s faction or the socialists. The coalition’s republicans have been vehement in their calls that relying on outsiders will just sell our newly gained liberty away, and that if Moyen-Congo is to survive its great trial by fire, it must do so on its own, with resources that it alone possesses. Given the situation, republicans such as Fulbert Youlou and Jean-Félix Tchicaya have called for the militias and citizens of the nation to forfeit their weapons for the or the cause of national liberation, for divided militias with their own stashes of old rifles will hardly stop all the enemies Moyen-Congo must face, but a centralized group with all our rifles and pistols combined just might. However, this has been met with a degree of hostility from the various groups already, with some claiming that this is simply the government attempting to demilitarize the population ahead of time so that the republicans can force their own system upon the Congolais. Nonetheless, if the call was far-reaching enough, and the other coalition members agreed that it would be the best course of action given the situation, then the paramilitary groups might just listen to reason. However, any of the options are viable, and the time for a solid decision was yesterday."

teke.3.d:0 "Despite the joyous arrival of the Congolais independence, the war against the Gabonese madman M’ba and the Portuguese lapdog in Kongo is proving to be far from an easy fight. Our enemies are no less determined to see the battle turn in their favour, and while our armies are still in their infancy after long years of colonial rule, all three sides have begun to wield terrible European weapons on the battlefield to achieve dominance. The reality of the matter is that more men are needed for total victory to be won, and this means that the ruling clique must mobilize forces from the three largest members of the coalition. Each of the participants have brought forward a proposal to defend the nation with their own troops, no doubt as a means to gain more leverage in the inevitable power struggle that will follow the war.\n\nMan Ounko Ngalifourou, thanks to her French connections, has been able to gain a small guard force of professional French troops to bolster her tribal militias and royal guard, which would certainly shred our enemies due to the experience and talent of the French veterans. However, given that the Gabonese are also strong allies of the Algiers regime, many fear that these Frenchmen may have their own, hidden loyalties, and could choose to swap sides if Gabon’s armies began to gain ground, though Ngalifourou has ensured the coalition that her contacts with Algiers would not betray the queen. A more reliable, if far less experienced and worse armed force are the militias of the republican coalition, ranging from the tribal Vili forces of Jean Felix-Tchicaya to the fiercely loyal men of Fulbert Youlou.\n\nCompared to the French alternative, we can be sure that the republican militias will not desert us in a time of need, but their combat prowess leaves a lot to be desired. Our final option would be to let the militias and guerilla fighters of André Matswa take over, for while his men are no veterans of Algiers, they are nonetheless fanatical and have been fighting the German colonial order for years. However, if these groups are given free reign to carry out combat operations, the republicans and monarchists fear that they may very well simply choose to carry out a revolution and elevate their venerated Matswa to lead the nation alone."

While the pretender was able to gain ground in the chaos, the counter-attack of the Congolais militias has been able to keep him at bay from the heart of Teke clique, and a final battle for Brazzaville was launched after the clique leadership smelled blood in the water following the Manikongo’s consistent defeats. In a brutal street to street fighting, the forces of the pretender tried to hold onto the city of Brazzaville, but as the monarchist militias of Ngalifourou, the socialist guerillas of Mikale and the republican troops of PPC-UDDIA coalition fought on, it was clear that the Manikongo would stain the ground of Middle Congo with his feet no more.\n\nHundreds lay dead from the bloodbath as the avenues and houses of the once grand city are ravaged by war, but as the smoke pillars reach for the sky, the various victorious groups all begin to bicker among themselves for spoils of war and accolades of glory. The supporters of Man Ounko claim that it was indeed their mighty tribal militias and French volunteer detachment that drove the Portuguese puppet out, while the guerillas of Mikale protest that it was indeed the guiding light of Prophet Matswa that led them to discover the weakness of Pedro’s lackeys and caused them to dislodge the Kongolese from the city. The PPC-UDDIA forces have begun to rebuild the city, but some have also attested that it was not the monarchists or socialists but the republican militias that overwhelmed the Kongolese and led to the final victory. Whoever manages to convince the Congolais people of the righteousness of their claim is likely to win the hearts and minds of the Moyen-Congo to their side, but due to the chaotic and sporadic nature of the fighting, few can tell which side actually contributed the most to the war effort and reclamation of the capital."

Supporters of Queen Ngalifourou and the socialist militias have clashed in Brazzaville following a series of confrontations between tribal leaders and socialist idealists regarding the future Moyen-Congo. Meanwhile the fervent followers of Matswa have been chafing under Fulbert Youlou’s increasingly rabid anti-syndicalist rhetoric, and the socialists of Jacques Opangault are also wary of the republican firebrand’s true intentions. The coalition is hardly one any longer, for infighting and refusal to collaborate between the different groups will reach a fever pitch in the coming days. The time seems perfect for one of the groups to seize the moment and take power before total collapse, for if one side is to come out on top right now, they will have just enough time to consolidate their forces before the other groups are ready for open confrontation.

However, throughout it all, leader of the Union Démocratique de Défense des Intérêts Africains, Fulbert Youlou, has called for calm and for the democratic process to be honoured, and he has been met with support from the Parti Progressiste Congolais and Mouvement Socialiste Africain, the two other parties running for the position of president in the elections. This has somewhat helped matters, and the nation holds its breath as the elections draw to a close. The different participants generally aim to gather the votes of different groups, UDDIA relying heavily on the Catholics, moderate liberals and the Lari tribes for support, MSA fishing for the votes of the urban proletariat, the left-wing intellectuals and those supporters of Andre Matswa who are taking part in the elections. The final party, PPC, is a rather big-tent group, relying on the railway unionists and Catholic workers, the liberal middle-class merchants and academics as well as the cultural sectors of the young Congolais state. The different wings of the party have been at odds with each other from time to time, but given the momentous occasion, they have unified under a singular candidate.

Perhaps the most radical group within the Congress is the Mouvement National de la Révolution, led by Alphonse Débat, with their aim of creating a socialist republic adhering to the principles of the scientific socialism and French-style Jacobinism, though some of Débat’s rivals claim he aims to bring about a Middle Congo built on ‘Bantu socialism’. Fears of Débat forming his own totalitarian regime centered around MNR’s one-party state have driven many to support his two central opponents, Simon-Pierre Kikhounga-Ngot and Jacques Opangault. Kikhounga-Ngot seeks to create a syndicalist state from the jungles and savannahs of Moyen-Congo along the lines of the French Commune, banking on his image as the successor of Matswa for support. His old mentor Opangault on the other hand wishes to moderate the excesses of the revolution and help mend the divides in Congolais society, as well as opening the nation to all of Africa and collaborating with friendly socialists all over the large continent. Only one can emerge victorious, and while wild speculation has swung in favour of all three candidates, only the end of the congress can truly determine which socialist figure shall follow in the footsteps of Matswa."

teke.8.d:0 "Jean Félix-Tchicaya has long been a strong supporter of his native Vili people, coming from a prominent immigrant Vili family of the Bolala clan, and thus it has been a large interest of his to see the former king of the ancient Loango Kingdom restored to his glorious position. In fact, the L’Harmonie group that has so far spread out to much of Moyen-Congo and continues to preach the good word of PPC was originally started to free the previous king of Loango, Moe Poaty II. The Loango royal house is primarily dominated by two clans, Kondi and N’Kata goes back centuries with the two clans switching places depending on which has its member elected to rule, in most cases this has been from the Kondi clan. Moe Poaty II, a member of the N’Kata dynasty, had been imprisoned by the new German colonial overlords on the charges that he restored the traditional trial by ordeal, which was abhorred by the Europeans.\n\nHowever, while Tchicaya’s attempts to free the chieftain failed and he would eventually meet his end at a German prison compound, it was an important stepping stone on the career of the young nationalist. WIth the German yoke thrown away and the independence war behind us, efforts were made by PPC supporters among the Vili to find the missing heir apparent, Moe Poaty III, or as he is known by his traditional title, N'gangue M'voumbe Oussangueme, and thankfully, despite German attempts to curb this quest, he was found in good health near the Angolan border. Moe Poaty III had ascended to the throne already in 1931, after being elected to lead the Loango states, but the Congolais resistance to German rule put him at odds with the local colonialists.\n\nAs the joyous Vili now celebrate their returning king, some have even gone as far as to suggest that Tchicaya should use his powers as the president of Moyen-Congo to install the monarch as not only the leader of the Loango, but all of the territories of the new nation. This would see the restoration of the great Loango Kingdom over all of the Congolais regions, bringing the Vili to the forefront of national politics.\n\nThis could be seen as dangerous overreach by the likes of queen Ngalifourou of the Teke and the more traditionalist-minded Congolais groups, who fear the Christian influences and merchant-nomadism of the Vili, but on the other hand it would be the culmination of Tchicaya’s life work and a great unifying move between the new democratic nation and its ancient traditions. However, a more moderate proposal has also been posited, which would greatly increase the autonomy of the Vili while keeping them contained to their regions as just another part of the larger Congolais whole."

Advisors to the Queen have suggested that the path forward lies either in the collaboration with the local republican democrats or the traditionalist chiefs, both sides holding considerably sway over the Teke people and while they do not necessarily threaten the Queen’s power, either could be a key ally in our fight for the continued survival of the kingdom. There are numerous republicans and socialists in these lands who are fully unsuitable to stand alongside the beloved monarch, but the UDDIA party of Fulbert Youlou forms perhaps the strongest candidate for cooperation. Youlou is a man of relatively modern approach to governance, having been educated in the Christian schools and seminaries, and while he is a devout Christian, his vision on the economy falls into far more liberal directions than could be expected. He has shown a great deal of respect for the Queen and the old ways of the Teke in the past, but some supporters of Ngalifourou spread rumours that the man is also a power-hungry opportunist and prone to esotericism despite his love for the white man’s faith, and thus an alliance with him must be a cautious one lest Youlou tries to seize power for himself and himself alone. The traditional chiefs of the kingdom are a far more reliable ally, for while they contain ambitious men as well, the chiefs are highly localized and focused on the matters of their own people. The Queen represents a branch of the Teke royal family that is only one of five such families, and the new monarch is chosen from a council called Ikil-Mpuh, which is made up of twenty dignitaries from these families. However, if we were to empower traditionalist chiefs, they could have a degree of say in this process as well, as well as getting more influence in the advisory council of the Man Ounko. This would obviously decentralize the power of the Queen further as well. Central part of the debate has also been that of religion, as Youlou’s UDDIA is a highly Christian party while the chiefs of Teke mainly follow the local religion and animist beliefs, though a few have converted to the white man’s faith as well. However, while both of these options offer their strengths and weaknesses, we could also simply continue the current line of the Man Ounko’s governance, given that it has been a tried and tested form of Teke politics for a long time and the Queen’s role is hardly threatened as of now."

teke.12.d:0 "The Teke Kingdom has a long and storied history of independent rule, a freedom that finally ended after the Great Makoko Iloo signed a treaty to transform the Kingdom into a French protectorate in 1880. Under France, the Teke were mostly left to their own devices. Queen Ngalifourou was however a strong supporter of the French, and gained the respect of these colonial masters. The French rulers helped Man Ounko pave a path to political domination by supporting the monarch against her numerous rivals, and this aid was paid back by the Teke as many Congolais troops fought for the French cause during the Weltkrieg. The subsequent German rule did initially hit Ngalifourou harder than most Teke due to this deep French collaboration, but eventually the German colonial order saw it best to continue the collaboration rather than to poke the greatest authority in the region. Ngalifourou’s diplomatic exploits combined with the pragmatic and hands-off approach of the Germans made the German rule a rather beneficial period for the Congolais as well, especially compared to the period of unrest that raged in the German-Belgian Congo. As the kingdom’s internal affairs have stabilized and the Queen is the paramount figure lording over the nation, the question of our foreign commitments have been raised once more. The French connection remains strong, especially given our existing trade connections and ease of communication, as well as Ngalifourou’s existing bias towards the French nationalists. However, the Algiers regime is hardly a powerhouse of global politics anymore, and aligning with them could very well lead to us throwing our lot in with a sinking ship. Another option would be to join the Reichspakt’s embrace once more, given that we have been under German protection for the last twenty years and the collapse of the Mittelafrikan colony could lead to a far more equal relationship between the Teke and Berlin. However, many still remember the German boot hanging over our lands, and thus are not particularly excited to support the Kaiserreich and its colonial holdouts in Africa, fearing that it would bring about yet another period of colonial rule. As such, perhaps the safest option would simply be to remain independent of the white man, given their propensity to imperialist domination."

While the two share little in terms of actual political positions, Youlou respects the queen as a true leader of his people, and despite his republicanism, Ngalifourou has found the young priest far more amicable ally than most other republicans. However, now that UDDIA stands as the sole leader of the new nation, Youlou and his more traditionalist allies have pondered the question of what to do with the queen.\n\nShe is hardly a force capable of toppling the republic now that Moyen-Congo has stabilized and no longer faces an existential threat from beyond its borders, and thus if the republic is to be maintained, Ngalifourou can be left alone to reign in her little tribal realm. Nonetheless, there are those who see this strange camaraderie as the roots of a new system, capable of merging the old traditions and beliefs of the Teke with the modern and forward-thinking ideas of UDDIA. These innovators would see Ngalifourou proclaimed as the constitutional monarch of the Congolais state, maintaining mostly spiritual, regional and ceremonial duties as the long-running crowned head of the new state, while Youlou would act as her prime minister and hold the actual reins of power.\n\nWhile unorthodox, and potentially controversial to our old republican allies in PPC and MSA, it would nonetheless unite much of the traditionalist Teke populace with the more Westernized city-dwellers and middle-class citizens of Moyen-Congo. Either way, the decision is not a critical one, but the topic has gained traction among UDDIA and thus a timely response could solve the matter once and for all."

Thus, the diverse influences of Youlou have made UDDIA an odd mixture of free market capitalism, local mysticism regarding the beloved leader, and Christian democratic influences. Representatives of UDDIA have claimed that under Youlou, the young Congolais state will ensure that profits from investment are to be guaranteed by the state, and that the party will do everything in its power to attract capital which will help fuel the growing economic might of the nation. The Moyen-Congo territory is perhaps not the resource-rich paradise of the larger Congo territory, but it possesses all the makings of a true industrial powerhouse. While the Germans had largely decided to focus on the larger Congo-Vrijstaat, Moyen-Congo had nonetheless been the target of many infrastructure projects, and compared to the larger Congo, illiteracy and lack of societal cohesion were less of a detriment to the smaller Congolais state. As such, Youlou believes that Moyen-Congo could become the business capital of Africa. However, this belief does clash with the Christian ethics of the rest of his party, with some claiming that such unfettered love for the big capital is bound to cause money to replace God in the hierarchy of the Congolais, forgetting good Christian values in name of capitalist debauchery. To avoid a schism within the party, Youlou must impose his will upon the party and use his status as the true leader of UDDIA to ensure that such rebellious sentiments are crushed before they are allowed to fester."

His faction has adopted the name Mouvement Socialiste Africain, with strong links to the French moderate socialist group SFIO as well as other African left-wing groups in Senegal and Niger.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Opangault’s faction was served a bitter blow when Simon-Pierre Kikhounga-Ngot led his own supporter base to split from Opangault’s group, forming a far more syndicalist-oriented group around his union, renaming the entire organization to Mouvement Socialiste Africain - Confédération Générale du Travail to represent the two partnering organization that formed his base. Kikhounga-Ngot has been a pupil of Opangault for many years, but his desire for a truly syndicalist Congolais society has led to disagreements with his mentor, especially when it comes to collaborating with republican figures. The unionist boss has also been a strong claimant to the legacy of Matswa, and has generally been viewed as his successor.\n\nFinal faction, far more authoritarian in nature and one that draws more from Matswa’s communist-inspired ideas than Kikhounga-Ngot or Opangault, is the Mouvement National de la Révolution of Alphonse Massambe-Débat. Debat has long been an admirer of the French communist Jacobins, and has stated that he aims to create the first truly Marxist society in Africa, utilizing the principles of scientific socialism. Focused on rapid industrialization, militant and all-encompassing counter-revolutionary action and the support of other socialist groups in the dark heart of Africa, Debat aims to bring about a truly Jacobinized Moyen-Congo, though his support has been relatively minor compared to the two other followers of Matswa."

teke.16.d:0 "The Teke Kingdom’s homegrown monarch, Man Ounko Ngalifourou, has obviously been a strong opponent to our new socialist regime, but thus far, we have left her alone as the socialist coalition has focused on internal matters. However, clashes between the fanatical and backwards supporters of the monarch and the brave freedom fighters of the Matswanist coalition are frequent, and there are huge swathes of Moyen-Congo where our men cannot enter without the ever-present danger of reactionary ambushes. Jacques Opangault and some of the more local-minded members of Matswa’s coalition have argued that if we simply leave the queen alone, she will continue to rule her tiny kingdom isolated from the wider world, and eventually it will all fade into oblivion as the new socialist order thoroughly eclipses it. However, others, such as Kikhounga-Ngot and Débat have argued that if we let this old ruler remain, Ngalifourou will continue to undermine our rule to the best of her abilities, either through continued tribal raids, uprisings and providing intelligence reports to our natural enemies in Algiers and Dar-es-Salaam. Kikhounga-Ngot is of the opinion that if the queen is so adamant to keep her European allies, she should be exiled to go and live with them in that case, to rot away as a powerless little curiosity for the white man to gawk at. Débat is of a different mind, claiming that nothing short of an execution of the queen and her rebellious followers is enough to quell the tide of incessant reactionary activity."

In recent weeks, he has felt this more than ever, feeling the crawling of time upon his mortal coil, and while he is not an old man, the wounds inflicted by the Germans and French colonial troops upon him over the years are starting to take their toll on him. For all his battles and struggles, Matswa has been dreaming of withdrawing from public life, to let the young and starry-eyed ideologues of Moyen-Congo to take over and lead in his stead. Nonetheless, given the messianic figure of Matswa among his followers, this may not be a popular move, for in the hearts of the Mikale supporters, no man could ever replace their beloved leader.\n\nThus, despite no official announcement made by Matswa regarding the matter, rumours about his possible retirement have caused immense political activity in the capital, with thousands of fervent supporters marching on the streets demanding that the socialist prophet remains as the father of the nation. However, among his political allies, Matswa’s possible retirement has been met with quiet celebration, as many hope to be able to utilize the legacy of the great independence fighter for their own political gain when the next leader of Moyen-Congo is chosen. Simon-Pierre Kikhounga-Ngot has been quick to portray himself as the most logical successor to Matswa, though others such as Alphonse Débat have utilized a rhetoric harking back to Matswa’s own populist style. However, despite his desire to leave the political limelight, the pressure from his loyal followers may very well cause Matswa to remain in his post for the sake of the nation, as the radical nature of men such as Débat causes concern not only with the elder statesman but his supporters as well."

To ease the administrative strain of the bureaucrats in Brazzaville, we have forged an alliance with local chiefs and regionalist parties to administer the greater Congo Basin, most notable being Moïse Tshombe, leader of the Katangan regionalists of CONAKAT. Hoping to take his slice of the pie, the cunning Tshombe has requested a meeting with the Abbé to ensure the continued flow of profit in the Congo.\n\nMaking use of Tshombe’s connections with the UMHK, these mining speculators would be invited back into the country while dividing the former colony between Brazzaville, European investors, and a highly autonomous State of Katanga. The wealthy Bas-Congo region would be annexed by our government and the rest of the Congo would be carved up between a separate Kasaian and a rump Congolese Republic, curbing the thought of unity forevermore.

Already, their calls for a “true proletarian party” have grown increasingly bold, and they have embarked on brazen attempts to subvert our state left and rìght, through political coercion, industrial sabotage, and so forth, which has exacerbated the already tenacious unity within the movement. While the MNR could simply weather their dissidence with approval from the movement’s majority, there have been certain proposals being floated around at conceding to these radicals in the name of revolutionary unity, with two being the most popular: \n\nThe first option is to abolish the MNR entirely and fully commit to the founding of a totalizing vanguard party of the proletariat, at the cost of alienating and even cracking down on more moderate interests within the revolutionary movement, while the second option, popular with many within our movement itself, is to form a separate leading vanguard party, while reforming and subordinating the MNR to become an advisory platform for this new party, preserving the proletarian dictatorship but not alienating our less ideological interests within the revolution, even if some stubborn Leftists would still disagree with this course. With these proposals in mind, ultimately the final decision lay with Débat and his trusted confidants to decide the final course of the Congolese revolution."

teke.22.d:0 "The Moyen-Congo state under Fulbert Youlou and his fervent supporters in the UDDIA have, through the strength of their arms, cunning of their leaders and the internal weakness of their enemies, marched from one victory to another. Our enemies have crumbled under the great Abbé and his armies, and what little resistance remains has been forced into hiding in the lush jungles and riverbeds of the Congo Basin. Imperialists, rival tribes and ideological fanatics all tremble at the mention of the new empire of Youlou, and it seems as if the military might of the Congolais forces is unstoppable. However, with our continued streak of victories, the appetite for further conquests have grown among the people of Moyen-Congo, either out of imperialist glee or genuine desire to see the Dark Continent liberated from its European overlords, socialist false shepherds or autocratic despots.\n\nThe Congo Basin is a price in itself, and one that will guarantee the prosperity of our people for decades to come if we can unite the disparate groups that make up this gigantic land, but to some within Youlou’s inner circle, this is only the beginning. They view Bas-Congo not as an end goal in itself, but a stepping stone to something greater, so grand that it would shift the balance of power in the entire world if formalized. To these hawkish individuals, only the achievement of full unity between the disunited and wide-reaching Bantu people can truly satisfy the need for expansion, and as a bonus, it would liberate most of Africa from the accursed exploiters of Berlin, Paris and London, as well as creating one of the most resource-rich, culturally diverse and economically lucrative nations in the world.\n\nThis goal may seem megalomaniac to many, and indeed Youlou himself has not made a decision on whether to support such a grand endeavour, but given the recent uptick in Bantu nationalism following Mittelafrika’s collapse and the continued calls for African unity against imperialism and colonialism, perhaps this dream of an unified Bantu Empire is not so whimsical as it may initially appear. Nonetheless, even if Youlou rejects the dreams of a monolithic Bantu state, the Bas-Congo will be an empire of great size and power either way."

teke.23.d:0 "It is no secret that Fulbert Youlou is not a mere politician dedicated to a cause but a man larger than life in everything he puts his mind to, and as his power has grown, the man’s ego has expanded in suit. As the liberal Christian has eclipsed his many rivals and solidified his power base, his personality cult has increasingly been blown out of proportions to the point that numerous myths and legends circulate about Youlou, and his supporters are frequently driven into a violent frenzy for their leader. This was already the case when the Congolais state had merely just been proclaimed and Fulbert Youlou was in the process of building up his supporter base, but as he now sits atop an empire of his own making, Youlou finds himself at the top of the world. Under such a successful leader, the personality cult has become so large and fervent that Youlou holds little actual sway on the beliefs it produces, and thus even the great Abbé was rather taken aback when some of his most fervent loyalists brought up a proposal to their leader and mentor earlier today.\n\nThe most zealous supporters of Youlou have seen the great works of their leader and come to the conclusion that the new realm of UDDIA cannot be confined to be a simple nation under a ministerial or presidential figure, for these are far too mundane for the glory of Youlou. Instead, Fulbert Youlou should embrace his God-ordained duty as the liberator and leader of Africa, but instead of being a mere political figure, he should be the Emperor of his new realm. After all, if the tribal chiefs and kings were unable to unify the vast lands of Africa, but the Kaisers and Emperors of the European powers did so in a matter of roughly a century, then perhaps the homegrown leader of all Africans should emulate this model instead. Thus, the beloved master of UDDIA and Central Africa should be none other than Emperor Fulbert I. However, even Youlou’s ego is not large enough to accept such a proposal without hesitation, and some part of him finds a declaration of this magnitude to be completely ridiculous in nature."

teke.24.d:0 "The Congolais experiment with syndicalism has begun to bear its first fruits to the people, as local unions are constantly popping up in villages and cities around the nation. French and British experts and volunteers are a very common sight in Brazzaville today, and their help with the setting up of heavy industry has been instrumental in kicking off the Congolais industrial sector. Originally, syndicalism as a concept was around as much of an enigma to the Congolais people as other European political concepts such as socialism or liberalism, but in a short while, the practical example of MSA-CGT has been instrumental in demonstrating the strengths of this new system to not only the people of Middle Congo, but to the entire African continent.\n\nSimon-Pierre Kikhounga-Ngot and his allies have earned a great deal of praise both nationally and internationally, but locally, there has been some confusion as to where the true emphasis of the Kikhounga-Ngot’s program lies in. Many ardent Matswanists feel that in his haste to bring true Francophone syndicalism to Moyen-Congo, Kikhounga-Ngot has forgotten the true grassroots revolutionary cause of the Congolais socialist titan André Matswa, abandoning the local form of socialism in favour of something that was never meant for the African realities. However, the new syndicalist system has found a great deal of support from many within Moyen-Congo, with the rapid increase of local unions and MSA-CGT membership as a clear proof of this.\n\nThus some have argued that while syndicalism as it stands may not be purpose-built for the Congolais society and geography, it is nonetheless the way forward. Matswanism, they claim, was a force for liberation and anti-colonial struggle, but it could not provide the economical and societal basis upon which the nation could be built, a basis that syndicalism already possesses because of its continued evolution in Europe. Kikhounga-Ngot has so far attempted to placate both sides of the discussion, but it is increasingly evident that the time for a side to support has come to him too."

teke.25.d:0 "Jacques Opangault and his Mouvement Socialiste Africain may have triumphed in the recent elections, but the people’s mandate is not everything, and much work needs to be done before the people of Moyen-Congo will accept the rule of the young socialist movement fully. However, Opangault and his followers do not need to pull off this feat alone, for the various parties in the Congolais parliament are always looking up for opportunities to enter governmental positions. A coalition with another large parliamentary group could give us the edge needed to legitimize our rule and turn the people of Moyen-Congo to our side once and for all. Given that Opangault is a respected and reliable moderate politician, he has been able to approach multiple sides of the political scene of our nation in hopes of an alliance, and now the decision remains upon which group the MSA should ally. The most obvious and least risky choice would obviously be the unionist wing of Parti Progressiste Congolais, led by Robert Stéphane Tchitchéllé, the political protege of Opangault’s bitter rival Jean Félix-Tchicaya. Tchitchéllé, despite his Catholic convictions, has always been a defender of the working man, and his relationship with his mentor has always been a somewhat stormy one. As such, we could exploit this crack in PPC to lure in the pro-worker side of the party, though we will have to compromise with their Christian ideals a bit. Another option however would be even more radically pro-Christian, with Fulbert Youlou’s Union Démocratique pour la Défense des Intérêts Africains. While Youlou and Opangault disagree on a number of policy points, with Youlou espousing an ideology of liberal economics and Catholic social policies while Opangault’s ideas fall solidly into African socialism, the two men have collaborated quite a bit throughout the years and during the rather intense period of violence before the elections, both Opangault and Youlou were the primary voices calling for an end to the chaos through national radio and party propaganda. UDDIA has quite a bit of sway within the clergy, who tend to view MSA with suspicion or open hostility, and thus a coalition could help alleviate these fears. Finally, the most radical option would be to ally with our fellow socialists and followers of André Matswa, as they represent perhaps the most palatable form of socialism outside of MSA, and Matswa’s role in the struggle against our colonial masters has earned him a great deal of love among the Congolais population. The decision is a difficult one, with different pros and cons depending on the chosen coalition partner, but it is one that is almost certainly crucial for the future popularity of MSA and Opangault’s regime."

However, while many of these ‘justifications’ for such prejudices stem from biological characteristics, customs or societal structures, it is far from uncommon for the colonialists to accuse their African subjects of being cannibals in hopes that it would paint these tribes as animalistic, barbaric and in desperate need of salvation by the Christian faith and European civilization. The Teke people have not avoided this fate either, with Europeans claiming that our people engaged in cannibalism as far back as the 16th century. However, as Man Ounko Ngalifourou is the symbolic heir to the Kingdom of Anziku, the most recent insult to our great people has hit particularly hard. Western fiction rarely makes its way here down to the heart of Africa, but even our remote corner of the world sometimes receives examples of the works of most prolific writers in the Francophone and Anglophone world.\n\nRecently, works of the American horror author H.P. Lovecraft has become a small success story among the academics, clergymen and administrator classes of our nation, thanks to the boost in popularity of the man’s books following his takeover of the American splinter nation of New England. However, much to the horror of the patriotic Congolais, this American author has seemingly decided to perpetuate the falsified account of our people being cannibals in his book The Picture in the House. The story details a lost wanderer who stumbles upon the house of an old man, and this eccentric hermit shows the visitor a picture of a Anziku butcher’s shop depicting the tribesmen of the Moyen-Congo performing all kinds of animalistic rituals involving the consumption of human flesh. The stranger then claims that the picture has caused him to acquire a hunger for delicacies of the forgotten kind, and while the man’s cannibalistic practices are not confirmed outright, they are heavily implied.\n\nThe story is not alone in its racist and heavily caricature-reliant portrayals of non-white human beings, as Lovecraft is well-known for using stereotypes as inspiration for his monsters, and thus this slander of the noble Teke is merely yet another insult on a long line of hatred. Nonetheless, queen Ngalifourou and many of her advisors have been absolutely enraged by such attacks against our people, and some have even gone as far as to suggest that we topple the Yellow King’s realm out of vengeance. However, those with cooler heads have brought up the matter of logistics and the fact that the Atlantic ocean separates the two nations, making attempts at revenge a massive endeavour."

Nkwe Mbali is a force embodied by the king of the Teke, which was passed to Ngalifourou upon the death of her husband. Today, Ngalifourou has become something of a bastion for the faith in a time when the Christian influence seems ever more powerful in the kingdom’s lands. The French attempted a slow transition to Catholicism, and when the Germans replaced them as the region’s colonial masters, they brought Protestant missionaries with them, with the odd German Catholic working with the local French and native Catholic as well. Given Ngalifourou’s immense influence in Moyen-Congo, she was considered the lynchpin upon which the conversion of the entire region rested upon, but the queen remained stalwart in the old ways and sent away all the European missionaries, while the colonial authorities considered her loyalty too precious to risk by attempting to forcefully convert the Teke.\n\nIn fact, even the African syncretics of Simon Kimbangu, Congo’s own Messianic figure and a political force by himself, attempted to woo the queen to their cause, but like those following the white man’s faith, the disciples of Kimbangu left empty-handed. Now, Man Ounko Ngalifourou continues to stand as the destination of many Teke pilgrims, who pay their spiritual leader a visit en masse and continue to keep the flame of the old Teke faith alive. While Ngalifourou herself is of course the main reason for the visit, many also pay their respects to her royal stool, likouba, which is among the most revered relics of the Teke faith and a direct link to Nkwe Mbali. With the Man Ounko’s ascension to power as the unquestionable ruler of the Teke Kingdom, it would appear that the ways of the Teke ancestors are on the rise once more."

teke.38.d:0 "The blessed leader of the Congolais people, Fulbert Youlou, is a man of many faces. A caring father to his people, an idol of worship for his fanatical followers and a crazed madman with a temper of his beloved cayman for his enemies and rivals, the perception of Youlou creates a kaleidoscope of a man who is at the same time Moyen-Congo’s greatest saviour and its inevitable downfall. Yet for all his perceived flaws, Youlou remains the head of the nation, and his one-party state stands supreme over all its affairs, driving a multifaceted program that seems to be at odds with itself as much as it is with UDDIA’s many rival parties. However, recently it seems that for all his talk about making a modern nation with Christian values and liberal economic boom here in the heart of Africa, Youlou seems far more invested in making the most amount of cold hard cash through his political machine and cult of personality rather than focusing on the improvement of the lives of Congolais folks. While it is clear that the post of a nation’s leader is a harsh one, and a task that requires adequate compensation, many within UDDIA have become fearful that Youlou is driven not by nationalist fervour to uplift his nation but to simply enrich himself by any means necessary. Recently, the leader of UDDIA issued a decree that led to the confiscation and sale or redistribution of all civilian administrator vehicles among the Moyen-Congo’s governmental apparatus, but curiously enough, Youlou and his inner circle was completely sheltered from this new rule, much to the chagrin of the Congolais society. It has also been noted that in effort to empower those close to him, Youlou has been making strides ensuring that the new Congolais society is far from a meritocracy, and many officials are hired entirely on their regional roles, not the qualities they possess. Youlou has also been increasing his state visits to other African nations and even the European continent in an effort to promote his new economic model and its benefits to the international corporations and companies, but accountants and governmental officials have raised eyebrows at the immense costs of these visits, with even short trips costing so much that the national budget has to undergo revisions and reallocations. It would appear that for all his piousness and facade of clergyman, there is no religious asceticism nor humbleness in the actions of Youlou, and many fear that it will eventually lead to his fall from grace if enough of his illicit dealings come to light."

However, where once there was a simple and humble cassock of the rank-and-file pastors of Moyen-Congo, many have pointed out that the new look of Youlou seems far more refined and elegant, with rumours spreading that he has acquired his new cassocks from the French exiles in Algiers for a hefty sum of presumably public funding, and in fact some whistleblowers within the government’s service have pointed out checks to the famous French fashion designer Christian Dior, which seem to coincide with Youlou’s new look. Nonetheless, this has not yet been much of a scandal in the eyes of the Congolais people, for a statesman on Youlou’s level needs the proper garments if he is to represent our noble people. However, what has been causing far more of a ruckus in the press and public discourse is Youlou’s seemingly unending hunt for new automobiles to add into his collection, and as can be expected, these vehicles are not from the budget model catalogue. Renault, Porsche, Rolls-Royce and Ferrari, among many, many others, have made their first arrivals here in the heart of the Congo, presumably delivered by various European settlers of high standing or even through Youlou’s friend Moise Tshombe, who has always had considerable sway with the Belgian mining company  Union Minière du Haut Katanga. Many of the regime’s loudest critics have been quick to leverage Youlou’s new hobby as a clear sign of the rotten core of UDDIA, with his personality cult seemingly allowing such egregious purchases to go unpunished, but even some of his most loyal supporters have began to voice concerns towards Abbé’s spending habits after the man was reported to have purchased numerous hotels and farms around Brazzaville and other parts of the nation. Despite the mounting evidence detailing Youlou’s increasingly careless usage of state resources, pressure towards him to end such frivolous actions has been lukewarm at best, for at the end of the day, UDDIA is the ship that steers Congo to its destiny and Youlou is simultaneously its captain and helmsman.

However, it is clear that Goura and his particular clique within the PPC will not win over the hearts and minds of the Congolais people on being the most milquetoast candidates alone, and thus some alliances are needed if the president is to ensure the success of his party and political program. As such, Goura has started to make moves towards gaining the support of many UDDIA voters, especially those tired of the flamboyant and ruthless leader of the party Youlou, who has never hid his ambitions. Goura may be a reformer at heart, and some even claim that he harbours full-blown socialist sympathies despite his tailored appearance as the centrist candidate, but recently, the president has begun to cultivate a far more Catholic appearance to his public perception, harking back to his roots and educational background with the church. This new turn has of course turned some of his more socialist-minded followers away, with many jumping ship to join the Mouvement Socialiste Africain of Jacques Opangault, but it has at least succeeded in gaining support for Goura in the eyes of the local faithful. Many of those fearful of Youlou’s love for power and wealth have begun to see Goura as the actual possible liberal Christian democrat, not the would be despot of UDDIA, though many fear that Goura is simply too meek and inexperienced to truly lead the young nation towards its glorious destiny. However, in the chaotic political scene of the infantile African nation, Goura has taken his first step towards solidifying a proper political movement around himself, no longer relying on moderation and PPC name alone.

teke.41.d:0 "Pierre Goura has never been a particularly ideologically radical man, but he has always been an admirer of the European republics and their democratic parties. Drawing much of his inspiration from the moderate left and centre of the former French republic and subsequent split in their movements following the French revolution, Goura has never been too invested into the more radical strains of socialism but has always had a certain degree of sympathy for its more liberal currents. With the consolidation of his power around the Moyen-Congo and a further solidified position of the PPC, the party has become more and more invested into creating an uniquely liberal platform around Goura’s image, as the founder of the party Jean Félix-Tchicaya takes an increasingly backseat approach to its affairs and the unionist wing led by Robert Tchitchéllé capitulates to Goura’s dominance. As such, Goura has decided to outline a new party platform based around his many influences. To further ensure that the two party bosses besides himself fall in line with the new program, Goura could align either Félix-Tchicaya or Tchitchéllé. Aligning more closely with the unionists of Tchitchéllé, the party would seek a more Christian approach to Goura’s centrist form of socialism, still heavily liberal in nature but in accordance with the pious path of God. Alternatively, Goura can align more with the progressive wing of the party led by Félix-Tchicaya, merging his own liberalism and pro-democratic approach with that of the party’s founder to make Moyen-Congo a beacon of African liberalism, progressivism and modernity. However, there is always the option that Goura treads on alone with his own vision of capitalism with a human face, as he has done thus far, or adopts a more French centre-left inspired approach to Congolais politics. This would see him merge some aspects of his love for liberalism with the particular quirks of moderate socialism, to create a mixture hardly seen before here in the heart of Africa. "

teke.42.d:0 "The Congolais economy is best described as a diamond in the rough, for despite the immense wealth hiding in the jungles of the nation, the French and German colonial administrations were quite hesitant to actually expand into the vast untapped fields of resources in the region for various reasons. The massive profitability of the neighbouring Congolese regions, especially Katanga and Kasai, as well as the never-ending bureaucratic reshuffling of the Moyen-Congo region meant that despite the knowledge of gigantic deposits of minerals and even possibly oil in the region, this potential was not exploited further by the Europeans. Partially this has always been because of the thick and inhospitable forests of Moyen-Congo, which shelter the riches of these lands from prying eyes, but those that seek only that which glimmers miss the forest for the trees. The current Congolais economy subsists mainly on agriculture and hunting, but under the premiership of Pierre Goura, the nation’s fledgling forestry section has reached completely new heights. Utilizing machines imported from European and other African nations or taken from the colonial masters, the forests of Moyen-Congo are quickly becoming a cornucopia of prosperity for the young nation, as European and American imports of local timber grow at a seemingly never-ending rate. Before his political career, Goura was involved in the local forestry business through his own company in the province of Niari, and he learned first-hand the potential of Congolais timber exports while working on the field. Luxury items such as mahogany seemed to lose some of their value after the collapse of the German economy, but now, the markets are booming once more, and Congolais forests will provide. Other local timber types are also gaining in popularity, with the local Okoumé trees becoming an increasingly common source for the manufacturing of plywood in Europe as the demands of war industries need cheaper and lighter wood types, while the medicinal properties of the limba trees of Moyen-Congo have also managed to nudge themselves into the markets of Africa and Europe. Goura also hopes that by expanding the forestry trade, land can be cleared up for further mining operations and agriculture, so that the benefits of the timber trade are not only felt in the short-term but can go on to have ripple effects on the modernization process of entire Congolais society. However, some local tribals have become increasingly agitated with these programs, attacking machinery and forestry workers as desecrators of the land, who are only emerging from the cities to rob the locals of their hunting grounds. Still, such incidents are minor, and the benefits of switching to a more modern form of making a living is bound to help the locals in the long-term. "

Following the electoral victory of Pierre Goura’s wing of the PPC, the new president was approached by an unexpected group, the socialist party of Gabon known as Parti de l'Unité Nationale Gabonaise led by René-Paul Sousatte. PUNGA and Goura’s PPC are hardly ideologically aligned, as for all his socialist influences, Goura is far more liberal and centrist than the Gabonese syndicalist-inspired Pan-Africanists of Sousette.\n\nHowever, it seems that Sousette’s PUNGA is eager to gain any allies it can to kickstart its program of creating a federation of equal, free and left-leaning states. Goura and Gabonese left-wing leaders have collaborated in the past, and there was a considerable overlap between the politicians of Gabon and Moyen-Congo, and for a time, Goura was considered a candidate for the leadership of PUNGA while the party was still assembling itself under the German colonial rule. However, given that this situation was caused by desperation on the part of the Gabonese socialists to achieve at least a degree of legitimacy, it was never put into action.\n\nAllying with PUNGA would help us heal the wounds of the independence war further, and given that Moyen-Congo lacks a sea access of its own, becoming an ally of Gabon would be beneficial to our international trade, but on the other hand, the Christian supporters of Goura are anxious about the revolutionary and secularist ideas of PUNGA, while the more liberal members of PPC fear that PUNGA’s commitment to democracy is shaky at best. Nonetheless, an offer like this does not come every day, and while there are ideological differences between the two groups, the shared past can help overcome these issues if Goura decides to take Sousette up on his offer."

However, with time, his grip over the Congolais society has grown to be near unshakeable, and as his personality cult grows, the voices of the opposition are increasingly feebler. His frenzied supporters have been caught performing acts of violence against anyone with even the slightest criticism against the priestly leader.\n\nMeanwhile, the gendarmerie and army of Moyen-Congo has been openly suppressing the socialist groups within the nation as well. Few men now remain to oppose Youlou openly, and with his rule nigh absolute, he has announced that the age of democracy in Moyen-Congo has come to an end. Only UDDIA is capable of guiding the nation to a gilded future, for no party is as pious and progress-minded as that of Abbé. The democratic opposition headed thus far by the moderate socialist Jacques Opangault, has been completely undermined after reports of Opangault’s supporters attacking the Lari people supportive of Youlou came into light, and the unionist leader has been taken into custody awaiting trial for his atrocities.\n\nThe PPC, another opposition party, has been shattered into multiple cliques with no clear direction, and Youlou has attempted to bring both the centrist and unionist wings of the party under UDDIA to completely neutralize his rivals. Thanks to his image as an anti-syndicalist crusader and a devout man of God, he has fully gained the support of the local Catholic church, and without any real group left to oppose him, the UDDIA has become the unquestionable rulers of Moyen-Congo. Under Youlou, the nation will forget the mistakes of democracy and forge a new glorious path to economic prosperity and rule of the faithful over all of Africa’s dark heart."

However, a recent event within the Congolais Assembly indicated that the opposition had completely underestimated how far Youlou would be willing to go if it meant keeping his power. The Assembly had gathered to launch a motion of no confidence towards the nation’s premier leader, with the plan being to completely push him out of power and hold new elections that would allow for the nation to avoid the pitfall of total UDDIA dominance. However, to the surprise and horror of the members of the assembly, Youlou arrived in a storm of wrath aimed at what he perceived as national traitors, and to the shock of everyone present, Youlou whipped out a rapid fire weapon from under his cassock.\n\nArmed with a leftover Erma submachine gun left behind by the nation’s former colonial overlords, he threatened to open fire upon the assembly if the motion of no confidence was pushed through, and the entire assembly, held hostage by the premier, was forced to give up its proposal. The Assembly was later forced to push out a proposal for a new Congolais constitution, severely limiting the rights of the nation’s citizens and giving far more power to Youlou and his allies within UDDIA. Many of the perpetrators behind the plot for the motion were later arrested and imprisoned, though some have since been missing as well.

This new force in the shattered region’s power politics, colloquially known as Groupe de Brazzavilla, brings together the primary democratic or centrist power-players of a Christian or liberal conviction.\n\nHowever, more often than not, these allies are also friends, mentors or great inspirators of Youlou himself, with the list including such titans of African liberalism and Christian democracy as Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Barthélemy Boganda, Andre-Marie Mbida and Moise Tshombe. The general stated aim of the group has been to limit the influence of Syndicalism in the post-colonial states of Central Africa, usually through isolation by trade embargoes or severing of political ties, though the provision for an armed intervention is not entirely ruled out. Similarly, it has been noted that Groupe de Brazzaville tends to hold generally favourable views towards collaborating and economically benefiting from the former European powers that held territories in Central Africa, though relations between these powers vary from one member state to another.\n\nYoulou has utilized the general success of these meetings as a key propaganda tool for his regime, claiming that it is the first step towards creating a truly liberal, Catholic and modern paradise in Central Africa, though whether the group will actually achieve much success remains to be seen given the large distances and general state of utter chaos ravaging the continent’s lush center."

The musical boom brought about by the increased funding for the cultural group L’Humanitie has been instrumental in this new rise of culture, but there are other factors that have also made their contributions to the greater whole. One of these cornerstone figures of the cultural resurgence has been an early supporter of PPC and the Congolais political awakening, Emmanuel Damongo-Dadet. Damongo-Dadet is something of a renaissance man of the Moyen-Congo, dabbling in politics, music and writing throughout his admittedly short career due to his age, and he has quickly risen to be a titan of Congolais diplomacy. However, when his trips to other nations of the globe do not take all his free time, the ambassador has been quick to introduce the gifts of global music to the people of Moyen-Congo. Shortly after the independence, Damongo-Dadet founded the musical group Mélo Congo, which united the various political and tribal factions of the young nation under the love for the finest of arts. Damongo-Dadet has previously played in the four central bands of Brazzaville, ranging from the military and militia brass bands to the Catholic and municipal bands, with his mastery of the saxophone, clarinet and guitar bringing some much needed variety to the performances. These bands became a common sight during independence celebrations, football matches and various other national activities, and Damongo-Dadet rose to be one of the central musicians of the young nation. This newfound fame has allowed him to push his newest souvenir from the wider world, jazz, to the African people, who have enthusiastically adopted it throughout the nation. Thanks to the efforts of Damongo-Dadet, who has been an enthusiastic supporter of spreading the new radio technology throughout the nation, even the most remote tribes of Moyen-Congo have been graced with the modern sounds of jazz, bringing a completely new aspect to the already rich and varied musical culture of this jewel of Central Africa."

teke.48.d:0 "The PPC party owes much to its founder, Jean Félix-Tchicaya, and he has become one of the key symbols of the new Moyen-Congo state, but recently his cousin has also been gaining a degree of traction within the Congolais society. Pierre Tchicaya de Boaempire was never quite as successful in the political sphere as his cousin Jean was, but the two have collaborated over the years due to Pierre’s position as the Mamboma Tchi Loango, a high position within the Kingdom of Loango roughly comparable to that of European-style prime ministers or premiers. Boaempire was also important as one of the key political leaders of Moyen-Congo Protestantism, for unlike his cousin, Pierre was baptised the in Reformed Church by American missionaries and would later go on to collaborate with the local Swedish missionaries of Loango as he entered the clergy and became a notable spiritual leader in the region. However, his most recent contribution and one that has earned much prestige to the family name both he and Jean bear is his determined work on translations, bridging the gap between the rest of Moyen-Congo and his native Vili people after he has painstakingly translated the Bible to the local language. Thanks to his efforts, conversions among the Vili have gone up quite a bit as preachers now have the adequate means to reach out to the population, but this religious contribution has not been his only one to the Vili language. He has also translated two popular songs among the Congolais, the new national anthem known simply as La Congolaise, and the famed French revolutionary song, La Marseillaise, into the Vili tongue, helping to foster a newfound unity between the Vili people and rest of Moyen-Congo while also giving a much needed voice for the Vili people. In fact, Pierre has been generally considered to be the first Congolais person to drive a program of language revivalism among the Vili, introducing a formal grammar to their language as well as developing it from its informal spoken form. However, while he has joined the PPC of his cousin, the pastor has been unable to garner much support partly because of his Protestant faith, partly because of his clear bias towards the Loango and partly because of his surname. Boaempire, which Pierre claims to mean ‘boa that surrounds’, tends to be too close to the French Imperial banner of Bon Empire which has led many tribal nationalists to view him with suspicion. Nonetheless, his importance among the Vili has earned him a degree of support, and only time will tell if Pierre can overcome his deficiencies in the political field as well."

Unlike many other politicians of the new nation, Malonga never went to a seminary or Catholic school to earn his education, but instead worked tirelessly to gain the knowledge and skills needed to pass the elementary school certificate exam through his wits and hard-working nature alone. Of course, the downside to this was that unlike many other members of Congolais politics, Malonga only passed his exam at the ripe age of thirty-five, but he has since gone on to become the leading voice within the journalistic field of Moyen-Congo. Joining the PPC shortly after his graduation, Malonga devoted himself to the running of the party newspaper AEF Nouvelle, which has increased its reach and reader base at a rather solid pace ever since PPC’s election victory. Malonga has been the propaganda mouthpiece of the PPC alongside his mentor and journalistic inspiration,Jean Félix-Tchicaya, but the young journalist has also strayed as a writer from mere newspaper articles. Malonga has devoted part of his nationalist fervour not towards running the voice of PPC, but to the expansion and renewal of the Congolais literary scene. A life-long storyteller at heart, he has taken the struggle of the Congolais for independence to heart, and has begun to write novels and poems dedicated to this national awakening in his free time. Enamored with the culture and storytelling tradition of the various local tribes, Malonga has made long and arduous trips throughout the jungles and savannah of this varied land in hunt for new stories and vocal traditions, noting them down as he conversed with tribe leaders, religious figures and even every day folks. His collections are still far from complete, but Malonga has hinted that once the PPC’s reign stabilizes and Moyen-Congo no longer needs his services as urgently, Malonga may direct a part of his efforts towards ensuring that the stories and myths of the Congolais are pressed into ink for the future generations to enjoy as well."

None of this would have been easy to manage if not for the cultural wing of the PPC, L'Harmonie de Pointe-Noire, founded by Jean Félix-Tchicaya long before the independence of the nation was even a distinct possibility. The society aimed at improving the lives of Congolais educated and literate people through petitions, rallies and various other means aimed at pressuring the colonial governments, most notably a long campaign aimed at freeing Moe Poaty II, the king of the Loango Kingdom, Jean Félix-Tchicaya’s birthplace, from German prison. However, while the campaign was a failure and the king perished under the custody of the Teutons, it was a key stepping stone to Tchicaya’s rise to the ranks of the fathers of Moyen-Congo, for his masterful propaganda campaigns lashing out at the oppressive rule of the Germans earned L’Harmonia quite a bit of support from the local Vili populace. However, following Congo’s independence, the group has been a strong supporter of PPC with its widespread concerts, cultural clubs and ever-present prominence in nationalist rallies and political gatherings. Thanks to L’Harmonie, Congolais culture has gotten the funds needed to truly flourish, and with its support, PPC can ensure that this continues for as long as the party can hold on to power."

As such, the leader of this great nation, Alphonse Massamba-Débat, has taken it upon himself and the Congolais people to be the flaming vanguard of socialism of the Dark Continent, supporting other like-minded groups such as the Ghanaian Kwame Nkrumah and Congolese Joseph Kasongo in their quest to liberate their peoples from the imperialist ambitions and bring a true red paradise to Africa, bit by bit. The writhing corpse of Mittelafrika is finally collapsing upon itself, and while some despots and colonial tyrants try to cling to their wretched realms, it is clear that the hold of the white man over Africa is at its end.\n\nThe scrap left of their exploitative colonial machines shall forge a truly new red continent, but much work must be done before a red sun hangs over the Old Continent. To this end, Débat has decreed that Moyen-Congo shall become a new haven of international militias, trained by local experts and Internationale advisors to become global liberators. Communists, syndicalists and socialists from Congo, Ubangi-Shari, Cameroon, Namibia and Somalia shall all find a safe haven here, free of divisive left-wing infighting and imperialist agents of reaction. With our help, these crimson patriots shall receive the arms, training and experience needed to topple the colonial remnants, tribal warlords and deceiving centrist leaders alike, until all of Africa is washed over by a red wave that sees its nations freed from capitalism, reactionary tribalism and imperialist Europeans alike.\n\nThese militia training centres and military camps within Moyen-Congo territory are likely to gain the ire of our many external enemies, and thus we must remain vigilant that our enemies over the border do not use our generous aid to rebels as a casus belli for grey zone warfare or even outright invasions.

While the nation is rich in resources and has been a center of trade for centuries, with the Kingdom of Loango being one of the key sites of copper mining, the profits of these operations have gone either to the pockets of local chieftains or to the greedy colonial administrators. However, under Alphonse Débat, this shall all change, for through his connections with global socialist groups, he will bring experts from all around the world to help propel the Congolais economy to greatness. Scientists from the former Bolshevik groups, such as the Andrey Vyshinsky, as well as prominent French revolutionary engineer and industrial figure Robert Louzon, have made their way here to help kickstart the efforts of the Congolais industrial revolution, accompanied by various industrial, military and scientific experts.\n\nThe riches of these lands are lucrative to the European socialists, and thus they are eager to help the Congolais economy in exchange for industrial aid. The starting projects may seem modest for these European industrial giants, as work has begun on a modern, French-style textile factory in Kinsoundi, as well as at the match factory of Bétou, but these manufacturing plants are unheard of here in Moyen-Congo, and their production is bound to create a strong stimulus for the local economy. Louzon has utilized his previous experience with gas and oil production to great effect as well, and while he has merely put out a hypothesis, the French syndicalist claims that there may be great untapped potential in the oil fields of the nation, if enough funds are allocated to these resources.\n\nThe Europeans, in their ever-gnawing hunger for more resources, have also sponsored the creation of top-of-the-line dockyards in Yoro, no doubt driven by their hopes to get shipments of Congolais resources running towards Paris and London, but these shipyards will provide much needed boost to the merchant marine of our young nation nonetheless. This uptick in industry has elevated the trust of our people towards the guidance of Débat, even if some traditionalists fear that it will forever transform the psyche and natural state of the nation for the worse. However, to Débat, it is a mere stepping stone on the long road towards true scientific socialism."

Some, such as Pierre Goura and Jean Félix-Tchicaya, could be reintegrated into the socialist machine of state due to their left-wing sympathies, but others, such as the ally of Katanga’s capitalist crook Moise Tshombe, Fulbert Youlou of the UDDIA party, saw exile as a far more lucrative option. However, after Alphonse Débat’s rise to power following Matswa’s retirement, the liberal Catholic Youlou has unexpectedly received a pardon from the socialist leader.\n\nDespite the anti-syndicalist policies and rhetoric of Youlou, and his rather unabashed admiration to the traditionalist beacon of reaction, Man Ounko Ngalifourou, Youlou was nonetheless just the pragmatic figure needed to maintain the coalition of wildly different political groups of the Teke Clique during the war against Gabon and Kongo, and despite the differences between Débat and Youlou, the two men gained a grudging respect for one another. There were rumours that Débat may seek to integrate the shrewd young priest into his administration shortly after the pardon, but upon returning to Brazzaville, Youlou was left largely to his own devices, a stranger in the strange new system of scientific socialism.\n\nThis surprise act of clemency has surprised many, but for the people of Moyen-Congo, it has been a great political act of goodwill that has somewhat accelerated the great divide between the new socialist regime and the old liberal democratic political parties that formed shortly before the independence. Much work remains ahead if the Congolais are to find true political unity once more, and it also remains to be seen what Youlou does with his newfound freedom, but to many this entire chain of events has brought a newfound sense of hope towards true national reconciliation."

Back then, Débat was still living in Oubangi-Shari, where he had emigrated to in search for work and where he would begin to teach in the Edouard Renard school, a remnant of the French colonial order that the Germans had left mostly untouched bar for a few curriculum changes and nods to the Protestant faith dominant in the Kaiserreich and its colonial regimes. These experiences forged from a young age left a lasting expression on Débat, to the point that he became one of the primary champions of an educational reform in Moyen-Congo and Oubangi-Shari alike.\n\nWith the reins of power firmly in his grip, Débat has sought to fulfill his promise of a truly scientific socialist strain by formalizing a strong school structure throughout the nation, sponsoring the creation of schools in even remote villages as well as diverting funding to the establishment of colleges and other faculties of higher education. Débat and his supporters hope that with these programs, Congolais people will be the first among Africans to have access to forms of higher education rivaling those seen in Europe and North America. Increased quotas for the training of teachers have been formed to ensure that the reach of the reforms is sufficient to encompass every corner of the nation, and lucrative contracts to Internationale and independent teachers from around the globe have been put out by the Débat government in hopes of attracting talent from all walks of the academic life to the institutes of the socialist republic.\n\nHowever, education alone won’t solve the woes of Congolais children, and thus health centers are popping up all over the territories of Middle Congo, which will ensure that more and more children reach the age needed to learn. Débat has also moved to limit the influence of clerical schools and missionary societies in education, targeting especially European establishment with ties to imperialist powers and showing a degree of leniency to local African-run schools with the intent of phasing out these clerical centres eventually as well. It is estimated that if the funding for the programs remains at a sufficient level, Moyen-Congo will quickly rise to become the most educated nation on the continent."

After André Matswa’s retirement from his leadership position as the venerable spiritual head of the revolution, the anti-colonial firebrand has largely retired from the public eye and does not issue statements on the government that followed in his footsteps. As such, debates among the left-wing coalition have been fierce on the matter of his successor, with each of three parties represented all having some voices championing their current leader as Matswa’s ‘clear protege’.\n\nHowever, while Débat was initially hesitant to claim such a thing, he has now become a rather enthusiastic Matswanist and despite the claimed aim of achieving scientific socialism in Moyen-Congo, Débat has began to build a cult of personality harking back to the Mikale of Matswa in many ways. Given that MNR was mainly a force of the left-wing academic elites, some unionist firebrands and the most authoritarian-minded guerillas within Matswa’s coalition, it has never had a particularly strong legitimacy with the Congolais people, and thus the idea of utilizing Matswanist rhetoric and symbolism to woo in the fanatical Matswa-cultists into the party is hardly a novel one.\n\nNonetheless, the party newspaper Etumba has begun a strong propaganda campaign to further hammer home the ‘fact’ that Matswa endorsed Débat in private correspondence and only refrained from doing so publicly to ensure proper democratic transition. The new direction has been somewhat divisive, with many Internationale-minded socialists within MNR seeing this as reactionary backsliding, while even Débat’s loyalists and staunch supporters fear that it will turn the grassroots action of MNR and its youth wing, Jeunesse du Mouvement National de la Révolution, towards dangerous and un-socialist zealotry and idolatry. Débat himself remains convinced that this is the right step towards broadening the party, but it remains to be seen if the socialist leader can convince the masses of Moyen-Congo of his legitimacy."

teke.56.d:0 "Perhaps the key term that could describe the reign of Alphonse Debat and his MNR is radical youth action. The main party tends to try and maintain a sense of political legitimacy and at least a degree of moderation in how it pursues its goal of achieving scientific socialism in Moyen-Congo. However, the youth wing of MNR, Jeunesse du Mouvement National de la Révolution, holds no such pretensions, and due to Debat’s young age, they have felt justified in their actions, claiming that they are serving the cause of the revolution and sweeping away the detritus of the old Congolais society. JMNR is not legally bound to any existing framework of the judicial bodies of Moyen-Congo, yet they hold considerable power over the political apparatus due to the possession of police-level rights when it comes to upholding the law.\n\nThese young firebrands, fiercely loyal to Debat and often coming from backgrounds that have never experienced anything but popular disdain and sidelining by those above them, have taken these rights in stride and now pursue enemies throughout the nation with extreme prejudice. While effective and reliable to the regime, especially given that Congolais police forces before this were merely local militias and tribal enforcers, the leadership of MNR has been receiving increasing numbers of reports that JMNR members are using the positions of power to carry out acts of vengeance against former rivals or political enemies. Additionally, they have been quick to crack down on any dissent and paint even the most mundane diversions from the revolutionary regime as ‘counter-revolutionary activity’ and ‘white terrorism’.\n\nThe JMNR network has grown to rival most of the MNR’s political establishment as is, and the reach of JMNR agents in the daily lives of the Congolais has reached a point of ridiculousness. Often times, the JMNR agents are called to act as arbitrators in marital troubles, to discipline children or perform other very simple tasks instead of doing their actual task of maintaining social peace, which combined with the brutality and arbitrariness of the JMNR members’ actions, has earned them quite a bit of negative publicity. Given their loyalty to Debat, the party leader could step in and order his youth section to moderate their actions, though this may cause some of the more radical members to turn against their former idol."
teke.56.a:0 "They’re just maintaining peace in a creative way."
teke.56.b:0 "We must reign in the excesses of terror."

teke.57.t:0 "Crescent over Congo"
teke.57.d:0 "Simon-Pierre Kikhounga-Ngot has long been the outside force in Congolais politics, supporting the socialist underdog Jacques Opangault during the pre-independence struggle before breaking off to fully embrace French-style syndicalism after the formation of the Matswa coalition. His tenure as the leader of Confédération Générale du Travail in Moyen-Congo saw Kikhounga-Ngot stand as the main political figure calling for a break in collaboration with Fulbert Youlou’s republicans, though his latest venture has the potential to topple all his previous breaks with the mainstream. Drawing his lineage from the territory of Senegal, Kikhounga-Ngot has long been interested in Islam despite his Christian upbringing and education in Protestant schools, and recently this obsession has begun to manifest in the man more. In private, the union leader has brought up the prospect of converting to Islam to his most trusted associates, but it has shortly become something of an open secret.\n\nWhile much of Moyen-Congo follows either the Catholic or Protestant faiths of their former colonial masters, or the animist traditional religions of the region, there are pockets of Islam throughout the nation, and thus a conversion would not be a completely unheard of event in Congolais history, but it would certainly be an unexpected and shocking turn of events. However, given that much of his powerbase comes from a Christian background, the backlash could be rather large, though given the widely varied nature of Moyen-Congo and its patchwork of different ethnic and religious customs, most workers would likely just shrug at their leader’s preferred faith. There is also the possibility that if Kikhounga-Ngot chooses to adopt the Islamic faith, he could attempt to implement elements of his newfound spiritual direction into the policies of his MSA-CGT grouping, which is bound to have more drastic reactions but could also lead the union towards a completely new path under the Crimson Crescent."
teke.57.a:0 "Perhaps it’s best to just forget about this all for now."
teke.57.b:0 "The conversion to Islam will be a merely personal one."
teke.57.c:0 "Congolais Islamic syndicalism does have a nice ring to it."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_FULBERT_YOULOU_DESC:0 "Abbé Fulbert Youlou has risen to become the first President of an independent state in the lands of the former French Congo. Born in 1917 and training to become a priest from a young age, this devout Catholic has increasingly evolved both a love for free market capitalism, economic liberalism, and conservative nationalism, and over the course of his young political career, Youlou has espoused a deeply anti-socialist sentiment that has grown to deeply anger the far more Socialist-orientated Northern regions of the nation. Now, this holy-man turned national father serves as the bastion of anti-leftist thought in the Tekeland Clique, with his rule supported by a junior officers clique from the nation’s newly formed military, which has been created from the ashes of the former Franco-German colonial administration."

TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea:0 "Defense Against Portugal"
TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea_desc:0 "With German rule shattered in this region, the Portuguese have begun to eye our lands. We must bolster our defences against these colonials and their allies under the Manikongo while still keeping tabs on the bubbling French and German remnants within our own borders, lest our nation be re-colonized before we can even attempt self-rule."
TKE_power_struggle_idea:0 "Pressures of Factionalism"
TKE_power_struggle_idea_desc:0 "Within our infantile government, a great deal of political forces are at war with one another. From the socialist Mikalé of the messianic André Matswa, Republican elements centered around Jacques Opangault and Fulbert Youlou, tribal Bateke monarchists rallied around Queen Ngalifourou, and various pro-colonial elements, both European and native, the stage has been set for great conflict or debate. This varied and dynamic political climate has cast a great shadow over our future, and now only time will tell who shall come out on top."
TKE_Queen_Ngalifourou_I_idea:0 "Ngalifourou I"
TKE_Queen_Ngalifourou_I_idea_desc:0 "Despite our republican form of government, which was declared shortly before our independence, our regime still shares power with the local Teke monarchy which served as an autonomous protectorate under Germany. Together with Queen Ngalifourou, Prime Minister Fulbert Youlou and his democratic regime hope to bring true parliamentarism to our new state. However, the Queen’s European contacts and nativist supporters may not be too keen on sharing power with a bunch of democrats, especially when the spectre of Socialism looms on the horizon."

### Focuses ###

TKE_coalescing_our_coalition:0 "Coalescing our Coalition"
TKE_coalescing_our_coalition_desc:0 "If we are to truly secure our independence as the colonial construct once called Mittelafrika collapses around us, the various disparate political factions of the French Congo centered around Brazzaville must come together, if only temporarily, in order to create a united front dedicated to the anti-imperialist pursuit of a free Equatorial Africa. The head of this new coalition shall be the honorable statesman Fulbert Youlou, who has campaigned for autonomy or independence first under the French and later the Germans for years, and who also has the favor of the Makoko who still holds great sway over much of the population. Although he may be a bit of a dubious figure given his apparent lust for total control of the wider independence movement, this devout Christian conservative shall be the face of the Free Congo, at least for now, and this fragile coalition shall see us to freedom!"
TKE_meeting_the_makoko:0 "Meeting with the Makoko"
TKE_meeting_the_makoko_desc:0 "The Makoko is the given title to the monarch of the Teke Kingdom, also known as the Anziku Kingdom, the Tio Kingdom, or simply the Great Makoko, and although this once-great kingdom has been reduced to a rump state centered in Mbé near Brazzaville, it still holds great sway over the local political situation even as more modernizing elements wish to break free from their traditionalist influence. The current Makoko is Ngalifourou, queen of Tekeland, who is known as a devout spiritualist devoted to the traditional Teke folk faith and a conservative anti-colonial that has only begrudgingly worked with the imperialists since their arrival, instead favoring a free French Congo where she holds great sway over her own lands, and with Fulbert Youlou - leader of the coalition - being her preferred candidate to lead a wider national government. No matter our attitudes towards Her Highness, we must meet with her all the same."
TKE_courting_democratic_cliques:0 "Courting the Progressive Cliques"
TKE_courting_democratic_cliques_desc:0 "Outside the conservative bloc centered around Youlou and the Makoko, the local political scene is mostly Left-leaning, with both radical and democratic Leftist elements being active and prominent in Brazzaville and beyond. The largest and most moderate of these Leftist political associations is the Parti Progressiste Congolais, or PPC, divided into cliques headed by competing visionaries Pierre Goura, Robert Stéphane Tchitchelle, and party founder Gérald-Félix Tchicaya, and it is these figures that we must now court if our coalition is to be much of a big tent coalition at all. Let compromise and peaceful cooperation guide us, at least until independence is achieved."
TKE_amiable_amicale_alliance:0 "An Amiable Alliance with L'Amicale"
TKE_amiable_amicale_alliance_desc:0 "L'Amicale - short for the Société Amicale des Originaires de l'Afrique Equatoriale Française - is an anti-German, anti-imperialist, and openly Leftist political association with open ties to the Commune of France created by the labor organizer turned messianic independence activist André Grenard Matswa. Tied to the nascent trade union movement in Brazzaville, L'Amicale positions themselves as heralds of the Equatorial African revolution while using spiritualist populism, various Socialist rhetoric, and grassroots activism to spread their message throughout the downtrodden masses. Popular with urban workers and the poor, L'Amicale and the wider Matswanist movement are obvious allies, even if only temporarily, in our push for freedom."
TKE_linking_with_libreville:0 "Linking Up with Libreville"
TKE_linking_with_libreville_desc:0 "Just across our northeastern border lies Gabon, another recently independent nation set loose from the collapse of Mittelafrika. Currently under the command of our fellow francophile the conservative strongman Leon M’Ba, Gabon could be a strong ally in these trying times, for we both seek to weaken the Portuguese-backed Manikongo to the South and the German-backed Belgian Congo across the Congo River. Hopefully, those in Libreville feel the same way."
TKE_arms_from_old_masters:0 "Arms from our Old Masters"
TKE_arms_from_old_masters_desc:0 "Although the Kaiserreich has been our colonial overlord since the Great War, or at least was until Mittelafrika’s sudden collapse, it was the French that first colonized this land back in 1882, and it was these French that laid the cultural and political foundations that we build from today. Always holding links to the French, and even still largely speaking their language, for Germany never really caught on here in the decade and a half or so they controlled the colony, we shall instead reach out to our old colonial overlords, whether it be the governments in Algiers or Paris, as we seek arms and supplies to win this war for our independence."
TKE_rally_political_militias:0 "Rally Political Paramilitaries"
TKE_rally_political_militias_desc:0 "Colonialism breeds many things, primarily resentment and resistance from the local inhabitants if given enough time and grief. As such, the French Congo is rife with locally-organized political paramilitaries from across the spectrum all with different ideological systems in mind, but all holding one thing in common - the burning desire for a free nation to call our own. We shall tap into these zealous radicals and dedicated militants to form a loosely-organized and decentralized military vanguard of sorts - a politically-educated officer class with members from across the aisle all dedicated to anti-colonialism and the pursuit of our complete sovereignty, no matter the cost. These men shall help train our militias and our infantile armed forces alongside the few actual officers we have that served in the colonial corps."
TKE_settle_old_scores:0 "Settle our Score with the Manikongo"
TKE_settle_old_scores_desc:0 "The time has come to march against the treacherous Manikongo to the south! The historic rivals of the Anziku Kingdom, the once formidable Kongo has been reduced to a pathetic lapdog of the Portuguese far past their prime with deluded aspirations of uniting the Kongo river basin under his foreign-tainted rule. The Manikongo and his government shall fall, freeing the Bakongo people from the clutches of European imperialism and brainwashing at long last while securing our southern border and the lucrative Congo river basin and its ports for ourselves. To arms!"
TKE_victory_against_lapdogs:0 "Prevailing Against the Portuguese Pretender"
TKE_victory_against_lapdogs_desc:0 "We have finally been proven victorious over the foreign-backed government of the Manikongo, and with it, the Portuguese will have a say in Congolese affairs no longer. Now, we must work to consolidate our hold over the Congo River Basin and prepare our infantile government for the nation building challenges that are to come. Freedom has been achieved at long last, at least for now, but it shall be a long road to stability and prosperity, and the wolves are already circling both abroad and domestically. We must be prepared."
TKE_fate_of_coalition:0 "Fate of the Crumbling Coalition"
TKE_fate_of_coalition_desc:0 "In a move that was not unexpected but also certainly not helpful, the fragile coalition formed around Fulbert Youlou with support from Queen Ngalifourou has begun to crack and crumble seemingly beyond repair, threatening to fully collapse lest a political miracle can occur to pull the disparate factions of the French Congo’s diverse political movement together once more. However, with the threat of total annihilation and continued foreign oppression no longer directly looming overhead now that independence has been won, this shall be harder than it sounds. What shall become of the coalition is not sure, but we shall soon decide its fate once and for all..."

TKE_revival_of_the_kingdom:0 "Triumph of the House of Makoko"
TKE_revival_of_the_kingdom_desc:0 "The eternal squabbling of the republicans and socialists proved without a doubt that their ideologies and modern nonsense would lead to nothing more than chaos and confusion here in the Middle Congo. With these agitators and false prophets swept aside, the new Kingdom of Teke will rise to greatness, guided by the benevolent and wise Man Ounko Ngalifourou and her loyal supporters. There is much work to be done until the devastation wrought by the internal conflict and the wider collapse of the German colonial behemoth can be undone, but under the crown we are likely to succeed and thrive once more!"
TKE_deal_with_socialists_and_republicans:0 "Strike at Socialists and Republicans"
TKE_deal_with_socialists_and_republicans_desc:0 "The socialists of Mikalé and the republicans of PPC may have served a purpose in the war against the German colonials and the Portuguese lapdogs, but their constant blabbering about outlander ideologies and supposed promises of freedom, equality and stability are little more than lofty ideals at best and outright falsehoods and lies at worst, meant to deceive the traditional populace of the Teke territory. The Republicans would sell our traditions and customs away for profit and vainglorious prestige, while the socialists would make the Teke territory little more than a protectorate of the French, merely coated crimson. If our nation is to thrive and pursue true glory here in the heart of Africa, we cannot allow such serpents to make their nest among our people. Loyal men of the Man Ounko will go from village to village and get rid of these troublemakers by any means necessary until only those with love for the Kingdom in their hearts remain to serve. Only then may we know peace, unity and prosperity."
TKE_collaborate_with_colonial_officers:0 "Collaborate with Colonial Officers"
TKE_collaborate_with_colonial_officers_desc:0 "The French colonial administration existed in the lands of the Teke from the first treaty in 1880 to the end of the Weltkrieg, and elements of it persisted even throughout the German reorganization of these territories. While many French colonists left to Algiers to fight alongside the Petainist republicans and nationalists, for many the Moyen-Congo territories had become a home in themselves, and they formed a part of the German administration, some no doubt hoping that one day the French tricolour would once more fly over these lands. The Germans introduced a whole host of new laws and directives to their freshly acquired colony, but while there was a degree of colonist outflow, they relied extensively on existing French treaties and colonial outposts to rule these primitive lands. With the collapse of Mittelafrika, we now have both French and German colonists in our lands, confused and directionless. Most have of course once again left for greener pastures in the remaining pockets of German or French colonial order, but plenty have also stayed behind. We should offer these vagabonds jobs in the running of the new Teke Kingdom, to ensure as smooth a transition as possible."
TKE_teke_spiritualism:0 "Teke Spiritualist Revival"
TKE_teke_spiritualism_desc:0 "It is no secret that Queen Ngalifourou and her late husband and king Iloo I were big proponents for the Teke to get closer to the French, and in fact, it was Ngalifourou who signed the first treaty between French authorities and traditional African royal house, and while the situation between the French and Teke would vex and wane depending on who was ruling in Paris at the time, the relationship between the tribes of our territory and the colonialists remained rather good. However, one line that Ngalifourou was never ready to cross was the adoption of the Christian faith. Catholic missionaries and local colonial officials, and later German Protestant ones, all attempted to convert the tribes of our land to their Western faith, but thanks to the intervention of Man Ounko, this never came to pass. To this day, our faith is our own, and under the guidance of the Queen Mother, it shall remain so. Queen Ngalifourou maintains a highly important position in the faith as she embodies the spirit of Nkwe Mbali, associated with the crown. In addition to her role as the monarch of our nation, she receives pilgrims from all around our kingdom, standing as the greatest beacon of the old ways in our small state. With the Queen’s rule solidified, we will revive the spiritualist ways of the Teke Kingdom to the fullest extent, and attempt to sway as many converts to Christianity back to the light of old faith."
TKE_power_to_the_queen_mother:0 "All Power to the Queen Mother"
TKE_power_to_the_queen_mother_desc:0 "After the death of former king Makoko, or Iloo I, in 1892, Queen Mother Ngalifourou has continued to rule as the mother of all Tekes. While she has married other kings of the kingdom, belonging to the thirteen different vassals of the main kingdom itself, Ngalifourou holds supreme authority in matters of the state and spiritual realm. This stems from the local Teke tradition of vesting both kings and queens with equal amounts of power, and as Ngalifourou succeeded the latest king, her influence on the realm remains the strongest. This is partially also because of her strong control of the territory of Ngabé and the city of Mbé, the capital of the kingdom, though the queen’s excellent qualities as a sovereign have not been ignored by the populace of nation. With the opponents of the regime swept away, we must now set to work to ensure that the Man Ounko of the Teke has the main authority in these diverse territories of ours, and that all the kings of the Teke will fall in line with the new monarchist system."
TKE_return_to_french_authority:0 "Return to Foreign Authority?"
TKE_return_to_french_authority_desc:0 "Since the 1880s to the end of the Weltkrieg and the collapse of the French Republic, the Teke Kingdom had been a protectorate of the French. This agreement was brokered between Makoko Iloo I and the French officer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. The kingdom became Moyen-Congo, nominally a territory of France but in reality, thirty French companies were sold much of the colony’s land. These companies would engage in large resource extraction projects in hopes of making the territory a veritable gold mine, but most soon found their coffers emptier than before with little to show for the lost investments. To the local Teke, these projects were costly as the tribesmen and -women were treated like slaves, but given the financial setbacks the French experienced, the territories of the Teke were more often than not left completely untouched by the white men. Despite the harsh treatment on behalf of the companies of France, Ngalifourou and her supporters hold a certain degree of hesitancy towards fully detaching from foreign rule. The new situation in the heart of Africa is violent and chaotic, and even if the French may have mistreated our people in the past, it is perhaps better to deal with the devil you know than the ones stalking the jungles of former Mittelafrika. However, the decision lies with Man Ounko as always, and her people look to the Queen for guidance."
TKE_woman_of_the_whites:0 "Ngalifourou, the Woman of the Whites"
TKE_woman_of_the_whites_desc:0 "Queen Mother Ngalifourou has earned many a moniker during her long reign, given by both her most ardent supporters to celebrate this venerable beacon of Teke might, and by her many bitter enemies in pointless attempts to sully said might. One that is shared by both however is the nickname ‘women of the whites’, given to Ngalifourou due to her prowess in dealing with the Europeans. Since Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza first visited these lands, Ngalifourou has remained the one constant in European-Teke relations, and our Man Ounko left such a lasting expression on de Brazza that the French officer even gifted a high-end sabre to the Queen. With the Queen leading with a strong hand, her expertise in dealing with the Europeans will surely help the Teke people reach their rightful place in the world."
TKE_a_modernized_tribal_monarchy:0 "Modernize our Tribal Monarchy"
TKE_a_modernized_tribal_monarchy_desc:0 "Modern world requires modern solutions, and this applies even to the Kingdom of Teke, as much as some traditionalists wish to resist the wheels of human progress. Man Ounko Ngalifourou has never been one to excessively push for change, and most of her supporters would be content with simply continuing the status quo that the heirs of Anziku have maintained since first emerging as a force in the region. Still, keeping our tribal monarchy as primitive as can be would only invite more Europeans, who would love to add Teke territories to their ever-hungry colonial machines. As such, educated men and experienced civil servants are what we need to modernize the administration of the kingdom to a sufficient degree, but those can only really be found within the ranks of the republicans. However, despite her distrust for the republicans and their socialist rivals, Ngalifourou sees some of them as the only possible way to bring some degree of modernity to the tribal monarchy, with the young Catholic priest Fulbert Youlou being her primary candidate to help shape the administration to keep up with the changing times."
TKE_anziku_renaissance:0 "Dawn of the Anziku Renaissance"
TKE_anziku_renaissance_desc:0 "For more than five hundred years the Ankizu have ruled the Middle Congo, from its vibrant forests to the roaring Congo river and the mighty savannahs. Their influence has ebbed and flowed throughout the centuries, but they have always remained the unquestionable rulers of Western Congo until the French colonization. Now, sovereign under the Queen Mother Ngalifourou, the Teke stand proud in the world, ready for all the challenges this new age will throw our way. The millenia old customs and traditions of the Teke honoured, our faith rekindled and our spear sharpened, the Teke Kingdom has proven itself a worthy successor state to the Ankizu and the legacy of the great king Makoko!"

TKE_democracy:0 "Democracy in Vogue"
TKE_democracy_desc:0 "As the other factions supporting the creation of an independent Moyen-Congo state have fallen into chaos and internal disarray, the liberals and conservatives of the Congolais centre have taken the reins. Led by the charismatic and firm-handed young priest Fulbert Youlou, a provisional republican government has been created to oversee a peaceful transitional period to democratic rule. The two rivaling democratic factions, Youlou’s Union Démocratique de Défense des Intérêts Africains and the big-tent Parti Progressiste Congolais have united under the temporary government to pacify the Middle Congo with a strong hand and gentle word, until both the revolutionary socialists and the rabid monarchists backed up by the Portuguese colonialists have been dealt with. Moyen Congo can only prosper if it is stable, and it will only become stable if the current crisis is efficiently dealt with."
TKE_anti_syndicalism_anti_colonialism:0 "Against Extremism, Against Colonialism"
TKE_anti_syndicalism_anti_colonialism_desc:0 "The French-backed syndicalists and Jacobins and the Portuguese-backed monarchists of the Manikongo will bring only ruin and destruction to our land. For too long have foreign interests determined what goes on in the lands of the Teke, and if these radical agitators and traditionalists are able to gain power, they will make us yet another puppet of the world powers, making our sons bleed in wars that do not concern us and taking our resources to benefit some fat cats in Paris or Lisbon. The provisional government has taken a stern stance against both extremists of the left and colonialists of the right, and will not rest until every single nest of these vipers have been burned to the ground."
TKE_modernism_and_mysticism:0 "Between Modernism and Mysticism"
TKE_modernism_and_mysticism_desc:0 "Queen Mother Ngalifourou is a powerful figure in the society of Moyen-Congo, partially because of her importance as a political figure and partially because of her spiritual significance. Ngalifourou is the widow of former king Makoko, who ruled these lands till his death in the 1880s, and since the Ngalifourou’s will has been instrumental in nearly any decision relating to the status of our small nation. Even after the democrats took power, the queen still holds considerable sway over much of the population, and thus we must be very careful in our decisions regarding her as we set out to solidify our rule over Moyen-Congo. Some members of the government are eager to see this final redoubt of traditionalism swept away into the dustbin of history that it belongs, while others urge for cooler heads to prevail. According to the latter faction, the queen could be a pacifying figurehead for our democratic process, capable of aligning the traditionalist tribes of our territory towards the new regime if we are compromising with Ngalifourou."

TKE_command_bacongo_militias_desc:0 "Without the support of Bakongo militias, the independentist forces of Moyen-Congo could have never secured Brazzaville from our former enemies. However, if the new democratic-minded regime is to survive, it must secure the support of these militias going further, lest they align with one of the more radical factions or tribes and becomes our very downfall. As such, we must get the support of powerful militia leaders one way or another, be it political favours, promises of military vacancies or just good old bribery."

TKE_elections_desc:0 "All of Moyen-Congo holds its breath as the first democratic elections of the nation are underway. The election is expected to be a highly contested affair, with the large powerblocks of PPC and UDDIA both bringing out their best leaders to fight for the future of Tekeland. They are joined by a last minute dark horse candidate in Mouvement Socialiste Africain, a local branch of the wider French SFIO organization and a moderate socialist force contesting the more liberal and conservative factions. The results of this momentous occasion will have far-reaching implications for all of Middle Congo, and as such, the regime has gone to great lengths to ensure that nothing interferes with the democratic process. Our future awaits, and the ballot box shall enlighten us on who shall deliver it to us!"

TKE_youlou_victory:0 "Victory of Youlou's UDDIA"
TKE_youlou_victory_desc:0 "Fulbert Youlou, one of the central collaborators between the German colonial administration and the local Moyen-Congo populace, has emerged victorious in the first democratic elections in Tekeland leading his Union Démocratique de Défense des Intérêts Africains. A Catholic priest by trade and conviction, he is expected to bring about a liberal-tinted Christian democratic transformation of the region, denouncing the emergence of African syndicalism in favour of a more liberal capitalist economic model. Already some worry about the man’s centralist tendencies and engagement in rather shady dealings to gain more political power and influence in the nation, but the supporters of Youlou view this as little more than ineffective slander of the rising statesman. Either way, Youlou’s rule over Moyen-Congo is bound to be an interesting time all around."
TKE_african_economic_liberalism:0 "African Economic Liberalism"
TKE_african_economic_liberalism_desc:0 "Fulbert Youlou’s esoteric mix of local folk mysticism, powerful Christian-imbued rhetoric and authoritarian nationalism has been something of an enigma to international observers, failing to grasp the multifaceted personality who now leads Moyen-Congo. However, far less difficult of a program to get one’s head around has been Youlou’s economic policy, as he is an ardent supporter of economic liberalism and has sought to utilize the riches of Middle Congo to propel the nation to greatness. His new program aims to guarantee profit off the investment of foreign and domestic companies and ensure that the typical protectionist policies of post-Mittelafrikan states are not present in the new state. Through private capital, French and German development aid and local government investments, Youlou hopes to transform the region into the heartland of African industrial and financial development. This is further helped by Youlou’s rather unbothered attitude towards budget deficits and blatant corruption in the governmental administration, to the point that Youlou’s party seems to endorse it as just another means of doing business."
TKE_youlou_personality_cult:0 "Fostering Fulbert's Following"
TKE_youlou_personality_cult_desc:0 "Opponents of the UDDIA party have long claimed that president Youlou wants nothing more than to become the sole dictator of Moyen-Congo, ruling with an iron fist and silencing any opposition to his market liberal dictatorship. This argument has been strengthening as Youlou’s personality cult formalises. Starting off innocently enough through stamps made in the ruler’s likeness, However, especially among the Lari youth, Youlou has become something of a messianic figure, a Jesus-like prophet who has arrived to deliver the people of Tekeland from the evils of colonialism. The cult of personality has led to frenzied supporters storming the houses of opposition politicians and killing them in cold-blood, while myths about the supposed miracles performed by Youlou spread around the nation. On multiple occasions, Youlou has been known to reply to opposition criticism with displays of violence, pulling out a gun from his cassock in the middle of parliamentary sessions to threaten his political rivals. As his rule solidifies, Fulbert Youlou grows more unpredictable, and his zealous followers even more so."

TKE_consolidate_the_one_party_state_desc:0 "Fulbert Youlou is known for his authoritarian tendencies, but for every rival that he disposes of through violent means, another one is recruited to the administration of UDDIA. Politicians from MSA, PPC and various other organizations have all been unable to resist the calls for unity and progress that Youlou espouses, and while the methods to get these men on board vary wildly from one individual to another, the end of the road is almost in sight. With most of his opposition swept aside and the nation pacified under the rule of UDDIA and its head Fulbet Youlou, the time has come to enshrine the one-party rule of UDDIA into law. No longer will Moyen-Congo suffer from these petty internal divisions and political backstabbing, the time has come to reach our greatness under the great chieftain Youlou and his liberal Christian political machine."

Aided by a shared language and historic past, we possess good avenues for negotiations with the Algiers regime, and while the rump state residing in northern Africa may not be the colonial powerhouse which once ruled over much of Africa, it is nonetheless far stronger economically than our fledgling state. As such, Pierre Goura seeks to contact the Nationalists in Algeria with the hopes of securing developmental aid in the form of French know-how in scientific, engineering and societal planning work, as well as in the matters of economy and military.

Our small nation must weigh its options carefully, as it does possess quite a bit of trade connections to both the Entente through the old French colonial links, and the German world-wide machine of business through former Mittelafrikan connections. Nonetheless, even if we are to throw in our lot with international market blocks, Goura is committed to ensuring that this cooperation will always remain mutually beneficial and fair to the indigenous people of Moyen-Congo, as no one here wishes a repeat of the colonial exploitation the French and Germans brought upon our lands.

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_FULBERT_YOULOU_DESC:0 "Abbé Fulbert Youlou has risen to become the first President of an independent state in the lands of the former French Congo. Born in 1917 and training to become a priest from a young age, this devout Catholic has increasingly evolved both a love for free market capitalism, economic liberalism, and conservative nationalism, and over the course of his young political career, Youlou has espoused a deeply anti-socialist sentiment that has grown to deeply anger the far more Socialist-orientated Northern regions of the nation. Now, this holy-man turned national father serves as the bastion of anti-leftist thought in the Tekeland Clique, with his rule supported by a junior officers clique from the nation’s newly formed military, which has been created from the ashes of the former Franco-German colonial administration."

TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea_desc:0 "With German rule shattered in this region, the Portuguese have begun to eye our lands.

TKE_power_struggle_idea_desc:0 "Within our infantile government, a great deal of political forces are at war with one another. From the socialist Mikalé of the messianic André Matswa, Republican elements centered around Jacques Opangault and Fulbert Youlou, tribal Bateke monarchists rallied around Queen Ngalifourou, and various pro-colonial elements, both European and native, the stage has been set for great conflict or debate. This varied and dynamic political climate has cast a great shadow over our future, and now only time will tell who shall come out on top."

TKE_Queen_Ngalifourou_idea_desc:0 "Despite our republican form of government, which was declared shortly before our independence, our regime still shares power with the local Teke monarchy which served as an autonomous protectorate under Germany. Together with Queen Ngalifourou, Prime Minister Fulbert Youlou and his democratic regime hope to bring true parliamentarism to our new state. However, the Queen’s European contacts and nativist supporters may not be too keen on sharing power with a bunch of democrats, especially when the spectre of Socialism looms on the horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n £GFX_Portrait_TKE_Ngalifourou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

### Focuses ###

TKE_coalescing_our_coalition:0 "Coalescing our Coalition"
TKE_coalescing_our_coalition_desc:0 "If we are to truly secure our independence as the colonial construct once called Mittelafrika collapses around us, the various disparate political factions of the French Congo centered around Brazzaville must come together, if only temporarily, in order to create a united front dedicated to the anti-imperialist pursuit of a free Equatorial Africa. The head of this new coalition shall be the honorable statesman Fulbert Youlou, who has campaigned for autonomy or independence first under the French and later the Germans for years, and who also has the favor of the Makoko who still holds great sway over much of the population. Although he may be a bit of a dubious figure given his apparent lust for total control of the wider independence movement, this devout Christian conservative shall be the face of the Free Congo, at least for now, and this fragile coalition shall see us to freedom!"
TKE_meeting_the_makoko:0 "Meeting with the Makoko"
TKE_meeting_the_makoko_desc:0 "The Makoko is the given title to the monarch of the Teke Kingdom, also known as the Anziku Kingdom, the Tio Kingdom, or simply the Great Makoko, and although this once-great kingdom has been reduced to a rump state centered in Mbé near Brazzaville, it still holds great sway over the local political situation even as more modernizing elements wish to break free from their traditionalist influence. The current Makoko is Ngalifourou, queen of Tekeland, who is known as a devout spiritualist devoted to the traditional Teke folk faith and a conservative anti-colonial that has only begrudgingly worked with the imperialists since their arrival, instead favoring a free French Congo where she holds great sway over her own lands, and with Fulbert Youlou - leader of the coalition - being her preferred candidate to lead a wider national government. No matter our attitudes towards Her Highness, we must meet with her all the same."
TKE_courting_democratic_cliques:0 "Courting the Progressive Cliques"
TKE_courting_democratic_cliques_desc:0 "Outside the conservative bloc centered around Youlou and the Makoko, the local political scene is mostly Left-leaning, with both radical and democratic Leftist elements being active and prominent in Brazzaville and beyond. The largest and most moderate of these Leftist political associations is the Parti Progressiste Congolais, or PPC, divided into cliques headed by competing visionaries Pierre Goura, Robert Stéphane Tchitchelle, and party founder Gérald-Félix Tchicaya, and it is these figures that we must now court if our coalition is to be much of a big tent coalition at all. Let compromise and peaceful cooperation guide us, at least until independence is achieved."
TKE_amiable_amicale_alliance:0 "An Amiable Alliance with L'Amicale"
TKE_amiable_amicale_alliance_desc:0 "L'Amicale - short for the Société Amicale des Originaires de l'Afrique Equatoriale Française - is an anti-German, anti-imperialist, and openly Leftist political association with open ties to the Commune of France created by the labor organizer turned messianic independence activist André Grenard Matswa. Tied to the nascent trade union movement in Brazzaville, L'Amicale positions themselves as heralds of the Equatorial African revolution while using spiritualist populism, various Socialist rhetoric, and grassroots activism to spread their message throughout the downtrodden masses. Popular with urban workers and the poor, L'Amicale and the wider Matswanist movement are obvious allies, even if only temporarily, in our push for freedom."
TKE_linking_with_libreville:0 "Linking Up with Libreville"
TKE_linking_with_libreville_desc:0 "Just across our northeastern border lies Gabon, another recently independent nation set loose from the collapse of Mittelafrika. Currently under the command of our fellow francophile the conservative strongman Leon M’Ba, Gabon could be a strong ally in these trying times, for we both seek to weaken the Portuguese-backed Manikongo to the South and the German-backed Belgian Congo across the Congo River. Hopefully, those in Libreville feel the same way."
TKE_arms_from_old_masters:0 "Arms from our Old Masters"
TKE_arms_from_old_masters_desc:0 "Although the Kaiserreich has been our colonial overlord since the Great War, or at least was until Mittelafrika’s sudden collapse, it was the French that first colonized this land back in 1882, and it was these French that laid the cultural and political foundations that we build from today. Always holding links to the French, and even still largely speaking their language, for Germany never really caught on here in the decade and a half or so they controlled the colony, we shall instead reach out to our old colonial overlords, whether it be the governments in Algiers or Paris, as we seek arms and supplies to win this war for our independence."
TKE_rally_political_militias:0 "Rally Political Paramilitaries"
TKE_rally_political_militias_desc:0 "Colonialism breeds many things, primarily resentment and resistance from the local inhabitants if given enough time and grief. As such, the French Congo is rife with locally-organized political paramilitaries from across the spectrum all with different ideological systems in mind, but all holding one thing in common - the burning desire for a free nation to call our own. We shall tap into these zealous radicals and dedicated militants to form a loosely-organized and decentralized military vanguard of sorts - a politically-educated officer class with members from across the aisle all dedicated to anti-colonialism and the pursuit of our complete sovereignty, no matter the cost. These men shall help train our militias and our infantile armed forces alongside the few actual officers we have that served in the colonial corps."
TKE_settle_old_scores:0 "Settle our Score with the Manikongo"
TKE_settle_old_scores_desc:0 "The time has come to march against the treacherous Manikongo to the south! The historic rivals of the Anziku Kingdom, the once formidable Kongo has been reduced to a pathetic lapdog of the Portuguese far past their prime with deluded aspirations of uniting the Kongo river basin under his foreign-tainted rule. The Manikongo and his government shall fall, freeing the Bakongo people from the clutches of European imperialism and brainwashing at long last while securing our southern border and the lucrative Congo river basin and its ports for ourselves. To arms!"
TKE_victory_against_lapdogs:0 "Prevailing Against the Portuguese Pretender"
TKE_victory_against_lapdogs_desc:0 "We have finally been proven victorious over the foreign-backed government of the Manikongo, and with it, the Portuguese will have a say in Congolese affairs no longer. Now, we must work to consolidate our hold over the Congo River Basin and prepare our infantile government for the nation building challenges that are to come. Freedom has been achieved at long last, at least for now, but it shall be a long road to stability and prosperity, and the wolves are already circling both abroad and domestically. We must be prepared."
TKE_fate_of_coalition:0 "Fate of the Crumbling Coalition"
TKE_fate_of_coalition_desc:0 "In a move that was not unexpected but also certainly not helpful, the fragile coalition formed around Fulbert Youlou with support from Queen Ngalifourou has begun to crack and crumble seemingly beyond repair, threatening to fully collapse lest a political miracle can occur to pull the disparate factions of the French Congo’s diverse political movement together once more. However, with the threat of total annihilation and continued foreign oppression no longer directly looming overhead now that independence has been won, this shall be harder than it sounds. What shall become of the coalition is not sure, but we shall soon decide its fate once and for all..."

TKE_beyond_brazzaville:0 "Beyond Brazzaville"
TKE_beyond_brazzaville_desc:0 "After the initial reforms of our government begin to bear fruit, the Congo now breathes a sigh of relief as we finally recover from both our bloody independence war and the bitter factionalism that had shook the young nation to its very core. With these domestic issues at rest, we shall look outwards to defend our newfound independence as well as exert our influence across Africa. By utilizing our unique position at the heart of Africa, we will use our geography as a springboard to become an important player in African affairs."
TKE_unite_moyen_congo:0 "Uniting 'Mittelkongo'"
TKE_unite_moyen_congo_desc:0 "Following our war of independence against the crumbling giant of Mittelafrika and the armies of the Manikongo and his Portuguese backers, we have brought the former colony of Moyen-Congo under the administration of Brazzaville once more. We were able to expel these colonial forces through an alliance with Gabon, another French-speaking nation fighting to secure its independence. Although we faced a common foe, this conflict has left Libreville and Brazzaville to compete for influence over the region of Mittelkongo, the former German colony comprising Gabon and Moyen-Congo. Either through means of war or leveraging with our allies, we will make sure that our designs for the post-colonial order are fully realised."
TKE_new_allies:0 "New Allies, Old Adversaries"
TKE_new_allies_desc:0 "The emergence of new states from the carcass of Mittelafrika has led to what can be described as a second Scramble for Africa. With its vast resources free from the grip of German industrialists, foreign powers have restored to more indirect means to exert their influence over these new nations. With this new post-colonial world taking form, we must choose our new allies wisely. Shall we return to the fold of our old masters on equal footing, join the Internationale in their struggle against colonialism, or forge a new path alongside our African brethren?"
TKE_towards_equatorial_africa:0 "Towards Equatorial Africa"
TKE_towards_equatorial_africa_desc:0 "For decades, Brazzaville has played a central role for both the French and German colonial administrations. Serving as the capital of both French Equatorial Africa and later the entirety of Äquatorialafrika, our city has grown rapidly to administer such an expansive and diverse territory. As we move to secure our nation's newfound independence, we shall look to expand Congolais influence into our northern frontier. Hosting an array of rival governments ranging from the German redoubt in Kamerun to the socialist revolutionaries of the Adamawa Clique, Islamic chiefdoms to the far north, and the unstable government of [CEA.getleader] in Ubangi-Shari, we will work diligently to establish a foothold in Equatorial Africa."
TKE_towards_congo_basin:0 "Crossing the Mto Kongo"
TKE_towards_congo_basin_desc:0 "With the fall of Mittelafrika, the delicate balance of power in the former Belgian Congo has utterly collapsed. With colonial holdouts, mercenaries, rogue capitalists, and native cliques each vying for power, there seems to be no end in sight for this conflict. To secure our eastern flank, we will play our hand and cross the Congo River to help restore order to this vast and resource rich land. We must plan accordingly, either achieving our goals through forging strong alliances with these upstart cliques or escalating our intervention by claiming the mantle of a free Congo for ourselves."
TKE_restoring_mittelafrika:0 "Restoring the Behemoth"
TKE_restoring_mittelafrika_desc:0 "After our victorious military campaigns across Equatorial Africa, the forces of the Queen Mother have accomplished the impossible. Once a curious statelet at the edge of the Congo, the Tiyo Kingdom has risen to become the sole giant of Equatorial Africa. As we reach the zenith of the Anziku golden age, our colonial benefactors have insisted that Queen Mother march her warriors towards the kingdom’s ultimate goal, the restoration of Mittelafrika. With the tantalizing prospect of Africa’s vast mineral wealth under our joint ownership, only time will tell if we can retain our overlordship over this reforged colonial monolith."
TKE_unite_bas_congo:0 "The Realm of the Bantu"
TKE_unite_bas_congo_desc:0 "After outmanoeuvring his rivals both domestically and abroad, Abbé Youlou has triumphed over his enemies and has emerged as the unquestioned master of Equatorial Africa. While the young priest could simply bask in this already impressive victory and amass a fortune from his current graft, Youlou is a man of great ambitions. The young Abbé shall make preparations to lead his flock towards the realization of his ambitious dream, the unification of not only the Bas-Congo region, but all Bantu peoples under his righteous leadership. Youlou’s proposed unification of his Bantu brethren shall not only serve as an African bulwark against the siren song of socialism, but also allow the Abbé to expand his kleptocracy and line his cassock with new opportunities for wealth."
TKE_unite_latin_africa:0 "Uniting Latin Africa"
TKE_unite_latin_africa_desc:0 "In our fellow Francophone nation of Ubangi-Shari, the young firebrand Barthélemy Boganda has made a name for himself in democratic circles. The uncle of the mad Askari, Jean-Bédel Bokassa, Boganda has used his familial ties to advocate for the unification of the Latin nations of Equatorial Africa under one banner. This proposal for pan-Latin unity has swept through the PPC, with its fervent adherents wishing to co-op Boganda’s beliefs in Brazzaville and march towards Latin unity under our leadership."
TKE_unite_french_africa:0 "Uniting Francophone Africa"
TKE_unite_french_africa_desc:0 "Although we have liberated our brothers in the Congo and Equatorial Africa from the clutches of imperialism, large portions of our diasporic kin continue to languish under colonial rule. Utilising our ties to our parent organization, Mikalé, we will make contacts across West Africa to make preparations for a final blow to bring an end to French reactionism in Algiers. From the bustling cities of Dakar and Ouagadougou to our far-flung Malagasy brothers in Madagascar, we will not rest until our kin are free from the shackles of colonialism."

TKE_revival_of_the_kingdom:0 "Triumph of the House of Makoko"
TKE_revival_of_the_kingdom_desc:0 "The eternal squabbling of the republicans and socialists proved without a doubt that their ideologies and modern nonsense would lead to nothing more than chaos and confusion here in the Middle Congo. With these agitators and false prophets swept aside, the new Kingdom of Teke will rise to greatness, guided by the benevolent and wise Man Ounko Ngalifourou and her loyal supporters. There is much work to be done until the devastation wrought by the internal conflict and the wider collapse of the German colonial behemoth can be undone, but under the crown we are likely to succeed and thrive once more!"
TKE_deal_with_socialists_and_republicans:0 "Strike at Socialists and Republicans"
TKE_deal_with_socialists_and_republicans_desc:0 "The socialists of Mikalé and the republicans of PPC may have served a purpose in the war against the German colonials and the Portuguese lapdogs, but their constant blabbering about outlander ideologies and supposed promises of freedom, equality and stability are little more than lofty ideals at best and outright falsehoods and lies at worst, meant to deceive the traditional populace of the Teke territory. The Republicans would sell our traditions and customs away for profit and vainglorious prestige, while the socialists would make the Teke territory little more than a protectorate of the French, merely coated crimson. If our nation is to thrive and pursue true glory here in the heart of Africa, we cannot allow such serpents to make their nest among our people. Loyal men of the Man Ounko will go from village to village and get rid of these troublemakers by any means necessary until only those with love for the Kingdom in their hearts remain to serve. Only then may we know peace, unity and prosperity."
TKE_collaborate_with_colonial_officers:0 "Collaborate with Colonial Officers"
TKE_collaborate_with_colonial_officers_desc:0 "The French colonial administration existed in the lands of the Teke from the first treaty in 1880 to the end of the Weltkrieg, and elements of it persisted even throughout the German reorganization of these territories. While many French colonists left to Algiers to fight alongside the Petainist republicans and nationalists, for many the Moyen-Congo territories had become a home in themselves, and they formed a part of the German administration, some no doubt hoping that one day the French tricolour would once more fly over these lands. The Germans introduced a whole host of new laws and directives to their freshly acquired colony, but while there was a degree of colonist outflow, they relied extensively on existing French treaties and colonial outposts to rule these primitive lands. With the collapse of Mittelafrika, we now have both French and German colonists in our lands, confused and directionless. Most have of course once again left for greener pastures in the remaining pockets of German or French colonial order, but plenty have also stayed behind. We should offer these vagabonds jobs in the running of the new Teke Kingdom, to ensure as smooth a transition as possible."
TKE_teke_spiritualism:0 "Teke Spiritualist Revival"
TKE_teke_spiritualism_desc:0 "It is no secret that Queen Ngalifourou and her late husband and king Iloo I were big proponents for the Teke to get closer to the French, and in fact, it was Ngalifourou who signed the first treaty between French authorities and traditional African royal house, and while the situation between the French and Teke would vex and wane depending on who was ruling in Paris at the time, the relationship between the tribes of our territory and the colonialists remained rather good. However, one line that Ngalifourou was never ready to cross was the adoption of the Christian faith. Catholic missionaries and local colonial officials, and later German Protestant ones, all attempted to convert the tribes of our land to their Western faith, but thanks to the intervention of Man Ounko, this never came to pass. To this day, our faith is our own, and under the guidance of the Queen Mother, it shall remain so. Queen Ngalifourou maintains a highly important position in the faith as she embodies the spirit of Nkwe Mbali, associated with the crown. In addition to her role as the monarch of our nation, she receives pilgrims from all around our kingdom, standing as the greatest beacon of the old ways in our small state. With the Queen’s rule solidified, we will revive the spiritualist ways of the Teke Kingdom to the fullest extent, and attempt to sway as many converts to Christianity back to the light of old faith."
TKE_power_to_the_queen_mother:0 "All Power to the Queen Mother"
TKE_power_to_the_queen_mother_desc:0 "After the death of former king Makoko, or Iloo I, in 1892, Queen Mother Ngalifourou has continued to rule as the mother of all Tekes. While she has married other kings of the kingdom, belonging to the thirteen different vassals of the main kingdom itself, Ngalifourou holds supreme authority in matters of the state and spiritual realm. This stems from the local Teke tradition of vesting both kings and queens with equal amounts of power, and as Ngalifourou succeeded the latest king, her influence on the realm remains the strongest. This is partially also because of her strong control of the territory of Ngabé and the city of Mbé, the capital of the kingdom, though the queen’s excellent qualities as a sovereign have not been ignored by the populace of nation. With the opponents of the regime swept away, we must now set to work to ensure that the Man Ounko of the Teke has the main authority in these diverse territories of ours, and that all the kings of the Teke will fall in line with the new monarchist system."
TKE_return_to_french_authority:0 "Return to Foreign Authority?"
TKE_return_to_french_authority_desc:0 "Since the 1880s to the end of the Weltkrieg and the collapse of the French Republic, the Teke Kingdom had been a protectorate of the French. This agreement was brokered between Makoko Iloo I and the French officer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. The kingdom became Moyen-Congo, nominally a territory of France but in reality, thirty French companies were sold much of the colony’s land. These companies would engage in large resource extraction projects in hopes of making the territory a veritable gold mine, but most soon found their coffers emptier than before with little to show for the lost investments. To the local Teke, these projects were costly as the tribesmen and -women were treated like slaves, but given the financial setbacks the French experienced, the territories of the Teke were more often than not left completely untouched by the white men. Despite the harsh treatment on behalf of the companies of France, Ngalifourou and her supporters hold a certain degree of hesitancy towards fully detaching from foreign rule. The new situation in the heart of Africa is violent and chaotic, and even if the French may have mistreated our people in the past, it is perhaps better to deal with the devil you know than the ones stalking the jungles of former Mittelafrika. However, the decision lies with Man Ounko as always, and her people look to the Queen for guidance."
TKE_woman_of_the_whites:0 "Ngalifourou, the Woman of the Whites"
TKE_woman_of_the_whites_desc:0 "Queen Mother Ngalifourou has earned many a moniker during her long reign, given by both her most ardent supporters to celebrate this venerable beacon of Teke might, and by her many bitter enemies in pointless attempts to sully said might. One that is shared by both however is the nickname ‘women of the whites’, given to Ngalifourou due to her prowess in dealing with the Europeans. Since Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza first visited these lands, Ngalifourou has remained the one constant in European-Teke relations, and our Man Ounko left such a lasting expression on de Brazza that the French officer even gifted a high-end sabre to the Queen. With the Queen leading with a strong hand, her expertise in dealing with the Europeans will surely help the Teke people reach their rightful place in the world."
TKE_a_modernized_tribal_monarchy:0 "Modernize our Tribal Monarchy"
TKE_a_modernized_tribal_monarchy_desc:0 "Modern world requires modern solutions, and this applies even to the Kingdom of Teke, as much as some traditionalists wish to resist the wheels of human progress. Man Ounko Ngalifourou has never been one to excessively push for change, and most of her supporters would be content with simply continuing the status quo that the heirs of Anziku have maintained since first emerging as a force in the region. Still, keeping our tribal monarchy as primitive as can be would only invite more Europeans, who would love to add Teke territories to their ever-hungry colonial machines. As such, educated men and experienced civil servants are what we need to modernize the administration of the kingdom to a sufficient degree, but those can only really be found within the ranks of the republicans. However, despite her distrust for the republicans and their socialist rivals, Ngalifourou sees some of them as the only possible way to bring some degree of modernity to the tribal monarchy, with the young Catholic priest Fulbert Youlou being her primary candidate to help shape the administration to keep up with the changing times."

Still somewhat of a foreign concept to much of the nation, Kikhounga-Ngot and his clique of Syndo-Matswanists will have to work tirelessly to bring syndicalism inspired by the messiah to Moyen Congo while also making it approachable and palatable to the working masses by utilizing the legacy of our own national father and populist prophet."

Opangault and the MSA have claimed to take a moderate stance in comparison to the more extremist factions that fell under the big tent of the Matswa. While their ties to Paris have been a concern to our caretaker government, Youlou has made an exception for the MSA and has allowed them to take part in the election following a private meeting between the two party chiefs."

teke.11.t:0 "Modernizing our Monarchy?"
teke.11.d:0 "It is no great surprise that Queen Ngalifourou is a strong traditionalist in her rule over the realm of the Teke, but even the staunchest hardliner to cling to the old ways must admit that sometimes, a reflection on the policies and ways of governance is needed. Advisors to the Queen have suggested that the path forward lies either in the collaboration with the local republican democrats or the traditionalist chiefs, both sides holding considerably sway over the Teke people and while they do not necessarily threaten the Queen’s power, either could be a key ally in our fight for the continued survival of the kingdom. There are numerous republicans and socialists in these lands who are fully unsuitable to stand alongside the beloved monarch, but the UDDIA party of Fulbert Youlou forms perhaps the strongest candidate for cooperation. Youlou is a man of relatively modern approach to governance, having been educated in the Christian schools and seminaries, and while he is a devout Christian, his vision on the economy falls into far more liberal directions than could be expected. He has shown a great deal of respect for the Queen and the old ways of the Teke in the past, but some supporters of Ngalifourou spread rumours that the man is also a power-hungry opportunist and prone to esotericism despite his love for the white man’s faith, and thus an alliance with him must be a cautious one lest Youlou tries to seize power for himself and himself alone. The traditional chiefs of the kingdom are a far more reliable ally, for while they contain ambitious men as well, the chiefs are highly localized and focused on the matters of their own people. The Queen represents a branch of the Teke royal family that is only one of five such families, and the new monarch is chosen from a council called Ikil-Mpuh, which is made up of twenty dignitaries from these families. However, if we were to empower traditionalist chiefs, they could have a degree of say in this process as well, as well as getting more influence in the advisory council of the Man Ounko. This would obviously decentralize the power of the Queen further as well. Central part of the debate has also been that of religion, as Youlou’s UDDIA is a highly Christian party while the chiefs of Teke mainly follow the local religion and animist beliefs, though a few have converted to the white man’s faith as well. However, while both of these options offer their strengths and weaknesses, we could also simply continue the current line of the Man Ounko’s governance, given that it has been a tried and tested form of Teke politics for a long time and the Queen’s role is hardly threatened as of now."
teke.11.a:0 "We shall cooperate with the favored Youlou and the UDDIA."
teke.11.b:0 "Continue our course with the Queen."
teke.11.c:0 "The traditionalist chiefs are empowered."

teke.12.t:0 "Our Old Masters"
teke.12.d:0 "The Teke Kingdom has a long and storied history of independent rule, a freedom that finally ended after the Great Makoko Iloo signed a treaty to transform the Kingdom into a French protectorate in 1880. Under France, the Teke were mostly left to their own devices. Queen Ngalifourou was however a strong supporter of the French, and gained the respect of these colonial masters. The French rulers helped Man Ounko pave a path to political domination by supporting the monarch against her numerous rivals, and this aid was paid back by the Teke as many Congolais troops fought for the French cause during the Weltkrieg. The subsequent German rule did initially hit Ngalifourou harder than most Teke due to this deep French collaboration, but eventually the German colonial order saw it best to continue the collaboration rather than to poke the greatest authority in the region. Ngalifourou’s diplomatic exploits combined with the pragmatic and hands-off approach of the Germans made the German rule a rather beneficial period for the Congolais as well, especially compared to the period of unrest that raged in the German-Belgian Congo. As the kingdom’s internal affairs have stabilized and the Queen is the paramount figure lording over the nation, the question of our foreign commitments have been raised once more. The French connection remains strong, especially given our existing trade connections and ease of communication, as well as Ngalifourou’s existing bias towards the French nationalists. However, the Algiers regime is hardly a powerhouse of global politics anymore, and aligning with them could very well lead to us throwing our lot in with a sinking ship. Another option would be to join the Reichspakt’s embrace once more, given that we have been under German protection for the last twenty years and the collapse of the Mittelafrikan colony could lead to a far more equal relationship between the Teke and Berlin. However, many still remember the German boot hanging over our lands, and thus are not particularly excited to support the Kaiserreich and its colonial holdouts in Africa, fearing that it would bring about yet another period of colonial rule. As such, perhaps the safest option would simply be to remain independent of the white man, given their propensity to imperialist domination."

Thus, the diverse influences of Youlou have made UDDIA an odd mixture of free market capitalism, local mysticism regarding the beloved leader, and Christian democratic influences. Representatives of UDDIA have claimed that under Youlou, the young Congolais state will ensure that profits from investment are to be guaranteed by the state, and that the party will do everything in its power to attract capital which will help fuel the growing economic might of the nation. The Moyen-Congo territory is perhaps not the resource-rich paradise of the larger Congo territory, but it possesses all the makings of a true industrial powerhouse. While the Germans had largely decided to focus on the larger Congo-Vrijstaat, Moyen-Congo had nonetheless been the target of many infrastructure projects, and compared to the larger Congo, illiteracy and lack of societal cohesion were less of a detriment to the smaller Congolais state. As such, Youlou believes that Moyen-Congo could become the business capital of Africa. However, this belief does clash with the Christian ethics of the rest of his party, with some claiming that such unfettered love for the big capital is bound to cause money to replace God in the hierarchy of the Congolais, forgetting good Christian values in name of capitalist debauchery. To avoid a schism within the party, Youlou must impose his will upon the party and use his status as the true leader of UDDIA to ensure that such rebellious sentiments are crushed before they are allowed to fester."

With colonial remnants, rogue capitalists, republican revolutionaries, and unscrupulous mercenaries all bending the knee to Abbé Youlou, we now face the monumental task of governing over such a vast and ethnically diverse territory. To ease the administrative strain of the bureaucrats in Brazzaville, we have forged an alliance with local chiefs and regionalist parties to administer the greater Congo Basin, most notable being Moïse Tshombe, leader of the Katangan regionalists of CONAKAT. Hoping to take his slice of the pie, the cunning Tshombe has requested a meeting with the Abbé to ensure the continued flow of profit in the Congo.\n\nMaking use of Tshombe’s connections with the UMHK, these mining speculators would be invited back into the country while dividing the former colony between Brazzaville, European investors, and a highly autonomous State of Katanga. The wealthy Bas-Congo region would be annexed by our government and the rest of the Congo would be carved up between a separate Kasaian and a rump Congolese Republic, curbing the thought of unity forevermore. While this proposal has garnered the support of many UDDIA leaders, others see Tshombe’s scheme as merely a ploy to invite these snakes back into our Eden."

Already, their calls for a “true proletarian party” have grown increasingly bold, and they have embarked on brazen attempts to subvert our state left and rìght, through political coercion, industrial sabotage, and so forth, which has exacerbated the already tenacious unity within the movement. While the MNR could simply weather their dissidence with approval from the movement’s majority, there have been certain proposals being floated around at conceding to these radicals in the name of revolutionary unity, with two being the most popular: \n\nThe first option is to abolish the MNR entirely and fully commit to the founding of a totalizing vanguard party of the proletariat, at the cost of alienating and even cracking down on more moderate interests within the revolutionary movement, while the second option, popular with many within our movement itself, is to form a separate leading vanguard party, while reforming and subordinating the MNR to become an advisory platform for this new party, preserving the proletarian dictatorship but not alienating our less ideological interests within the revolution, even if some stubborn Leftists would still disagree with this course. With these proposals in mind, ultimately the final decision lay with Débat and his trusted confidants to decide the final course of the Congolese revolution."

teke.22.d:0 "The Moyen-Congo state under Fulbert Youlou and his fervent supporters in the UDDIA have, through the strength of their arms, cunning of their leaders and the internal weakness of their enemies, marched from one victory to another. Our enemies have crumbled under the great Abbé and his armies, and what little resistance remains has been forced into hiding in the lush jungles and riverbeds of the Congo Basin. Imperialists, rival tribes and ideological fanatics all tremble at the mention of the new empire of Youlou, and it seems as if the military might of the Congolais forces is unstoppable. However, with our continued streak of victories, the appetite for further conquests have grown among the people of Moyen-Congo, either out of imperialist glee or genuine desire to see the Dark Continent liberated from its European overlords, socialist false shepherds or autocratic despots.\n\nThe Congo Basin is a price in itself, and one that will guarantee the prosperity of our people for decades to come if we can unite the disparate groups that make up this gigantic land, but to some within Youlou’s inner circle, this is only the beginning. They view Bas-Congo not as an end goal in itself, but a stepping stone to something greater, so grand that it would shift the balance of power in the entire world if formalized. To these hawkish individuals, only the achievement of full unity between the disunited and wide-reaching Bantu people can truly satisfy the need for expansion, and as a bonus, it would liberate most of Africa from the accursed exploiters of Berlin, Paris and London, as well as creating one of the most resource-rich, culturally diverse and economically lucrative nations in the world.\n\nThis goal may seem megalomaniac to many, and indeed Youlou himself has not made a decision on whether to support such a grand endeavour, but given the recent uptick in Bantu nationalism following Mittelafrika’s collapse and the continued calls for African unity against imperialism and colonialism, perhaps this dream of an unified Bantu Empire is not so whimsical as it may initially appear. Nonetheless, even if Youlou rejects the dreams of a monolithic Bantu state, the Bas-Congo will be an empire of great size and power either way."

teke.23.t:0 "Ambitions for a New Empire?"
teke.23.d:0 "It is no secret that Fulbert Youlou is not a mere politician dedicated to a cause but a man larger than life in everything he puts his mind to, and as his power has grown, the man’s ego has expanded in suit. As the liberal Christian has eclipsed his many rivals and solidified his power base, his personality cult has increasingly been blown out of proportions to the point that numerous myths and legends circulate about Youlou, and his supporters are frequently driven into a violent frenzy for their leader. This was already the case when the Congolais state had merely just been proclaimed and Fulbert Youlou was in the process of building up his supporter base, but as he now sits atop an empire of his own making, Youlou finds himself at the top of the world. Under such a successful leader, the personality cult has become so large and fervent that Youlou holds little actual sway on the beliefs it produces, and thus even the great Abbé was rather taken aback when some of his most fervent loyalists brought up a proposal to their leader and mentor earlier today.\n\nThe most zealous supporters of Youlou have seen the great works of their leader and come to the conclusion that the new realm of UDDIA cannot be confined to be a simple nation under a ministerial or presidential figure, for these are far too mundane for the glory of Youlou. Instead, Fulbert Youlou should embrace his God-ordained duty as the liberator and leader of Africa, but instead of being a mere political figure, he should be the Emperor of his new realm. After all, if the tribal chiefs and kings were unable to unify the vast lands of Africa, but the Kaisers and Emperors of the European powers did so in a matter of roughly a century, then perhaps the homegrown leader of all Africans should emulate this model instead. Thus, the beloved master of UDDIA and Central Africa should be none other than Emperor Fulbert I. However, even Youlou’s ego is not large enough to accept such a proposal without hesitation, and some part of him finds a declaration of this magnitude to be completely ridiculous in nature."

The Teke people have not avoided this fate either, with Europeans claiming that our people engaged in cannibalism as far back as the 16th century. However, as Man Ounko Ngalifourou is the symbolic heir to the Kingdom of Anziku, the most recent insult to our great people has hit particularly hard.

Lovecraft has become a small success story among the academics, clergymen and administrator classes of our nation, thanks to the boost in popularity of the man’s books following his takeover of the American splinter nation of New England. However, much to the horror of the patriotic Congolais, this American author has seemingly decided to perpetuate the falsified account of our people being cannibals in his book The Picture in the House. The story details a lost wanderer who stumbles upon the house of an old man, and this eccentric hermit shows the visitor a picture of a Anziku butcher’s shop depicting the tribesmen of the Moyen-Congo performing all kinds of animalistic rituals involving the consumption of human flesh. The stranger then claims that the picture has caused him to acquire a hunger for delicacies of the forgotten kind, and while the man’s cannibalistic practices are not confirmed outright, they are heavily implied.\n\nThe story is not alone in its racist and heavily caricature-reliant portrayals of non-white human beings, as Lovecraft is well-known for using stereotypes as inspiration for his monsters, and thus this slander of the noble Teke is merely yet another insult on a long line of hatred. Nonetheless, queen Ngalifourou and many of her advisors have been absolutely enraged by such attacks against our people, and some have even gone as far as to suggest that we topple the Yellow King’s realm out of vengeance. However, those with cooler heads have brought up the matter of logistics and the fact that the Atlantic ocean separates the two nations, making attempts at revenge a massive endeavour."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_FULBERT_YOULOU_DESC:0 "Abbé Fulbert Youlou has risen to become the first President of an independent state in the lands of the former French Congo. Born in 1917 and training to become a priest from a young age, this devout Catholic has increasingly evolved both a love for free market capitalism, economic liberalism, and conservative nationalism, and over the course of his young political career, Youlou has espoused a deeply anti-socialist sentiment that has grown to deeply anger the far more Socialist-orientated Northern regions of the nation. Now, this holy-man turned national father serves as the bastion of anti-leftist thought in the Tekeland Clique, with his rule supported by a junior officers clique from the nation’s newly formed military, which has been created from the ashes of the former Franco-German colonial administration."

### Ideas ###

TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea:0 "Defense Against Portugal"
TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea_desc:0 "With German rule shattered in this region, the Portuguese have begun to eye our lands. We must bolster our defences against these colonials and their allies under the Manikongo while still keeping tabs on the bubbling French and German remnants within our own borders, lest our nation be re-colonized before we can even attempt self-rule."
TKE_power_struggle_idea:0 "Pressures of Factionalism"
TKE_power_struggle_idea_desc:0 "Within our infantile government, a great deal of political forces are at war with one another. From anti-democratic Socialists under Alphonse Massamba-Débat, Republican elements centered around Jacques Opangault and Fulbert Youlou, tribal Bateke monarchists rallied around Queen Ngalifourou, and various pro-colonial elements, both European and native, the stage has been set for great conflict or debate. This varied and dynamic political climate has cast a great shadow over our future, and now only time will tell who shall come out on top."
TKE_Queen_Ngalifarou_I_idea:0 "Ngalifarou I"
TKE_Queen_Ngalifarou_I_idea_desc:0 "Despite our republican form of government, which was declared shortly before our independence, our regime still shares power with the local Teke monarchy which served as an autonomous protectorate under Germany. Together with Queen Ngalifarou, Prime Minister Fulbert Youlou and his democratic regime hope to bring true parliamentarism to our new state. However, the Queen’s European contacts and nativist supporters may not be too keen on sharing power with a bunch of democrats, especially when the spectre of Socialism looms on the horizon."

### Focuses ###

TKE_coalescing_our_coalition:0 "Coalescing our Coalition"
TKE_coalescing_our_coalition_desc:0 "If we are to truly secure our independence as the colonial construct once called Mittelafrika collapses around us, the various disparate political factions of the French Congo centered around Brazzaville must come together, if only temporarily, in order to create a united front dedicated to the anti-imperialist pursuit of a free Equatorial Africa. The head of this new coalition shall be the honorable statesman Fulbert Youlou, who has campaigned for autonomy or independence first under the French and later the Germans for years, and who also has the favor of the Makoko who still holds great sway over much of the population. Although he may be a bit of a dubious figure given his apparent lust for total control of the wider independence movement, this devout Christian conservative shall be the face of the Free Congo, at least for now, and this fragile coalition shall see us to freedom!"
TKE_meeting_the_makoko:0 "Meeting with the Makoko"
TKE_meeting_the_makoko_desc:0 "The Makoko is the given title to the monarch of the Teke Kingdom, also known as the Anziku Kingdom, the Tio Kingdom, or simply the Great Makoko, and although this once-great kingdom has been reduced to a rump state centered in Mbé near Brazzaville, it still holds great sway over the local political situation even as more modernizing elements wish to break free from their traditionalist influence. The current Makoko is Ngalifourou, queen of Tekeland, who is known as a devout spiritualist devoted to the traditional Teke folk faith and a conservative anti-colonial that has only begrudgingly worked with the imperialists since their arrival, instead favoring a free French Congo where she holds great sway over her own lands, and with Fulbert Youlou - leader of the coalition - being her preferred candidate to lead a wider national government. No matter our attitudes towards Her Highness, we must meet with her all the same."
TKE_courting_democratic_cliques:0 "Courting the Progressive Cliques"
TKE_courting_democratic_cliques_desc:0 "Outside the conservative bloc centered around Youlou and the Makoko, the local political scene is mostly Left-leaning, with both radical and democratic Leftist elements being active and prominent in Brazzaville and beyond. The largest and most moderate of these Leftist political associations is the Parti Progressiste Congolais, or PPC, divided into cliques headed by competing visionaries Pierre Goura, Robert Stéphane Tchitchelle, and party founder Gérald-Félix Tchicaya, and it is these figures that we must now court if our coalition is to be much of a big tent coalition at all. Let compromise and peaceful cooperation guide us, at least until independence is achieved."
TKE_amiable_amicale_alliance:0 "An Amiable Alliance with L'Amicale"
TKE_amiable_amicale_alliance_desc:0 "L'Amicale - short for the Société Amicale des Originaires de l'Afrique Equatoriale Française - is an anti-German, anti-imperialist, and openly Leftist political association with open ties to the Commune of France created by the labor organizer turned messianic independence activist André Grenard Matswa. Tied to the nascent trade union movement in Brazzaville, L'Amicale positions themselves as heralds of the Equatorial African revolution while using spiritualist populism, various Socialist rhetoric, and grassroots activism to spread their message throughout the downtrodden masses. Popular with urban workers and the poor, L'Amicale and the wider Matswanist movement are obvious allies, even if only temporarily, in our push for freedom."
TKE_linking_with_libreville:0 "Linking Up with Libreville"
TKE_linking_with_libreville_desc:0 "Just across our northeastern border lies Gabon, another recently independent nation set loose from the collapse of Mittelafrika. Currently under the command of our fellow francophile the conservative strongman Leon M’Ba, Gabon could be a strong ally in these trying times, for we both seek to weaken the Portuguese-backed Manikongo to the South and the German-backed Belgian Congo across the Congo River. Hopefully, those in Libreville feel the same way."
TKE_arms_from_old_masters:0 "Arms from our Old Masters"
TKE_arms_from_old_masters_desc:0 "Although the Kaiserreich has been our colonial overlord since the Great War, or at least was until Mittelafrika’s sudden collapse, it was the French that first colonized this land back in 1882, and it was these French that laid the cultural and political foundations that we build from today. Always holding links to the French, and even still largely speaking their language, for Germany never really caught on here in the decade and a half or so they controlled the colony, we shall instead reach out to our old colonial overlords, whether it be the governments in Algiers or Paris, as we seek arms and supplies to win this war for our independence."
TKE_rally_political_militias:0 "Rally Political Paramilitaries"
TKE_rally_political_militias_desc:0 "Colonialism breeds many things, primarily resentment and resistance from the local inhabitants if given enough time and grief. As such, the French Congo is rife with locally-organized political paramilitaries from across the spectrum all with different ideological systems in mind, but all holding one thing in common - the burning desire for a free nation to call our own. We shall tap into these zealous radicals and dedicated militants to form a loosely-organized and decentralized military vanguard of sorts - a politically-educated officer class with members from across the aisle all dedicated to anti-colonialism and the pursuit of our complete sovereignty, no matter the cost. These men shall help train our militias and our infantile armed forces alongside the few actual officers we have that served in the colonial corps."
TKE_settle_old_scores:0 "Settle our Score with the Manikongo"
TKE_settle_old_scores_desc:0 "The time has come to march against the treacherous Manikongo to the south! The historic rivals of the Anziku Kingdom, the once formidable Kongo has been reduced to a pathetic lapdog of the Portuguese far past their prime with deluded aspirations of uniting the Kongo river basin under his foreign-tainted rule. The Manikongo and his government shall fall, freeing the Bakongo people from the clutches of European imperialism and brainwashing at long last while securing our southern border and the lucrative Congo river basin and its ports for ourselves. To arms!"
TKE_victory_against_lapdogs:0 "Prevailing Against the Portuguese Pretender"
TKE_victory_against_lapdogs_desc:0 "We have finally been proven victorious over the foreign-backed government of the Manikongo, and with it, the Portuguese will have a say in Congolese affairs no longer. Now, we must work to consolidate our hold over the Congo River Basin and prepare our infantile government for the nation building challenges that are to come. Freedom has been achieved at long last, at least for now, but it shall be a long road to stability and prosperity, and the wolves are already circling both abroad and domestically. We must be prepared."
TKE_fate_of_coalition:0 "Fate of the Crumbling Coalition"
TKE_fate_of_coalition_desc:0 "In a move that was not unexpected but also certainly not helpful, the fragile coalition formed around Fulbert Youlou with support from Queen Ngalifourou has begun to crack and crumble seemingly beyond repair, threatening to fully collapse lest a political miracle can occur to pull the disparate factions of the French Congo’s diverse political movement together once more. However, with the threat of total annihilation and continued foreign oppression no longer directly looming overhead now that independence has been won, this shall be harder than it sounds. What shall become of the coalition is not sure, but we shall soon decide its fate once and for all..."

TKE_revival_of_the_kingdom:0 "Triumph of the House of Makoko"
TKE_revival_of_the_kingdom_desc:0 "The eternal squabbling of the republicans and socialists proved without a doubt that their ideologies and modern nonsense would lead to nothing more than chaos and confusion here in the Middle Congo. With these agitators and false prophets swept aside, the new Kingdom of Teke will rise to greatness, guided by the benevolent and wise Man Ounko Ngalifourou and her loyal supporters. There is much work to be done until the devastation wrought by the internal conflict and the wider collapse of the German colonial behemoth can be undone, but under the crown we are likely to succeed and thrive once more!"
TKE_deal_with_socialists_and_republicans:0 "Strike at Socialists and Republicans"
TKE_deal_with_socialists_and_republicans_desc:0 "The socialists of Mikalé and the republicans of PPC may have served a purpose in the war against the German colonials and the Portuguese lapdogs, but their constant blabbering about outlander ideologies and supposed promises of freedom, equality and stability are little more than lofty ideals at best and outright falsehoods and lies at worst, meant to deceive the traditional populace of the Teke territory. The Republicans would sell our traditions and customs away for profit and vainglorious prestige, while the socialists would make the Teke territory little more than a protectorate of the French, merely coated crimson. If our nation is to thrive and pursue true glory here in the heart of Africa, we cannot allow such serpents to make their nest among our people. Loyal men of the Man Ounko will go from village to village and get rid of these troublemakers by any means necessary until only those with love for the Kingdom in their hearts remain to serve. Only then may we know peace, unity and prosperity."
TKE_collaborate_with_colonial_officers:0 "Collaborate with Colonial Officers"
TKE_collaborate_with_colonial_officers_desc:0 "The French colonial administration existed in the lands of the Teke from the first treaty in 1880 to the end of the Weltkrieg, and elements of it persisted even throughout the German reorganization of these territories. While many French colonists left to Algiers to fight alongside the Petainist republicans and nationalists, for many the Moyen-Congo territories had become a home in themselves, and they formed a part of the German administration, some no doubt hoping that one day the French tricolour would once more fly over these lands. The Germans introduced a whole host of new laws and directives to their freshly acquired colony, but while there was a degree of colonist outflow, they relied extensively on existing French treaties and colonial outposts to rule these primitive lands. With the collapse of Mittelafrika, we now have both French and German colonists in our lands, confused and directionless. Most have of course once again left for greener pastures in the remaining pockets of German or French colonial order, but plenty have also stayed behind. We should offer these vagabonds jobs in the running of the new Teke Kingdom, to ensure as smooth a transition as possible."
TKE_teke_spiritualism:0 "Teke Spiritualist Revival"
TKE_teke_spiritualism_desc:0 "It is no secret that Queen Ngalifourou and her late husband and king Iloo I were big proponents for the Teke to get closer to the French, and in fact, it was Ngalifourou who signed the first treaty between French authorities and traditional African royal house, and while the situation between the French and Teke would vex and wane depending on who was ruling in Paris at the time, the relationship between the tribes of our territory and the colonialists remained rather good. However, one line that Ngalifourou was never ready to cross was the adoption of the Christian faith. Catholic missionaries and local colonial officials, and later German Protestant ones, all attempted to convert the tribes of our land to their Western faith, but thanks to the intervention of Man Ounko, this never came to pass. To this day, our faith is our own, and under the guidance of the Queen Mother, it shall remain so. Queen Ngalifourou maintains a highly important position in the faith as she embodies the spirit of Nkwe Mbali, associated with the crown. In addition to her role as the monarch of our nation, she receives pilgrims from all around our kingdom, standing as the greatest beacon of the old ways in our small state. With the Queen’s rule solidified, we will revive the spiritualist ways of the Teke Kingdom to the fullest extent, and attempt to sway as many converts to Christianity back to the light of old faith."
TKE_power_to_the_queen_mother:0 "All Power to the Queen Mother"
TKE_power_to_the_queen_mother_desc:0 "After the death of former king Makoko, or Iloo I, in 1892, Queen Mother Ngalifourou has continued to rule as the mother of all Tekes. While she has married other kings of the kingdom, belonging to the thirteen different vassals of the main kingdom itself, Ngalifourou holds supreme authority in matters of the state and spiritual realm. This stems from the local Teke tradition of vesting both kings and queens with equal amounts of power, and as Ngalifourou succeeded the latest king, her influence on the realm remains the strongest. This is partially also because of her strong control of the territory of Ngabé and the city of Mbé, the capital of the kingdom, though the queen’s excellent qualities as a sovereign have not been ignored by the populace of nation. With the opponents of the regime swept away, we must now set to work to ensure that the Man Ounko of the Teke has the main authority in these diverse territories of ours, and that all the kings of the Teke will fall in line with the new monarchist system."
TKE_return_to_french_authority:0 "Return to Foreign Authority?"
TKE_return_to_french_authority_desc:0 "Since the 1880s to the end of the Weltkrieg and the collapse of the French Republic, the Teke Kingdom had been a protectorate of the French. This agreement was brokered between Makoko Iloo I and the French officer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza. The kingdom became Moyen-Congo, nominally a territory of France but in reality, thirty French companies were sold much of the colony’s land. These companies would engage in large resource extraction projects in hopes of making the territory a veritable gold mine, but most soon found their coffers emptier than before with little to show for the lost investments. To the local Teke, these projects were costly as the tribesmen and -women were treated like slaves, but given the financial setbacks the French experienced, the territories of the Teke were more often than not left completely untouched by the white men. Despite the harsh treatment on behalf of the companies of France, Ngalifourou and her supporters hold a certain degree of hesitancy towards fully detaching from foreign rule. The new situation in the heart of Africa is violent and chaotic, and even if the French may have mistreated our people in the past, it is perhaps better to deal with the devil you know than the ones stalking the jungles of former Mittelafrika. However, the decision lies with Man Ounko as always, and her people look to the Queen for guidance."
TKE_woman_of_the_whites:0 "Ngalifourou, the Woman of the Whites"
TKE_woman_of_the_whites_desc:0 "Queen Mother Ngalifourou has earned many a moniker during her long reign, given by both her most ardent supporters to celebrate this venerable beacon of Teke might, and by her many bitter enemies in pointless attempts to sully said might. One that is shared by both however is the nickname ‘women of the whites’, given to Ngalifourou due to her prowess in dealing with the Europeans. Since Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza first visited these lands, Ngalifourou has remained the one constant in European-Teke relations, and our Man Ounko left such a lasting expression on de Brazza that the French officer even gifted a high-end sabre to the Queen. With the Queen leading with a strong hand, her expertise in dealing with the Europeans will surely help the Teke people reach their rightful place in the world."
TKE_a_modernized_tribal_monarchy:0 "Modernize our Tribal Monarchy"
TKE_a_modernized_tribal_monarchy_desc:0 "Modern world requires modern solutions, and this applies even to the Kingdom of Teke, as much as some traditionalists wish to resist the wheels of human progress. Man Ounko Ngalifourou has never been one to excessively push for change, and most of her supporters would be content with simply continuing the status quo that the heirs of Anziku have maintained since first emerging as a force in the region. Still, keeping our tribal monarchy as primitive as can be would only invite more Europeans, who would love to add Teke territories to their ever-hungry colonial machines. As such, educated men and experienced civil servants are what we need to modernize the administration of the kingdom to a sufficient degree, but those can only really be found within the ranks of the republicans. However, despite her distrust for the republicans and their socialist rivals, Ngalifourou sees some of them as the only possible way to bring some degree of modernity to the tribal monarchy, with the young Catholic priest Fulbert Youlou being her primary candidate to help shape the administration to keep up with the changing times."

Now, sovereign under the Queen Mother Ngalifourou, the Teke stand proud in the world, ready for all the challenges this new age will throw our way. The millenia old customs and traditions of the Teke honoured, our faith rekindled and our spear sharpened, the Teke Kingdom has proven itself a worthy successor state to the Ankizu and the legacy of the great king Makoko!"

Witnessing the brutality and exploitative means of the Europeans first hand as they ruthlessly tore through the African landscape in the ever-gnawing hunger for resources and expansion, Tchitchéllé swore that one day, these marvels of European engineering would be turned to benefit the people of Congo-Brazzaville instead. As one of his first campaign promises, Tchitchéllé has sworn to nationalize railway companies such as CFCO as well as others founded by the Teuton overlords, and put them to use enriching the people of the Middle Congo. The people and riches from the mines and farms of Moyen-Congo shall reach the sea on the smoke-spewing iron horses of the Europeans, but no longer will they line the pockets of fat cats in Algiers and Dar-es-Salaam but the native people of Teke territories."

These worker’s actions were harshly repressed by the local colonial government, but they earned Tchitchéllé quite a bit of popularity among the local workers and his paternalist unionism has become a veritable bastion of Congolais workers’ action. Unions have rallied under Tchitchéllé to bring about a just, modern and pro-labour republic of Middle Congo without the oversteps on the rights of other social classes that the syndicalists desire to achieve."

One such opportunity has arisen in the l’Union Démocratique pour la Défense des Intérêts Africains party, led by the young priest Fulbert Youlou. Youlou has his flaws, but he is nonetheless a moderate man with a great deal of political ambition and conviction, and he could prove to be an useful ally for PPC alongside the rest of his party.

Tchicaya used the l’Harmonie to coauthor petitions that saw the removal of corrupt officials, improving access to education, and funding local relief efforts. The apparatus that Tchicaya had built through l’Harmonie were vital during the creation of the PPC, who were able to quickly unite as the colonial order fell across Mittelafrika.

TKE_matsoua_victory_desc:0 "Weary of the fractious political scene he sees before him, the revolutionary messiah André Grenard Matswa has decided to take matters into his own hands for the good of his people and our fledgling nation. Instead of ceding power to the next generation, Matswa now steels himself with the backing of l’Amicale, making ready to lead his flock through these difficult times as the herald of Congolais independence, at least until he fully trusts his fellow countrymen to rule as peacefully, progressively, prosperously, and fairly as he does in his absence."
TKE_mobilize_mikale:0 "Mobilize the Mikalé"
TKE_mobilize_mikale_desc:0 "Mikalé, also called l’Amicale or simply Amicale in French, is the short form, Africanized name given to  André Matswa’s political association, the Société Amicale des Originaires de l'Afrique Equatoriale Française. Trade unionist, anti-colonial, progressive without losing sight of traditional culture, and mildly Pan-African, the Mikalé calls for the various newly-independent, decolonized African nations to come together as allies and compatriots, though likely not full countrymen, in order to resist imperialism and properly nationbuild peacefully while also seeking to build the Moyen Congo up into the beating heart of working class reform in Equatorial Africa. With Matswa squarely in charge, we shall be able to freely allocate resources to greatly expand his beloved Mikalé in order to reach a wider range of people across not only around the Congo Basin but all of post-colonial Africa, utilizing them as Matswa’s party apparatus and outreach group. However, we must be ready for the occasional naysayer that hurls claims that l’Amicale is made up merely of hypocrites, for despite being anti-imperialist, many of its members have close ties to various Communist and Syndicalist parties within the French Commune while actively implementing some of their foreign-borne ideas into the party doctrine, betraying their blatant sympathies with the Third Internationale, but perhaps aligning with Paris isn’t such a bad idea after all..."
TKE_kimbanguist_outreach:0 "A Convocation with the Ngunza"
TKE_kimbanguist_outreach_desc:0 "Across the Congo river lies Kinshasa, or Leopoldville to the vile colonials, and the wider Belgian Congo - the true dark heart of Africa and a nation not unlike ours. There, the Ngunza, or prophet, Simon Kimbangu preaches his own Afrocentric and puritanical offshoot of Baptist Christianity that proclaims that not only was Jesus a Black Man and the Congo is the remnant of Eden, but also that he himself is the living reincarnation of the Holy Spirit itself. Using this religion and his family who also hold similarly lofty positions on the faith as a vehicle for anti-colonial action and populist reform, the supposed Ngunza is not too dissimilar from our own messianic Matswa, though our own messiah does not lean into the idea nearly as much as the Kimbangus do. Regardless of the differences in minutiae between our groups, there is no denying that we share a similar cause and background, and as such, the Kimbanguists make natural allies. We shall reach out across the Congo river in a meeting of messiahs so that we may work with the Kimbanguists, welcoming them into l’Amicale so that together we can save this Eden we both call home."
TKE_spiritual_populism:0 "Messianic Populism Under Matswa"
TKE_spiritual_populism_desc:0 "With the masses only further popularizing his own ideology of Matswanism that uses his own quasi-religious aura and grassroots cult of personality as a vehicle to further leftist socio-economic reform and anti-colonialist pursuits, André Matswa is still hesitant to truly call himself any sort of messiah, instead simply seeing himself as the national father of a nation in need of a shepherd to usher it through the growing pains of newfound independence and mass social reform. However, that will not stop him, or more accurately the Mikalé, from entertaining the notion so long as the masses freely believe it themselves, and so long as the masses are willing to put up with Matswa’s continued tutelage over the national government even as local democratic and unionist governments and organizations continue to thrive and expand beneath him all across the country, giving a voice to all Congolais in Moyen Congo regardless of the background or circumstances of their birth even if their executive remains unchanged. An unwilling saviour thought of as a demigod by many of his people and by a national hero by most all, Matswa shall continue to utilize this ‘messianic populism’ to build up Brazzaville and beyond into a flourishing and egalitarian utopia at the heart of the once-dark continent."

Still somewhat of a foreign concept to much of the nation, Kikhounga-Ngot and his clique of Syndo-Matswanists will have to work tirelessly to bring syndicalism inspired by the messiah to Moyen Congo while also making it approachable and palatable to the working masses by utilizing the legacy of our own national father and populist prophet."

Extending a hand to all those in need like Matswa did to the downtrodden and forgotten of the old Equatorial Africa colony, we too shall extend a merciful hand to the meek. Only when those at the bottom of our society have been truly lifted up to an equal level as the rest of us can we all walk towards everlasting prosperity and equality together."

Through our support of local trade unions and with the help of the guiding hand of our communard allies back in Paris among the CGT, we shall work to synthesize a new syndicalist system uniquely form-fit to match the realities and challenges present here at the heart of Africa. Additionally taking ideas from other nascent syndicalist movements developing in far flung corners of Africa such as in the Belgian Congo, Nigeria and Kenya, South Africa, throughout the Sahara and along the Slave Coast, as well as across the Diaspora in places like Haiti, Cuba, and the Americas, we shall create an Afro-Syndicalist system that brings socio-economic prosperity and equality to our working class and peasantry while also keeping our local culture, customs, and traditions in tact."

We must petition Paris for aid as we seek to secure the revolution against any and all counter-revolutionary elements, foreign or domestic, and any other bad actors as we prepare to aid other postcolonial African nations in their own revolutionary struggles across the Diaspora. Though we do not wish to impose our ideology or systems on any others, we shall bring freedom to those fellow Africans that need it while giving them the tools of self-determination needed to build functional nation states, hopefully syndicalist or at least pro-union ones, of their own. From Brazzaville to Paris, from London to Pointe-Noire, all workers within our compact shall rejoice as we rise to stand shoulder to shoulder with the other greats of the Third Internationale, and may the rest of Africa and the Black Diaspora hopefully follow."

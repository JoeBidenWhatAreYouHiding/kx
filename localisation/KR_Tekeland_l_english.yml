### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_FULBERT_YOULOU_DESC:0 "Abbé Fulbert Youlou has risen to become the first President of an independent state in the lands of the former French Congo. Born in 1917 and training to become a priest from a young age, this devout Catholic has increasingly evolved both a love for free market capitalism, economic liberalism, and conservative nationalism, and over the course of his young political career, Youlou has espoused a deeply anti-socialist sentiment that has grown to deeply anger the far more Socialist-orientated Northern regions of the nation. Now, this holy-man turned national father serves as the bastion of anti-leftist thought in the Tekeland Clique, with his rule supported by a junior officers clique from the nation’s newly formed military, which has been created from the ashes of the former Franco-German colonial administration."

### Ideas ###

TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea:0 "Defense Against Portugal"
TKE_defense_against_portugal_idea_desc:0 "With German rule shattered in this region, the Portuguese have begun to eye our lands. We must bolster our defences against these colonials and their allies under the Manikongo while still keeping tabs on the bubbling French and German remnants within our own borders, lest our nation be re-colonized before we can even attempt self-rule."
TKE_power_struggle_idea:0 "Pressures of Factionalism"
TKE_power_struggle_idea_desc:0 "Within our infantile government, a great deal of political forces are at war with one another. From anti-democratic Socialists under Alphonse Massamba-Débat, Republican elements centered around Jacques Opangault and Fulbert Youlou, tribal Bateke monarchists rallied around Queen Ngalifourou, and various pro-colonial elements, both European and native, the stage has been set for great conflict or debate. This varied and dynamic political climate has cast a great shadow over our future, and now only time will tell who shall come out on top."
TKE_Queen_Ngalifarou_I_idea:0 "Ngalifarou I"
TKE_Queen_Ngalifarou_I_idea_desc:0 "Despite our republican form of government, which was declared shortly before our independence, our regime still shares power with the local Teke monarchy which served as an autonomous protectorate under Germany. Together with Queen Ngalifarou, Prime Minister Fulbert Youlou and his democratic regime hope to bring true parliamentarism to our new state. However, the Queen’s European contacts and nativist supporters may not be too keen on sharing power with a bunch of democrats, especially when the spectre of Socialism looms on the horizon."


monarchist.tt:0 "§gThis will strengthen the Monarchists within the Teke Clique§!"
republican.tt:0 "§CThis will strengthen the Republicans within the Teke Clique§!"
socialist.tt:0 "§RThis will strengthen the Socialists within the Teke Clique§!"

### Focuses ###

TKE_coalescing_our_coalition:0 "Coalescing our Coalition"
TKE_coalescing_our_coalition_desc:0 "If we are to truly secure our independence as the colonial construct once called Mittelafrika collapses around us, the various disparate political factions of the French Congo centered around Brazzaville must come together, if only temporarily, in order to create a united front dedicated to the anti-imperialist pursuit of a free Equatorial Africa. The head of this new coalition shall be the honorable statesman Fulbert Youlou, who has campaigned for autonomy or independence first under the French and later the Germans for years, and who also has the favor of the Makoko who still holds great sway over much of the population. Although he may be a bit of a dubious figure given his apparent lust for total control of the wider independence movement, this devout Christian conservative shall be the face of the Free Congo, at least for now, and this fragile coalition shall see us to freedom!"
TKE_meeting_the_makoko:0 "Meeting with the Makoko"
TKE_meeting_the_makoko_desc:0 "The Makoko is the given title to the monarch of the Teke Kingdom, also known as the Anziku Kingdom, the Tio Kingdom, or simply the Great Makoko, and although this once-great kingdom has been reduced to a rump state centered in Mbé near Brazzaville, it still holds great sway over the local political situation even as more modernizing elements wish to break free from their traditionalist influence. The current Makoko is Ngalifourou, queen of Tekeland, who is known as a devout spiritualist devoted to the traditional Teke folk faith and a conservative anti-colonial that has only begrudgingly worked with the imperialists since their arrival, instead favoring a free French Congo where she holds great sway over her own lands, and with Fulbert Youlou - leader of the coalition - being her preferred candidate to lead a wider national government. No matter our attitudes towards Her Highness, we must meet with her all the same."
TKE_courting_democratic_cliques:0 "Courting the Progressive Cliques"
TKE_courting_democratic_cliques_desc:0 "Outside the conservative bloc centered around Youlou and the Makoko, the local political scene is mostly Left-leaning, with both radical and democratic Leftist elements being active and prominent in Brazzaville and beyond. The largest and most moderate of these Leftist political associations is the Parti Progressiste Congolais, or PPC, divided into cliques headed by competing visionaries Pierre Goura, Robert Stéphane Tchitchelle, and party founder Gérald-Félix Tchicaya, and it is these figures that we must now court if our coalition is to be much of a big tent coalition at all. Let compromise and peaceful cooperation guide us, at least until independence is achieved."
TKE_amiable_amicale_alliance:0 "An Amiable Alliance with L'Amicale"
TKE_amiable_amicale_alliance_desc:0 "L'Amicale - short for the Société Amicale des Originaires de l'Afrique Equatoriale Française - is an anti-German, anti-imperialist, and openly Leftist political association with open ties to the Commune of France created by the labor organizer turned messianic independence activist André Grenard Matswa. Tied to the nascent trade union movement in Brazzaville, L'Amicale positions themselves as heralds of the Equatorial African revolution while using spiritualist populism, various Socialist rhetoric, and grassroots activism to spread their message throughout the downtrodden masses. Popular with urban workers and the poor, L'Amicale and the wider Matswanist movement are obvious allies, even if only temporarily, in our push for freedom."
TKE_linking_with_libreville:0 "Linking Up with Libreville"
TKE_linking_with_libreville_desc:0 "Just across our northeastern border lies Gabon, another recently independent nation set loose from the collapse of Mittelafrika. Currently under the command of our fellow francophile the conservative strongman Leon M’Ba, Gabon could be a strong ally in these trying times, for we both seek to weaken the Portuguese-backed Manikongo to the South and the German-backed Belgian Congo across the Congo River. Hopefully, those in Libreville feel the same way."
TKE_arms_from_old_masters:0 "Arms from our Old Masters"
TKE_arms_from_old_masters_desc:0 "Although the Kaiserreich has been our colonial overlord since the Great War, or at least was until Mittelafrika’s sudden collapse, it was the French that first colonized this land back in 1882, and it was these French that laid the cultural and political foundations that we build from today. Always holding links to the French, and even still largely speaking their language, for Germany never really caught on here in the decade and a half or so they controlled the colony, we shall instead reach out to our old colonial overlords, whether it be the governments in Algiers or Paris, as we seek arms and supplies to win this war for our independence."
TKE_rally_political_militias:0 "Rally Political Paramilitaries"
TKE_rally_political_militias_desc:0 "Colonialism breeds many things, primarily resentment and resistance from the local inhabitants if given enough time and grief. As such, the French Congo is rife with locally-organized political paramilitaries from across the spectrum all with different ideological systems in mind, but all holding one thing in common - the burning desire for a free nation to call our own. We shall tap into these zealous radicals and dedicated militants to form a loosely-organized and decentralized military vanguard of sorts - a politically-educated officer class with members from across the aisle all dedicated to anti-colonialism and the pursuit of our complete sovereignty, no matter the cost. These men shall help train our militias and our infantile armed forces alongside the few actual officers we have that served in the colonial corps."
TKE_settle_old_scores:0 "Settle our Score with the Manikongo"
TKE_settle_old_scores_desc:0 "The time has come to march against the treacherous Manikongo to the south! The historic rivals of the Anziku Kingdom, the once formidable Kongo has been reduced to a pathetic lapdog of the Portuguese far past their prime with deluded aspirations of uniting the Kongo river basin under his foreign-tainted rule. The Manikongo and his government shall fall, freeing the Bakongo people from the clutches of European imperialism and brainwashing at long last while securing our southern border and the lucrative Congo river basin and its ports for ourselves. To arms!"
TKE_victory_against_lapdogs:0 "Prevailing Against the Portuguese Pretender"
TKE_victory_against_lapdogs_desc:0 "We have finally been proven victorious over the foreign-backed government of the Manikongo, and with it, the Portuguese will have a say in Congolese affairs no longer. Now, we must work to consolidate our hold over the Congo River Basin and prepare our infantile government for the nation building challenges that are to come. Freedom has been achieved at long last, at least for now, but it shall be a long road to stability and prosperity, and the wolves are already circling both abroad and domestically. We must be prepared."
TKE_fate_of_coalition:0 "Fate of the Crumbling Coalition"
TKE_fate_of_coalition_desc:0 "In a move that was not unexpected but also certainly not helpful, the fragile coalition formed around Fulbert Youlou with support from Queen Ngalifourou has begun to crack and crumble seemingly beyond repair, threatening to fully collapse lest a political miracle can occur to pull the disparate factions of the French Congo’s diverse political movement together once more. However, with the threat of total annihilation and continued foreign oppression no longer directly looming overhead now that independence has been won, this shall be harder than it sounds. What shall become of the coalition is not sure, but we shall soon decide its fate once and for all..."

TKE_revival_of_the_kingdom:0 "Triumph of the House of Makoko"
TKE_revival_of_the_kingdom_desc:0 "taking advantage of the divisions among the republicans and socialists within the clique, queen Ngalifourou and her royalists have secured their control over the nation"
TKE_deal_with_socialists_and_republicans:0 "Strike at Socialists and Republicans"
TKE_deal_with_socialists_and_republicans_desc:0 "the dangerous radical socialists and republicans threatened to destroy our people over their constant bickering and dangerous ideas that would taint our traditional way of life. We will exploit their divisions and wipe out these parasites once and for all."
TKE_collaborate_with_colonial_officers:0 "Collaborate with Colonial Officers"
TKE_collaborate_with_colonial_officers_desc:0 "many of the former colonial administration have found themselves abandoned by their homeland as the colonial entity of mittleafrika collapsed into anarchy. We shall extend an olive branch to these wayward colonial officers by granting them a role in our administration"
TKE_teke_spiritualism:0 "Teke Spiritualist Revival"
TKE_teke_spiritualism_desc:0 "ngalifourou resisted attempts by both catholic and protestant missionaries to convert to christianity and opted to preserve the teke traditional religion. We shall promote and preserve our true ancestral faith. The queen is also a religious figure among the teke religion and people make pilgrimage to her throne"
TKE_power_to_the_queen_mother:0 "All Power to the Queen Mother"
TKE_power_to_the_queen_mother_desc:0 "the teke kingdom has placed equal importance to both the king and queen in decision making. Following the death of her first husband, ngalifourou had retained the powers of her late husband to lead the teke people for decades. The queen does not live with the king and she has no children. She also serves as a religious symbol and a powerful authority figure."
TKE_return_to_french_authority:0 "Return to Foreign Authority?"
TKE_return_to_french_authority_desc:0 "the teke kingdom was able to survive and enjoy a great deal of autonomy under the french and german administration, the teke protectorate was a state within mittelafrika. With our position secured shall we return to the protection of our old friends in algiers or remain cordial with our former allies?"
TKE_woman_of_the_whites:0 "Ngalifourou, the Woman of the Whites"
TKE_woman_of_the_whites_desc:0 "known by her supporters and mockingly by her detractors, ngalifourou has been referred to as the ‘woman of the whites’. Her shrewd negotiating skills had allowed the queen to retain the autonomy of her people."
TKE_a_modernized_tribal_monarchy:0 "Modernize our Tribal Monarchy"
TKE_a_modernized_tribal_monarchy_desc:0 "while our system of governance under the Nkwembali have proved effective for centuries, we find ourselves falling behind the times to address the issues of the modern age. We shall work to adapt our system to a new government while working with moderate democrats such as the queen mother’s preferred choice fulbert youlou"
TKE_anziku_renaissance:0 "Dawn of the Anziku Renaissance"
TKE_anziku_renaissance_desc:0 "the anziku are proud warriors who have waged war with the kongo kingdom for centuries.

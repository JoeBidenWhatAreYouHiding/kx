ZAM_entente_obligations_desc:0 "Now that Baring stands triumphant over Africa, he has redoubled his commitment to the Entente alliance, supplying the [ENT.GetAdjective] government with money, guns, and men. From Dakar to Dar-es-Salaam and Algiers to Lusaka, Africa stands ready to liberate Europe."

ZAM_Colonial_Nation:0 "Colonial Government"
ZAM_Colonial_Nation_desc:0 "Following the 1925 revolution we have reluctantly sided with our former enemy Mittelafrika and requested their protection. Even worse, Northern Rhodesia's sovereignty was violated by the Germans in order to "protect" it from Entente aggression in Africa against Mittelafrika. This has the immediate impact that Dar-es-salaam dictates our foreign policy for now."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_HUTTIG_DESC:0 "Hans Hüttig was never supposed to be in charge of Nordrhodesien, such a man should not be in such a place, but a man at the wrong place at the wrong time can make all the difference. Born in Dresden during the year of 1894 as the son of a carpenter turned photographic equipment salesman, Hüttig's life wasn't cut out for much, that all changed with the start of the Weltkrieg. After Hüttig had enlisted in the German Imperial Army, he saw particularly brutal fighting during the East African Campaign, which saw German victory against the British. For serving with valour and distinction in both East Africa and during the occupation of their new holdings holdings, Hüttig was assigned as the Military leader of Zambia in 1925 after the British Revolution and subsequent collapse of British control in the region. Since then Hüttig has ruled Nordrhodesien with an Iron Fist, but his attention has recently been drawn to not only his squabbling cabinet, but to South Rhodesia and Mittelafrika's own internal issues respectively. But for now, Hüttig remains on the Frontier of the Eagle, standing guard against the menace to the south."
POLITICS_JUNGER_DESC:0 "Ernst Jünger is a colorful figure, perhaps one of the most colorful in all of Afrika. Born in Heidelberg in South West Germany, Jünger was destined for an easier life than most as he was the son of a successful chemist and businessman. But always the rebellious type, Jünger sought adventure in the Wandervogel and later the French Foreign Legion, though he should have been tried for this illegal act, he escaped persecution due to his father's efforts. After the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, Jünger was sent firstly to the Western Front, but then later sent to German East Afrika as the conflict was expanding there. After serving in Afrika and being discharged from active service, Jünger first headed to Madagascar, but was disgusted with the Industrial filth bought upon by Reinhard Heydrich, so he opted to head for the frontier of the Eagle, Nordrhodesien. Jünger spent most of his first years in Nordrhodesien studying the local flora and fauna as well as trekking across it's vast mountains and valleys, as well as be an active writer since the war. Jünger had found peace in life and opted to spend his days on the frontier, but Hüttig's brutal rule ate at him. He had to do something about it, Baring's decadent ways weren't the answer either as they were both sides of the same coin, he had to do something but not only for himself but for the plight of the people under Hüttig's boot. After rising up the ranks and seizing power from Hüttig, Jünger became ruler of Nordrhodesien and now commands a vast and foreign territory, but the people have faith in him, but only time will tell if they keep their faith."
POLITICS_BARING_DESC:0 "As long as Evelyn Baring controls North Rhodesia, the sun hasn’t set on the British Empire. As long as he breathes, German Domination over Africa is anything but secure. After bouncing around various administrative jobs, Baring settled into a position in the German-Occupied former British Colony of North-Rhodesia. While he worked diligently under the Hüttig administration, Baring never shied away from voicing his disgust at how the Germans wrongfully invaded rightful British holdings, and horror at how his beloved British Empire had seemingly crumbled to dust before his very eyes. As Hüttig grew more and more oppressive, Baring began organizing British Remnants in attempt to drive the Hun from North Rhodesia, and turned to the South for assistance. However, Baring was met with silence from both South Rhodesia and South Africa, who deemed Baring’s cause as hopeless. Despite this, Baring seized control following Hüttig’s fall from grace with minimal support from the South. \n\n Now the undisputed leader of South Rhodesia, Baring has hoped to use this territory as a springboard not only to free the former British Colonies, but to drive the Hun from Africa forever; a task easier said than done. Baring’s pleas for assistance have mostly fallen on deaf ears, with most Anglos agreeing that the Reds are a bigger threat than the Germans. Even as his compatriots treat him as a madman, Baring sees that the Kaiser is just as big of a threat as the Syndicalists, and he won’t rest until the Union Jack flies proudly over both London, and Berlin. "

### Events ###
nrho.1.t:0 "The Collapse of Order"
nrho.1.d:0 "Our worst fears have been realized! The Kaiser’s grand project of Mittelafrika has utterly failed. The fires of rebellion and chaos swirl and spread across the Dark Continent. Afrika will soon see widespread war for the first time since the Weltkrieg as the drums of war can be heard from the Gold Coast to the Namib. However, we haven’t had to wait long for the chaos to reach our colony, as the natives of Nyasaland have rebelled against our rule! Our brave Schutztruppe march east to crush these damned savages for daring to shake off the rule of the Kaiser."
nrho.1.a:0 "Stay Calm!"

nrho.2.t:0 "Skirmishes on the Border"
nrho.2.d:0 "Damn them! The perfidious, backstabbing Anglos to the south have decided to launch a series of border skirmishes into our territory. As they attack, they probe our defences and survey our lands, gaining valuable intel to use against us for the inevitable war for the heart of the Dark Continent. For now, these attacks are manageable thanks to our brave Askari and Schutztruppe regiments, but if we are to survive this harsh environment, improvements on all accounts are going to be necessary. One miscalculation could cost us not only our future, but the future for all Germans across Mittelafrika."
nrho.2.a:0 "Oh Dear..."

nrho.3.t:0 "A Federal Council?"
nrho.3.d:0 "As governing this large and populous colony grows more and more with each rising crisis, Huttig has begun to muse on the idea of creating a Federal Council. In theory, this bureaucratic addition to the colonial government would alleviate much of the administrative strain off the Schutztruppe garrisons so they can more thoroughly focus on their military duties. Though it would largely be powerless compared to Huttig, it could still prove to be more trouble than it's worth, though it also would appease many of our more vocal critics. Ultimately, the choice lies with Huttig."
nrho.3.a:0 "Allowed."
nrho.3.b:0 "Denied."


nrho.4.t:0 "Ties with Local Unions?"
nrho.4.d:0 "Another growing hot topic of conversation in the halls of the colonial capital is the question on Zambian unions. Currently, unions are largely banned across the colony, and any class collaboration has been quickly crushed over fears of the festering influence of syndicalism. Regardless of these fears, allowing state-sanctioned unions to operate could satisfy our detractors, and through granting more autonomy to the locals, unions would alleviate much of the excess strain our Shcutztruppe garrisons have been under. As always, such an important decision lies squarely on Huttig's shoulders."
nrho.4.a:0 "Allowed."
nrho.4.b:0 "Denied."

nrho.5.t:0 "A New Administration?"
nrho.5.d:0 "Though sharply effective and brutally efficient, Hans Huttig’s lust for power and direct control over the colony of Nordrhodesian has also caused detrimental damage to our stability, threatening the Kaiser’s foothold in the region. His constant disregard for any notion of decentralization out of his grip has made many in the administration nervous, and some have begun to call for a change in leadership. The chief candidate for Huttig’s replacement is Ernst Jünger, another decorated veteran of the weltkrieg and burgeoning author and amateur entomologist. A man of varied tastes and a sharp, tactical mind, many feel Jünger is the ideal candidate to run the colony. Huttig will have to rely on support from the Kollaborative Regierung von Nordrhodesien to have any hope of maintaining control, but many see his days in charge as numbered."
nrho.5.a:0 "Bank on NKR Support for Huttig."
nrho.5.b:0 "Step Aside, allow Jünger to take Charge."

nrho.6.t:0 "Hüttig requests an Extension"
nrho.6.d:0 "News has reached Dar-Es-Salaam today from the desk of Hans Huttig and his administration in Nordrhodesien. Huttig has asked us to accept his request to remain as Hauptman of Nordrhodesien, extending his tour of duty despite the rumors circulating him and his heavy handed tactics used in ruling the colony. If ousted, Weltkrieg veteran Ernst Jünger would rule in his place and is expected to rule with a velvet glove rather than the iron fist of Huttig’s regime. Ultimately, the choice is up to the wise Staathalter of Mittelafrika to decide."
nrho.6.a:0 "Order him to step aside."
nrho.6.b:0 "Grant him the extension."

nrho.7.t:0 "Dar-Es-Salaam Denies Hüttig’s Request"
nrho.7.d:0 "Scheiße! It seems the fools in Dar-Es-Salaam have denied our simple request and called for Huttig’s immediate retirement as Hauptman of Nordrhodesien, less they face the full might of the Kaiser’s Afrikan holdings. This blow to his ego has crushed him, driving him to be less than reasonable to say the least. Frothing at the mouth in sheer anger, Huttig demands that a state of emergency be declared so he can gain emergency powers, but cooler heads may prevail if they could just manage to get him to relax. After hours of deliberation and argumentation between Huttig and his advisors, the lord of Nordrhodesien has decided to..."
nrho.7.a:0 "Declare a State of Emergency for the time being!"
nrho.7.b:0 "Follow their order."

nrho.8.t:0 "Arrest Warrant for Hüttig"
nrho.8.d:0 "Ignoring the will of the Staathalter, Huttig has declared the administration in Dar-Es-Salaam to be foolish and shortsighted. As he and his small force of loyal Schutztruppes and Askari ready themselves for the coming conflict, far more Germans and natives have begun to side with Jünger and his benefactors as they have issued a warrant for Huttig’s arrest. This shocking turn of events has brought about near certain doom for the current Hauptman. As this plot of betrayal thickens, the ever scheming Anglo has also started to scuttle from out under of their rocks as well. From the south of our colony, with funding and aide coming from South Rhodesia and South Africa, a man known as Evelyn Baring has been inflaming old rivalries and tensions, seeking to seize power in the coming storm with a momentous march on the capital of our colony and return Nordrhodesian to those pompous English dogs. Which group, Hun or Anglo, that will win the coming power struggle is unknown, but regardless of who comes out on top, blood will come to dye the Zambezi red."
nrho.8.a:0 "The Schutztruppe Removes Hüttig!"
nrho.8.b:0 "Baring's Men March on Lusaka!"

nrho.9.t:0 "Baring’s Men Invade"
nrho.9.d:0 "Following the issuing of Huttig’s arrest warrant and the brief calm of the coming storm, Baring and his Anglo allies have declared all out war on the German colonial administration in Nordrhodesien. Following perceived failure after failure, the British of the colony have had enough of the Hunnic boot. Riding into Lusaka, Baring and his forces hope to strike a quick and decisive blow to the German administration, forcing a swift and early retreat. To ensure his success, it has even been rumored he seeks to ask for South Africa’s assistance in the war. Regardless of rumor, the writing is on the wall, and unless Huttig and his few remaining loyal forces act quickly, Huttig’s tour of duty will be over for good."
nrho.9.a:0 "South Africa joins the Invasion!"
nrho.9.b:0 "Baring's Men March on Lusaka!"
nrho.9.c:0 "Huttig crushes the rebels!"

nrho.10.t:0 "Baring Secures Control"
nrho.10.d:0 "With nothing but the sweat on their brow and the lead in their rifles, the Anglo forces under Evelyn Baring have successfully taken control of Lukasa, and with it, control of all of Nordrhodesien. These lands return to British hands for the first time since the Weltkrieg, and under the guidance of the United Empire League, Baring will carve out another space for the Anglo man on the Dark Continent. Though surrounded by enemies on nearly all sides, the newly created North Rhodesia stands triumphant as another piece of the British Empire of old is restored. It seems the sun is beginning to rise on the fallen empire yet again."
nrho.10.a:0 "God Save the King!"

nrho.11.t:0 "Hüttig Secures Control"
nrho.11.d:0 "As explosions and gunshots pierced the night air of Lusaka, Hans Huttig and his small but fiercely loyal group of Schutztruppe stalked the streets and alleys of the city, searching for their prey. The recent upheaval of law and order in the colony has turned Lusaka and other cities into brutal warzones while a savage guerilla war has broken out on the jungles and wilds of Nordrhodesien. As Huttig and his men slink from city block to city block, they silently execute their treasonous foes while collecting information on their enemy’s whereabouts. Though the Anglo rebels and Jünger loyalists far outnumber his own men, Huttig’s force has had the upper hand in tactics and brutality. After countless long nights of sowing subterfuge and sabotage, Huttig’s group remains standing as the only effective and uncompromised fighting force in the colony. With their newly found strength and position of superiority, many Jünger loyalists have defected to Huttig’s camp, and with one final assault on the remaining Anglo regiments under Baring, Nordrhodesien shall firmly be under the control of Hauptman Hutting once more."
nrho.11.a:0 "Long Live the Hauptmann!"

nrho.12.t:0 "Dar-Es-Saalam Backs Down"
nrho.12.d:0 "With our recent slew of victories against the rebellious Jünger and Baring, Hans Huttig stands as Nordrhodesisen’s one and true leader. Though he greatly angered the head office back in Dar-Es-Salaam with his schemes and antics, even they can not deny his efficacy and brilliance in outmaneuvering the myriad of foes that sought to topple his regime. The colonial administration of Mittelafrika has no choice now but to support Huttig, even if it is through lying eyes and fake smiles, for Hauptman Huttig has proven himself as the one man capable of taming the Nordrhodesien wilds. Hans Huttig’s tour of duty continues, and only time will tell what this will mean for Afrika as a whole."
nrho.12.a:0 "Fantastic!"

nrho.14.t:0 "Jünger Takes Charge"
nrho.14.d:0 "Ernst Jünger, famous veteran of the weltkrieg and once right-hand man to Huttig, now stands atop the pile of slain foes and broken promises created by his predecessor. After weeks of fighting Baring’s Anglo riflemen, rebellious Askari, and even Huttig’s own loyal cadre, Jünger has emerged victorious! Now comes the monumental task of repairing the broken colony and righting the wrongs of the previous administration. Jünger has even paid lip service to the idea of real democracy, but whether he is a man of his word remains to be seen. Regardless of his plans and ambitions, Jünger alone shall choose our new headining, and under his steely watch, Nordrhodesien marches towards the future."
nrho.14.a:0 "Long Live the Hauptmann!"

nrho.15.t:0 "Promises of Democracy?"
nrho.15.d:0 "With the initial rebuilding procedures underway and the colony slowly healing, the time has come for Ernst Jünger to finally decide how Nordrhodesien should move forward. During his run against Huttig and the subsequent conflict, Jünger has become a mouthpiece for the more liberally minded and pragmatic officials in our government, and their biggest desire is the creation of a true Nordrhodesien democratic system. Though Jünger himself has paid lip-service to the idea, even going so far to promise many groups of democracy’s eventual arrival, the decision now must finally be made. Democracy could allow subversive elements into the administration, such as the perfidious Anglos, but could also provide much needed stability and public support to the German regime. Ultimately, it is up to Jünger to decide. Should he be a man of his word, or is this backwards colony not yet ready for the light and privilege of democracy?"
nrho.15.a:0 "Not Yet"
nrho.15.b:0 "I am a man of my word!"

nrho.16.t:0 "The First Elections"
nrho.16.d:0 "Ernst Jünger has done it! With the creation of one of the first true democracies on the Afrika continent, Jünger has fulfilled a dream many in the colony never thought possible. With the first elections now fast approaching, two main parties have shown to be popular enough to hold any chance of winning. Jünger’s own party stands tall with large amounts of backing from Dar-Es-Salaam and the established Germans in the colony, but the Anglo-aligned Dominion Party has also seen an explosion in popular support. This first race will be a close one, and will determine the soul of the colony going forward. Should Nordrhodesien remain in the clutches of the Hun and Kaiser, or is it finally time for the Anglo to restore these old lands to their former glory during the reign of the British Empire? Only the people and their votes can decide now."
nrho.16.a:0 "Jünger wins a smashing victory!"
nrho.16.b:0 "The Dominion Party Wins!"

nrho.17.t:0 "The Call of the Empire"
nrho.17.d.nigeria:0 "A secret telegram has made its way to our office today from the former colony of Nordrhodesien. Since Evelyn Baring’s recent successful revolt against the mad tyrant Huttig, the roar of the Anglo lion can be heard in Lusaka once more in the south as North Rhodesia was reformed to its former majesty. Baring has inquired us about the possibility of armed revolt against all of Mittelafrika, seeing as their previous endeavor was so successful. Though the war would be brutal and hardfought, and victory would be no guarantee, the allure  of recreating the old imperial glories of the home country is almost too enticing to pass up. What shall be our reply?"
nrho.17.d.kenya:0 "An interesting proposal has landed on the desk of our office today from Evelyn Baring of the newly reestablished North Rhodesian colony. Baring’s recent victory against the Hun in overthrowing Huttig’s barbaric regime has emboldened him, and now he seeks to incite rebellion against the monstrosity that is Mittelafrika as a whole. To take on the might of the Kaisereich and its allies alone seems foolish, but if we strike together, as one large pride, we true lions of the Dark Continent will roar victoriously once more. How shall we respond?"
nrho.17.d.westafrika:0 "Before Evelyn Baring launched his war against the Germans in Africa, he desperately sought to bring us over to his side and gain co-operation, citing our shared obligations to the Crown and our duty to preserve and extend British rule in Africa.\nAt the time, we ignored these pleas for support, seeing Baring as a madman and his planned war as doomed. Now, however, his Rhodesian forces have pushed deep into Mittelafrika, defeating the German troops in several key battles and throwing the German administration into a panic as British forces reclaim former colonies.\nAs such, many of the more committed royalists and colonialists in the administration now want us to declare our support for Baring, launching our own offensive against the Germans to secure rightful British holdings, and affirming our loyalty to the Entente alliance and legitimate British government."
nrho.17.a:0 "The Time is Now, God Save the King!"
nrho.17.b:0 "They are on their own..."

nrho.18.t:0 "Huttig’s Safari"
nrho.18.d:0 "The warm sun beat down on Hans Huttig as he slowly and methodically made his trek up the coast of Zambezi. Armed with his trusty mauser, he stalked his prey as the towering Victoria Falls shimmered up ahead. As some the largest waterfalls in the world thundered in the distance, Huttig’s sound as well masked; perfect for his current activity. Hunting the great beasts of this continent made his time all the more enjoyable, as Huttig enjoyed nearly nothing as much as the thrill of the safari. He had been tracking the lone lion for days, and was fast approaching his chosen quarry, far ahead of the rest of his hunting party. As he finally approached the beast, he could feast his eyes upon its majesty. A hulking mass of writhing sinew and claws with a long and wild mane as black and mysterious as the Dark Continent itself. Its massive fangs were currently digging into a fresh kill, a local puku antelope, as Huttig slowly circled the beast from a few dozen meters away, looking for an ideal perch to take the shot. As he leveled his rifle upon a flat rock, taking aim at the beast, a twig broke under his foot, alerting the creature to his presence. In a flash, the lion lunged for Huttig who was just a short distance away. As his quarry leapt into the air for the death pounce, Huttig fired his mauser. Landing an eagle-eyed shot on the airborne feline’s chest, the round pierced the beating heart of this jungle king moments before Huttig’s face was introduced to the dagger-like fangs of an apex predator. Once again, Huttig’s shot landed true, and he began to call out to the rest of the hunting party that had finally caught up with him. Ordering two servants to begin carving the beast for pelt and trophy, Huttig walked to the nearest cliff on the edge of this clearing. He stared up at Victoria Falls in the distance, seemingly lost in its awe-inspiring beauty, internally thanking whoever has allowed him to rule over such a land."
nrho.18.a:0 "I am the one, true King of the Jungle."

nrho.19.t:0 "Growing pains"
nrho.19.d:0 "The dreams of a united Rhodesia have been fully realized, with the north and south coming together to form one indivisible union. Despite the frilly pomp and drivel the capital feeds the people of Rhodesia, no amount of lying or propaganda can change the reality. The reality is that, since the unification, our new state has been plagued by inefficiency, instability, and sheer incompetence. Though no one expected the merging of two distinct administrations to be easy, no one could have guessed it would have gone awry to such a degree. Regionalist identities have taken hold to the point that northerners and southerners argue or brawl openly in the streets, while behind closed doors, separatist groups already meet to discuss a dissolution of the union. On top of the angry Rhodesians, we must also deal with the natives of Nyasaland and Malawi, as they've been none too happy to be forced into this union either. We can not let this stand! We must sort out our myriad of issues at once, and purge the chaff and dead weight from our administration like a butcher trims the fat off a fine roast. Rhodesia must stand united, as the future of the Dark Continent grows more uncertain by the day."
nrho.19.a:0 "Rhodesia, one and indivisible?"

nrho.20.t:0 "A Man with many disciplines"
nrho.20.d:0 "Ernst Jünger is one of the more interesting men in the great patchwork of the Mittelafrikan megacolony. A brave veteran of the Weltkrieg and avid lover of nature throughout his life, it is no wonder how he came to reside in the colony of Nordrhodesien. In his youth, he participated with the myriad of Wandervogel groups in the Kaiserreich, trekking through the wilds and garnering an unwavering appreciation for life and the great outdoors. Joining up with the French Foreign legion for a time, an illegal and treasonous act in the eyes of the Kaiserreich, Jünger travelled to the French colonies in Africa where he fell in love with the Dark Continent. With the final guns of the Weltkrieg drawing silent, he had become a highly decorated soldier, using what he learned in the war to write his magnum-opus “Storm of Steel,” a memoir piece on the horrors and glories of the trenches he witnessed on the Western Front. Moving to the colonies post-war as a hero and a scholar, he integrated himself well into the Afrikan regime. On arrival, he took an interest to colonial politics where his national-conservative views would be appreciated by the German administration, while also finding time to delve into his love for writing and naturalistic pursuits. Studying marine biology, conservation, zoology, entomology, botany, and philosophy, just to name a few pursuits, Jünger prided himself on a sharp and tactful mind. Now, the old intellectually-gifted veteran has risen to the top of the hierarchy in Nordrhodesisen, finding himself to be the successor to Hans Huttig’s tyrannical regime. Under his calm and measured guidance, Nordrhodesia shall weather any coming storm. "
nrho.20.a:0 "A true Renaissance man of the Afrikan continent."

nrho.21.t:0 "No shortage of interruptions"
nrho.21.d:0 "Ernst Jünger sat arched over the desk in his study, peering through a microscope at some specimen or another when two Schutztruppen aides burst through the door. The young duo began to yammer on incessantly about recent budgetary issues and administrative jargon that the grizzled Hauptmann had no care to listen to. “Yes yes, very good,” he growled to the attendants, waving his hand in the air to motion them out the door without taking his eye from the eyepiece of his microscope. “Thank you for bringing this to my attention, but do not bother me with this nonsense again, ” Jünger flatly said as the two soldiers turned to walk out of the dark room. With these distractions now leaving him, he could get back to his work. Peering at the insect that lay pinned to a dish, the meticulous man dived back into his study, taking notes and sketches of the peculiar little bug he preserved from his latest trek into the jungles that hug the Zambezi. As he drowned out the world around him, Jünger was at peace once more as he set the little beetle aside to be preserved, and pulled another specimen out from his traveling case to repeat his process over again. Hopefully he would not have any more intrusions, he thought to himself, as his mind drifted back into his naturalistic study."
nrho.21.a:0 "Every man needs a hobby, or three."

nrho.22.t:0 "Baring’s Raid on the Natives"
nrho.22.d:0 "Evelyn Baring loaded another round into his antique Martini-Henry Mk IV, snapping the breech closed as he readied his aim against a fleeing native rebel. With a thunderous crack, the old rifle hurled another massive round, striking the native “officer” just below the left shoulder. As he slowly walked up to the rebel, who now lay on the ground clutching his new wound in agony, Baring took a long pull from his cigar, exhaling the thick smoke into the hot, arid air of the Nyasaland. The natives of this region have proven to be a particularly annoying thorn in the side of Baring’s new administration, and so he and a small “hunting party” had been on the trail for days, finding and exterminating every last separatist and rabble rouser he could aim his rifle at. Now standing over the native man, Baring looked straight into his fear-filled eyes, pulling out his Webley revolver and aiming it squarely at the forehead of this failed revolutionary. With a movement of his finger and another thunderous crack, the deed was done. “One less problem to deal with” Baring thought to himself, as he loaded another shell into his rifle, took a drag from his cigar, and continued down the trail with the rest of his comrades, seeking to annihilate every last traitorous dog he could lay his sights upon. His colony would be civilized, and he would bring order to these wild lands, no matter the cost."
nrho.22.a:0 "These savages will feel the burning light of civilization, or the searing heat of lead."

nrho.23.t:0 "Huttig takes a stroll"
nrho.23.d:0 "Hans Huttig walked the perimeter of the camp, rattling his imperial sabre against the three meter tall barbed wire fence. He was making his way through his bi-monthly tour of the myriad work camps that dotted Nordrhodesien, and was currently inspecting one of the more profitable camps in Malawi. As he strolled around the edges of the fence, continuing his haunting rattling, he quietly observed the native workers slave away at their various mundane tasks. Dozens of men were in the mud-filled central yard, breaking rocks or chopping wood or doddering on with some other laborious activity. Suddenly, Hutting stopped dead in his tracks and narrowed his eyes upon one of the workers. The struggling prisoner was an elderly yet noble looking man, possibly holding respect among his people before his internment in the camp. He struggled to heft the wheelbarrow he was attempting to push through the muck, and collapsed in exhaustion before Huttig’s eyes as other workers rushed to the elder’s aide. Upon seeing this display, Hutting quietly pulled out a small black book from one of his uniform’s pockets and quickly wrote down the number that was branded on the failing labourer’s back. Within the book were hundreds of listed numbers, with all but a few of the more recent entries crossed out in red ink. As he jotted down the man’s serial number, a wry smile flashed across Huttig’s face while many of the workers stared back at him. Once finished, Huttug stowed his book and began his stroll once again, redrawing his sabre to continue dragging it along the fence; its incessant noise ringing loudly in the still air. Huttig would have peak efficiency in his camps; there was no alternative."
nrho.23.a:0 "Work brings civilization."

nrho.24.t:0 "Baring’s Obsession"
nrho.24.d:0 "Evelyn Baring slammed his desk in anger as he finished reading the latest telegram delivered to his office. The message contained another refusal from the Anglo-dominated colonies of Mittelafrika, denying Baring’s call for war. The young governor-general of North Rhodesia dreamt of a return of the glorious British Empire of old and hoped it would be himself and his United Empire League to be the ones to lead the reclamation. However, his “friends” did not see it that way. The various Anglo administrations and groups dotted across this expansive continent, like in Kenya, Nigeria or South Africa, felt that a direct, all-out war against the Hun would be suicidal, and rightfully so. The Kaiser’s grip on the Dark Continent was strong, and to dislodge the Germanic taint would require a miracle, or a complete collapse in the German system. Still Baring persisted, sending letter after letter and constant telegrams to these potential brothers-in-arms, imploring them to take up arms against the Kaiser’s forces. Though he will not stop until they accept, Baring might have to wait for a more opportune time for his potential allies to agree to his crusade."

nrho.28.d:0 "The horrendous and blood-soaked campaign across the dark continent which claimed the lives of thousands, white and black, English and German, is over. Evelyn Baring's Entente-aligned royalist forces now stand victorious over Africa, and the brief but miserable period of Hunnic tyranny over this continent has drawn to a close.\nHaving consulted with the British government in [ENT.Capital.GetName], Baring has now announced that all of the conquered and liberated African lands will be amalgamated into a unified Crown Colony of Africa, under the responsible and benevolent administration of the British Crown. Shortly after this announcement, [ENT.GetLeader] confirmed Baring as the first African Governor-General, an announcement met with parades throughout English communities in Africa."

nrho.29.d:0 "The war aganst the North-Rhodesian royalists has been the longest and bloodiest one in German colonial history, costing thousands of lives, English and German, white and black. Now, however, the hell is finally over.\nWith the fall of Lusaka and Baring's other strongholds, we have at last pacified Nordrhodesien, with harsh reprisals against the English population reported in some areas and German colonial rule over the territory formalised.\nThe news has been greeted with much celebration in Dar-es-Salaam, and also Berlin, as we have clearly proven to the world the enduring strength of German colonialism, and our capacity to defend our rightful territories against irredentist invaders."
nrho.29.a:0 "German rule is here to stay!"

nrho.30.t:0 "The Dakar Conference"
nrho.30.d:0 "Now that the Entente stands triumphant over Africa, we can look to restoring the borders that the continent had had before the German filth usurped our possessions. While this does mean that British administration will be rebuilt in former British colonies and newly-annexed German territories, it also necessitates returning to our allies land that they lost in the aftermath of the Great War.\nThus, Baring has invited delegates from the Entente to a new Conference in Dakar, Senegal, where we shalll set about a new carve-up of Africa. In practice, this will likely mean repaying National French support and loyalty to the Entente through the return of former French lands, including Cameroon and the Ivory Coast."

nrho.31.d:0 "Now that the Entente forces under Evelyn Baring stand triumphant over Africa, Baring has resolved to restore the borders that the continent had had before the German filth usurped our possessions. As such, the ambitious young leader has called together a conference in Dakar, where Entente representatives will carve out new borders for the continent.\nIn practice, this means that we will be able to pull our weight in order to gain the full return of French colonies siezed by Germany after the Weltkrieg, such as Cameroon and the Ivory Coast, which we can re-integrate into our Empire."

nrho.32.a:0 "Good doing business with them."

nrho.33.t:0 "African Aid"
nrho.33.d:0 "With Evelyn Baring having restored British rule in Africa under his Crown Colony, the ambitious young administrator has wasted little time in making a full commtiment to the Entente, stating that his foremost duty is to get Africa into such a state that it can make a substantial contribution to the liberation of Great Britain.\nAs such, the first shipment of aid from Africa arrived at our shores today, with money, arms, and men recruited from English settlements all put towards our noble cause."

No British monarch has set foot on the continent since before the Great War, and thus his visit today is a stark reminder of how far the Entente powers have come in Africa.\n[ENT.GetLeader] was greeted personally by Governor-General Baring, and the two men, alongside many friends, diplomats, and hangers-on, will travel the continent over the coming weeks, absorbing all the life and passion of Africa's natural beauty, and its many game reserves and Safaris."
nrho.34.a:0 "We welcome His Majesty."

nrho.35.t:0 "The Fate of German Collaborators"
nrho.35.d:0 "With Baring's government having resolved to deport German nationals en masse, we must also consider the fate of Englishmen whose relationship with Germany during the occupation of our colonies was rather too cordial.\nMany civil servants and officers, whether for their own ends or out of a desire for peace, were glad to co-operate with the German authorities, even if it was to the detriment of their countrymen and national cause. Now that these men are in our hands, we must decide on our policy towards them."
nrho.35.a:0 "Let them off, we need their talents."
nrho.35.b:0 "We have no need of these traitors."

nrho.36.t:0 "The African Westminster System"
nrho.36.d:0 "As we further secure our rule over Africa, the Crown Colony will require a more coherent legal and political apparatus. With this in mind, Evelyn Baring today announced the institution of a Westminster System, an elected parliament with legal authority, in Africa.\nAs in Great Britain, elections will be held every five years by default, but can be called early if a sitting Prime Minister so desires. Only white Englsih citizens may vote, however, and as the representative of the British Crown, the Governor-General, namely Baring himself, will retain executive power."
nrho.36.a:0 "I love democracy."

nrho.37.t:0 "Native Protests"
nrho.37.d:0 "Our abolition of native titles across the continent has hardly gone down well among the natives, with thousands now protesting across the Colony to demand the restoration of Protectorate systems, formal titles, and local autonomy.\nIn normal times, Baring would not hesitate to have such seiditious affairs crushed as rapidly as possible, but given the volatility of the situation and extent of popular anger, there are many within the government who urge restraint."
nrho.37.a:0 "They'll wear themselves out given time."
nrho.37.b:0 "Take no chances with these rebels."

nrho.38.t:0 "Incentivising Settlement"
nrho.38.d:0 "With Baring having committed to make Africa a prize destination for British officers and administrators, whose talents we sorely need, he will have to find a means of making our still recently-conquered and unstable territories appeal to British exiles.\nOne proposal for how to do this is that we offer free plots of land to any British citizen willing to settle, removing natives from this land if needs be. On the other hand, some believe that a simpler offer of high pay would be more attractive. Meanwhile, there are those who argue that the best way to attract settlers is to promise to turn a blind eye to corruption and misdeeds, so long as our own government is not threatened."
nrho.38.a:0 "Give every settler free land."
nrho.38.b:0 "High pay will pull them in."
nrho.38.c:0 "Treat corruption more leniently."

nrho.39.t:0 "Baring's Speech"
nrho.39.d:0 "With Africa finally pacified, and British rule all but unchallenged, Evelyn Baring today adressed a large crowd of settlers, who had gathered in Lusaka to hear the hero of the African Reconquest. Baring congratulated them on their unfailing commitment to the British nation anf its civilising mission in Africa, and promised that as long as he was at the helm of the continent he would never fail their interests.\nHowever, the Governor-General went on to call his audience's attention to matters in Europe, particularly the Mother-Country, Great Britain. Reminding the crowd of the Red tyranny to which millions of good Englishmen - including many of their relatives - are subjected to daily, Baring declared that the Crown Colony's mission is not yet over, and that he will not rest until the Union Jack flies proudly once more over London."
nrho.39.a:0 "Hurrah!"

nrho.40.t:0 "Nordrhodesien Defeated"
nrho.40.d:0 "Our gamble in rising up after the Mittelafrikan collapse has triumphantly paid off, and the German tyrants in Lusaka have been routed.

ZAM_bolster_british_control_desc:0 "While the UEL may be in power, the British hold over the region is far from concrete, and the threat of the British being expelled from these lands once more is present. We must bolster British Authority to a point where revolution is impossible. "

ZAM_legitimate_afrikan_borders_desc:0 "Over the second half of the 19th Century, European powers were able to peacefully divide Africa, sharing its wealth and resources between them for mutual benefit. However, following the Great War, the Hun shattered this benign arrangement in an effort to take the whole continent for themselves. Now that their tyranny is no more, we can co-operate with our allies to restore this continent's rightful borders."
ZAM_expel_german_settlers:0 "Expel German Settlers"
ZAM_expel_german_settlers_desc:0 "Since the Reich siezed much of Africa in the 1920s, the continent has been flooded with German settlers. As long as they exist within our borders and our colonies, our own settlers will be harder-pressed for space and resources, and our rule will be undermined by the presence of many who are loyal to an enemy power. As such, Baring has resolved to deport these settlers back to Germany."

ZAM_topple_native_leaders_desc:0 "Before the Great War, British administrators had counted on the loyalty of native monarchs, who were generally allowed to stay on their thrones so long as they accepted British rule. However, the German usurpation of the continent proved their true opportunism, with the same leaders who once swore allegiance to the Crown turning to Berlin instead. Now, however, we will put these traitors in their place, formally abolishing the system of protectorates and dethroning native leaders across Africa."

ZAM_the_best_ye_breed:0 "The Best Ye Breed"
ZAM_the_best_ye_breed_desc:0 "Before the Revolution and disintegration of the Empire, colonial service was an immensely desirable job for many a young Englishman, with his nation's prowess allowing him to travel the world as a soldier or administrator, or even to permanently settle in the colonies. With our grip over Africa secured, we should restore this prestige, and appeal to British exiles to settle the continent and put their skills at our disposal."
ZAM_royal_tours:0 "Royal Tours"
ZAM_royal_tours_desc:0 "In order to further entrench the prestige and legitimacy of our administration, and curry favour among the British Exiles, we should invite British Royals and aristocrats to tour Africa, giving them the chance to enjoy Africa's game reserves and beautiful landscapes for the first time since before the Great War. This experience will doubtless leave them with a favourable impression of our administration, and of Baring's leadership."
ZAM_punitive_communal_labour:0 "Punitive Communal Labour"
ZAM_punitive_communal_labour_desc:0 "It is time for those natives mad enough to stand in the way of our benevolent rule a valauble lesson. Presently, there is little organised policing of remote villages, and with no incentive otherwise these can thus become hotbeds of resistance. As such, the only rational solution is collective solution, with a whole village put to work in service of the Crown should it harbour terrorists."
ZAM_our_place_in_the_liberation:0 "Africa's Place in the Liberation"
ZAM_our_place_in_the_liberation_desc:0 "Baring has triumphed in his mission to pacify Africa and restore the noble rule of the British Crown, and now it is time to look further afield. Our brothers and sisters in Great Britain itself continue to suffer under the tyranny of socialism, and it is the mission of the Entente to liberate them as soon as is possible. As such, Baring has authorised greater recruitment efforts across the continent, particularly targeted at English settlers, to ensure that Africa answers the call of the British Liberation."

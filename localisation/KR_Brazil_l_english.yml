### Leaders ###
POLITICS_OTAVIO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "Otavio made his politcal debut in 1908 at the contentious politics of the state of Bahia, and his rapid rise in notoriety gave him fame, and some exiles from the state as well. Said notoriety was enough for him to later become a State Representative in 1912. His staunch positions in favour of the late Washington Luis and João Pessoa during the times of civil war helped to raise his profile to greater heights, and he was elected president of the State of Bahia in the elections organized there in 1928. Later, as consensus bid for the Brazilian Republican Party, his name was put forward for the position of President of the Republic, and was endorsed by then President João Pessoa. His presidency was very much a return to normalcy at first, but the rise of radical movements especially in the cities, and public order in general, is a rising concern. However, the good pace of economic and political recovery has ensured his popularity remains high, and it is possible that some of this popularity is why João Mangabeira, his brother, became a household name more left wing circles."
POLITICS_GUSTAVO_DODT_DESC:0 "Hailing from the Northeastern state of Ceará, Gustavo Dodt Barroso is one of the nation's most influential intellectuals and the leader of the Brazilian Integralist Action. While he's an accomplished author since age 23, his entry in the political arens came after watching a passionate speech about the values of Integralism by important figure, Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, in 1928. Ever since he has dedicated himself to helping push the movement's agenda, writing several well selling books on the subject, but also his own anti-semitic views, especially in the first translated copy of the Protocols of the Heirs of Zion in Brazilian Portuguese, and also dedicates himself to poetry and studies of Brazilian folklore, which garnered him a seat at the Brazilian Academy of Letters. His profound nationalism and hatred of perceived foreign meddling made him gain especial disdain and hatred for Syndicalists in Brazil, whom he claims are French spies sent to establish a puppet republic."
POLITICS_GETULIO_VARGAS_BRA_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the border state of Rio Grande do Sul, Getúlio Vargas always had a knack for politics. Since his earliest forays into state politics, he always was a skilled navigator and, according to some, a shrewd manipulator. While he only entered politics in 1913, by the time of the Revolution of 27 he was already State President of his home province, and his diplomatic skill managed to both prevent intervention from foreigners and to ensure that Rio Grande do Sul sided against the Federal forces. After the war, Vargas became Vice President under João Pessoa, and became far more well known nation wide, taking time to appear in radio and other public addresses as a man 'looking out for the little guy' while he could do so. Since Otávio Mangabeira took office, he spent four years articulating an energetic presidential campaign. Always professing non extreme, but powerful views on the future of Brazil, Vargas believes that the only way the nation can truly enter the modern era is through and extensive campaign of industralisation, modernisation and rearmament, a process that he believes no person or law has any right to impede, for his intention is to always act with Brazil's best intentions first and foremost."
POLITICS_EURICO_DUTRA_BRA_DESC:0 "A Matogrossense general with the highest condecorations, Eurico Gaspar Dutra started his military career very early, and went to officer's academies at Rio Pardo, Rio de Janeiro, where he partook in the Vaccine Revolt and was later pardoned, and at Porto Alegre. Respected for his efforts during the Civil War and beyond, the officer has enough gravitas to pull together a haphardly government, which is more or less a dictatorship all but in name, to keep order in this time of extreme crisis. He has a very public disdain of Syndicalism and all forms and socialist and has personally overseen the crushing of several revolts of this nature over the past decade."
POLITICS_JULIO_PRESTES_DESC:0 "A representative of a powerful family in São Paulo, Julio Prestes debuted in the political arena in 1909 as a state representative in the parliament of São Paulo. He quickly distinguished himself, and even led troops into battle against mutinous military men twice before becoming a federal representative, where his liberal character gave him admiration from many. A friend and supporter of Washington Luís, Prestes was devasted by his sudden assassination and rallied behind the cause during the coming crisis and conflict, but was glad that it ended as quickly as it did. He gained renewed political vigour afterwards, and claims to be trying his best to uphold the legacy of his friend Washington. Following the defeat of Bahia's liberals in the previous elections, Julio found himself as an almost unanimous choice for candiate of the Liberal Party, and his victory again renewed his vigour to uphold the liberal and positvist principles he defended throughout his life."
POLITICS_EDGARD_LEUENROTH_DESC:0 "Born in the city of Mogi Mirim in 1881, Edgard Frederico Leuenroth is one Brazil's foremost anarcho-syndicalists, with a very extensive history in the labour movement. Having moved to the great city of São Paulo at the yung age of five, Edgard abandoned his studies and began working at age 10; his education was completely self taught years afterwards. Having managed to get positions in many newspapers in the city, by the turn of the century he found himself attracted to socialism, and quickly began working for leftist publications instead. His work was very aggressive against both government and faith, and he was arrested multiple times during the early 20th century. The success of the Revolution in France filled him and his colleagues with hope, and he alongside them spearheaded the general strikes at the end of the century's second decade, even if he was not involved in the infamous armed uprisings against the national government.. This made him both very well known amongst the left, and a hated figure amongst right wingers, with his newspaper's headquarters openly attacked in the early 1920’s twice. While he, as with many left activists, saw the events of 1927 with hope, soon they realized that the new status quo gained little tangible for the workers, and agitation started yet again. Having most recently taken part in the protests following Black Monday, Edgard has never given up on his dream of a more equal and fair Brazil, and his notoriety makes his rise to the position of chairman very unsurprising. However, the birthing pains of this new, socialist Brazil are just beginning, and the man has a long and laborious task ahead of him."
POLITICS_ABILIO_NEQUETE_DESC:0 "An orthodox christian hailing from Lebanon, Abilio de Nequete is actually not his birth name, that being Abdo Nakt. He came to Brazil looking for his father, who had emigrated years earlier than him, in 1903, and reunited with him shortly thereafter. However, soon their political differences put a wedge on their relationships, and later on Abilio converted to Spiritism and joined union circles. Inspired by the revolutions in Europe, he joined the anarchist International Workers Union, but their militant atheism caused him and some other men to split off and form the Maximalist Union, a party that opposed their ideas in more matters than just religion. The Maximalist movement grew and garned much strength in Porto Alegre, but still he faced opposition from anarchist unions, who were still the majority in the city, but his influence grew with time. In recent years, he was influenced by other centralist socialists abroad, and his Maximalist Union was one of the many leftist movements to support the so called Democratic Left. He is well respected by most Syndicalists in Brazil, even if his scathing and combative personality got him kicked out of more than one meeting. To him, Brazil's many issues after a decade of chaos can only be solved by a firm hand and unity among the people, a view shared by many army and navy officers. However, anarchists are still the biggest opponents to him in the political arena."
POLITICS_MINERVINO_OLIVEIRA_DESC:0 "Like many of Brazil's poor, Minervino de Oliveira began to work as a child, and from his earliest years of adulthood he already was an influential union member, and also was an early member of the Brazilian Syndicalist Party and contributed to leftist newspapers. By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defence of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front was a key turning point in the electoral race, and he became nationally known after the endorsement, Thrusted into his new position by the first congress of trade unions, Mangabeira is the first black president and the first syndicalist to occupy the highest office in the country, and the nation holds its breath to see what will come to pass during the Oliveira government."
POLITICS_MACIEL_BRA_DESC:0 "A true captain of the old guard, Olegário his political career all the way back in 1880, and has not left the game since, even at his advanced age. While some opposition members claim that having a president with ''one foot on the grave'' is dangerous for Brazilian democracy, the three time state president of Minas Gerais' politcal power cannot be denied, even if his body fails him more and more frequently in the past few years, as with any man in his eighties. His long support of Vargas in the Republican Party can be seen as ideological similarities, as both see a united and proactive federal government as vital for a better Brazil, but their alliance is often seen as one of convenience between the most powerful politicians of two powerful states of the Union. While his platform during elections was mostly a repeat of Vargas's 10 years ago, the ''old man president'' doesnt really considers the southerner his sucessor, as he envisions Gustavo Capanema as the one to inherit his political legacy in Brazil as a whole."
POLITICS_BORGES_DE_MEDEIROS_BRA_DESC:0 "Few men alive had as much of an impact in Brazilian politics, and especially in the Rio Grande do Sul state, as Antônio Augusto Borges de Medeiros, known politically by his last two names. Starting his political career in the 1890s, he swiftly rose through the ranks and assumed the position of state president from 1898 to 1908 and from 1913 to 1926, and was at the centre of the innumerable political crises, revolts and intrigues in Rio Grande do Sul during the timeframe, while also steadily rising to national prominence. Considered by many a man of unparalleled charisma and integrity, Borges refused a judicial position early in his life, in 1892, to focus entirely on politics, and has always tried to strike a balance between his ideas for a progressive Brazil and the whirlwind of political forces in his country and state. Having positioned himself very publicly in favour of São Paulo in 1927, his views on the integrity of the state's soverignty remain unchanged, as does his disdain for any centralizing overtures by the government in Rio de Janeiro. Now elected president at nearly his eighties, his positivist beliefs are staunchier than ever, after the national-level schsim of the liberal party and a contested electoral race. While establishing a parliamentary majority and governing the large democracy is a challenge, Borges' gravitas and personal charm will no doubt play an important role in keeping the republic on the way to progress."
POLITICS_PRESTES_MAIA_BRA_DESC:0 "Maia is not a politician by trade, but rather a civil engineer thursted to the position after his success in planning and repairing the infrastructure in São Paulo's most affected areas by the civil war, and his plan to completely remodel that state's streets has made great strides in the last decade, which made him the man of the hour in these elections. His beliefs clashed with other, older politicians and less liberally inclined members of the party, but his urban remodelling and subsequent tenure as Mayor of São Paulo made him well known nation wide, and thus he was picked to lead the splinter liberal ticket. His lack of political experience, especially at the national arena, may make his government quite the eventful affair, as his plans to remodel the country's fiscal and infrastructure systems may very well find stiff resistance in parliament, even with his own party's views. However, the fact that a man that isn't an establishment politician managed to enter the Catete is seen well by most of the populace."
POLITICS_NEREU_RAMOS_DESC:0 "The first president in history to hail from Santa Catarina, a small state in the far south of the country, Nereu de Oliveira Ramos began his political career in the 1910s, and has since managed to find a distinguished position in his own state's politics, but even still isn't one of the long time titans of politics he beat in the elections recently. While previously a member of the Liberal party, Nereu joined the Democratic Left during the last elections at the urging of Mangabeira, as to make sure that the party is not seen as dangerous leftist outsiders, and because his own frustrations at the apparent lack of changes after the crisis in 27. Now a leading figure among social democrats nation wide, Nereu wresteled much influence in the party in the past four years, and seeks a more centrist, albeit certainly still leftist, path for the party to tread through"
POLITICS_CANDIDO_RONDON_HOS_DESC:0 "Almost a living legend in Brazil, Candido Rondon is a die hard republican who spent decades of effort to connect, explore and map the large western reaches of Brazil. Usually not one to meddle in political affairs, Rondon was shocked to find after an expedition that Brazil's ruling Integralist party was not only plotting to restore the monarchy, but also had seemingly ordered his arrest. He took up arms, and was joined by many across the country who loathed the monarchist and populist rhetoric of the Integralists, but still was at a severe strategic disadvantage. However, his knowledge of local terrain and lifetime of military experience, coupled with uprisings dividing the attention of the oversteched federal government, allowed his revolution to succeed. Now he rules as interim president, leading a process of de-intoxicating Brazil from the monarchist disease until the next elections come, and law and order are properly restored to the nation. "
POLITICS_MENEGHETTI_BRA_DESC:0 "Born and raised in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Ildo Meneghetti is a relative newcomer to politics, being more well known in his home city for being several times president of Sport Club Internacional, one of the three major football teams in the city. This by itself is probably the most divisive facet of the relative newcomer, who joined the Liberals due to his disapproval of working with syndicalist and workers movements as closely as the Left Democrats do. An engineer by trade, his late foray into politics was a mayoral position in Porto Alegre in the last years, which he performed well enough to gain immense popularity there as a politician. Still, the leap from Mayor to President is fairly uncommon and a major milestone in Brazil's democratic history. Assembling a legislative majority will seemingly be the major hurdle for his government, as hardline Republicans are likely to refuse to vote for anything put forward by the Liberals; but such are the rules of this new game he chose to get himself involved with."
POLITICS_BARBOSA_MARTINS_BRA_DESC:0 "By and large a newcomer to politics, even if he is from a traditional political family in Mato Grosso, Wilson Barbosa Martins was born in Campo Grande in 1917, and witnessed first hand as a child the upheaval of the worst years of Brazil's republic, as his father joined the effort to oust the federal government during the struggle between São Paulo and the federal government. Since then, he has walked the somewhat typical path of local politicians towards the federal sphere, including being elected a state representative and then a federal one. Such a young man, no matter how successful, would have any under normal circumstances scant chances at being nominated to run for president, however, the split of the Liberal party left the faction with a dire need for leadership and renewed impetus, and Wilson has managed to garner support amongst those who seek change in the party, but did not leave it. After a close election in which he did not gain control of the house, his political situation is tenuous, with many older politicians dismissing him as an inexperienced youngster from a backwater state, a sentiment often shared by the press in Rio de Janeiro. A coalition with the Liberal Republicans, even if something extremely contentious, is perhaps the man's best hope at a stable government, lest he risks having even his most trivial proposals to the house constantly overturned."
POLITICS_RAUL_PILLA_DESC:0 "An influential man with strong ideals, Raul Pilla is often referred to as ''the Pope of Parliamentarism'' in his home state, even if his plans for reform of the federal government have scant chances of success considering the current political climate. Born in 1892 in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Raul's career in politics stated when he was only 17 years old, and even during this early age, his position against a strong executive power coming from this early stage in his career, as it was one of the banners of one of the many decentralization-friendly groups in that state, and often found himself in the complex disputes between factions in that state. The conflict between São Paulo and the Federal government was one where he naturally sided against the centralizers, whom he saw as violating the rights of states, and alongside his chief ally in his home state, Borges de Medeiros, fully supported the movement in an astonishingly rare moment of political unity in Rio Grande do Sul alongside other parties. Having since positioned himself against the Republican party, whose centralizing overtures in the past few years seem hypocritical at best considering the cause of the war that divided Brazil so recently, he joined Borges de Medeiros's splinter liberal party, as the two men also saw issues with what they perceived as an ineffectual opposition. His election as president is ironic, as he seeks to abolish the office in favour of one of a parliament elected prime minister, but he knows this is not a possibility in the short term, and his control of the house is tenuous at best. For now, the priority of him and the rest of the Republican Liberals is to undo some of the more egregious reforms from previous governments, while defending the rights of individual states."
POLITICS_JANIO_QUADROS_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in Mato Grosso do Sul in 1917, Jânio da Silva Quadros is one of the leading members of the new generation of Social Democrats that grew up and lived through the worst of the Black Monday crisis and its damaging fallout. The volatile years that followed allowed for the relatively young law school teacher to firmly establish himself in the political scene in São Paulo, decrying the corruption and inefficiency that has always plagued the state's government even before independence. His populist, aggressive campaign, that didn't even spare members of his own party, resonated with the people, who gleefully sang along to his slogans of ''Brooming'' the Brazilian politics of the old, the decrepit elites of the times before the war that hang on tightly to power. Despite all his ambitious plans, he still a democrat and constrained by constitutionale limits, but that has not stopped his enemies accusing him of Syndicalism and treason alike."
POLITICS_AFFONSO_CAMARGO_DESC:0 "Although he was born in the town of Guarapuava, Paraná, in 1873, Afonso Alves de Camargo moved to Curitiba later on his life, after he finished his studies in law school, as it was all too common for politicians in Brazil at the time. In the state capital of Paraná, he found himself involved in the local power struggles between centralist and federalist factions, in which he positioned himself against the national government. Shortly after the hostilities of this state civil war ended, in 1894, he formally entered politics as a state representative, and steadily climbed the political ladder; he became state president of Paraná, and later a federal representative and a senator. During this time, he positioned himself in favour of the Brazil Railway Company in the Contestado Affair, which caused a significant dent in the veteran politician's popularity, but did not affect his political power, as his handpicked successor won the elections after his term as State President with relative ease. A state senator at the time of the crisis that engulfed Brazil in 1927, he later returned to state to serve yet again as state president, and became the chief figure among Republicans in the state in recent years. While he isn't in Vargas's inner circle like most senior Republican leaders, his influence and seniority add much credibility to his nomination, even though some claim he's just 'more of the same', and is seen by opposition as just another aging oligarch seeking more power. However, opposition within his own party is a far more credible threat to his administration's political success, as Vargas and his associates still hold immense sway in the party's house membership, and a shaky base there could have negative ramifications for his government."
POLITICS_MANUEL_TOLEDO_BRA_DESC:0 "Perhaps the oldest political actor of great relevance in the nation, Pedro Manuel de Toledo has a long and rich political career that began almost concurrently with the rise of the republic itself. A staunch defender of liberty and the republic, he was involved in numerous revolts and conspiracies against the status quo, and wrote extensively on matters from secret voting to state autonomy. Of these revolts, his role in the large scale uprising in São Paulo is of great importance, as he saw the federal meddling as a direct attack on republican principles. Having somewhat recently ended a term as president of São Paulo, Toledo decided he was ready to become president of the nation now, even while well into his eighties. His age is seen as his main obstacle by the people, but politics is rarely that simple, and his presidential victory did not grant his party full control of the lower house, which might very well be an issue unless he is willing to work with some of the more virulent opposition politicians. A lawyer but chiefly diplomat by trade, he personally opposes any kind of foreign military adventures by Brazil, but intends to respect all existing treaties regardless."
POLITICS_TEIXEIRA_GYZ_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the city of Goyaz, Pedro Ludovico Teixeira completed his studies in Rio de Janeiro before returning to his home, where quickly began a political career, positioning himself against the state oligarchs, the Caiado family. While initially left leaning politically, the failures of the ED and the street violence that even reached his city during the 1936 elections have drifted him towards a more liberal-democratic point of view. While the nomination was a challenge in itself, few perhaps with the exception of the man himself expected an electoral victory for the presidency. His main goal while at the helm of the republic is one that has defined his political career, his long standing desire for a better and more developed Goyaz, even if his ideas on how to reach said goal have changed quite a bit over the years. After decades of what he sees as neglect, he plans to bring great amounts of investment to hinterlands of eastern Brazil, and in doing so will probably draw the ire of Southeastern politicians who expect to be at the top of the pecking order, not to mention the substantial parliamentary issues a party like his inevitably will face while in power."
POLITICS_JOSE_AMERICO_DE_ALMEIDA_BRA_DESC:0 "José Americo de Almeida was born in the small town of Areia, Parahyba, in 1887, and became a public prosecutor in the city of Souza, in that same state, shortly after graduating from law school. He rose quickly, becoming state prosecutor at the age of twenty four. Such a rise is notable and uncommon in the usually long climb politicians have in Brazil. Americo is one of the many more established political figures to join the party, after their cooling of relations with more radical left elements after the 1936 election cycle, and lends to the party his notable experience and gravitas as both a navigator and a talented author. While the victory at the elections may be seen as a surprise, it is in no doubt due to these new connections the party developed with important leaders, perhaps Americo's reputation as unlucky will finally turn around. Now at the helm of the entire nation of Brazil, he finds himself having to face the great challenge of managing the disparate political forces in the nation, a fact especially exacerbated by his relative lack of clout in his home state, where João Pessoa, his rival, is far more influential."
POLITICS_TANCREDO_NEVES_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in 1910 in the city of São João del-Rei, southern Minas Gerais, Tancredo de Almeida Neves started to take an interest in politics as early as age nine, already as a young man opposing the then ruling party of his home state in the crisis that sparked the Interstate War. While he at first tried to volunteer for opposition militias, his remarkably poor aim and physical disposition had him rejected, and he spent the war at home, while having difficulties finding a job during the economic depression that hit the nation. Some years after the war, he joined the Republican party and began the slow climb through it's ranks, becoming a representative at city hall and the state legislature before heading to Rio's parliament. While his loyalties certainly lie with the Republicans, his somewhat moderate stances on key issues gave him a meaningful leg over other candidates, in what was a fairly contested election, even if the wanton violence of 1936 has been long left behind. His stances on economical and social issues are also why he has a relatively stable control of the upper and lower houses, but the ever eventful politics of Brazil may well surprise even the most skilled of politicians."
POLITICS_ASSIS_BRA_DESC:0 "A true old timer of Rio Grande do Sul politics, Joaquim Francisco de Assis Brasil is a well respected politician, backed by his years of experience dealing with both local and national party members. His career started in 1884, still in the waning years of the Empire, and he became an important figure during the Old Republic era, even if at a national level he was often overshadowed by other natives of his state, he performed very important roles, including vital diplomatic missions to Argentina, Mexico, the USA and more. A true gaucho, Joaquim adores the free country life of the plains, even if he is not advised to ride horses anymore due to his advanced age. Still, he always associated the freedom of the gaucho rider with that of the republican freedoms, and even if not a separatist, places a deep value to the traditions of a state. He is also a prolific historical and political writer, even if some of the concepts proposed in his books, like that of an ''voting machine'' to prevent fraud, do seem truly outlandish. While his victory has led to rabid optimism by most party members, he knows that keeping control of the lower house may well be a far more difficult affair than they predict, as the Liberal majority is tenuous at best, and the party remains relatively fractured even after the split."
POLITICS_AFONSO_FEATHER_JUNIOR_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in the small town of Santa Barbara in Minas Gerais, Afonso Augusto Moreira Pena Júnior started his career like many other local politicians, studying law and becoming a state representative. Even though he is a very successful liberal and a respected literary intellectual, he always had to deal with the looming shadow that his father, former President Afonso Pena, whose achievements and legacy always seemed impossible to match. But now, he too has become president of Brazil, but unlike his father, who was frustrated at every turn by powerful landlords and political opponents, Junior is determined to advance and modernize the Brazilian nation to the standard enjoyed by other nations, especially in its farthest reaches, both in terms of education and infrastructure development. However, said endeavours are certainly easier planned than followed through, for even with a relative control over the ever turbulent politics of Brazil, there is no shortage of opposition for the so called radical ideas put forward by Afonso."
POLITICS_JOAO_GOULART_BRA_DESC:0 "João Belchior Marques Goulart, known by the common people by the nickname Jango, hails from a family of powerful landowners in Rio Grande do Sul. While he is a relatively young man, his career in politics saw a rapid rise since it's start in the 1940s, but before that he studied law and notably was a youth player for Internacional in Porto Alegre before entering the political arena, under the auspices of his father, the rather powerful Vicente Goulart. He has always been a bit more left leaning than his father however, and his election may well be the shake-up the left in Brazil needed in this decade, as many of the old slogans and talking points have been rendered moot by changes in legislation. Frequently accused of being a syndicalist or a populist, Jango is steadfast in his moderate stance, defending that all voices are heard, but also vehemently denying claims of syndicalism. This so called ‘softness’ towards what many in Brazil consider dangerous radicals may well cause instability during his rule, as Republican political forces already prepared to thwart his every move in congress. It seems that winning the elections is just the first of many battles head of Jango's presidency."
POLITICS_OSVALDO_ARANHA_BRA_DESC:0 "Osvaldo Euclides de Sousa Aranha hails from the town of Alegrete, in Rio Grande do Sul. Ever since the earliest points of his career, he has been seen as both a reliable mediator and a skilled administrator, skills sorely necessary in a state where political violence was at a breaking point until the state presidency of Getúlio Vargas, a man who is one of his closest allies and friends, and it's a common occurrence to see both side by side. Having spent most of his career as a diplomat after the Civil War, he returned to Brazil and politics at the request of his longtime friend, as a consensus candidate was sorely needed in the ranks of the ever fractured Republican party, even if the party itself is not nearly as divided and decentralized as it was during the early 1930s. His remarkable experience as a mediator is surely to be invaluable as the head of state, and it's widely predicted that his demeanour and relatively moderate stances will ensure one of the most stable and hopefully prosperous presidencies in Brazil's republican history, as his party gives him an extremely comfortable political position at the Catete. His years as a diplomat will also hopefully help with diplomacy abroad, as Brazil looks more than ever outwards in these new times."
POLITICS_JK_BRA_DESC:0 "Hailing from the city of Diamantina in Minas Gerais, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira is the son of a Mineiro father and a Czech mother, his middle name being the Germanized spelling of Kubícek. After his father's death very early on his life, he began his studies, and eventually graduated from medical school and volunteered to aid in medical service during the Interstate War. Afterwards, he began his by now very long political career. While he is a well known figure in Belo Horizonte, where he even ran for the office of mayor in the past, and has been a representative in Rio multiple times, his clout outside of his home state has always been somewhat limited, even after the victory in the election, as the Liberal party has to juggle with opposition at every corner of congress. However, even with these issues, JK, as he is more commonly known to the public, has big plans. Not just urban renewal, infrastructure investments or political reforms, he is a very vocal proponent of the proposal of moving the capital of the nation further inland to push development in the great hinterlands of the Cerrado plains, which would be an outrageously expensive endeavour. Regretfully for him, and thankfully for the state budget some say, such a proposal is already dead on arrival, with massive opposition from several groups in parliament and prominent newspapers."
POLITICS_LANDRY_SALES_DESC:0 "A native of Acaraú and born in 1904, Landry Sales Gonçalves started his career as a military officer, and both took part on rebellions back in the Old Republic and interacted with several key figures of the tenentist uprisings that would follow. While he did flirt with the AIB during the rise of that party, he since has adopted more classical liberal stances while keeping his militarist political thought, and has been elected president with great support from fellow officers in campaigning. His outlook towards politics also changed over the years, and he is more in favour of de-escalating tensions and a generally less active role of active officers in political affairs. His nomination by the party was somewhat contested, but the true challenge will be to retain control of congress with a significant house minority, especially since there is little chance of the Liberal factions cooperating even this long after their political split, albeit there is nothing a few ministerial positions can’t solve, some say. Regardless, his presidency is probably going to be one of the most difficult affairs in recent memory, but the man is used to both the harsh life of the barracks and the ever shifting loyalties of politics."
POLITICS_ELISA_KAUFFMAN_ABRAMOVICH_BRA_DESC:0 "A career teacher and Ashkenazi jew, Elisa Kauffmann was born in São Paulo during the late stages Weltkrieg, her parents having fled the horrors of wartime Russia. While a teacher, she has worked on special schools to help other jews fleeing Europe in the following decades of chaos and unrest on the continent. Having been a political activist from a very young age, Elisa was one of the few openly socialist politicians to run for office under the ED umbrella and succeed in the contentious 1936 elections, being always a voice for the worker's movement in parliament. Her general political experience put her ahead of the pack in the selection process for chairman, but even still gathering the necessary support was by no means an easy feat, as Brazil's unions are even more decentralized in terms of ideology and state lines than the previous parties once were. Now in power and leading Brazil's nascent socialist government, Elisa has to deal with a tumultuous foreign and internal political landscape, and ensure that the planned industrialization and development programs go on as planned. Thankfully, the worst, more shaky years of the new status quo seems to be the in past, and she seems more than capable of achieving her goals."
POLITICS_ELISA_KAUFFMAN_ABRAMOVICH_BRA_SD_DESC:0 "A career teacher and Ashkenazi jew, Elisa Kauffmann was born in São Paulo during the late stages Weltkrieg, her parents having fled the horrors of wartime Russia. While a teacher, she has worked on special schools to help other jews fleeing Europe in the following decades of chaos and unrest on the continent. Having been a political activist from a very young age, Elisa was one of the few openly socialist politicians to run for office under the ED umbrella and succeed in the contentious 1936 elections, being always a voice for the worker's movement in parliament. Despite the fallout of their coalition's perceived failures, and the many political issues since arisen, she has not faltered in her desire to establish a broad left front to improve the situation in Brazil, even if it means great compromises with the Social Democrats and other traditional political forces in the country. Now known nationwide as the 'Red Senator' after a long tenure maintaining worker's rights at the forefront, she has to assuage military personnel's rampant fear of a syndicalist coup, as her proposals, while seen as overly moderate by her fellow syndicalists, are extremely radical for a nation like Brazil. However, the longstanding dissatisfaction of the common people with the seemingly endless inability of the federal government to end poverty, unemployment and other far more pressing concerns than ideological disagreements have ensured she managed to win a democratic election and become the first female to do so. Now she has to deal not only with the traditionally conservative elites, but with a constantly divided and bickering powerbase in an even less stable legislature; and yet she wholly believed she can turn Brazil's fortunes around for good."
POLITICS_ISIDORO_DIAS_LOPES_DESC:0 "One of the many old and very respected Gaúcho officers in the Brazilian Army, also known for the moniker of 'Marshall of the Revolution' recently, Isidoro Dias Lopes has a long history of siding with what he considers morally correct rather than what his superiors order him to. From 1893 in the Federalist Revolt in his home state to now the Chilean Crisis, his steady hand and respect by the people and officers granted him enough political capital to proclaim himself provisional president. Despite persistent requests by other officers, especially from those further to the right who see his moderate voice as needed, Isidoro has stated in no uncertain terms that his government is temporary, and he will step down as soon as the Union representatives and delegates meet to select a ruler. Time will tell if this decision is the right one for the future of the country."
POLITICS_MARIA_LACERDA_DE_MOURA_DESC:0 "Hailing from inner Minas Gerais and born in 1887, Maria Lacerda de Moura was raised by her anticlerical, spiritist parents in the somewhat larger paulista town of Barbacena, and began her political and social history shortly after becoming a full time teacher, campaigning for nationwide education reform and literacy efforts. She was publishing books as early as 1918 and started to author articles 8 years before that, and during this period she began to be influenced by anarchist and syndicalist thought. Despite issues with suffragette movements, whom she saw as 'not fighting for enough change', she has always been one of the foremost feminist activists in the country, something that no doubt influenced in her choice as Chairwoman by progressive minded delegates, but she also has held a position among the most respected lefitist academics and authours on São Paulo. Now, Brazil' head of state has the daunting task of leading the continuing socialization of the government, rising demands of officers and the ever contentious Congress of Trade Unions, as some still rose issues regarding her birthplace, but her experience and fame seem to indicate she is more than prepared for the task; or so the nation hopes."
POLITICS_ASTROJILDO_PEREIRA_DESC:0 "Astrojildo Pereira Duarte Silva is a native of the town Rio Bonito, near Rio, and was born in 1890, and left his hometown to the far larger Niterói, the state capital of Rio de Janeiro. There he began his studies in earnest, and after coming into contact with the intellectuals there, he decided to abandon said studies to focus solely on subjects he actually cared about, such as literature and politics. He avidly backed Ruy Barbosa, a reformist liberal, against Hermes da Fonseca, a marshall, in the 1910 elections, and the defeat, coupled with the increasingly repressive actions of the federal government, made him utterly skeptical of traditional politics. He was then, in that same year, drawn to anarchism and syndicalism causes, and began his trajectory in the worker's movement in Rio. He worked tirelessly to organize the worker's movement, creating associations and playing a key role organizing the CGT and the FAB into articulate institutions capable of defending the rights of workers, and was one of their key leaders during recent decades. His distrust of traditional politics made dealings with the Democratic Left difficult, and he was often one of the voices opposing 'class appeasement' with the men he saw as nothing but liars. His popularity and influence among anarchists and syndicalist circles made his election to the position of chairman something of a political inevitability, but even still he is more or less a complete unknown to most Brazilians, who apprehensively watched the old order be replaced with the Union of Brazil. Now that conventional politics and its corruption are gone, Astrojildo can finally get working into establishing the country he envisioned, built by workers, for the workers, while keeping the fragile political peace currently in place."
POLITICS_AVELINO_FOSCOLO_DESC:0 "A member of the old guard of the Brazilian left, Avelino Fóscolo was born in 1864 in Sabará, Minas Gerais, still in the days of the Empire. While at his youth he wandered around the country, allegedly even trouping with the circus, by the 1880s he had left his mark in his hometown's press, championing the abolition of slavery and anti-monarchistic views, and by end of the century's first decade, he was already deeply involved with anarchism in the city of Paraopéba, then called Taboleiro Grande, while he worked as a pharmacist. It was during this time he also began writing books, romances usually colored with less than subtle political undertones as was typical of literature of the time. While he later moved to Belo Horizonte permanently, he also frequently visited Rio and lended his support to the strikes and the labour movement in that city, making him one of the chief figures among anarchists nationwide. And old man, with several children and a life nearing its end, the ideologically orthodox Avelino may well find difficult to reconcile his strong principles with the realities of governing a nation as vast as Brazil, especially considering the intense political turmoil it is experiencing, even if the same adherence to ideological precepts allowed his election in the first place."
POLITICS_EVERARDO_DIAS_DESC:0 "Everardo Dias was actually born in the town of Pontevedra in Spain, and came to Brazil while very young in 1887, as his father fled his home country. He started working at age 13 on a major Paulista newspaper, but his studies later turned towards law, as is all to common for Brazilian politicians. A long time anti-clerical and anti-censorship advocate, Everardo was writing about his political thoughts as early as 1902, and has partook in most great strikes and political actions by socialist and anarchist elements in São Paulo in this century, being one of the most recognizable figures of the movement. His long and storied history with the labour movement was doubtlessly a chief factor to see his name put forward by the congress of trade unions as the head of their council, but he also is a conciliatory and non radical figure, always defending differing viewpoints and the right of non socialist opposition do demonstrate and even put forward candidates for certain offices. While some claim this comes from a misguided sense of camaraderie with his fellow freemasons and former political associates in the republican era, the truth is simply his ever staunch defence of free speech, as a system that cannot withstand criticism is not strong enough to do real change in a country as vast and unequal as Brazil."
POLITICS_CANDIDO_PORTINARI_DESC:0 "The son of Italian immigrants, Candido Portinari was born in the small town of Brodowski, in the state of São Paulo. Always having been a prolific artist, he started his career as a helper in the restoration of churches in his hometown, and at just age 16 he moved to Rio to enrol in the national school of arts, where his talent was immediately recognized. Since then, his position as one of the foremost artists of the nation has solidified, but his political career is far more recent, having only in recent times become truly active as an elected union representative. While his political experience is somewhat limited, his talent and intellect made him well known, and as with many other elections, this fame placed him an advantageous position when compared to his fellow candidates. While it's certainly an advantage for a head of state to be such a respected artist, especially on the international level, many raise concerns about having such an inexperienced man as head of state."
POLITICS_DJALMA_MARANHAO_DESC:0 "A relative newcomer to the political scene, Djalma Maranhão has been involved with the worker's movement since the early 1930s in his hometown of Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, even attempting to run for a mayoral position under the ED umbrella, albeit that endeavour did not succeed. While also a teacher and journalist, his dedication to the political cause has been intensified since the revolution, as real change finally arrived to Brazil. Having gained significant support from his fellow northeastern union representatives, Djalma now prepares to take the helm of Brazil's socialist government, and seeks to turn development efforts to northeast, as he feels previous governments have put the needs of urban, industrial workers ahead of the great many Brazilians who still work on the fields and on small towns across the nation. Such a paradigm shift is popular in non central regions, but naturally less so in Rio, São Paulo and other major urban centers. Time will tell whether these extensive reform programs will be successful or not."
POLITICS_OTTO_ACLIDES_OHLWEILER_DESC:0 "Born and raised in Porto Alegre, Rio do Grande do Sul, Otto Alcides Ohlweiler is perhaps a teacher first, and a politician second, having dedicated most of his life to his career as a chemistry laureate and teacher at the local federal university. Author of multiple books, most of his political life has been dedicated towards left wing causes, which he formally joined in the early 1930s. While he did run for office under the ED umbrella in the 1936 elections, he was ultimately frustrated by the political games of parliament, and was one of the advocates of changing the legislative to its current form in the congress of trade unions. Having always leaned towards a more european ideal of syndicalism, Otto's views fit well with the Internationale's official stances, but much less so with the majority of anarchists and socialists in the congress of trade unions."
POLITICS_JOAO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "João Mangabeira started out as a noteworthy defence attorney in Ilhéus, before turning to politics like his brother, former president Otávio. Early on in his career he was a close and passionate follower of Rui Barbosa, but after his mentor's passing, he carved a career of its own as a federal representative of the state of Bahia. A man with deeply rooted anti-authoritarian principles, he was a vocal supporter of Bahia's role in the civil conflict, and gained notoriety as a result. As his career went by, the continuous and yet seemingly fruitless struggle of Brazil's poor brought him closer to the left, and while he certainly has some socialist views and allies in union and intellectual circles, he certainly is no Syndicalist. His plan for Brazil was to build a broad leftist front to oppose the current status quo, and his success was unexpected, but probably not unpredictable considering the social upheaval following Black Monday and the scandalous repression of labour movements nationwide. Now, he has to juggle the several disparate factions in his left front while keeping the ravenous opposition at bay, and it seems his presidency is certainly going to be as eventful as his brother's."
POLITICS_APOLONIO_DE_CARVALHO_DESC:0 "Apolônio de Carvalho is one of the most notable military servicemen to have joined political life in the left wing, having had a long and distinguished career in the Brazilian military after he left his home in Corumbá to serve. He joined the ranks of the ED around the time of the 1936 elections, urged by fellow officers to act on his desire to bring meaningful change to the nation. One of the most enthusiastic supporters of the counter-coup that brought about the revolution in Brazil, Apolônio certainly is a proactive politician, as he and many other fellow left leaning officers feel that the changes in the structure of the country are being too slow and gradual, and doing so risks both lives and the safety of the future success of the revolution. His political stances also are a lot closer to traditional french ideals than the general heterodoxical ideas of most officers in the army. As a military man, he also believes in a proactive foreign policy to safeguard the interests of the revolution."
POLITICS_JORGE_AMADO_DESC:0 "Jorge Leal Amado de Faria was born in Itabuna, Bahia, in 1912, and began his career as an author as early as age fourteen. He moved on to Rio de Janeiro to conclude his studies of law, and there was influenced by the many left wing intellectuals and the ideas of the revolutions in Europe, whose success seemed to inspire the left wing elites of the country. He later became a journalist, and only truly joined the political arena in the years after the tumultuous 1936 elections. While he officially defines himself as irreligious, he is in practice a practitioner of Candomblé, an african traditional faith that has many practitioners in the state of Bahia, and is well acquainted with most religious leaders in his home region. Now thrust into the position of head of state, many question his relative lack of experience in the political arena when compared to other candidates for the task. While his enthusiastic approach to his new job is certainly for many welcome at a time where revolutionary fervour is cooling down, he may well not be prepared for the great task of ensuring the cooperation of the disparate unions and factions in the nation."
POLITICS_CARLOS_LACERDA_DESC:0 "Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda was born in 1914, the year the weltkrieg started, and his very name is significant to understand him; Carlos comes from Karl Marx, Frederico from Friedrich Engels, as his father was a socialist activist as well who greatly admired the duo; In time, he followed in his father's footsteps, and joined the CGT and became a full time leftist activist as early as 1932, when he put his law degree on the backseat to focus on the political realm entirely. Long involved in the Demoratic Left and before that the CGT, he found himself rapidly rising in the ranks of brazilian syndicalist circles, thanks to his no nonsense attitude and oratory talent; albeit some claim this is due to his father's influence, not his own talent. His faith in syndicalism is unabated by the crises that followed the past decade in the world, and he took an active part in bringing it to his home. Now, he has taken up the great responsibility of leading his new nation, and to finish the fight against the capitalist rot of Brazil for good, and seeks to implement extensive reforms on almost all matters of state. However, his somewhat aggressive demeanour may result in issues both domestically and abroad when it comes to close negotiations."
POLITICS_LUIS_CARLOS_PRESTES_DESC:0 "While he hails from Rio Grande do Sul, Luís Carlos Prestes started his political career in Rio de Janeiro, where he became an officer and partook in Tenentist revolts, especially left wing ones. There, he was also exposed to the new ideals of Syndicalism as espoused in Europe, and formally joined that movement shortly after the New Republic was established in 1927, and even spent some years in France, at the behest of that country's government. This naturally made him suspect to many who assumed him to be a foreign agent, but his charisma and aggressive politics ensured he remained a relevant figure, and now not only did he finally manage to liberate Brazil from capitalism, but was elected as the chairman of the nation. He has widespread, nearly nationwide military support, due to his long standing principles of anti-corruption struggle, but he's also kept in touch with officers and diplomats from his time in France. Said international connections and charisma made him a natural choice for the leader of the newly founded commune, and now he assumes a position at the absolute forefront of the revolutionary vanguard. A somewhat reserved man regarding personal matters, he has never married, once stating that he ''never met the one''. While the worst period of post-revolutionary unrest has come and gone, it's still a tenuous balance that keeps the political authority of the Union together, but Prestes's longstanding military connections afford the nation a great deal of stability in these turbulent times."
POLITICS_PATRICIA_REHDER_GALVAO_DESC:0 "Patrícia Rehder Galvão, sometimes referred to as her pseudonym of Pagu, is one of the youngest and most energetic leaders of the left in Brazil. Born in 1910 to to a german mother and a french father in the town of São João da Boa Vista, she started her forays into both politics and writing at an early age, despite her deeply conservative background, with a small role at a newspaper in 1925, at age 15, and joined modernist and heavily left leaning circles at 18 shortly after finishing school. The nickname of Pagu derives from one of her fellow modernist writers mistakenly assuming her name to be Patríca Goulart, and stuck as a moniker throughout her life since then. Her political activism truly started in the 1930s, as she and other intellectuals felt that all the turmoil of the last decade did little to improve the situation of her fellow Brazilians.  Her former husband was none other than Oswald de Andrade, who also happens to be influential among syndicalist intellectuals, and is nowadays a close political associate of his ex-wife, despite the relatively turbulent divorce they experienced, allegedly due to bouts of jealousy after one of the couple's many visits to the Commune of France, due to their shared views and values for the future of the country as a whole. As if the institution of the Union of Brazil wasn't enough to infuriate conservatives, the election of a divorced, single woman to the position is bound to intensely irritate those who still believe the government to be illegitimate, and Patrícia's short temper for those who believe they can tell her what to do is bound to cause political attrition."
POLITICS_OSWALD_DE_ANDRADE_DESC:0 "A paulista born in the capital of that state in 1890, José Oswald de Sousa de Andrade has always been an intellectual first and a politician second, but his influence on leftist circles across Brazil cannot be understated. His role in the modernist is quite extensive, with some coming as far as calling him it's founder and main proponent. While he used to be married to Patricia Rehder Galvão, who is more known by her nickname Pagu, the marriage broke down in less than half a decade, as did his previous marriage to another renowned artist, Tarsila do Amaral. While he is known for generally humoured and spirited demeanour, he also is described as combative and often aggressive in arguments, which may explain his relationship's short duration. Still, his charisma carried him with relative ease to a victory in swaying the congress of trade unions to choose him as the leader of the revolution, a task he plans to take on very seriously. While his literary and artistic identity is well defined, few can guess what kind of leader he will be on the international arena, and the nation now pays close attention whether he will make friends or enemies when meeting with foreign diplomats."
POLITICS_PEDRO_VENTURA_POMAR_DESC:0 "Pedro Ventura Felipe de Araújo Pomar lived certainly an unorthodox childhood, having moved to New York from his home state of Pará while aged 5, living there for two years before returning to his small birth town of Obidos, and then moving to the state capital of Belem. He started to act politically at age thirteen, supporting the rebel cause in the interstate war quite publicly, but later on he moved further and further left as he reached adulthood, becoming a full blown socialist by age 20; he spent these youth years studying for medical school, and as a part time footballer for Clube do Remo. A calm and collected man, Pedro often remains quiet in political gatherings, only occasionally inferring in rare points, and has a usually positive and likeable demeanour, which resulted in his relative popularity among trade union members, despite his somewhat young age. Having taken the lead of the entirety of Brazil is one thing, but properly leading the extremely disparate and decentralized factions is another matter entirely. While he calmly believes matters will be sorted shortly and that the revolutionary process will continue smoothly, many wonder if his relative lack of contacts in upper syndicalist circles in major centres of the south may leave him isolated in his own cabinet."
POLITICS_LILLIA_RIPOLL_DESC:0 "Born in a small town in Rio Grande do Sul in 1905, Lila Ripoll began her public life as studying and performing music in Porto Alegre, but she also was a poet before she entered politics, a sudden change she and few around her could have predicted. Such a sudden change came when her cousin Waldemar Ripoll was assassinated in 1936, allegedly on the orders of one of the major local strongmen, Flores da Cunha. This strengthened her resolve, and compelled her to join the unions in their strikes. Her determination to make a positive impact, constant and active political presence, and rising renown among the Unions of Brazil, who see her and her story as a symbol of worker's struggle, and of merit and competency, made her a natural choice to run for the post of chairwoman by the unions of Rio Grande do Sul, and their pitch has been welcomed by the Congress, who named Lila their leader. Now, she hopes to make a positive impact in the country, but her idealism may clash with the tough choices ahead, and the world in conflict around her."

POLITICS_EUGENIA_ALVARO_MOREYRA_DESC:0 "Eugênia Álvaro Moreyra was born in Juiz de Fora, in the state of Minas Gerais, in 1898. After the early death of her father, she and her mother moved to Rio de Janeiro, where she was self taught in proper Portuguese and French. Shortly after her first job at age 15, she joined the A Rua newspaper as a reporter, a fact so unprecedented a brand new work was coined for a female reporter, reportisa. She was one of the key figures in the suffragette movement, and she also became the first major female political figure in leftist and modernist circles, and in these same circles she met her future husband, the poet Álvaro Moreyra, whom she married in 1914. Having been among the earliest members of the PSB and the ED alongside her closest associates like Oswald de Andrade and Carlos Lacerda, she has a longstanding influence on the going's on of the left wing in capital of Rio, and therefore the entire nation, for decades, and this influence has made her one of the key figures of the new Union of Brazil. Her aggressive activism towards gender equality has some less enthusiastic revolutionaries worried about the pace of the changes imposed on the generally conservatvie Brazilian public, she nevertheless remains undeterred and in her dedication to the cause that has taken most of her life by now."
POLITICS_RACHEL_DE_QUEIROZ_DESC:0 "Perhaps better known for her activities as an author, journalist, teacher and translator, Rachel de Queiroz mostly represents the interests of her unions than that of any established political movement in the modern post revolutionary landscape, as she never had a very deep connection with leftist cliques. Often bothered by what she considers ideological orthodoxy standing in the way of eradicating poverty, especially in her home state of Ceará, she was something of a consensus candidate among the several disparate groups that have arisen in the congress, with the backing of several northeastern delegates behind her. This position also may complicate her situation in executive matters, but she believes that working with a focus on the education of the lower orders will bring about greater prosperity than simple industrialization programs, or building huge railways across the nation."
POLITICS_ARMANDA_ALVARO_ALBERTO_DESC:0 "Few women have worked for the feminist and educational causes as long, and as strongly, as Armanda Álvaro Alberto. A founding member of the Brazilian Femine Union, she also was a pioneer in establishing the Proletarian School model, where poor children were granted both food and education from the school, but also she had great influence from foreign innovations in education, especially from Montessori's New School method. She has always defended a position where women of all categories must join to fight for their rights, but also against divisive rhetoric that paints men as an enemy of women, which she saw as shallow and petty. Her position at the forefront of socialist movements has landed her more than one tenure in jail, but also great fame and acclaim in political circles. Her main goals are to combat hunger and the shoddy state of education in the entirety of Brazil, spreading a standardized method of teaching to schools all across the nation."
POLITICS_MAURICO_GRABOIS_DESC:0 "Maurício Grabois, born in Salvador da Bahia in 1912, is descended from bessarabian Jews that fled the ever growing chaos of the Russian Empire during the Russo-Japenese war to find a new life in Brazil, after a long journey. While studying at military school, he started to lean towards radical leftism, while also becoming a staunch opposition of the ever growing integralist ideology that seemed to spread into barracks across the country then. While just 24 years old, he already was leading syndical and socialist activities, and his early rise only went further within the labour cause."
POLITICS_PEDRO_IV_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in exile in 1909, His Imperial Highness Pedro de Alcântara Henrique Astolfo Filipe Maria Gastão Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga de Orléans e Bragança e Bourbon is the grandson of Princess Isabel, heir of Pedro II, the greatest and last emperor of Brazil. Having spent his childhood at Castle D'eu with the Imperial family in exile, he wasnt able to set foot in Brazil until the Decree of Banishment by the republic was revoked in the 1920s, even though he was deferred from serving in the armed forces in 1925. Having come to live permanently in Brazil after the civil war, which convinced him personally more than ever that a monarchy was needed by the people, he immediately started to articulate politically towards his restoration, and his scheme has finally come to fruition as he has been crowned Pedro III of Brazil. He has been prepared all his life, from childhood tutors to lessons as an adult, for this station he considers his birthright, but few things could prepare a man for the tumultuous times since Black Monday shattered the economic order of the world. While he certainly is thankful for the assistance of the Integralist movement in restoring him, his views towards the more radical wings of the party are not as positive as one could think, as their extreme views often clash with his milder ones."
POLITICS_GUSTAVO_CAPANEMA_DESC:0 "Born in the small town of Pitangui, Minas Gerais, Gustavo Capanema Filho is great-grandson of Guilherme Schüch, the Baron of Capanema. Like most men in influential families, Gustavo studied law in university, becoming a city councillor in Pitangui shortly after his graduation. He has climbed the ranks in the PR very quickly, and while he is a capable man, this is in no small part due to the immense influence wielded by his close friend and associate Getúlio Vargas, as he is one of the few that has the gaucho's trust. His nomination and election campaign had Vargas's widespread support, as cartoonists often drew Capanema as little more than his sockpuppet. But despite these attacks, he remains a staunch ally to Vargas, who now leads his political articulation in congress to ready for a smooth republican government. While many rejoice the stability of the orderly elections, some worry that the oligarchs of the plantations of the old republic have been replaced with a new type of politician, far more cunning and malleable. Capanema, of course, knows these to be only the rumblings of a defeated and scattered opposition, as the many newspapers under republican control will surely begin sharing in the coming months. His politics of self strengthening and industrialization have much in common with Vargas's, as well."

Was closely involved with the coup that toppled the monarchy despite his low rank at the time. In the years since, he has spent much of his time and effort mapping and exploring the far wilderness of northwestern Brazil and its immense jungles, and the specially dangerous task of establishing telegraph lines in that area. A fervent believer of positivist principles, he seeks strictly peaceful contact with the natives of inner Brazil, even at risk of harm; he narrowly escaped death by a poisoned arrow in 1913 but ordered his men not to fire back. His expeditions are each a dangerous and long adventure, with some, like the one he led to the River of Doubt alongside Theodore Roosevelt, internationally known. But he also does not hesitate to lead troops in defense of the republic, and has led troops on occasion against various revolts when he is not expedition, and has an extensive military record in dealing with such. His much higher rank in the military and age have thus far done little to diminish his adventurous spirit, as there is still much to explore the in the far wilds \n§YImportant Notes:§W He has spent great time and effort advocating for the rights of natives to the government in Rio, but his requests, so far, fell on deaf ears. \nHis men claim he has killed an alligator in an expedition armed only with a knife."

Later became a military engineer, working throughout his home state on barracks and fortifications, but was also an advocate of military railways in the region. He joined politics after the republic was proclaimed, but was still first and foremost an army man, with military concerns always on his mind. In 1910 was named Minister of War in the Hermes da Fonseca administration, and juggled several high ranking positions in the republic ever since, reaching the rank of marshall just before the 1927 revolution. While his high ranking means he has with great frequency dealt with rebels, he generally grants them amnesty when they are fellow soldiers, such as in the common tenentist uprisings, but the harshness of the operation led by him the Contestado revolt in 1915 is still infamous. While generally out of politics, and public life in general for that matter, since the civil war, he's still one of the highest ranking and most respected servicemen in the country, and thus well positioned to take leadership in case of war."

Between 1893 and 1895, he took part in a local revolt in Rio Grande do Sul, known as the Federalist Revolution, wherein he was defeated by government forces and exiled in Paris for a year before receiving amnesty. In 1926, he returned from Rio, where he was stationed, to Rio Grande do Sul, allegedly to deal with personal matters, but rising tensions in the capital clearly indicate it was to prepare for the inevitable conflict brewing. During the hostilities in 1927, Isidoro was in general command of the forces in the uprising, and thus is well known as the 'Marshall of the Revolution' for his leadership on the matter. Since then, his prestige has far surpassed those of other military leaders from the conflict, but he mostly keeps away from political affairs, albeit his disdain for the Old Republic is well known and vocal. He has been nonetheless invited to campaign for the Democratic Left, an offer which he refused, despite the fact his popularity is such that he may well be a viable presidential candidate. \n§YImportant Notes:§W His previous exile in Paris left an impression of him, especially regarding how backwards Brazil is to him."

While not fully supporting the Federal Government’s cause, he did not side with the Paulista alliance either. His command in Rio had him frequently square off against strikes and barracks uprisings of syndicalist nature, giving him an immense distaste for the ideology that caused this chaos, and he seldom hid his immense disregard for their movement, especially after they took over Chile and caused open war in Argentina. He is a leading figure among conservative officers,but has shown little interest in Integralist movements or ideology due to his more traditional conservative leanings, despite them sharing positions in violent opposition to Syndicalism. He is also personally opposed to any involvement of Brazil in European or overseas entanglements in general, preferring a generally neutral foreign policy for the nation \n§YImportant Notes:§W Eurico has a speech impediment, and always swaps the sounds for the letters C and X."

He joined the side of the paulista faction in the 1927 revolution, as he was serving in São Paulo at the time and his home state sided with the rebels, and in that conflict he served with distinction as an officer; the conflict, while short, helped him prove his mettle to his superiors and made him well regarded throughout the armed forces after the conflict, as he is now one of Brazil's most valued officers, even if he does not share the popularity among civilians some of his compatriots do. He cares little for such matters, and has not expressed himself politically in any strong way so far, which also sets him apart from several other officers in the army."

There he found himself involved in local politics, joined the Federalist Revolution in 1893 and thus was banished from the army. After a brief period living as a civilian in Porto Alegre, he received amnesty and re-joined the military, and was assigned to an infantry regiment in his home city, where he also collaborated to local newspapers. He was deployed to several states over his military career, generally dealing with local revolts, and even the navy mutiny of 1910. He frequently found himself serving under Candido Rondon, and is among many who greatly admire him in the brass of the armed forces. He positioned himself strongly on the side of the so called rebel forces during the hostilities of 1926, and under his command were made some of the first organization attempts at an air force, even if still under the command of his regiment. Since the war, he also played roles in the ministry of war."
BRA_ZENOBIO_COSTA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 9, 1893, in Corumbá, Mato Grosso, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Enlisted in 1911, and immediately began to prepare for a military education, having previously moved to Rio de Janeiro for that reason. One of his first assignments was to restore order in the south, fighting the so-called Contestado War, under the command of Setembrino de Carvalho, the suppression of which was as ruthless as it was successful. Was transferred to Rio again after the conflict, and during the revolution, was one of the officers who sided with the legalists, and he was briefly arrested as one of their senior commanders, but received amnesty and reinstated a year later. Since then, he was assigned to relatively unprestigious positions, but is unlikely to lead any revolts due to his legalist stances. \n§YImportant Notes:§W Was trained as both an infantry and cavalry officer."
BRA_NEWTON_CAVALCANTI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 23, 1885, in Palmeira dos Índios, Alagoas, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Enlisted in a infantry regiment at Maceió in 1902, and later became an army engineer and artillery officer after studying in Rio de Janeiro. Served under Candido Rondon expanding telegraph lines in the Amazon between 1909 and 1910. Continued to climb military ranks thereafter, including becoming an instructor at the Realengo Military Academy. Joined the side of the rebels in the 1927 revolution, he performed mainly roles related to military engineering and management, and due to the brief nature of the conflict, didn't do anything of particularly great note on that front. Still, he was one of the senior figures in the new military cabinets, and his voice is still one greatly respected among both the brass and politicians."
BRA_HORTA_BARBOSA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 8, 1881, in Pinheiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joined the army in 1897, and in that very same year fought in the so called Canudos War against the fanatics led by Antonio Conselheiro, where he was wounded. Later studied to become an officer at several schools in Rio, and during his time he partook in the anti-vaccine revolt that brought chaos to the city in  1904. He was discharged and arrested, receiving amnesty and freedom a year later. In 1906, he joined Candido Rondon and Theodore Roosvelt in the extremely dangerous expedition to the then called River of Doubt, being one of the men that made it back. Afterwards, he was one of the officers who studied foreign armed forces after the Weltkrieg, having done small missions to Germany, the United States and Britain before its fall to Syndicalism. Positioned himself as a legalist in the 1927 revolution, but he yet again received amnesty as his expertise is respected among his fellow officers. Politically, he is a die-hard positivist and has been since his formative years."
BRA_EUCLIDES_FIGUEIREDO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 12, 1883, in Rio de Janeiro, Federal District, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a Paraguayan War veteran, he was raised by his sister in his early years before joining military in 1893, studying to become an officer. He, alongside most students of the Praia Vermelha military school, revolted against the implementation of mandatory vaccination in Rio in 1904; the rebellion was crushed and the rebels arrested, with amnesty being granted a year later. After studying physics and mathematics, he, alongside other senior officers, was sent to a military mission to Germany in 1911, where he was stationed alongside prussian cavalry officers in Ohlau. After returning, he, alongside fellow officers in the mission to Germany established the Defesa Nacional magazine, which defended several modernization and reform measures for the armed forces based on the German Empire, which earned him and his associated the derogatory nickname of 'Young Turks', no doubt due to the high degree of francophillia amongst fellow officers and other members of the press. After his return, he led forces in several engagements, such as the Contestado war, the 1927 revolution, and against entrenched rebels in Rio and São Paulo in the following decade. As one of the defeated loyalists of 1927, he received amnesty and rejoined the armed forces, but was deeply disappointed in the small extent of the reforms in the military since."
BRA_CASTELO_BRANCO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 20, 1897, in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Started his officer training in the Rio Pardo Military School in the far south, and finished it in the Realengo Military Academy. After that, he became an army officer, partaking chiefly in the quelling of revolts in Minas Gerais and São Paulo until the 1927 revolution began, which thrust him into major military operations. The war allowed him to prove his worth, but due to his relatively young age, he still isn't one of the major figures in the army by any means. A staunch nationalist, he has often found himself at odds with internationalists."
BRA_GOIS_MONTEIRO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 12, 1889, in São Luís do Quitunde, Alagoas, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W A member of a prestigious and powerful family from Alagoas, to the point four of his brothers are well known officers and politicians locally. He studied in a military school in Porto Alegre, and while he was very far from home, he learned much about the inner workings of the military, and made powerful friends in the South and later in Rio. While he was a consistent legalist throughout most of his career, he, like many northeastern officers, in the end sided with the rebels, which included his southern associates. Since then his family's influence in Alagoas only grew, and he has acted politically against leftist officers intensely.  \n§YImportant Notes:§W Close political associate of Getúlio Vargas."
BRA_JOSE_CASTRO_LEITE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 5, 1871, in Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Having joined the army at a young age in 1887, José studied to become an artillery officer in his early career. He partook in the local revolt known as the Federalist Revolution in Rio Grande do Sul in the 1890s, fighting against the rebels with loyalist forces, and also against monarchist and peasant uprisings later on in a national scale. By the time of the weltkrieg, he partook in a foreign mission to study more modern military equipment, serving as an observer for the neutral nation in the conflict. As one of the main military experts on modern warfare in Brazil, he was a previous minister of war, and his expertise was put to use in the 1927 revolution and the battles in it, as he sides with his home state and the allies over the federal government. Since then, he mostly concerns himself with modernization of the army against more reactionary cliques of officers, as the political situation seems to have greatly stabilized."
BRA_TERTULIANO_POTIGUARA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 27, 1873, in Sobral, Ceará, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joined the army in 1889 and later climbed through the ranks. He had short career in politics where he ordered the suppression of various uprisings. He is known as an enforcer of the old order, indeed, his conduct in the war in Contestado, concurrent with the early Weltkrieg, was deemed nearly criminal by many, though his methods proved successful. While his legalist stance remained unchanged in 1927, he eventually abandoned the federal government at the request of fellow northeastern officers. His political views are typical for an army officer in Brazil, though it can be argued his disdain for radical movements like integralism and syndicalism stems more from an association with sedition and disorder than any deep ideological opposition. \n§YImportant Notes:§W Lost his arm in a dynamite mail-bomb attack after the turn of the century, and served briefly as a federal representative."
BRA_ESTILAC_LEAL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 6, 1893, in Rio de Janeiro, Federal District, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Enrolled in a military school in 1905, and joined it in 1912. The young officer was from the outset involved in various revolts against the old republic, and was one of the many among this newer crop of officers to defect and mutiny against the federal government in 1927. This background made his anti-authoritarian stances harden, and to some he is even considered a radical officer, as he is one of the few who agree with the mostly opposition held view that Brazil's new repulic needs still further massive changes and reforms to become a truly democratic nation. He has relatively close links with several other officers who are considered radical, but he is also a staunch nationalist even while strongly anti-authoritarian."
BRA_BERTOLDO_KILINGER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W January 1, 1884, in Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joined the Rio Pardo Military School in 1899, and completed military studies in Rio. Partook in the so-called 'Vaccine Revolt' in 1904 against mandatory vaccination of the people of Rio, and was arrested and spent a year in prison for the uprising. In 1910, Bertoldo was selected to be one of the key members in a military mission to Germany, and he stayed there until 1913, learning much about modern warfare, or at least the latest at the time, as he was stationed mostly with the 24th Artillery Regiment in Gustrow. After he returned, he and some fellow minded officers, like Euclides Figueiredo, started to publish magazines to publicly defend german-inspired modernization of the army and country, which led to the group being mockingly referred to as the ''Young Turks'' at the time. Their anti-status quo position naturally put them closer to the rebels in the 1927 revolution, but the extent of the reforms greatly disappointed Bertoldo, who still sees the military as woefully behind Germany and other world powers. He has since maintained his pro german views and his publications on military matters, and has a strong anti-syndicalist stance as well."
BRA_LUIS_CARLOS_PRESTES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W January 3, 1898, in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Graduated at the Realengo military academy in 1919, and afterwards worked as a railway engineer in the Rio district of Deodoro, but quickly was transferred to Rio Grande do Sul after an uprising against the government less than two years later. Living in a situation of quasi-exile until the civil war, he later became a extremely influential leader of the far left, constantly pushing politically for worker's legislation and such left wings causes, and partook in some tenentist revolts in his youth years, often at great cost to his prospective career as an officer. However, he is seen with immense distrust by right wing civilians and military alike due to his close links to the Internationale, including a recent trip to France and Britain. \n§YImportant Notes:§W Sometimes known by the rather lofty nickname of 'Knight of Hope' for his constant struggle in favour of the poor."
BRA_ARAKEN_OLIVEIRA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 8, 1909, in Rio de Janeiro, Federal District, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Perhaps the youngest figure of note in the interstate war, he joined the army in 1927, and one year later started his formal military education at Realengo. Still a relatively young artillery officer, his rise through the ranks has been quite rapid for the relatively meritocracy-averse Brazilian military, no doubt due to the instability in recent years. His age is also why he carries no significant baggage regarding his allegiances in the 1927 revolution, as he was but an aspiring student officer. As with most officers, he leans towards the political right wing."
BRA_MOURAO_FILHO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 9, 1900, in Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Finished military studies at the Realengo academy at Rio in 1921.  Was stationed in Santa Catarina during hostilities in 1927, and reached the rank of captain shortly thereafter. He was deeply disillusioned by the lack of immediate change, leading him to later join the integralist movement, having lent public support to some it's more radical figures. Has extensively written against 'liberal-democracy' and marxism alike, and has openly supported and advised in the establishment of integralist militias. A deeply religious and conservative man."
BRA_NELSON_MELLO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 20, 1899, in Santana do Livramento, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joined the army relatively early, and studied in the prestigious military school of Realengo, in Rio de Janeiro. Reached the rank of Captain during the war in 1927, having conspired in favour of the rebels while in Rio before joining their ranks proper, but still too young to be considered a top figure among military circles, especially among the army. Politically conservative and anti-socialist, he has personally led crackdowns against leftist uprisings in Rio de Janeiro more than three times since 1927."
BRA_MARCONDES_SALGADO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 1, 1890, in Pindamonhangaba, São Paulo, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W A member of a distinguished military family dating back to the days of independence, and one of his ancestors was reportedly one of Pedro I's companions at the moment of independence. Júlio joined the army as a cavalry soldier at age 16, and by 1912 had already reached the rank of sergeant, rank of captain by 1924, and after the conflict in 1927 had been named general. A profoundly legalist man, Júlio distinguished himself fighting against insurrections throughout his career, taking barricaded positions by storm in a revolt in Rio in 1923, and had a key role in leading the forces of the State of São Paulo during the war in 1927, where he again performed competently leading local forces, this time against the federal government. He delivered rousing speeches on how São Paulo was not revolting, but upholding republican values that were supposed to maintain the unity of Brazil, and quickly rose to be one of the most famous military men of the entire nation. He is extremely respected especially in São Paulo and among legalist circles in Brazil. While a cavalry officer by career, he is a flexible and modern commander when compared to most of his peers. \n§YImportant Notes:§W An avid sportsman, Júlio is state champion of Polo and Fencing, and an expert horse rider, winning a national title in 1928."

In an attempt to improve the livelihood of Brazilians, several moderate leaders have spent the past few years attempting to organize a broad, united left front to run for the elections and show the will of the proletariat in a democratic fashion. While the aptly named Democratic Left did have presidential candidates before 1936, those were of middling importance and appeal, and could not even gather support among major unions. It would take a major shake-up in the political landscape of the labour movement as a whole to allow the broad front to gain traction, but if such a feat could be achieved, it could be a credible threat to the predatory crony capitalists who currently hold power in Brazil.§!"

It abhors democracy on principle, seeing it as weak, and the Republic as the reason for Brazil's fall from grace. While not openly monarchical at first, few doubt this aspect of their beliefs, considering the constant anti-republican rhetoric spouted by propaganda newspapers. The AIB, by far the most important integralist movement, is actually quite homogenous in nature, with especially large portions of its electorate being of colour, and even some ''revolutionary republicans'' among its ranks.

The fall of the old party chiefs swayed the balance of power among liberals away from the traditional centres, and thus many of the notables in the party are from South or Northeastern areas of Brazil. In general, they lack the apparatus and personnel the Republicans have used to share their names and their candidates with the common folk, even if they do have many newspapers and intellectuals favouring their party.

BRA_election_year_desc:0 "Tensions rise as vastly different factions prepare for what will probably be the most violent and contentious election in the history of Brazil. Political talk is almost synonymous with heated arguments, and an air of ideological extremism looms over the nation's populace."
BRA_decentralization_desc:0 "The United States of Brazil has always prized the autonomy of its states. Each has its own president, its own political parties, and its own military, and the people have shown themselves willing to die for these regional rights. However, this does result in a very weak and toothless central government, which cannot act decisively when required."
BRA_wake_of_civil_war_desc:0 "Few wounds take longer to heal than a civil war. The War Between the States left thousands dead, and many more orphaned and homeless, as the tensions between the political oligarchies and regional identities finally boiled over to the battlefield after troops from Minas Gerais trespassed into São Paulo. Any actions the central government tries to do are now viewed with immense distrust, and the sheer damage caused on the border between Rio and São Paulo has not yet been fully been repaired."
BRA_fatherland_volunteers_desc:0 "Honouring the legacy of our army in its great history, the Fatherland Volunteers are more than a force raised from common Brazilians, but it is a symbol of their willingness to die for the nation and its freedom."
BRA_forager_idea_desc:0 "Our troops need to have the capacity to strip the land of as much resources as they possibly can, for the logistics of supplying an army in Brazil demand that level of autonomy from our soldiers."
BRA_planningspeed_desc:0 "Our officers are well capable of planning offensives in unison, and to adapt said plan to any occasion; after all, a battleplan seldom survives contact with the enemy."
BRA_we_werent_expecting_special_forces_desc:0 "The special forces of Brazil are a well trained lot, who spent years practising the art of war to defend their country against foreign invasion. Their numbers and mastery of terrain are certainly a factor to be examined by any would be invader."
BRA_state_armies_desc:0 "Brazil's armed forces are, simply put, a ragtag group of 26 state militias, a so called 'Federal Army' in Rio de Janeiro, and its navy is pretty much the only arm of the military under actual federal chafing. These archaically organized forces have immensely differing quality in both training and equipment, and are simply unsuited to modern combat in any way whatsoever, especially if required to fight for a nation they feel little allegiance to."
BRA_militiagungs_desc:0 "The militias have been properly integrated into the army of the nation as special state guard regiments, organized and equipped in a modern fashion and ready to fight and die for Brazil."
BRA_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Brazil has always been a nation of international trade, for its very name comes from its very first export, brazilwood. Our capacity to import goods is an important strategic factor, and expansion of the merchant marine is officially state sponsored."
BRA_patriotism_desc:0 "Our citizens are being slowly accustomed to the notion of a Brazil as an united country, but in time, our efforts to build an united identity will surely take root."
BRA_cangaco_is_over_desc:0 "Banditry between the states is at an all-time low, and both rural and urban population feel much safer now that criminals can't just run across state borders to avoid capture."
BRA_higher_learing_desc:0 "A great deal of funding is being diverted to increase the number of people in our country who complete college education. We hope to turn what was once a privilege into something that is accessible by all."
BRA_manter_isso_ai_viu_desc:0 "From public letters of support to shady meetings, we have spared absolutely no measure in ensuring political and economic stability. Politics is a cruel and evil game, but the consequences for losing would be chaos!"
BRA_cheap_cars_desc:0 "Thanks to generous tax breaks, our automotive industry is working with great efficiency and even greater profits, and can supply the state with all manner of vehicles for our needs."
BRA_black_monday_1_desc:0 "Black Monday's devastation upon our economy is on a colossal scale. We can do little but to weather the storm and attempt to make ends meet with our fast diminishing budget..."
BRA_black_monday_2_desc:0 "The new government has taken proper measures to deal with the crisis on our economy, and the worst is over. However, the damage is still done, an open wound on our markets, and further measures must be taken."
BRA_bigger_salaries_desc:0 "The rate of increase in salaries for state officials has been increased officially, as promised during campaign by our president. Naturally, this improves our political situation, even if at a cost."
BRA_it_prints_money_desc:0 "Excessive spending has resulted in what could be the beginning of a significant inflation problem. We should deal this problem immediately, lest we might suffer immensely under the weight of ever rising prices."
BRA_freedom_of_press_desc:0 "The right for every journalist to report on all matters is a fundamental aspect of freedom, and we will never allow that to be at risk; our anti-censorship legislation is perhaps the most robust in the western hemisphere."
BRA_freedoms_desc:0 "The rights of individuals always come before the needs of the state: The main priority of the government should be to protect their citizens rights, not treating them as tax income reserves to be drained!"
BRA_tax_breakings_desc:0 "Significant tax breaks were given to several strategic sectors, such as plantation owners, as an emergency recovery measure in the fallout of the Black Monday crisis."
BRA_salarys_marlib_desc:0 "Taking a step back and re-evaluating public salaries, we have set their raises at a much more reasonable rate, giving the budget some direly needed breathing room."
BRA_marlib_loans_desc:0 "Intense and extensive fiscal reforms have greatly improved the budgetary situation of both the government and federal units such states."
BRA_am_i_being_detained_desc:0 "Our laws have been always the cornerstone of our freedoms, and in these troubled times it is no different. We must always take the freedoms of the people above all else."
BRA_good_natives_desc:0 "The first Brazilians are protected under harsh, but fair laws, and if they wish to live in isolation from the rest of the Empire, it's well within their rights to do so. Who are we to taint their noble and pure lifestyle?"
BRA_advisory_parliament_desc:0 "The parliament now has a simple advisory role, and the word of the monarch is final and absolute, the way it was always meant to be."
BRA_anmon_gang_desc:0 "The powers of the so-called states, little more than tools of the republicans to dismantle Brazil, have been properly dealt with. Brazil is one step closer to a government that works for its people."
BRA_are_you_threatening_me_master_jedi_desc:0 "A truly organic and decentralized state, properly representing the will of the people, is now a reality, as each city has more freedom than a syndicalist slave could conceive. God has truly blessed our Empire."
BRA_blueguard_desc:0 "The Imperial Blueguards are more than resourceful and loyal; they are the first line of defence against both foreign spies and syndicalist lies."
BRA_krush_desc:0 "We have restored both the traditions and the funding of the army's cavalry corps, and now these mighty defenders of the empire have the training and equipment they always deserved."
BRA_stubborness_desc:0 "Our Empire will never fall to the dark forces that oppose us, no matter how high the cost!"
BRA_the_romena_desc:0 "A new constitution is in effect in Brazil, and is the legal basis of the New State. Pejoratively called the 'Romanian' by its opponents due to its authoritarian leanings, it's in fact far less radical that anything the Iron Guard could come up with, but is still a brazen attempt by the New State to seize utter control of the country nonetheless, with open margin for critics to be arrested for 'treason'."
BRA_voz_do_brasil_desc:0 "Na Guanabara, dezenove horas"
BRA_estado_novo_youth_desc:0 "The youth of our new state is more than ready to deal with Syndicalists and other rabble that constantly seek to sabotage Brazil's prosperity."
BRA_populsit_education_desc:0 "Since their youngest days, the new generation of Brazilians will know that the Father of the Poor saved the country from utter ruin and brought it back to greatness."
BRA_CLT_Vargas_desc:0 "The New State has always had the interest of the workers at heart, and few can claim that the new charter of worker's rights is not both fair and well overdue."
BRA_unlimited_powa_desc:0 "The New State has achieved perhaps the greatest degree of centralisation any state ever had in South American history. Vargas' personal directives may as well be laws in this new era."
BRA_anarcho_hueism_desc:0 "Brazil's unique history and culture means we can't just apply ideas thought for France and Britain, nor that we should be so rigid reading ownership of private property. Ideological orthodoxy can't get in the way of Brazilian progress!"
BRA_shrukie_state_desc:0 "While certainly a difficult process, we are spending a great deal of effort diminishing the impact of the apparatus of state on people's lives."
BRA_mst_desc:0 "Farmland has largely been redistributed to local cooperatives both owned and operated by those who toil on the land. Individuals, however, are still allowed to possess the value that they add to the land."
BRA_women_homefront_desc:0 "We must ensure that, in the event of wartime, the entire population of Brazil is ready to do its part, on and off the battlefields."
BRA_radsoc_literay_desc:0 "Grand strikes are being taken in the herculean effort that is to ensure that every Brazilian, no matter where he lives, knows how to read and write."
BRA_christian_socialism_desc:0 "Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
BRA_radsoc_literay2_desc:0 "Grand strikes are being taken in the herculean effort that is to ensure that every Brazilian, no matter where he lives, knows how to read and write."
BRA_people_militias_desc:0 "The people's militias are the descendants of the state militias of the previous republic, and deal with both law enforcement and garrisoning activities."
BRA_guns_desc:0 "The best defence against tyranny is to ensure that the people can arm themselves, as we are doing right now."
BRA_nomnom_desc:0 "Eradicating hunger will not be by any measure something we can achieve in a few years. But we are doing immense strides towards that goal, and we may in a few short decades ensure that not a single Brazilian, no matter where he hails from, spends a day of his life wanting for food."
BRA_kids_learn_materialism_desc:0 "Educating the people properly is perhaps the most important task of our state, especially the children, who must be taught from birth the values of Syndicalism."
BRA_cs_union_desc:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions is the new legislative body of the Union of Brazil, a shining example of worker's democracy for the world to see."
BRA_cs_main_legistaltive_desc:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions is the new legislative body of the Union of Brazil, a shining example of worker's democracy for the world to see."
BRA_cs_local_aswell_desc:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions is the new legislative body of the Union of Brazil, a shining example of worker's democracy for the world to see."
BRA_adults_learn_materialism_desc:0 "Our grand educational reforms now reach every level of teaching, with a new generation of intellectuals fast rising to bring us to the future."
BRA_cs_powerful_desc:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions is the new legislative body of the Union of Brazil, a shining example of worker's democracy for the world to see"
BRA_washy_washy_desc:0 "The romanticisation of poverty and living in abjectly unhygienic places is a disgusting practice. The personal wishes of individuals most not take precedence to the needs of society, especially in matters of public health."
BRA_shining_syndies_desc:0 "The Union of Brazil is the example of what a Syndicalist state should aspire to be. The chains were broken, replaced with books and bread, as the entire nation now lives an unprecedented era of peace and stability."
BRA_pray_or_gulash_desc:0 "Our clergy now fully support our new regime, for they know the alternative is to risk the souls of the people."
BRA_helpful_spies_desc:0 "Without any allegiances or ties in the country, these foreign spies are perfect for the cold and necessary work of military intelligence. Worker's solidarity does come in many forms..."
BRA_dops_desc:0 "The Department of Political and Social order makes the rounds in universities and other hotbeds of counter-revolutionary unrest, always ready to defend our grand principles."
BRA_dops_extra_harsh_desc:0 "The Department of Political and Social Order, bolstered also by a specialised counter-espioniage and intelligence department, makes the rounds in universities and other hotbeds of counter-revolutionary unrest, always ready to defend our grand principles and to prevent incidents before they happen."
BRA_pravda_desc:0 "So much of the state press is propaganda now, that few can even be sure of what is news and what is pamphleteering."
BRA_thats_racist_desc:0 "Brazil now has the most robust anti-racism legislation on the world, and spouting a slur against a fellow citizen is not something tolerable. We are all equal under God and Emperor, and to think otherwise is treason!"
BRA_the_red_army_desc:0 "The Army of the Union of Brazil has been reformed and reorganized into the pinnacle of the will of the workers for a better future: The Red Army."
BRA_industrialist_soft_approach_desc:0 "We are taking a soft approach towards the powerful industrial barons of the country."

##Focuses
BRA_archipelago:0 "Bridging the Brazilian Archipelago"
BRA_archipelago_desc:0 "To many of our military analysts and theorists, Brazil is akin to an archipelago, with cities and major centres being its islands. The vast, inaccessible unknown of the nation can greatly hinder our reaction speed to an invasion, but also may come to save it from invasion in the near future. What we need is a series of radio stations, for our army can always be ready act at a moment's notice!"
BRA_general_staff:0 "General Staff"
BRA_general_staff_desc:0 "For decades our military has been fractured among cliques and factions, weak and ineffectual. We need to bring them closer, into one, singular general staff where the defence of the homeland can be properly planned."
BRA_logistics_battalions:0 "Logistic Battalions"
BRA_logistics_battalions_desc:0 "An army is made of more than just guns and uniforms. Medics, engineers, officers and scouts are of vital importance, but their effectiveness is hindered by our sheer lack of equipment."
BRA_scouts_trackers:0 "Scouts and Trackers"
BRA_scouts_trackers_desc:0 "The treacherous terrain of our home is a blessing and a curse for our army planners; it is not that uncommon for our own forces need proper guidance from locals to navigate the lands. However, by establishing proper scouting and planning procedures, we can ensure that we always have the edge."
BRA_doctrine_mass:0 "Mass Assault"
BRA_doctrine_mass_desc:0 "Brazil may not have the most advanced equipment, or the best trained troops, but there is one thing we do have: A people that is not afraid to fight and die for their country! Our neighbours' small forces will not be able to confront the will of the people of Brazil."
BRA_not_one_step_back:0 "Not One Step Back"
BRA_not_one_step_back_desc:0 "Brazil will endure! Not one man will allow himself to be conquered by fear of the enemy, for our nation is built on the courage of every citizen and soldier. Cowards and deserters will gain something to fear, that is for sure!"
#BRA_fatherland_volunteers:0 "Fatherland Volunteers" already defined above as an idea
#BRA_fatherland_volunteers_desc:0 "Honouring the legacy of our army in its great history, the Fatherland Volunteers are more than a force raised from common Brazilians, but it is a symbol of their willingness to die for the nation and its freedom." already defined above as an idea description
BRA_forager_squads:0 "Forager Squads"
BRA_forager_squads_desc:0 "When you lead a grand army, supplies are always a colossal issue. In order to aid in that endeavour, scouts and forager battalions will be trained specifically to gather food, in addition to some survival training to our troops so they can feed off the land."
BRA_grand_battleplan:0 "Grand Battleplan"
BRA_grand_battleplan_desc:0 "Preparation is the key to success, in war and in life. If we truly are to keep our position as South America's greatest and wealthiest nation, we must prepare for war, wherever it may come from."
BRA_exercises_large:0 "Large Scale Exercises"
BRA_exercises_large_desc:0 "He who desires peace should prepare for war; and these preparations should be of the proper size and scale that our nation's defence demands."
BRA_plano_infalivel_n1936:0 "Planning Staff"
BRA_plano_infalivel_n1936_desc:0 "Our general staff will now have a hand in preparing every major operation our troops perform on the field. While some criticize this as an over-centralizing move that could potentially diminish operational autonomy, we cannot simply assume every officer knows his Grand Strategy."
BRA_macro_battlelines:0 "Strategic Battlelines"
BRA_macro_battlelines_desc:0 "The age of pitched battles is long gone; now, operations occur on a strategic level, with fronts going for hundreds of kilometres as the battlelines of war extend themselves. We must ensure that our generals can think and plan in such a scale."
BRA_united_brazilian_army:0 "Unite the Army"
BRA_united_brazilian_army_desc:0 "Our army has traditionally been more decentralized than even the state itself, with local regiments and militias operating in a nearly independent fashion from each other. The civil war broke almost any semblance of federal authority over the army, and now our forces are truly a mess of commanders and officers. Serious steps must be taken to overcome this, no matter the political cost."
BRA_southern_strongholds:0 "Southern Strongholds"
BRA_southern_strongholds_desc:0 "If all else fails, and one of our lines break, our defensive planners have a contingency. By fortifying the São Paulo and the outlying hills and areas, we can establish a perimeter around Rio and the coastline, and using the São Francisco river as the northern, natural part of the line, we can ensure that we are not caught unprepared in case initial engagements fail against Argentina."
BRA_techslot:0 "Military Science"
BRA_techslot_desc:0 "Tanks, submarines, planes, radar; the battlefield is ever changing, especially in the interesting times we live in. We must ensure that our military not only gets up to date equipment, but also that our generals and admirals can keep up with this age of ever changing warfare."
BRA_adapt_militias_into_hieracy:0 "Adapt State Militias into Hierarchy"
BRA_adapt_militias_into_hieracy_desc:0 "While heterogeneous in efficiency, our militias have the same rankings and order of battle as the regular army does. Direct integration is possible and desirable, but we have to remember many still don’t trust the Federal Government and such a move may be unpopular."
BRA_joint_planning_staff:0 "Joint Staff"
BRA_joint_planning_staff_desc:0 "Centralizing the very top of the military hierarchy should be our utmost priority in our task to unify our armed forces. This will no doubt be a complicated process, but it's a necessary one."
BRA_joint_exercises:0 "Joint Exercises"
BRA_joint_exercises_desc:0 "Not only military exercises are not common, but they also most often feature just a few members of a given state militia practising a mock war against their fellow Brazilians. To create a sense of unity, these exercises must be reorganized to more productive and realistic outcomes."
BRA_federal_intervention_corps:0 "Federal Intervention Corps"
BRA_federal_intervention_corps_desc:0 "The forces of the federal government nominally don't exist, but this could be used to justify the creation of an elite force, the Federal Intervention Corps, as a national guard doubling as special forces. Naturally, we'll need to hand pick soldiers from every state for this endeavour."
BRA_selva_forces:0 "Jungle Warfare"
BRA_selva_forces_desc:0 "The vast jungle that runs through most of our coastline has massive military implications. Its mountainous terrain is too rugged and forested for usual land combat to occur. We must train special units to properly garrison and for effective counter operations if need be."
BRA_federal_army:0 "The Federal Army"
BRA_federal_army_desc:0 "The armies of states should be abolished formally, and as soon as possible; they are nothing but a scar reminding us of troubled and uncertain times."
BRA_modern_army_corps_organization:0 "Modern Army Corps Organisation"
BRA_modern_army_corps_organization_desc:0 "More than just being centralisation for its own sake, we need to end the fragmentation of the army to build proper, modern divisions based on the great armies of Europe."
BRA_promote_military_invation:0 "Promote Innovators"
BRA_promote_military_invation_desc:0 "Traditionally, officer positions were just tools of political bargaining or for those whose families could pay for one. But innovation and forward thinking must prevail if our army is to evolve, and ensuring promotions are based on merit is always easier said than done."
BRA_stronger_together:0 "Stronger Together"
BRA_stronger_together_desc:0 "Brazil's strength lies in its unity! We have not shattered like our neighbours into squabbling warring states, but we stood firm and united against the enemies of our great nation. This principle, too, will be true for our army."
BRA_regionalist_recruiting_tactics:0 "Regionalist Recruiting Tactics"
BRA_regionalist_recruiting_tactics_desc:0 "In a country as large as ours, convincing folks to fight for far away lands can always be complex, especially for those to whom cities are an abstract context. We will make sure to adapt our recruiting and propaganda efforts to each and every region possible, and ensure every soldier knows they are fighting for their families as much as they are fighting for Brazil."
BRA_uniforms_standards:0 "Standardized Equipment"
BRA_uniforms_standards_desc:0 "From the most isolated border patrol to the garrisons in Rio, our army has equipment that can be described as shoddy at best, and useless at worst. We must spare no effort to change this situation."
BRA_better_barracks:0 "Better Military Conditions"
BRA_better_barracks_desc:0 "Our armed forces' headquarters have traditionally been not a desirable place to live; to the point where the word barracks is almost a byword to bad place in some areas of the nation. This can be explained by the simply horrid lack of funding our forces have suffered with throughout history, and only we can change that."
BRA_military_equipment_effort:0 "Military Equipment Effort"
BRA_military_equipment_effort_desc:0 "Clothes, food, shoes, guns; if an infantryman needs something, chances are Brazil cannot supply that thing properly to its soldiers. Changing this sad state of affairs, while an admirable goal, will be expensive."
BRA_brazilian_small_arms:0 "Brazilian Small Arms"
BRA_brazilian_small_arms_desc:0 "In order to properly ensure our national security, we must ensure the capacity of our nation to produce armaments here, in Brazilian factories for Brazilian soldiers."
BRA_automotive_expertise:0 "Automotive Expertise"
BRA_automotive_expertise_desc:0 "Our nation has been producing automobiles for a while now, and we have the greatest such industry in the Southern Hemisphere. However, it's important to note that thus far this expertise has not been properly capitalized on by our regular forces. It's time to change that."
BRA_armor_mechanziation:0 "Mechanisation"
BRA_armor_mechanziation_desc:0 "The concept of a fully mechanised army has been gaining strength in military circles. We can, with some help from our engineers, take the first such steps, so our military can be as up to date as possible."
BRA_tank_experiments:0 "Project Tamoio"
BRA_tank_experiments_desc:0 "The tank changed the Weltkrieg, and the face of warfare, irreversibly. We need a steady supply of a home-made tanks if we want to not be behind our rivals in matters of modern warfare."
BRA_brazilian_panzer_corps:0 "Brazilian Panzer Corps"
BRA_brazilian_panzer_corps_desc:0 "In order to properly use armour, we must not simply produce the artefacts; we also must group them in special regiments, to blast through enemy lines and bring us victory in a scale and speed hitherto unthinkable. By establishing our very own armoured corps, we will gain the edge we need in war."
BRA_heavy_weapons_guy:0 "Artillery Renewal"
BRA_heavy_weapons_guy_desc:0 "Artillery is an extremely vital part of any modern military. Our models, outdated and overused, will certainly be no match for what the world has in store for us, hence the need for bigger, better guns!"
BRA_armor_piercing_shells:0 "AT Artillery"
BRA_armor_piercing_shells_desc:0 "Considering the costs involved in building a fully mechanized army, it may well prove wise to seek to counter enemy armour in a more cost-effective fashion; by the use of much cheaper armour piercing rounds and equipment pieces."
BRA_rocket:0 "Rocketry Projects"
BRA_rocket_desc:0 "Long range rocketry is highly experimental, and as such, we expected our high command to be unmoved by the concept. However, they see the need for the capacity to strike back at our enemies in zones simply outside the reach of the air force."
BRA_renew_arsenals:0 "Renew State Arsenals"
BRA_renew_arsenals_desc:0 "While we do have several plants dedicated to production of military goods, many are more apt to produce museum replicas than proper military hardware. The need for new arsenals is urgent, we must act and quickly."
BRA_build_new_arsenals:0 "Build State Arsenals"
BRA_build_new_arsenals_desc:0 "In order to keep the ever hungry armed forces equipped with proper tools of war, we need more than renewal, we need to build many more factories and set up production chains to ensure the survival of our nation."
BRA_more_arsneal:0 "Expand State Arsenals"
BRA_more_arsneal_desc:0 "Now, our final steps towards properly addressing the state of our army equipment can be taken as we establish production lines powerful and vast enough to supply our armed forces at land and in the skies for decades to come!"
BRA_military_engineering_advancements:0 "Military Engineering Advancements"
BRA_military_engineering_advancements_desc:0 "More than just the capacity to produce equipment, we must ensure our forces can get said equipment, and that they do not lose it. Logistical concerns regarding our infrastructure must be solved as soon as possible."
BRA_needs_of_war:0 "The Needs of War"
BRA_needs_of_war_desc:0 "The need for resources is more than rhetoric, it's a fact of war. We must establish steps so that our army has all it needs, from food to cold steel."
BRA_rubber_army:0 "The Rubber Army"
BRA_rubber_army_desc:0 "Many in Brazil need jobs. Many in Brazil wish only the best for our country. Let us enlist civilians to collect rubber in the deepest jungles of Acre and Amazons, something that can greatly help our war effort, for even if we have no use for it, we can sell it to the highest bidder, for Germany's control of the Kongo and Malaya ensure a vast market is available."
BRA_lobato:0 "The Oil Wells of Lobato"
BRA_lobato_desc:0 "We found it! Finally, oil was discovered on Brazilian soil. It's going to be a costly endeavour, but the strategic value of having our very own oil wells cannot be understated."
BRA_CSI:0 "Establish the CSN"
BRA_CSI_desc:0 "The Compania Siderugica Nacional will grant us with much needed steel for our arms industry. Establishing it will require foreign expertise and a great deal of effort, however."
BRA_ram_eater:0 "Chromium Mining"
BRA_ram_eater_desc:0 "The so called chromium ore is simply untapped in Brazil, and for its reserves would require immense effort to mine for very little gain. However, the situation demands it, and we must ensure that we have these ores under our control no matter the cost."

BRA_FAB:0 "Establish the FAB"
BRA_FAB_desc:0 "The Brazilian Air Force, or FAB, must be organised as a single, centralised command structure, in order to keep the skies of Brazil safe and under her control."
BRA_lessons_civil_war:0 "Lessons of the Civil War"
BRA_lessons_civil_war_desc:0 "The limited air combat of the civil war did not give rise to aces or a developed military science on the matter, but it did create a generation of young officers who realized the immense value of air combat, and we will ensure they are prepared to lead our air force into glory in the skies."
BRA_watching_the_skies:0 "Watching the Skies"
BRA_watching_the_skies_desc:0 "We can't assume that we will control our airspace at all times, our lands are too vast and airports too scattered. To protect our cities and soldiers, we will ensure that our anti air capacity is on part to those of the most advanced systems of the sort in Europe."
BRA_fighter_planes:0 "Fighter Renewal"
BRA_fighter_planes_desc:0 "The most important aspect of aerial combat is to keep control of the skies, and make sure any of our planes is safe, and that our enemies on land are not. We will spare no effort so our fighters are the pride of the FAB."
BRA_bomber:0 "Bombing Aircraft"
BRA_bomber_desc:0 "The most important aspect of aerial combat is to damage targets on land, in order to have a tangible impact on the war on the ground. We will spare no effort so our bombers are the pride of the FAB."
BRA_cas:0 "Close Air Support"

BRA_fleet_in_being_desc:0 "We already have two capital ships and several powerful and modern ships; we not only could, but should, establish utter dominance over the South Atlantic, for even the great powers of the world do not have a presence in the region that can properly rival our might."
BRA_dockyards:0 "Dockyard Expansion"

BRA_mastery_of_the_seas:0 "Sovereign of the Seas"
BRA_mastery_of_the_seas_desc:0 "Brazil is a giant by its very nature, and our navy is supreme south of the Equator. Even the Kaiserliche Marine would be wary of the majesty and prowess of our glorious fleet, dominant over all others!"

BRA_republican_government:0 "Republicano Government"
BRA_republican_government_desc:0 "The Republican party is less of an ideological grouping and more of an odd alliance of the so-called New Oligarchy in Brazil. Farmers, industrialists, officers and intellectuals hoping to steer the nation slowly, but surely, towards the future."

BRA_preserving_our_republic_desc:0 "Many times in recent years, radical forces almost won the elections for President; such a risk cannot be ignored any longer, for our republic has shown time and again how fragile it truly can be."
BRA_grand_public_works:0 "Grand Public Works"
BRA_grand_public_works_desc:0 "In Brazil, you rule by opening roads. And other pieces of infrastructure, things that the people can see and touch; it's a natural by product of the years of empty promises faced by the people. If we want to hope for re-election, we need a grandio."

BRA_state_power_bounduaries:0 "Formalize State Power Boundaries"
BRA_state_power_bounduaries_desc:0 "States within our union still have a significant amount of attrition between them.

BRA_o_petroleo_e_nosso_desc:0 "Popular support for complete state control of oil has always been there, but it has in recent years skyrocketed to a massive public issue, especially due to the efforts of children's book author turned rabble rouser Monteiro Lobato.

BRA_left_alliance:0 "Esquerda Democrática Government"

BRA_increased_public_salaries:0 "Increase Public Salaries"
BRA_increased_public_salaries_desc:0 "Many Brazilians who work for the states have languished under below inflation raises for a long time; changing this matter would mean that they would have more money to spend, but also would give us some much-needed political support."
BRA_left_front:0 "The Left Front"
BRA_left_front_desc:0 "Our alliance's vast differences in vision for Brazil have created many discussions, and often we cannot act in unison in parliament. If we seek to change that, we must take an effort to create a proper ED charter for our Left Front."

BRA_conquest_of_the_west_desc:0 "Our infrastructure, much like our populace, is heavily concentrated in the coastline of the nation, leaving inland towns without proper connection to the world at large. Changing this would help bring development to these areas."

BRA_taming_the_sertao_desc:0 "The vast dry lands, the weary villagers, the small towns, the scorching sun. A reminder of another time, when Brazil was almost antonymous with progress. Time will wash away these images, after the trains start their routes."

BRA_liberal_alliance:0 "Liberal Government"
BRA_liberal_alliance_desc:0 "While to some a symbol of the Old Republic, the Liberals have little in common to the old marshals who ruled that. Their vision of a future based on republican and humanist ideas may not be shared by many Brazilians, but they will try to achieve it nonetheless."
BRA_press_freedom:0 "Safeguard Press Freedoms"
BRA_press_freedom_desc:0 "The right to voice your own opinions is the most basic one in a republic, and especially so when it comes to the press. From the respected newspaper to the shameless tabloid, we will pass no judgement and allow Brazilians to decide truth from forgery."
BRA_state_taxation_reform:0 "State Taxation Reforms"
BRA_state_taxation_reform_desc:0 "Too many taxes are kept at a federal level, a clear betrayal of the federal arrangement dating years now. We will ensure that each federal unity has enough income to properly sustain itself."
BRA_civil_liberties:0 "Civil Liberties"
BRA_civil_liberties_desc:0 "We must work towards protecting people's rights, for even their most basic ones were under threat from violent groups in recent years. Quasi military groups seek to undermine our basic rights, and we will not allow them to do so."
BRA_positivism:0 "Positivism"
BRA_positivism_desc:0 "Positivism was the value on which the Brazilian Republic was founded, but that was forgotten as that Old Republic became mired by greed and military ambition. We will renew our commitment to a free and sovereign Brazil that is always moving forward."

BRA_liberal_republicans:0 "Liberal Democráta Government"
BRA_liberal_republicans_desc:0 "The so-called Liberals in our nation have no idea what liberalism truly means; their simple opposing of the Republicans is their entire program. It's high time for Brazil to truly abide by the principles of a free republic."
BRA_curb_desenvolmentismo:0 "Curb Developmentalism"
BRA_curb_desenvolmentismo_desc:0 "The concept that state intervention in the economy is the key to development is a folly born of highly unusual times of global instability. The only way a nation can truly become rich is by allowing free enterprises to flourish in a proper fashion."
BRA_flexibilize_work_law:0 "Flexibilise Work Laws"
BRA_flexibilize_work_law_desc:0 "The fixed laws set by previous administrations are too strict and encourage informal employment. We should modernize and flexibilise contracts with a modern, forward looking mindset."
BRA_lower_salary_increase:0 "Lower Salary Increase Rates"
BRA_lower_salary_increase_desc:0 "Much of the total expenses of the state come from government workers, who do little work and are paid very generously for it; most of the stations are in fact gifted by politicians to their friends and favoured ones. By trimming the number of public workers and drastically cutting the rate of their salary increases, we will greatly improve our income."
BRA_gold_reserves:0 "Gold Reserves"
BRA_gold_reserves_desc:0 "In such dangerous times that we live in, the market desperately craves for safety, for something whose price is not as fluctuating as battle lines in a war. Gold is the answer, and increasing our reserves will increase our trustworthiness, both in our government and in our currency."
BRA_state_level_fiscal_responsability:0 "State Level Fiscal Responsibility"
BRA_state_level_fiscal_responsability_desc:0 "The state governments have for too long spent far more than they gain, mostly in flashy displays of power by elites in form of pointless roadworks. To improve this situation, proper legal safeguards must be put in place."

BRA_illegalize_integralism:0 "Illegalize Integralism"

BRA_the_empire_strikes_back_desc:0 "His Imperial Majesty Pedro III lies ready to receive his crown, as Brazil once again becomes what it was always meant to be, a monarchy.

The empire has come back to life, with its full power and might intact!"
BRA_one_nation:0 "One Nation"
BRA_one_nation_desc:0 "The pedantic idea of the separation of the church from temporal power is nothing but proto-syndicalist drivel.

BRA_protecting_the_first_brazilians:0 "Protect the First Brazilians"
BRA_protecting_the_first_brazilians_desc:0 "Our natives have long been under neglect of the Republic, even more than the rest of the country.

BRA_afro_religions:0 "Safeguard African Culture"
BRA_afro_religions_desc:0 "The African people of Brazil have long been ignored by the republic; an unsurprising fact, considering how it was founded and maintained by former slave owners, who resented the monarchy for ending the cruel practice. Not only their gatherings and practices will be protected, but they will be encouraged by a state which actually cares for the silent majority of Brazilians."
BRA_criminalize_racism:0 "Criminalize Racist Offences"
BRA_criminalize_racism_desc:0 "The elites of Brazil have long lived sheltered and uncaring lives, luxuriating while mocking and ridiculing the less fortunate. These vultures, not content with merely enslaving good Christians, also believe themselves cut from a better cloth than the masses. None can be more equal than others in Brazil! Those who lack basic respect will face the might of Imperial law."
BRA_healing_the_chaos:0 "Healing the Chaos"
BRA_healing_the_chaos_desc:0 "A civil war deals much more serious wounds than those in bodies and buildings. It's the idea that the person beside you might be an enemy, the division and chaos caused by the so called 'democratic process'; all evils that will not be allowed to fester in the Empire of Brazil."

BRA_christian_integral_unions:0 "Christian Trade Unions"
BRA_christian_integral_unions_desc:0 "While we have taken the much needed measures to combat Syndicalism, we should not forbid our workers to associate themselves in trade unions, for we as a society must foster good relations with our brothers of trade.

BRA_curb_state_powers:0 "Curb State Powers"
BRA_curb_state_powers_desc:0 "The states in Brazil, as they existed in the republic, were heirs of the alliance of cruel oligarchs who led the coup against the Empire. Pedro II, in his wish for harmony, did not stand his ground against them. We will not make the same mistake, and we will show these local lords the true might of the Empire!"
BRA_true_education:0 "True Education"
BRA_true_education_desc:0 "For decades, the so-called intellectuals of the Republic have been polluting school books with propaganda, fake histories, and slander against the Imperial House.

BRA_brazilian_youth:0 "Brazilian Youth League"
BRA_brazilian_youth_desc:0 "Kids these days have no sense of responsibility and duty; naturally due to all the liberal drivel taught to them at schools, and in some cases even by their parents!

BRA_true_municipalism:0 "True Municipalism"
BRA_true_municipalism_desc:0 "Brazil needs true decentralisation, and not just in trivial matters. The crux of our plan for Brazil is for every city, town and farm to protect what's theirs, and manage what's theirs, and for every Brazilian to live his life with God and his family."
BRA_imperial_blueguards:0 "Imperial Greenguards"
BRA_imperial_blueguards_desc:0 "Many of our young have been for a while helping the people through charities, soup kitchens, and dismantling syndicalist roadblocks and other rabbles. These fine young men should not only be celebrated, but their organisation will be brought closer to the state, and the Greenshirts will be truly Brazil's greatest and proudest organisation."
BRA_grant_titles:0 "Renew Title Grants"
BRA_grant_titles_desc:0 "In the time of the Empire, we had many dukes, counts and other nobles, who by their own merit acquired the titles, only for them to be abolished by jealous republicans.

BRA_sponsor_popular_festivals:0 "Sponsor Popular Festivities"
BRA_sponsor_popular_festivals_desc:0 "Brazil's people have a rich and colourful tradition of festivities and celebrations. Some, like Carnival and the festivities of Saint John, are old, while others, like the great football matches, much newer.

BRA_local_congresses_trade_unions_desc:0 "A key point of Syndicalism, and a part of what makes it a true democracy, is that it seeks to truly bring the will of everyone into motion, a state for the workers.

### Events ###
bra.1.t:0 "United States of Brazil"
bra.1.d:0 "Brazil's neutrality in the Weltkrieg kept the country at peace and with stability until the economic collapse following the crisis in its main trade partners after the British Revolution. The period of turmoil came to a head as the balance at play was put in jeopardy after both São Paulo and Minas Gerais each launched their own candidates for the 1926 elections. The stage was set for a major crisis, and thus began the Interstate War, also referred to as the Civil War. São Paulo had widespread support in its war against the federal government; especially important was that of the northern and eastern state governors led by João Pessoa, and the Rio Grande do Sul state, whose historical borderland status meant it possessed a disproportionately strong military. This support, coupled with its manufacturing and monetary advantages and the mutiny of the federal navy, resulted in the war ending in a victory for the rebels, and Fernando de Melo resigning in favour of Borges de Medeiros, who briefly ruled over the republic and transitioned into the current constitution. Ever since, the republic has transformed in many ways, especially economically, and has prospered in many ways as two presidents in a row were democratically elected. However, as the 1936 elections approach, political radicalism rises as Syndicalists, Anarchists and Integralists continue to engage in street fights and rhetoric from politicians becomes more divisive and aggressive."

After a coup d’état during the Christmas days, the radicals led by Manuel Carlés have taken control of Argentina, citing incompetence by the authorities to properly deal with what seems to be a syndicalist revolt in remote regions. Reports coming from Argentina are sketchy and often conflicting. However, it has been almost a month since then, and Brazil needs to have an official stance on the regime in the South."
bra.3.a:0 "Denounce it."
bra.3.b:0 "Support it."
bra.3.c:0 "Issue no statement."
bra.4.t:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Denouncement"
bra.4.d:0 "[From.GetAdjective] leadership has denounced our government as illegitimate, in a blatant attempt to discredit our revolution. While escalation is unlikely, this is an unprecedented breakdown in relations between the continent's two major nations."
bra.4.a:0 "Who do they think they are?"
bra.5.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Support"
bra.5.d:0 "Brazil has recognized our regime as the only legitimate government of Argentina, a move that greatly aids us in our quest for attaining standing in the international community, and shows Brazil's commitment against Syndicalism in the continent."
bra.5.a:0 "We appreciate it."
bra.6.t:0 "The Portuguese Colonial Fair"
bra.6.d:0 "The Kingdom of Portugal has opened a colonial fair in Rio de Janeiro, to celebrate the bonds between Brazil and Portugal. While some leftists claim it is a shameless propaganda move by the colonialist state, Portuguese officials insist that the exhibition is purely scientific in nature, and seeks to educate the people on Portugal's mission to civilize the dark continent, by comparing its colonies to those under German rule with great frequency. Said frequent comparisons have drawn the ire of the German ambassador to Brazil, as he claims they are 'slanderous claims on governor Goering's upstanding character'. Regardless of the political controversies, the many trinkets, objects and even African kings brought are bound to bring people in large numbers to see the fair's many curiosities."
bra.6.a:0 "Grand!"
bra.7.t:0 "New Guns Reach the Barracks"
bra.7.d:0 "After a long time without new batches of equipment, new boots and other kinds of supplies started reaching the barracks in the last few years, improving the soldier's lives. However, the new guns acquired by the state have been the most recent happening, and they are a noticeably popular success among foot soldiers; reliable and accurate when compared to the old guns, often from the past century, used in some areas. This will certainly improve the opinion of the infantry regarding our state."
bra.7.a:0 "They do like their new toys..."
bra.8.t:0 "Manuel Bandeira publishes 'Estrela da Manhã'"
bra.8.d:0 "Renowned poet Manuel Bandeira has published yet another book, 'Estrela da Manhã', which is also bound to be acclaimed by the public. Known for his modernist and innovative style, the author has frequently gone against the current of 'well organized' poetry, especially in recent years. Having arrived back in Brazil after years in Europe at the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, his work gradually became more heterodox in each book, with subjects of poems often mixing comedic, deathly or even vulgar tones, and this drift towards modernism is very well shown in his most recent book. While praise is almost universal in more modern literary circles, some intellectuals like Plinio Salgado slammed the poet as cheap and nonsensically anti-Christian."
bra.8.a:0 "Grand!"
bra.9.t:0 "Syndicalist Strikes in São Paulo"
bra.9.d:0 "While protests and workers' movement gatherings in general are not at all an uncommon sight on May 1st, the strikes currently ongoing in São Paulo are noteworthy due to the very large number of workers who have laid down their tools. They are now, after some time of normal striking, preparing to barricade certain areas of the city, knowing full well the consequences of this action. Little option remains to the state police than to crackdown on these vile insurgents."
bra.9.a:0 "Send in the police!"
bra.10.t:0 "Strikes End Violently"
bra.10.d:0 "The strikers put up a fight, and rather than running, they stood their ground against the state police of São Paulo. A grave mistake, and even some deaths have been recorded by journalists, with the numbers tallied by leftists greatly differing from the official statistics of less than half a dozen casualties. This incident, colloquially called 'Battle of the Barricade' is likely to have a lasting legacy in the memory of the city."
bra.10.a:0 "Regrettable, but unavoidable."
bra.11.t:0 "Getúlio Vargas Courts State Leaders"
bra.11.d:0 "Getúlio Vargas, state president of Rio Grande do Sul and former Vice President in the JP Government, has met with several important figures from other states, especially those from the northeast that backed him in his term. He seems to be laying the groundwork for a candidacy for the presidency, and his plans for a more active government which can energetically act against crisis situations have found listeners in the meeting."
bra.11.a:0 "The Republican candidate seems to be here."
bra.12.t:0 "Vargas Announced as Republican Candidate"
bra.12.d:0 "Getúlio Vargas's career seems to have always be heading towards this. From his early positions in Rio Grande do Sul, to a successful state presidency in times of turmoil to being Vice President of the most popular head of state in Brazilian history, his rise has been very fast for the traditionally slow climb politics in Brazil entails. He announced his intentions to run for president officially earlier today in Porto Alegre, to a roaring crowd of citizens who wish for the republic to finally achieve stability, and are tired of opportunists attempting to deceive them. Among his promised goals is a planned industrialisation program, better salaries for workers and bringing Brazil 'to the modern age'."
bra.12.a:0 "A popular and safe choice."
bra.13.t:0 "Gustavo Dodt Barroso meets with Pedro de Bragança"
bra.13.d:0 "Gustavo Dodt Barroso, a chief integralist figure and an army officer, met today with the Imperial claimant to the throne of Brazil, Pedro of the house of Bragança. While their meeting was publicly regarding donations to poor neighbourhoods in cities near Rio, the fact is that they are likely making plans for an eventual Integralist electoral victory. Integralism in Brazil is highly influenced by Portugal, even if being an openly monarchist party is technically illegal, and thus the meeting stirred up much controversy, for it is proof for many of the AIB's true allegiance. Integralist leadership seems to be uniting and preparing in a way until now unprecedented, and only time will tell if these manoeuvres will result in anything major."
bra.13.a:0 "If this isn't Monarchism, I don't know what is."
bra.14.t:0 "AIB's Presidential Candidates Announced"
bra.14.d:0 "The Brazilian Integralist movement is eclectic in nature, but recent years have settled it as a monarchist, Lusitanian inspired party that defends Catholic values and with great participation from the poor, especially from the Afro-Brazilians. Said participation and commitment to racial equality is represented by their former candidate to the presidency, and current VP nominee Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, a deeply monarchist intellectual who denounces the leaders of the republic as former slave lords, who just mask themselves under new guises. However, the presidency candidate, Gustavo Dodt Barroso, is far more hostile and has not been shy in demonstrating his anti-Semitism, claiming the capitalist classes of Brazil are puppets of the Elders of Zion. The men have fundamentally different visions in many areas, but they agree on the basic Integralist principles and more importantly, on that the Republic is a rotten carcass that only serves the few and the powerful."
bra.14.a:0 "Two very different men under one cause."
bra.15.t:0 "Anarchist Uprising"
bra.15.d:0 "In Rio, consequences of the Battle of São Paulo were felt this week as an Anarchist uprising occurred in the northern areas of the federal district. While few in number, having an actively lawless area so near the capital could be dangerous, and thus our officers are taking immediate action."
bra.15.a:0 "Send in the boys in blue."
bra.16.t:0 "ED Names Mangabeira as their Candidate"
bra.16.d:0 "The Democratic Left is very much a broad front, formed by people that range from former Republicans, frustrated with the lack of aid to the common people, to syndicalists who seek to gain power via democratic methods. This big tent organisation of the party made choosing a presidential candidate difficult, even if it wasn't a particularly contentious process. João Mangabeira is probably more well known for being the left-wing brother of president Mangabeira than his own career, but this recognition may very well be his greatest asset in what is probably going to be a complicated electoral process. The nomination is just the beginning of his journey, for he needs to properly build a left front with several factions, such as with unions and the FAB."
bra.16.a:0 "A consensus choice."
bra.17.t:0 "Mangabeira Courts the CGT"
bra.17.d:0 "The Confederação Geral do Trabalho, or CGT, has gained notoriety in the past decade for organizing strikes, including being a major part of the May strikes earlier this year. Perhaps the most well organized and influential leftist organisation in the country, it's natural that João Mangabeira and his allies in the Left Front have spared little time in bringing them under the ED umbrella. While many in the CGT have their reservations on working with someone who is clearly less radical than themselves, the idea of peaceful transition to a worker's government has grown in some circles, especially after the violent repression of several strikes recently."
bra.17.a:0 "The left organizes itself..."
bra.18.t:0 "Mangabeira Meets with FAB Leaders"
bra.18.d:0 "While the meeting of the Democratic Left leader and the Anarchist federation was mostly fruitless when it comes to formal support, it's clear that the man made some influential friends in that section of the left wing. The FAB is, unsurprisingly for an Anarchist organisation, very decentralized, and the meeting was mostly on topics of worker's rights and payments, rather than formal coalition talks. However, it's safe to assume most leftists in Brazil are indeed under the ED's tent, even if not all are formally or publicly doing so."
bra.18.a:0 "Anarchists in a government coalition? As if."
bra.19.t:0 "Mangabeira Reaffirms Moderate Stances"
bra.19.d:0 "João Mangabeira, leader of the ED, has met with certain 'unsavoury and socialistic' people, as the O Globo newspaper put it, causing concerns he is in fact a Syndicalist, and seeks to destroy democracy in Brazil and raise a worker's republic in its place. Naturally, it's an exaggeration, but the effect of this red scare was significant enough for Mangabeira to publicly say that he, in fact, is not a Syndicalist in any way, and mention that European Syndicalism is 'not an example to be followed', citing the civil war in Italy as a warning to the consequences of extremism. His words fall flat on those convinced he is a spy sent by London to take over Brazil, a rumour already being spread by Integralist pamphleteering."
bra.19.a:0 "Many remain concerned, however..."
bra.20.t:0 "PL Announces Júlio Prestes as Candidate"
bra.20.d:0 "The Liberal Party is, much like the Republicans, more a confederacy of local parties rather than an organisation with single goals and ideals. The most influential liberal leaders, the Positivist leadership from São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, have met today and decided for Júlio Prestes to be their nominee for the presidency, something of a consensus candidate among the homogenous party lines. While the odds may not look particularly good for a Liberal victory at first glance, the controversial opinions of the other candidates may drift the more centrist electorate towards their coalition."
bra.20.a:0 "A natural choice."
bra.21.t:0 "Barroso and dos Santos Fund Festival in São Paulo"
bra.21.d:0 "The AIB has funded and organized a festival in São Paulo, with musicians, speeches and plenty of free food and drinks. The show, which pretty much celebrates their victory months before the election, had speeches from basically every Integralist of note, bishops and even the Imperial claimant to the throne, in what was an unprecedented act in recent political history. Journalists called the event ''Bread and Circus'' and mocked the largely uneducated crowd that gathered, but there is no doubt the AIB is sure of their victory."
bra.21.a:0 "Is that even legal?"
bra.22.t:0 "Vargas Takes Shot at 'Utopian Fools'"
bra.22.d:0 "Getúlio Vargas, as he makes speeches throughout the country, used his speech today in Juíz de Fora to denounce what he calls 'Utopian Populism', and blamed the unrest that plagues Brazil on said foolish ideals. Vargas claims that they want the quick, fast and painless way out of the troubles of the country, but put the people into sleep with golden promises, only to rob them in their sleep of their freedoms; and some other, less friendly analogies. The frankness and language of the speech captivated the audience, and recordings of it are being transmitted via radio already in some major cities."
bra.22.a:0 "Is this for the best?"
bra.23.t:0 "Anarchists Support the ED Candidacy"
bra.23.d:0 "While the FAB has simply no way of actually endorsing a candidate, leading members of it, such as Edgard Leuenroth, have expressed that the ED candidacy is the best for the people of Brazil. Such endorsements are bound to pull many workers who were on the fence to their camp."
bra.23.a:0 "Do they, now?"
bra.24.t:0 "Arms Smugglers Captured!"
bra.24.d:0 "Several unsavoury individuals were captured today, trying to smuggle arms from Rio Grande do Sul to Argentina. The guns seem to be of German origin, and they did fall directly under our lap... however, they are of uncertain origin and may very likely be stolen or have been already paid for. What should we do with the rather large amount of cargo?"

bra.25.a:0 "A minor inconvenience."
bra.26.t:0 "Luis Carlos Prestes Endorses the ED"
bra.26.d:0 "Luis Carlos Prestes, a high profile military officer with known Syndicalist tendencies, has publicly announced his support for the ED movement, as he sees it as the only option that will truly defend the workers from tyranny. This move certainly can do more harm than good for the ED, for Prestes is notorious for his links with the Third Internationale."

bra.27.d:0 "Disaster! Brazil faces ruin! No amount of panic would be too much, for the crashing of German economy cascades into our agriculture and nascent industry like a train into cattle. There is little we can do than to watch the disaster unfold, as our budget collapses almost overnight, our currency loses half its value and millions in investments are cancelled and pulled out of the country. We don't even have the funds to pay vital government personnel as the situation stands now! Decades of planning, of prosperity, all gone to waste...?"

bra.28.t:0 "Return of the Coffee Fires"
bra.28.d:0 "Just like in the past decade, our coffee piles up with nobody to buy it. The solution found by state governments is to burn the surplus of the harvests in large fires, to keep the prices from utterly and completely collapsing again. This is certainly an extreme measure, but Black Monday's disastrous impact is far from over; dark times are ahead."
bra.28.a:0 "Burn baby, burn!"
bra.29.t:0 "Factories Close Down"
bra.29.d:0 "As Black Monday damaged the purchasing power for non essential goods for most Brazilians, many factories close down as their goods have no market, and they are forced to face massive losses. A disastrous setback to our plans of developing our industry, and we may take years to properly recover."

bra.30.t:0 "Industrial Leaders Meet with Vargas"
bra.30.d:0 "Several important industrialist leaders have met with Getúlio Vargas today in São Paulo, as he negotiates for formal support to his candidacy, claiming only he has the vision to help them.

bra.31.t:0 "The Steel Cycle"
bra.31.d:0 "As Brazil's economy evolved in history, its main exports changed; from the redwood that gives the nation its name to the coffee of the modern day. However, as we industrialise and modernize, a new era rises: The time of steel; when we no longer need to export basic good to import manufactured goods. This fundamental shift will be without a doubt the greatest legacy of our state."

Polling stations countrywide face never before seen lines, as pamphlets and criers ask for votes across the nation. Four very different visions for the country clash, in ideas, and in some places, like in São Paulo, literally, as the now semi-regular clashes between Unions and Integralists dominate the news for the day, at least until the results start to come in.

bra.107.t:0 "Syndicalists Flee the Country"
bra.107.d:0 "It seems that our plans regarding Syndicalists were 'leaked' to the common public, and hundreds of syndicalist intellectuals and students have fled the country via various methods in the past month. Our forces are spread thin maintaining order, and thus they were able to escape unharmed, but they should know Brazil now belongs to God, not Marx."

In a traditional Jewish neighbourhood in Porto Alegre, quite near the city's centre, a synagogue was burnt down by a group of arsonists last night, who then bragged about how they would 'cleanse' the city from their trickery and deceit. However, the vast majority of citizens, and of Integralists, were appalled by the act, that is a tangible show of the great rift between the Anti Semites and Integralists in current AIB politics. In the end, this could be the catalyst incident that decides whether such views will prosper or not in the new Brazil"

bra.112.d:0 "Despite official condemnation, and help of the Church to the Jewish community, Gustavo Dodt Barroso furiously defended the arsonists, saying that they were doing the obvious and the best for Brazil. His popularity and political situation dwindling, he was requested by the Emperor to retire from the position of Prime Minister to avoid further embarrassment to the throne from his anti Semitic ravings."

bra.114.d:0 "Prince Antônio Gastão of Braganza, last living son of Empress Isabel, now heads to visit the French Government, currently in exile in Algiers. Being a descendant of Bourbon royalty, he was denied the right to fight for France, his adoptive hope, in the Weltkrieg, and thus joined the British forces in that conflict until its bitter end. While the trip is going to be just a little bit of sight seeing, and meeting some members of the Bourbon family, the matter is being well document in papers locally."

bra.116.d:0 "Prince Imperial of Brazil Antônio Gastão visited [Root.GetNameDef] today, and his trip was quite the pleasant one. Few foreign dignitaries can claim to have fought alongside us in the Weltkrieg; the then exiled prince, denied from joining the French forces due to a law preventing Bourbon royals from doing so, found a loophole and joined the British forces to fight for his adoptive home. Now an old and warm fellow, he takes upon himself the role of diplomat for his nephew, the Emperor of Brazil, and brought gifts and foodstuffs from that land. Wasn't that nice of him?"
bra.116.a:0 "A true warrior!"
bra.117.t:0 "The Basis of Restoration"
bra.117.d:0 "As we endeavour towards restoring the monarchy as an institution and the Empire as a whole, a first principle must be recognized: The restoration has legal basis. The will of the people brought the AIB into power, and the army had no mandate from the masses to depose His Imperial Majesty in 1889. We are, simply, righting a wrong that should have never happened. However, such a matter is easier said than done; Republican lies were spread far wide, our loyalists hunted down and our legacy tarnished. The quest to bring Brazil back to its glory begins now."

After their defeat in the general elections, several factions blamed each other for their failure to achieve the presidency even in the wake of a major recession; their biggest opportunity in a decade to take power, perhaps even ever.

bra.227.t:0 "The CSN: Where?"
bra.227.d:0 "Our new steel industry's location may very well affect how the people see it; especially in a nation as decentralized as Brazil. But the political advantages also have to be weighted towards practical advantages; we could make use of our existing industry in São Paulo, use the steel directly on Rio's dockyards, leave it at the disposal of the Third Army Headquarters at Porto Alegre, or use the opportunity to foster development in Salvador da Bahia."

bra.228.t:0 "The CSN: How?"
bra.228.d:0 "We must also prioritize how we will develop the company. While its initial goal always was to simply produce steel, we can also opt to diversify our plans to include other kinds of industries under this direct program, granting us other benefits and bring us closer to true independence from foreign economies. However, the focused approach will mean the state will have better access to weapons grade quality Steel, an important strategic aspect to consider."

bra.230.t:0 "Benefits from the CSN Investment"
bra.230.d:0 "It has taken some time, but we're reaping rewards from our investment in the CSN in cold, hard cash. While the ideal of an industrialised Brazil is grand, we need to be able to afford it, and thankfully the CSN has been incredibly profitable."

bra.250.t:0 "Workers Protest Republican Dominance"
bra.250.d:0 "A strike of several categories, such as industrialists, has occurred in Rio today, organized by the CGT. Their main complaint was the 'lack of democracy' in Brazil, and how utter Republican dominance seems to be in all aspects of public life. It's regrettable that some people are such sore losers, really; this is not what democratic elections are meant to be like."

bra.251.d:0 "Monteiro Lobato, a known publisher of children's books who also dabbles on politics, has slammed our leadership on not taking the matter of petrol seriously. To him. we should make finding and extracting oil in large amounts a priority of the state, for that resource is incredibly strategic and will be of immense value to the nation.

bra.256.d:0 "After a meeting with several officers, Vargas decided to increase army funding for the next year. It seemed like a spontaneous reaction seeing the sorry state of the barracks in Rio, but the law was seemingly passed too quickly for it to truly be a coincidence..."
bra.256.a:0 "To what end?"
bra.257.t:0 "Vargas Probes State Presidents"
bra.257.d:0 "Getúlio continues to articulate heavily behind the scenes for some unseen goal. Today, he met with several notable state presidents, seemingly to discuss internal policies. However, the goal of the meeting behind closed doors can only be guessed, and the press speculates that further centralizing efforts will be under way shortly."
bra.257.a:0 "Natural for a man of his position."
bra.258.t:0 "Vargas Meets with Union Leaders"
bra.258.d:0 "In a somewhat unusual move, Getúlio Vargas has met with several union leaders, including some affiliated to the CGT, and promised to greatly improve their working conditions and public salaries if he is able to. He had little reason to make the speech, much less his promises, considering his position; the stunt has greatly helped his already substantial popularity."

bra.259.d:0 "Whatever may be the reason, Vargas's series of meetings have culminated today with top army leaders, and some navy ones as well. Several hours passed in the closed doors meeting; the official topic was to prepare the nation in case of an attack from 'hostile forces'."

bra.260.t:0 "Revising the Federative Pact"
bra.260.d:0 "Brazil has for too long lagged behind, in no small part due to the overly decentralized nature of its state. Other democracies lack the structural weakness Brazil has, and Vargas has tirelessly worked to dismantle this sad status quo and unite Brazil as one country once and for all. Opposition rallies against him, but the move has support from the lower classes and the pressure is mounting on the aftermath of Black Monday, and as war and tensions rise all over the world, the need for Brazil to be decisive in its actions is evident"

bra.261.t:0 "Vargas Expands Powers of the President"
bra.261.d:0 "What once seemed odd, now make sense; almost every move from Vargas in the last three years was towards this moment. Brazil's senate is all that stands between Vargas and complete power; the proposal to expand the powers of the president is as brazen as it is all encompassing, gathering criticism from the press and many intellectuals. However, in Rio and many other places, the common people are in favour of a more modern government, for the people and by the people, not shackled by oligarchies. Truly an ironic situation, for a decade ago, a much less contentious move resulted in a war between the states. But Vargas planned well, and it seems that little can stand in the way of his plans..."

bra.262.t:0 "A New Era Dawns: The New State"
bra.262.d:0 "With his expanded powers approved and covered by the law, many saw this as a brazen attempt to become a dictator. Certain elements of the military attempted to apprehend the president, and they were quickly repelled and order was restored in the capital. While some opponents also claim this coup attempt was fabricated, it remains no doubt that Vargas is the most powerful man in Brazil since the days of the Empire, and that his vision for Brazil has been influenced by many foreign thinkers; some of his new proposals for the constitution have been derogatorily called 'Romanian', as a reference to the notoriously authoritarian Eastern European regime. These opinions matter little to Vargas and his legions of supporters, as Brazil's reformation into a brand new state is complete.. and perhaps irreversible."
bra.262.a:0 "Everything is proceeding as planned."
bra.300.t:0 "Constitutionalist Revolt!"
bra.300.d:0 "Every single Paulista voted against the new presidential powers, believing them to be another attempt to subjugate the states to Rio. Protests immediately took over the state, with personalities across the political spectrum protesting against the new regime... and some paid the ultimate price. The so called PPC movement, named with the initials of the first three victims, now organizes militias across the state, as the oligarchies and syndicates prepare for a war that they see as the last chance for a free Brazil. Calls for aid have been sent to other states, just like in 1927... but no aid has arrived yet, and we should strike at these traitors before that happens!"

bra.303.a:0 "Excellent!"
bra.304.t:0 "Ban the Democratic Left?"
bra.304.d:0 "The Democratic Left, also known as the Social Democrats colloquially, has for too long opposed us for enacting the very same policies they once defended. Such hypocrisy has a simple explanation: They have always been agents of London, attempting to turn our country into a syndicalist colony! Thankfully, we now have the legal means to ban their foul party and to foil their schemes."

bra.305.b:0 "It's too expensive."
bra.306.t:0 "Buying Heavy Weaponry"

Vargas' immense popularity all but secures a victory, and he certainly has planned well for the occasion. His opposition, rallied around the Liberal Party, reunited under a common ticket.. has no real chance.

Vargas' immense popularity all but secures a victory, and he certainly has planned well for the occasion. His opposition, rallied around the Liberal Party, again united under a common ticket.. has no real chance. Their votes will be systematically burnt, or miscounted, and the press' calls for free elections were quickly dismissed as the same feeble excuses from the last election, and turnout was even smaller from the opposition this time."

bra.352.t:0 "Thirst for Rubber"
bra.352.d:0 "The world demand for rubber skyrockets as the shadows of war covers the lands of Europe. With the most significant rubber reserves spoken for in the hands of European colonial powers, a grand opportunity arises to fill their place and supply the war rubber needed for conflict... if we can collect it in large enough amounts. A planned expansion of the rubber plantations in Acre will surely be a quick and certain way to bolster war profits."

In time, all of the nation will see the praise in this letter, which was published in the O Globo newspaper this morning, praising our economic policy."
bra.353.a:0 "We are doing it right."
bra.354.t:0 "Developmentalists Protest"
bra.354.d:0 "Naturally, breaking pre-established concepts is a divisive move. The so called development brought by artificial state meddling in the economy is seen as a good thing by the uneducated masses of Brazil, who protested in large numbers against what they call 'selling out to foreigners'. The march attracted many opposition figures as well, as the hot political issue of the day was to spout nonsense about things that folk could not understand."

bra.355.a:0 "Excellent."
bra.356.t:0 "Surge of Republican Popularity"
bra.356.d:0 "Our measures have been proven unpopular enough that a massive surge in Republican party membership is visible, both in protests and in the press. Millions listen to the siren's call of state capitalism, but we must stand fast in our mission to improve Brazil's budgetary situation, no matter the cost."
bra.356.a:0 "Such is life in a free democracy."
bra.400.t:0 "Press Wars"
bra.400.d:0 "While a politically charged press is nothing new, especially in the tumultuous world we live in, what is new the campaign of assault and smear led by Republicans against our government. Citing 'anonymous tips' and working of baseless assumptions, they claim that our government works for big business, not the people, and seeks to shackle us diplomatically to foreign powers as a 'colony all but in name'. While the evidence is clearly not enough, it's enough that we are forced to publish rebuttals in other newspapers, and go down to their level, exposing the deals Republicans have done through the years. We have reached a new low point in political discourse in this country."
bra.400.a:0 "Now that’s just slander!"
bra.401.t:0 "Positivist Propaganda"
bra.401.d:0 "Positivism has been the founding precept of our republic. Our flag, and our motto, and the actions of the presidents who had Brazil in their hearts. Brazil marches towards the future, towards freedom from the shackles of ignorance, of poverty, of religion, pressing ever forward, following the march of history. It's long past time we renew these ideas we once held so close."

But there is a future for Brazil, one that shines brighter than ever before."
bra.402.a:0 "As it should!"
bra.403.t:0 "Borges Triumphs in the South"
bra.403.d:0 "Our party's strength in many ways depends on the influence of our local parties in the states of the union. Thus, Borges de Medeiros's victory in Rio Grande do Sul is vital in the grand scheme of things, for he has been an influential opponent of the Republican government throughout the years, and has great political capital within that state; which is all so vital due to its strategic position and very high militarisation. We can only hope that other states of great importance come to the fold in the near future."
bra.403.a:0 "Good for all!"
bra.450.t:0 "Power and Responsibility"
bra.450.d:0 "Our victory in the elections could not have been achieved without the crucial help of the workers of this great nation, who supported us every step of the way. However, said support also gave rise to rumours and panic of a syndicalist take over... our promises were many to the unions and other workers, but we should consider the stability of the nation and our government as well, for we could do no good if we enraged the military and were ousted from power..."
bra.450.a:0 "Try to focus on stability."

bra.451.t:0 "New Worker's Legislation"
bra.451.d:0 "Our states will now have to abide to worker's legislations that are both modern and just, an example scarcely seen around the world. Many rights once considered dreams by Brazilian workers, such as paid vacations, are a few bureaucratic issues away from reaching realisation. Truly we have accomplished our mission; but more challenges lay ahead for Brazil!"
bra.451.a:0 "A grand achievement!"
bra.452.t:0 "Naval Officers Attempt Revolt!"
bra.452.d:0 "Accusing our government of being syndicalist spies, many sailors have risen up in a revolt today in Rio de Janeiro. We managed to prevent them from taking over important ships, but we still had no choice but to suppress the violent revolt with a show of force. A regrettable loss of experienced manpower, no doubt, but also a warning of how we walk on the edge of a knife; our actions have consequences that we can only hope to predict."
bra.452.a:0 "Regrettable."
bra.453.t:0 "Mangabeira Reaffirms his Goals"
bra.453.d:0 "João's presidency has been one of recovery and development, with its main goal of reforming worker's legislation successfully achieved. In a speech today at the Catete, he not only proudly claimed his mission to be accomplished, but also reinstated his vision for a free and democratic Brazil, without hunger, without inequality, and one that does now bow to foreign powers."
bra.453.a:0 "We will prevail!"
bra.454.t:0 "Increased Syndicalist Support"
bra.454.d:0 "Our government's achievements have been piggybacked by many worker's organisations that supported us throughout the years, including the CGT, whose membership and support has greatly increased since we reformed worker's legislation. While it's daft at best to assume that they were responsible for such improvement, the people have difficulty knowing that."
bra.454.a:0 "Naturally."
bra.455.t:0 "Increase Salaries?"
bra.455.d:0 "While we have increased the growth of public salaries very recently, we did not increase their current value, infuriating certain sections of our government's base, such as the CGT and radical leftist deputies and senators. While an immediate increase could in theory be done, it would certainly damage our budget a great deal, so it's not something we should consider doing lightly."
bra.455.a:0 "That's quite excessive."
bra.455.b:0 "Do it."
bra.456.t:0 "The Chilean Crisis"
bra.456.d:0 "We have never officially broken relations with Chile after the Syndicalist revolution, and many times have members from that government visited us. Today, an unknown person in Chilean politics, Mr. Labarca, visited the Catete and was welcomed by president Mangabeira, something that caused nothing less than a panic in the nation. The idea of a known syndicalist radical meeting with the president is seen as both absurd and borderline treason, and many military officers, and the press, issued statements that more read like ultimatums to our government than anything. If we fold to their demands, we will be arresting an innocent man and falling out of favour with any leftists in our nation and abroad; the opposite is true if we do not, but the danger of civil war looms on the horizon. A decision must be taken immediately."
bra.456.a:0 "Arrest him!"
bra.456.b:0 "A fellow champion of the workers who doesn’t wish us harm."
bra.457.t:0 "Coup Attempt!"
bra.457.d:0 "The army would have no more! After the government's refusal of their demands, they prepare to assault the presidential palace and end our government by force! The so called Chilean Crisis has escalated in ways we could never have foreseen, and some already suggest the president to step down to avoid bloodshed. However, if we stand our ground, sympathetic elements in the army will surely side with us and we can in theory resist. Brazil stands at a crossroads in history, and the decision of our head of state will determine its future..."
bra.457.a:0 "They shall not pass!"
bra.457.b:0 "Do not resist...Brazil is liberated from Syndicalism!"
bra.458.t:0 "Syndicalist Counter Coup!"
bra.458.d:0 "Foul traitors have seized the presidential palace! After arresting President Mangabeira and declaring in a pronunciamento that they would not step down, the reactionary officers clearly miscalculated their strength in Rio, especially in terms of manpower. Leftist military men, worker's militia, anarchists and students, led by Isidoro Dias Lopes and Luis Carlos Prestes, not to mention civilian leaders, successfully seized barracks and the palace after a day of intense conflict... While the future is certainly uncertain, there is little doubt that Brazil's capitalists overplayed their hand, and accelerated the arrival of the revolution!"
bra.458.a:0 "Brazil is Liberated from Capitalism!"
bra.459.t:0 "Order Restored!"
bra.459.d:0 "As we refused to step down, the barracks fell into chaos. The unexpected response resulted in mutinies, for a coup would not only be illegal, but dangerous considering the large amount of leftist and liberal forces who would surely oppose any kind of military takeover. As the crisis faded and we gathered our wits, our stand surely seems wise in hindsight, but one cannot help but wonder the great tragedy and loss of life that was so narrowly avoided..."
bra.459.a:0 "Thankfully."
bra.500.t:0 "The First Congress of Trade Unions"
bra.500.d:0 "As we purged Brazil of its capitalistic junta, we now have to decide on our new leadership. Many local syndicalists already were based in Rio for political reasons, but the decision on how Brazil will head towards socialism is now up in the air, to be decided by the first congress of trade unions. Three main ideological factions arose in the small time we had to ponder and debate. The Orthodox Syndicalists are, as the name suggest, the ones that are attuned to foreign intellectuals and European syndicalism, while the Autonomists see the European governments as excessively large and centralized, and claim that Brazil is simply too large and varied to be administrated in such a way. The third faction, the Maximalists, are a minority by a large margin, but their loud cries for action and strong leadership resonate with some leaders. No matter who walks off this first congress in power, this choice is an irreversible one for the path that our nation must take in following decades, and thus many debates are being held, even as forces outside the state seek to push for counter-revolution."

We will now ensure prosperity and peace for Brazil, for the workers, by the workers!"

bra.502.t:0 "Provincial Revolts"
bra.502.d:0 "The bourgeoisie have risen in revolt against our new union, led by provincial leaders who are terrified of losing their power. It was naive to think the transition could possibly be peaceful, but we must resist and press on for the sake of the workers in these states."

However, our new government just so happens to be similar to that of Germany's great enemies, and these ignorant rural folks are naturally scared and upset. Opportunist leadership has them in open revolt, and it will be some time until we can send a force to restore order in these German-speaking villages and towns."
bra.508.a:0 "Regrettable."
bra.509.t:0 "Divided Clergy"
bra.509.d:0 "It's no simple matter to be a man of God today. As we have continuously moved away from state Catholicism, many Christians in Brazil feel that our government is atheist, while others praise its work for the poor. The division is palpable, exacerbated by the tense political situation in Italy. We do not have the capacity or the mandate to end such strife inside the Church, but we can hope that the biggest faith in the country comes around and sees the good we do."

bra.510.t:0 "Italians confront each other"
bra.510.d:0 "Italians in Brazil arrived here in the 1800s, as landowners sought cheap labour for their plantations after the abolition of slavery. They still kept arriving in large numbers, and it's without a doubt the largest immigrant community along with the Germans and Japanese. However, the Italian Civil War left scars on the people, who lost their homeland to war, and ideological allegiances to the Italian Social Republic were kept hidden until our proclamation of the Union of Brazil. Hiding turned into gloating, and then confrontations and angry mobs fight people they once saw as brothers for coming from the same place."

bra.517.d:0 "Stripping lands from capitalists was the easy part; now we should strive to redistribute the lands in a fair manner. The farm owners should get a share, naturally, as should farmhands, but how to deal with those in the cities who requested land is a complicated matter that requires much study and consideration for individual cases. Thankfully, the rebels recently crushed were mostly backed by landowners, who we can reasonably strip lands from to attend the demands of these peoples; it's fair to asses that they lost the right to work due to their treason."

While few can say for sure what happened behind closed doors to warrant such a fallout, rumours spread; anything from a lover to disputes regarding work hours could have potentially caused the rift, but it was almost certainly something that has been a long time coming, especially now that they do not have a common goal of toppling the republic to unite them."

One such leader is the young Djalma, whose constant campaigning and activism made him the face of Brazil's new youth.

His position was so weak afterwards, he was not even a factor in the first congress of trade unions, and mostly retired from public life. He, however, announces his return to it now, in what some may say is a controversial move. Time will tell what kind of motivation he has to emerge after so long again."

While doing so without much support when it comes to political articulation, her impromptu candidacy has already highlighted her charisma and willingness to lead, and many leaders once thought spoken for voiced their support for her.

To those who see the military as the guardians of democracy, and that demand more aggressive measures in foreign and internal policy, a candidate catering to their needs is now running for chairman. Heavily influenced by European Syndicalists, Prestes does not take lightly to what he calls ''intellectual dishonesty'' in heterodox measures and the slow reformation of Brazil into a proper syndicalist country. His rhetoric found ears in many of the common people, and he seems to be the current frontrunner."

bra.606.d:0 "To many, the modernist avantgarde of Brazil are the intellectual and spiritual heart of the revolution; and to an even bigger number of people, the aggressive rhetoric pushed by Prestes' candidacy is simply too orthodox and European to ever truly consider the issues Brazil faces. While many candidates were spoken of during meetings of these anti-militarist syndicalist cliques, perhaps comes to the people as a surprise that not only their candidate for chairman is in fact a young woman, Patricia Rehder Galvão, who was always at the front lines of both intellectual pursuits and activism, being arrested multiple times in the last few years of the republic. While it's not likely for her to snag a victory from clear frontrunner Prestes, her fiery ambition surely seems to have captivated those around her."

While the end of their marriage was, to put it lightly, somewhat contentious, in recent years the pair had something for a detenté, mostly due to the large number of friends in common both had inside and outside the party.

In a symbolic and meaningful gesture, most union leaders in that state have met and launched Otto Ohlweiler to represent them on the chairman elections, what they call an 'autonomist' front seeking less centralisation by the union with a much stronger anarchist ideological backing. Time will tell if this candidacy is merely a show of unity, or if it's really an important step in Brazil's history."

Known for his modernist and innovative style, the author has frequently gone against the current of 'well organized' poetry, especially in recent years. Having arrived back in Brazil after years in Europe at the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, his work gradually became more heterodox in each book, with subjects of poems often mixing comedic, deathly or even vulgar tones, and this drift towards modernism is very well shown in his most recent book. While praise is almost universal in more modern literary circles, some intellectuals like Plinio Salgado slammed the poet as cheap and overly cynical."

Carlos Drummond de Andrade is no different, and his newest book seeks to capture the insecurity and danger the world at large feels as it's surrounded and engulfed by war in a brutal scale never before seen. While the theme is certainly one of reflection of the times we live on, it cannot be classified as a manifesto or as a political publication; rather, its poems show a window to the thoughts and feelings of man in such troubling times."

The book not only refutes the supposed 'inferiority' of Brazil due to miscegenation, but also lauds how the Brazilian people inherited the best of its many peoples; Indians, Moors, Blacks, and Europeans have lived side by side and created a Brazilian race that is among the best on this planet."

The opening match, in Rio, will be between Brazil and Hungary."
bra.710.a:0 "Good luck!"
bra.712.t.uruguay:0 "Uruguay Wins World Cup!"
bra.712.d.uruguay:0 "Predictably, Uruguay has stormed though the opposition and gained its 5th Championship Title, and second World Cup title. The Celeste Olimpica defeated hosts Brazil 2-0 in the final of the record setting tournament. While being a strong team and host nation, Uruguay's experienced and talented squad managed to resist Brazil's valiant efforts and win with a goal in each half, and their great skill was recognized by the crowd."
bra.712.t.brazil:0 "Brazil Wins World Cup!"
bra.712.d.brazil:0 "The crowd goes wild in Brazil as the host nations upset the world of Football! Uruguay's reign lasted since before the first world cup, and it seemed to be continuing as they were up 1-0 at half time in the final against the hosts. However, Brazil's pressure resulted in 2 goals in the second half, and Batatais, the goalkeeper from local club Fluminense SC, held his ground against the Uruguayan counter offensive. History was made and now two nations can claim the title of world champion!"
bra.712.t.austria:0 "Austria Wins World Cup!"
bra.712.d.austria:0 "Edged by Germany in 1934, the Austrian team came to Uruguay as not even a favourite, but comes home as World Champions. The fast football of the Austrians managed to defeat powerhouses like Brazil, Uruguay and most notably Hungary, in a rough match that required a replay after tense 0-0. History was made and now two nations can claim the title of world champion!"
bra.712.t.hungary:0 "Hungary Wins World Cup!"
bra.712.d.hungary:0 "An impressive and unparalleled achievement was conquered by Hungary, as they are the first European nation to win the World Cup! After a shocking win against the host Brazil in the opening match, the Magyar team quickly became the host nation's favourite team due to their incredible skill. The so-called Magical Magyars made history, after beating Argentina in the Semi Finals and Uruguay in the final. With a score line of 3-2, what is to many the greatest match in football so far ended Uruguayan hegemony. History was made and now two nations can claim the title of world champion!"
bra.712.t.germany:0 "Germany Wins World Cup!"
bra.712.d.germany:0 "The Kronprinz can truly rejoice, for what was once considered a pipe dream is now a reality; Germany won the World Cup! Few could have predicted this outcome, especially after the defeat at home in 1934, but finally the Kaiserreich has won where it truly matters: football! The tense final with Uruguay ended 1-1, and a miraculous extra time goal by Josef Gauchel sealed the outcome as the crowd celebrated the underdogs. History was made and now two nations can claim the title of world champion!"
bra.712.t.chile:0 "Chile Wins World Cup!"
bra.712.d.chile:0 "Chile's road to the World Championship was a difficult one, for their bracket included an early confrontation with Uruguay right at the first game. After their shocking win, the team took off and was not stopped even by the host in the final. While naturally mired by some political controversy, history was made and now two nations can claim the title of world champion!"
bra.712.t.argentina:0 "Argentina Wins World Cup!"
bra.712.d.argentina:0 "In an incredible surprise, Argentina has claimed the title of World Champion! In a campaign that was in many ways impressive, Argentina managed to finally get their revenge for the final in 1930, and defeated Uruguay. However, the hardest game was the semifinal against Brazil, an incredibly tense 1-0. History was made and now two nations can claim the title of world champion!"
bra.712.a:0 "Hurrah! We are victorious!"
bra.712.b:0 "We congratulate the winners."
bra.713.t:0 "Tenentist Uprising Quashed"
bra.713.d:0 "After several days of discontent, the barracks in Porto Alegre have risen in revolt, and were severely punished for their treason. A regrettable symptom of the trying times we live in."
bra.713.a:0 "A minor inconvenience."
bra.714.t:0 "Tenentist Uprisings Quashed"
bra.714.d:0 "More barracks have risen up in revolt, this time in Salvador. The local garrison demanded fairer prices and a better democracy, but said vague demands were silenced by loyalists who stormed their barricaded living quarters."
bra.715.t:0 "Major Tenentist Uprising Quashed"
bra.715.d:0 "In Rio, São Paulo and several other cities, what seems to have been a coordinated revolt happened. However, the truth is different, and almost every mutineer had a different vision for Brazil and its future; even if most leaned slightly left in Rio itself, shaping public opinion on the uprising to be Syndicalist in nature. Regardless of their motives, the revolt quickly collapsed upon itself at the lightest of resistance from loyalists, but its impact shows immense fragility in our government both at home and abroad."
bra.715.a:0 "Regrettable."
bra.716.t:0 "Another Tenentist Uprising Quashed"
bra.716.d:0 "Yet another uprising in the barracks! While their demands were similar in nature to the previous ones, this time we managed to destroy the revolt in a relatively swift and decisive fashion."
bra.716.a:0 "Alright, that's enough now."

bra.717.d:0 "Representatives from the [From.GetAdjective] government met with [Root.GetAdjective] officials today, making an official request to ally with [Root.GetNameDef]. While far off, they are a nation of no small means, and could possibly be of use to [Root.GetAdjective] war efforts."
bra.717.a:0 "Of course!"
bra.717.b:0 "No, we've no wish to involve ourselves in their conflicts."
bra.718.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"

bra.718.a:0 "Ready the armies!"
bra.719.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
bra.719.d:0 "Inexplicably, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our petition, apparently deciding that [Root.GetNameDef] in their alliance is more trouble than it's worth."
bra.719.a:0 "Too bad."
bra.750.t:0 "The Imperial Coronation"
bra.750.d:0 "As we make our final preparations to restore the empire, some within our ranks still support the claim of the Petrópolis branch over the Vassouras line led by Dom Henrique. Dom Gastão has made his rival claim to the throne apparent, despite his father's renunciation of said title over three decades ago. Both sides hold a convincing argument over who should become the emperor, but it is Barroso who has the final say."
bra.750.a:0 "Viva Dom Pedro Henrique!"
bra.750.b:0 "Viva Dom Pedro Gastão!"
bra.751.t:0 "Brazilian Volunteers and Equipment Arrive"
bra.751.d:0 "[BRA.GetNameDefCap] has sent us volunteers and equipment to aid in our war."
bra.751.a:0 "Excellent."
bra.752.t:0 "The End of the War in Portugal"
bra.752.d:0 "For good or ill, the war in Portugal is now over and our surviving volunteers have returned to [Root.GetNameDef]. The general staff reports that they learned many valuable lessons regarding the nature of modern warfare over the course of the conflict."
bra.752.a:0 "Great!"
bra.753.t:0 "Mission from [BRA.GetNameDef]"
bra.753.d:0 "[BRA.GetNameDefCap] has sent several ambassadors to us, requesting much closer ties with that nation. While the aid would most certainly be welcome, their second intentions of simply gaining influence and power in Africa are quite clear. Should we accept?"
bra.753.a:0 "Of course!"
bra.753.b:0 "No, we are not interested in more colonizers."
bra.754.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
bra.754.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to our generous offer for a treaty of peace and amity! We rejoice at their wisdom, and so will the people in [From.GetNameDef], for this will be the first step in it's new and bright future."
bra.754.a:0 "Excellent."
bra.755.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
bra.755.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused our treaty of friendship, condemning hundreds of thousands to barbarism. A decision that we can only hope they don’t deeply regret."
bra.755.a:0 "Damn."
bra.756.t:0 "The Brazilian Demands"
bra.756.d:0 "Brazil has sent what can pretty much be interpreted as a thinly veiled ultimatum to surrender diplomatic independence from them. While it's far from being a sensible request, Brazil's Emperor is almost certain to not take a refusal lightly... Our forces stand ready to defend us, but the choice ultimately falls to the president. What should we do?"
bra.756.a:0 "It seems we have no choice but to agree."
bra.756.b:0 "Never! Let them come, if they dare!"
bra.757.t:0 "[PAR.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
bra.757.d:0 "Paraguay, certainly aware of the consequences of defying Brazil now, has gracefully accepted our terms. They will be protected and guarded, and never again be led astray by madmen"
bra.757.a:0 "Excellent."
bra.758.t:0 "[PAR.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
bra.758.d:0 "Paraguay's deluded leadership has declared war! Lusting to conquer Brazil in the name of their insane ambitions of grandiose conquest, Paraguay has formally declared war on us, justifying said declaration on a fake ultimatum! The demands are cartoonishly brazen, and were quickly debunked by the press. Now the Empire has a awoken, and we teach them a lesson that they won't forget!"
bra.758.a:0 "This time, we'll cut them down to the last!"
bra.759.t:0 "Investment from [BRA.GetNameDef]"
bra.759.d:0 "Brazil has decided it would be wise to improve the situation in the kingdom. Thus, we will seek to make the most use their generous aid"
bra.759.a:0 "We are grateful."
bra.760.t:0 "The Brazilian Demands"
bra.760.d:0 "Ever since the Empire of Brazil was proclaimed, few doubted they would try again to seek supremacy in the continent. Now, after months of tense diplomacy, Brazil used a few criminals crossing the border as an excuse for an ultimatum: Uruguay is to surrender its diplomatic independence and allow use of all its ports and roads to the Empire of Brazil. The intent is obviously to turn our nation into a puppet state, and to start to exert control over the River Plate; not to mention the aggressive and coercive tone in the ultimatum. However, the Empire's power far dwarfs ours, or that of our possible allies in an eventual war; some say that accepting is the only way of saving Uruguay from a lost war and annexation."
bra.761.t:0 "[URG.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
bra.761.d:0 "Uruguay, realizing that the alternative was to become an Imperial province, has surrendered use of all its ports and roads to the Brazilian Army, and recognized our protection on all diplomatic matters; they are safely under our wing and the River Plate is secured."
bra.761.a:0 "Excellent."
bra.762.t:0 "[URG.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
bra.762.d:0 "The Cisplatine dogs have refused our generous offer of autonomy... They will be punished"
bra.762.a:0 "Then war it is!"

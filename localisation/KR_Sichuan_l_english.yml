Whilst Tang Jiyao’s invasion failed and the officers were driven into hiding as a weakened guerilla force, their radical political legacy still endures.\n\nAmong those who rallied under Tang’s banner were numerous Kuomintang generals, chief among them Lu Chao, who sought to bring peace and stability to Sichuan in the form of implementing Sun Yat Sen’s famous three revolutionary principles. Whilst Lu Chao may have alienated many of his colleagues, thanks to his political ambitions and leftist beliefs, he has gained a sizable following among younger, more radical recruits, who have eagerly flocked to his vision to destroy the warlordism and corruption that has plagued Sichuan for decades.§!"

Whilst Tang Jiyao’s invasion failed and the officers were driven into hiding as a weakened guerilla force, their radical political legacy still endures.\n\nOne of Tang’s personally handpicked leaders for the Officer Department was an old colleague, Xiong Kewu, a former governor of the province who had administered it during the Xinhai Revolution. Xiong and Tang shared many political principles, most notably in regards to Federalism, but Xiong had an independent streak and desired to run the Officer Department himself, free of the Yunnan Clique’s heavy handed political influence. He eventually worked to organize an independent base of power, joining forces with old friends and enemies, such as Lu Chao and other senior officers to operate free of Tang’s meddling.§!"

Although they are considered politically liberal and fiscally responsible, the Baoding Department has earned a reputation for favouritism and nepotism, as well as frequently interfering with Yang Sen’s government. Liu Wenhui, the uncle of the infamous Industrial Corps leader Liu Xiang, perhaps best embodies the liberal politics of these senior generals, with his laissez-faire approach to governance, he has conceded much ideological ground to the well-educated and well-meaning progressives in his department, as long as he can maintain his hold over Sichuan’s opium production and foreign policy. Although this has led to some radical reforms, some believe Wenhui’s greed and ambition ultimately hinders Sichuan's potential.§!"

Although they are considered politically liberal and fiscally responsible, the Baoding Department has earned a reputation for favouritism and nepotism, as well as frequently interfering with Yang Sen’s government. Deng Xihou’s faction within the Baoding Department is quite idealistic and believes in implementing genuine reforms, unlike some of his more pragmatic peers which merely pay lip service to these ideals. Deng’s name is almost synonymous with fiscal responsibility thanks to his “Model Province Project”. To implement these impressive reforms he has built up extensives connections in the Sichuan, allowing him to greatly influence the government’s military as well as economic developments.§!"
SZC_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "Wuxì"
SZC_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Wubèi Xì\n§LArms Department§!\n§gThe Armament Department enjoyed a half decade of prestige after Yang Sen was recognized as the legitimate ruler of Sichuan by the Zhili Clique, but the bold and cunning general slowly witnessed his grip slip away. The Yunnan Clique’s invasion of his province was the last straw which corroded his authority, putting much of Sichuan back in the hands of warlords and radicals. The Armament Department was forced to adapt to these disastrous circumstances and reluctantly invited several of these key warlords to join the government.\n\nYang since then strove to rebuild his authority over Sichuan, but faced great resistance from the newly emboldened warlords, as well as opportunists within his own clique such as the Confucian general Liu Cunhou and the leader of the bandit suppression army, Tian Songyao. Much of the department doubts if Yang can maintain this morebund, decentralized government much longer. His generals eagerly hope he will at last reign in the warlords, or finally give up and make way for a more aggressive leader like Cunhou. Without a firebrand like him to egg them on however, the generals may very well fall back in line behind Yang.§!"
SZC_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Gōngtuán"
SZC_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Gōngyè Tuán\n§LIndustrial Corps§!\n§gThe enormous army of the Industrial Corps, led by Chongqing warlord Liu Xiang, is frequently derided by Zhili Loyalists and progressive officers as nothing more than a host of bandits. Whilst it is true that his oversized military favours quantity over quality and has certain moral failures, the Industrial Corps have accomplished great things thanks to their raw manpower and their intense firepower. The fact that Xiang has managed to keep his hold over south-eastern Sichuan as well keep his countless men paid and fed is testament to this fact.\n\nAfter being passed up for governorship of Sichuan and left bereft of any recognition from the Zhili Clique he had once so loyally served, Liu Xiang turned his attention towards taking what he declared was rightfully his, now by force and cunning. He has pushed for genuine modernisation and economic reforms, caring little for short term profits from bandit and opium selling when there is so much more up for grab, should the Industrial Corps successfully expand their influence over Sichuan. These aggressive policies mean Xiang’s army and his reforms both rely on raw momentum, a single mislaid plan or an unexpected roadblock in his path could grind his ambitions to a halt.§!"

SZC_national_populist_party_long:0 "Yīguàndào\n§LConsistent Way§!\n§gThe Yiguandao Cult has over recent years maintained contact with a handful of pockets of convinced adherents situated in the province of Sichuan. Most of these communities are grouped around isolated villages, or part of military hosts belonging to particularly zealous and fanatical generals. As such they are difficult for the Great Master to directly influence, but they nonetheless remain a great symbol for Zhang Tianran’s pan-national ambitions of elevating China spiritually as well as materially out of its century of humiliation and infighting.§!"

SZC_Liu_Cunhou_party_long:"Wubèi Xì\n§LArms Department§!\n§gIn the wake of Yang Sen’s sudden, unfortunate death, coupled with the rapid disintegration of the Armament Department’s political rivals, a massive power vacuum emerged in Sichuan Province. The position of leadership was swiftly filled by a popular, charismatic figure among the Armament Department’s generals, the zealous Confucian and chaotic rabble rouser Liu Cunhou.\n\nLiu has in many ways turned Sichuan’s greatest weakness, its factional disputes and decentralized government, into his own greatest strength. By bribing, threatening, extorting and executing those generals who have questioned his authority, he has filled much of the province with loyal yes men and greedy opportunists, who will gladly manage their own fiefs and maximize the province’s overall profit through completely unscrupulous measures. Whilst this chaotic confederation of warlords is functioning for the moment, some of Liu’s colleagues quietly doubt if it can hold on for the foreseeable future. However few dare to bring this up to his face and none have ever done so twice."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_SZC_YANG_SEN_DESC:0 "After joined the army in 1904, Yang Sen had his first brushes with politics when he joined the Tongmenghui Society while attending the Sichuan Education Hall in 1906. After graduating in 1908 he went on to serve in the Newly Created Army of the Qing Empire until 1911. His background and connections allowed him to gain prominence when the Xinhai Revolution occurred. While serving under Cai E, he was eventually promoted to the rank of general in 1921 and posted in Chongqing. This pattern of rising in the ranks through political ties and maneuvering more than military accomplishments went on when Yang Sen became an ally of Wu Peifu in 1925. When the Zhili became the dominant clique in the fully restored Qing Empire, Yang Sen was elevated to governorship of Sichuan.\n\nAs governor of Sichuan, Yang Sen stands out from other warlords with his platform of rapid modernization both in the social and economic spheres, spearheaded with various infrastructure and educational projects that have improved the lives for many in Sichuan. While he is a competent enough military leader, the fact that Yang Sen owes much of his success to dealmaking and supporting the right people at the right time has put him and the Armament Department in a precarious position. His position is further undermined by his own lifestyle contradicting what he claims to be best for Sichuan, which has limited his public support. For instance, he would earn the ire of more conservative elements of Sichuan by speaking out against traditional roles for women and practices such as foot binding, and would then squander any goodwill he might have gotten from reformists by having eight concubines of his own and as many as thirty children between them.\n\nDespite his many imperfections, he's managed to hold on to power thus far with enough support both from the army and common folk to be a force to be reckoned with. And as long as he's in charge, the Zhili will have a reliable ally in Chengdu."

POLITICS_SZC_LIU_CUNHOU_DESC:0 "The son of wealthy salt merchants, Liu Cunhou is more of a brutish bandit than a strategist, let alone a governor. He attended Sichuan's military academy in 1903, went on to study in Japan in 1907, and returned to Sichuan after Graduating in 1908. He made a name for himself during the Xinhai Revolution where he initially led smaller anti-bandit forces and went on to lead larger forces as his loyalty earned him the trust of his superiors. During the conflicts he participated in, however, his forces were often more concerned with extorting wealth from the locals than functioning as a proper military force. While his soldiers often behaved like bandits, he's managed to strong-arm himself into a position of relative power in Sichuan in the process, though he's hardly endeared himself to the people.\n\nDuring the Sichuanese civil war, Liu Cunhou hardly contributed to the Armament Department's breakthroughs, though his forces were plentiful enough to exploit the ones that were created during the conflict. As he was mostly experienced in anti-banditry operations, his forces spent most of the war flushing out Kuomintang loyalists and mopping up routed remnants of the Industrial Corps. Thanks to this, his forces were left in a relatively unscathed state compared to the rest of the Armament Department, eventually allowing him to outmaneuver his supposed ally Yang Sen once the dust of the war had settled.\n\nHis reign as a governor of Sichuan would end up being little more than his de-facto banditry on a larger scale. Imposing countless of taxes upon the people and using his army to extort the rich and poor of Sichuan alike, he quickly grew to become a hated tyrant that chiefly managed to maintain power through violent repression and shameless bribery."

POLITICS_SZC_LIU_XIANG_DESC:0 "Liu Xiang initially rose to prominence in 1920 when he helped lead Sichuan's forces to a victory over Yunnan. He rose through the ranks and would eventually lead a large contingent of Sichuanese forces against the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition. During this conflict he managed to gain a reputation as a skilled, albeit reckless, commander with numerous victories to his name. Once the Northern Expedition had been soundly defeated, he returned to Sichuan and was assigned to Chongqing as the head of the city's garrison.\n\nWhile his performance during this conflict allowed him to establish his own clique and remain a force to be reckoned with within Sichuan, he was never granted the governorship of the province that he felt that he deserved. Instead, he was made a subordinate to Yang Sen, a loyal stooge of Wu Peifu and the Zhili. Liu Xiang saw this as an insult and petty cronyism. As a result, he began to harbor a deep resentment towards both the Zhili and their puppets in the Armament Department.\n\nThis resentment eventually led to him seizing the moment after the collapse of the Qing hegemony in the early days of 1936. After successfully rallying his subordinates in the Industrial Corps against Yang Sen, Liu Xiang managed to claim Chengdu for himself and defeat both the Armament and Baoding departments through a series of daring military gambles during the Sichuanese Civil War. After making himself the governor of Sichuan and moving the province's capital from Chengdu to the industrial powerhouse of Chongqing, he set out to rapidly modernize the region, hoping to eventually settle his scores with the Zhili."

POLITICS_SZC_DENG_XIHOU_DESC:0 "Deng joined the army in 1906 and went on to enroll in the Baoding Academy, though he would later discontinue his studies to return to Sichuan when the Xinhai Revolution occurred. Deng went on to rise through the ranks over the years until he was promoted to general in 1923. Having been more active behind a desk than on the various battlefields during this turbulent time in China earned him a reputation as a trustworthy and competent careerist, though he hardly earned much fame and fortune in the process. While he was respected among his colleagues from the Baoding Department, he would eventually go on to be subordinated to Yang Sen as the Zhili Clique favoured the Armament Department over the Baoding Department.\n\nDespite not having the favour of the Zhili, the Baoding Department managed to cooperate with the Armament Department, putting them in a position where they were able to fill the vacuum in Sichuan left by the eventual collapse of Yang Sen's clique in the Sichuanese Civil War of 1936. As the most prominent figure in the more traditionalist side of the Baoding Clique, his reforms focus on rural development and improving the lot of the farmers of Sichuan. His widespread support in the countryside and the army combined with the broader support earned by his diarchy partner Liu Wenhui has put the Baoding Department in a position of political flexibility rarely seen among China's warlord cliques. He aims to turn Sichuan into a model province for the rest of China, generally putting the well-being of Sichuan's people ahead of ideology or lofty expansionist ambitions."

POLITICS_SZC_LIU_WENHUI_DESC:0 "A lifelong military man, Liu Wenhui has been in the army since he was thirteen. He graduated from the Sichuanese Military Academy in 1911, enrolled into the Baoding department in 1914, and went on to graduate from it in 1916. While he owes a lot of his success and influence through nepotism and convenient connections, he's nonetheless managed to become a respected and influential figure within the clique. After the end of the Northern Expedition, Wenhui went on to side fully with Deng Xihou and would go on to become one of the clique's more notorious members.\n\nAfter the defeat of his nephew Liu Xiang in the Sichuanese Civil War, the Baoding department ascended to power. His friendship with Deng Xihou earned him a position of leadership with what has become the country's diarchy where he - in stark contrast to his nephew - represents a more reformist branch within the diarchy. Popular within the military and the more urban administrative class, he's allowed the department to broaden its support far beyond the conservative constituents that Xihou appeals to. While he's unlikely to make it into the history books as one of China's greatest military leaders, as long as the cooperation between the two friends in the diarchies continues he's sure to be remembered for his stalwart efforts to rapidly modernize Sichuan and improve the lot of the province's citizens."

POLITICS_SZC_YANG_SEN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 20th, 1884\nGuang'an, Sichuan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nYang Sen joined the army in 1904 and attended Sichuan's military academy which he graduated from in 1908. Afterwards, he served in the Qing New Army until 1911. His background and education allowed him to rise to prominence in Sichuan's military clique when the Xinhai Revolution began the same year. During this period Yang served under general Cai E, who also promoted him to become one of Sichuan's generals in 1921. After being posted to command the forces of Chongqing, Yang Sen would go on feud with the province's other warlords, most notably Xiong Kewu and Liu Xiang. Despite his attempts to undermine his opposition, he was never fully successful.\n\nHis position as military governor of Sichuan has far more to do with his ties to Wu Peifu and the Zhili clique than any military accomplishments. That being said, he's hardly an inept military leader either by any stretch of the imagination, having performed adequately in prior wars and maintained the Armament Department's prominence in Sichuan throughout his time as governor."

POLITICS_SZC_LIU_CUNHOU_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n 1884\nSichuan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLiu Cunhou was enrolled into the Sichuanese Military Academy in 1903. He went on to study at the Japanese Imperial Army Academy in 1907 and had graduated by 1908, after which he returned to China. His military career began in proper during the Xinhai Revolution when he was first promoted to Lieutenant-General by the Beiyang commanders. He went on to lead a series of anti-bandit raids and would earn the trust of his superiors, enough so that he'd eventually go on to lead provisional armies. It is, however, speculated that this had less to do with his abilities as a commander and was rather a question of him seeming loyal in a time of conflict and chaos.\n\nWhile he was able to successfully pacify bandits and earn the trust of his superiors, he earned nothing but disdain from the locals as his armies would behave no better than the bandits they were supposed to fight. Wherever his forces went, they would effectively run a protection racket against the locals. Greedy and less concern with discipline than military doctrine, he's held in poor regard by most of his peers and was seen as a man largely devoid of military acumen through most of his career. Be that as it may, he was still the epitome of a ruthless warlord and managed to amass wealth and a powerbase to be reckoned with.\n\nHe was eventually subordinated to Yang Sen and tasked with maintaining order in the north of the country. His previous loyalty to the Zhili has earned him a high position within the Armament Department despite his spotty military record."

POLITICS_SZC_LIU_XIANG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n July 1st, 1888\nSichuan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAfter graduating from the Sichuanese Military College in 1909, Liu Xiang went on to rise in the ranks of the army until he became Sichuan's army chief in 1919. When the war between Sichuan and Yunnan broke out in 1920 Xiang earned his first military successes by pushing back the invading warlord forces. When the war ended in 1921, he was assigned to lead the Chongqing garrison. During this time, he established himself as a force to be reckoned with and built up considerable influence in Sichuan's industrial heartland.\n\nWhen the Kuomintang launched the Northern Expedition Liu Xiang led his forces against them. During this war he earned a reputation as a bold commander through a string of defensive battles and sometimes reckless counter-offensives. When the Kuomintang were defeated he returned returned to Sichuan where he was subordinated under Yang Sen, now the governor of Sichuan. Although he saw this as an insult, he still retained a sizeable force that remained loyal to him. Thanks in no small part to his successes in putting down the Northern Expedition, he's a respected military commander and a powerful warlord in his own right."

POLITICS_SZC_DENG_XIHOU_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1889\nSichuan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAfter joining the army in 1906 Deng was admitted to the Sichuanese Military academy. After graduating in 1909 he enrolled into the Baoding Academy. After the Xinhai Revolution, Deng discontinued his studies and returned to Sichuan to continue his military service there instead. After the Republic of China was established Deng joined the Sichuan Fourth Division under Liu Cunhou. Deng successively held the post of adjutant and went on to rise through the ranks to become a battalion commander by 1916, the commander of the Fifth Brigade in 1917 and an independent brigade commander by February 1918. From 1920 to 1923 Deng participated in various battles in Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan and performed well enough to become the commander of the Third Division. In December of the same year, the Beijing government established by the Zhili clique had him promoted to the rank of general. He would maintain this rank after being subordinated to Yang Sen when he was made the military governor of Sichuan.\n\nDeng is a careerist through-and-through, with a service record that had more stationings, transfers and promotions than actual battles by the time he became the most prominent figure among Sichuan's Baoding graduates. While no one disputes that he's competent at what he does, his experience in the past has been far more theoretical than practical compared to his more battle-hardened peers."

POLITICS_SZC_LIU_WENHUI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1895\nDayi County, Sichuan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLiu Wenhui has been in the army his whole life thanks to his brother enrolling him into the Sichuanese Army Academy in 1911. It's fitting in a sense as most of his subsequent advancements in life were either thanks to nepotism through his brother Liu Wencai or his nephew Liu Xiang, or the result of connections to a clique such in the case of his ties to the Baoding Military Academy where he enrolled in 1914. Although he's admittedly been a devoted and dedicated military man since his graduation from the Baoding Military Academy in 1916, his track record leaves a lot to be desired. Most notably, it was under his watch, parts of western Xikang were lost to Tibet. Despite the fact that his early military record leaves much to be desired, his connections within the Baoding Department and relative popularity in the cities has made him a force to be reckoned with."

SZC_Labour_Relief:0 "Labour Relief"
SZC_Labour_Relief_desc:0 "There isn't enough food to go around, so those that can must work to earn their rations.

SZC_Allocate_More_Government_Funds:0 "Allocate More Government Funds"

SZC_Subsidise_Food_Production_desc:0 "Sichuan has plenty of farmers, but since most of them don't earn enough to rely on anything but the weather and antiquated methods the specter of a new famine looms with every drought.

SZC_Enact_Price_Controls:0 "Enact Price Controls"
SZC_Enact_Price_Controls_desc:0 "When the famine broke out many merchants started to hoard grain and rice while charging extortionate fees for these goods. The state, backed by the army if need be, will make sure no one profiteers from the misery of our people by enacting price controls."

Sichuan_Opium_Monopoly_decisions:0 "Sales Monopoly Bureau"
Sichuan_Opium_Monopoly_decisions_desc:0 "The opium situation is beyond our control at this point and we're in no position to completely rid ourselves from it.

SZC_Buy_Out_Merchants:0 "Buy Out Merchants"
SZC_Buy_Out_Merchants_desc:0 "Sometimes the best way to deal with the competition is to simply buy it out. While a costly investment for the state to make, in due time these costs to our state coffers should be paid back through the profits we’ll make."

SZC_Tax_Harvesting_Scheme_desc:0 "In order to increase revenues to fund our government plans, we can devote extra resources to local administrators and help their efforts to collect the taxes - old, current and new - owed to us and squeeze out every penny from those that thought they were above the law. It'll be unpopular, but it's for the good of Sichuan."
SZC_Transit_Tariffs:0 "Transit Tariffs"

SZC_Uncontested_Monopoly:0 "Uncontested Monopoly"
SZC_Uncontested_Monopoly_desc:0 "There is no more opium market in Sichuan, only a state monopoly that the criminals and smugglers can’t touch. If they aren’t directly under our control, they’re de facto so through our regulations and taxes.

SZC_Combat_Corruption:0 "Combat Corruption"
SZC_Combat_Corruption_desc:0 "Our efforts to maintain market control are hampered by some of our officials taking bribes in order to turn a blind eye to the non-sanctioned opium businesses. By removing them, there’ll be fewer cracks for the non-state actors to slip through."
SZC_Combat_Smuggling:0 "Combat Smuggling"
SZC_Combat_Smuggling_desc:0 "By diverting our army to patrol the roads and rivers of the country we'll be able to greatly hinder the smugglers cutting into the state’s monopoly. Gradually, this will drive them out of business."

Sichuan_Opium_Removal_decisions:0 "Opium Prohibition Committee"
Sichuan_Opium_Removal_decisions_desc:0 "Since the Treaty of Tianjin was imposed upon is, the opium trade has ravaged China and brought despair to millions of Chinese.

SZC_Promote_Crop_Production:0 "Promote Crop Production"

SZC_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns:0 "Anti-Corruption Campaigns"
SZC_Anti_Corruption_Campaigns_desc:0 "Our efforts in containing the spread of opium are greatly hindered by corrupt officials and civil servants that take bribes, embezzle funds and ignore the law when convenient.

SZC_Purge_The_Administration:0 "Purge the Administration"
SZC_Purge_The_Administration_desc:0 "Drastic times call for drastic measures and we presently have too many weasels in our midst that profiteer from our people's hardships.

Sichuan_Diarchy_decisions:0 "The Diarchy"

If the balance is maintained it'll bring powerful benefits to Sichuan.

SZC_Favour_The_Militarists_desc:0 "By supporting the more conservative military wing through funding and favors, our army will reap the benefits while giving their faction a boost in the public eye. If the army is neglected, it'll degrade their performance in the field. Letting them grow too strong, however, risks crippling Sichuan's civilian branches of government. While it's certainly tempting to favour the army in times of war in particular, we should be careful not to provoke a hostile response by letting our administrative duties crumble."
SZC_Favour_The_Bureaucrats:0 "Favour the Bureaucrats"
SZC_Favour_The_Bureaucrats_desc:0 "By providing more resources and public support for the civilian branches of government, we'll see an well-oiled bureaucracy, more able to tackle the challenges that the province faces. Should we favor them too heavily, however, our army will suffer the results of spending cuts and perform worse in the field. If this goes on for too long, we can't rule out the army taking measures into their own hands to adjust this imbalance."

SZC_Asymmetric_Warfare:0 "Asymetric Warfare"
SZC_Asymmetric_Warfare_desc:0 "At the present it's unrealistic for us to try and match countries like Japan in terms of massed tanks, air power and artillery.

SZC_Professional_Legacy:0 "Professional Legacy"

SZC_Army_Of_Professionals:0 "Army of Professionals"
SZC_Army_Of_Professionals_desc:0 "Much of China's suffering has come from warlords and corrupt officials pretending that an unruly mob can act as an army - let alone take a city without behaving like bandits in the process.

SZC_Equipment_Standardisation_desc:0 "During the days of the warlords, any logistics officer would often have the unenviable burden of every local war band, governor militia and splinter force having their own rifles, ammunition and uniforms.

sichuan.1.t:0 "The Sichuan Clique in 1936"
sichuan.1.d:0 "As 1936 dawns, Sichuan remains in a very fragile balance between its multiple factions. Yang Sen holds for now, buoyed by Zhili support from his personal backer, the Jade Marshal Wu Peifu and aided by his close associate and former governor of Sichuan, Liu Cunhou, whose status and connections, as well as considerable forces, give Yang sorely needed stability and legitimacy. However, the military disasters of the past decade led Yang Sen to rely on the cliques led by Deng Xihou and Liu Xiang, who now hold considerable influence in the government and in Sichuan itself. The remnants of the KMT-aligned Officer Department still control parts of southern Sichuan, though the years since have seen their area of control steadily diminish.\n\nSichuan stands at the edge of a knife, internally divided, with multiple factions vying for ultimate power in the province. It may take only the slightest sign of weakness in the Zhili for this powderkeg to blow up..."
sichuan.1.a:0 "Tell me about Sichuan."

sichuan.1.c:0 "Surely Wu wouldn't let such a thing happen."

sichuan.2.t:0 "The Sichuan Clique"
sichuan.2.d:0 "The modern history of Sichuan begins in 1912. When the Xinhai Revolution reached Sichuan, the region entered a period of prolonged instability, with regional warlords vying for the governorship by diplomacy and force. Between 1912 and 1926, the region was alternatively controlled by Xinhai revolutionaries, Kuomintang loyalists and local warlords.\n\nThis state of affairs would last until the failure of the Northern Expedition in 1926. With the personal support of the victorious Zhili leader, Wu Peifu, Yang Sen was able to establish himself as the firm ruler of Sichuan, finally restoring some semblance of stability to the region. However, the profound divisions within Sichuan would not disappear, with Yang rapidly becoming beheld to the interests for various internal cliques that formed and unable to remove their influence. Liu Xiang, one of these warlords, established himself in Chongqing by allying himself with the local administration, quickly becoming Yang's main rival for control over Sichuan.\n\n1928 saw Sichuan face an invasion from the neighboring clique of Yunnan. While at first a success, the invasion was soon defeated by Sichuanese forces, causing considerable losses among Yang's personal forces. A Tibetan invasion in 1930 deteriorated the situation even further, with Tibetan troops reaching the Yangtze River and directly threatening the capital of Chengdu. While the involvement of the Ma Clique to the north eventually turned the tide against the Tibetans, Sichuan was forced to cede half of the Xikang region to Tibet and Yang's military was left in tatters."

sichuan.3.t:0 "The Sichuan Clique"
sichuan.3.d:0 "While the Tibetan invasion was repelled, this was not the end of Sichuan's troubles. In 1931, a group of Kuomintang-aligned officers, warlords and former governors of Sichuan, the Officer Department, launched its first expedition into Sichuan from their bases in northern Yunnan, with tacit support from Tang Jiyao's Republican government. The tattered Sichuanese forces under Yang were no match for the KMT troops, being routed time and again, losing most of its supplies to the advancing invasion forces. With the Clique on the brink of collapse, warlord Yang Sen, in a move of desperation, formed a temporary alliance with Chongqing warlord Liu Xiang and his clique, the Industrial Corps. With assistance from Liu's forces, Yang was able to beat back the expedition. Further cooperation with the Industrial Corps allowed Sichuan to begin rebuilding its army, at the cost of ever increasing Industrial Corps influence within the government.\n\nAnother group to rise in influence at this time was Deng Xihou's Baoding Department, whose forces helped suppress the Officer Department while Yang rebuilt his forces. The highly visible work by the Baoding Department in suppressing the rebels led to an increase in the group's popularity, which is seen by more and more citizens as the true protectors of Sichuan.\n\nAnother invasion attempt in 1933 by Yunnan, in support of the Officer Department, was quickly aborted when the League-Marshal of the Eight Provinces, Sun Chuanfang, threatened to intervene. The unexpected Yunannese retreat allowed Yang to partially reoccupy southern Sichuan. The chaos also allowed Tian Songyao to establish himself in the northeast as a minor warlord, yet his ambitions remain a mystery."

sichuan.4.d:0 "Sichuan in 1936 stands divided, with multiple factions vying for absolute power.\n\nThe ruling faction at the moment is the Armament Department, led by Yang Sen and his close associate Liu Cunhou. Due to Wu Peifu's personal support over the years, the Department is closely aligned to the Zhili authorities in Beijing and Nanjing. While their influence remains secure for now, the clique has grown dependent on Zhili support in the last decade. Should something befall the Zhili, Yang's authority will be dangerously threatened.\n\nYang's chief rival for control over Sichuan is Chongqing warlord Liu Xiang, leader of the Industrial Corps. Liu Xiang remains an erstwhile ally of Yang since the KMT expedition in 1931, but Liu is an ambitious man and makes no secret of his desire to rule Sichuan. Should the opportunity appear, the Industrial Corps may quickly reconsider the usefulness of their alliance with Yang Sen.\n\nThe third most important faction is the Baoding department, a clique formed by former Baoding graduates - though this is not a prerequisite for membership - and led by Yang's general Deng Xihou. In the last few years, their highly visible operations against rebel enclaves in the south has seen them gain popularity among the people. The Baoding Department forms a core of Yang's support in the region. While Deng has long been loyal to Yang, he may very well be considered a threat to Yang's rule.\n\nIn the south, the remnants of a KMT expedition in 1931 continue to hold territory. The Officer Department, as they are called, are the main group openly resisting Yang's control of Sichuan. Led by Lu Chao and Xiong Kewu, the group maintains close relations with the nearby clique of Yunnan, on whose support they depend to survive."

Some are now claiming the League - and the Zhili order that backs it up - are on their last legs, though most are still willing to believe that military force can keep the unrest contained."

It very well may be, but it's a high stakes gamble, to say the least, because at this point his armies are tiring from weeks of marching and fighting.\n\nThe city itself is surrounded by channels derived from Dujiangyan's levees upriver and fortified by walls dating back to the late Qing era, before the Xinhai Revolution. Old as they might be and built before the time of modern artillery the walls still stretch nearly seven miles around the city and stand at over thirty feet in height. Effectively they form a mighty citadel that has stood the test of time, which make it a daunting task for any attacking army to breach.\n\nKnowing that a head-on assault would cause ruin to the Chongqing army, Xiang has instead opted to lay siege to Chengdu. Sporadic shelling has been exchanged between both forces all morning, but it's clear that Xiang's troops have no hopes of breaching the defenses anytime soon and have thus dug in for a long siege. While our defenses stand for now, this city will be our grave if we simply wait behind these walls. Swift action must be taken!\n\nIf their schemes aren't disrupted, Chengdu will surely fall."

In doing so, we can hopefully force the surrender of Xiang's main force, especially their prized engineer units.\n\nOn the other hand, with most of their experienced forces committed to the siege, other members of our high command believe that we should cut the head of the snake by attacking the Chongqing outright. The city should be lightly defended by Xiang's reserve units under mayor Pan Wenhua and its capture would massively disorganise Xiang's efforts due to the city's vital infrastructure.\n\nFinally, there are the officers in our ranks that warn us against putting all our eggs into one basket, urging us instead to split up our forces and attack both targets at once, negating their chances to reinforce their objectives.\n\nThe only thing they seem to agree on is that whatever course of action we choose must be considered carefully as there is no room for mistakes."

It was clear that if there was a fight for the city, it'd be a long and hard fight, even with Liu Xiang out of the picture. When word reached us that forward detachments from the Officer Department were marching towards the city, our commanders were relieved. Surely expecting the Industrial Corps to not put up a fight, the Officers would march into a death trap as they neared the city.\n\nUnfortunately for us, this was not meant to be.\n\nInstead of being greeted with bullets and bombs from the city's defenses, they were greeted with open arms as the banner of the Industrial Corps flying over the city was quickly exchanged for the colors of the Kuomintang and of the Federalists. Pan Wenhua declared his loyalty to the cause of the revolutionary army. This was apparently not just the cowardly act of an opportunistic turncoat, but an act of planned deceitful and treachery. Not only had Pan Wenhua coordinated this with Lu Chao and Xiong Kewu of the Officer Department, but it became clear that he's likely been in contact with major KMT figures like Song Qingling and Lin Biao for a very long time.\n\nAlthough their armies have yet to fully link up, Chongqing's considerable industrial output has effectively been given to the Officer's Department as a wrapped gift, all right under our noses.\n\nThis is dire news indeed and it has effectively changed the entire situation on the ground in an instant."

It'd gone from the fortress of a warlord to a fortress of republicanism, federalism and the Three Principles of Dr. Sun Yat Sen. Whether or not Pan Wenhua himself believes in this is anyone's guess, but he's certainly playing the part and the people of Chongqing hardly seem unhappy that the promises of glory through war are being replaced with promises of prosperity and freedom, at least given that the alternative seemed to be a ruinous conquest at the hands of Yang Sen and his Zhili allies. The Officer Department itself, too, has been transformed. Gone are the days of being a ragtag guerrilla force, as they now receive the finest arms and uniforms that Chongqing's manufactories can produce. They're still the same revolutionary army in spirit, only this time they look the part of a professional force.\n\nThis pact between the revolutionaries and the turncoat in Chongqing is a dire threat, to say the least. Under no circumstances must we let the Kuomintang dogs that we and our Zhili allies fought so hard to contain rise to power. Their ideas are a threat to all of China and they must not be permitted to uproot the very foundations of our civilization.

We must use this opportunity to strike while they're still divided. While we've only seen small skirmishes in the area so far, a big battle between the three forces is inevitable.\n\nWe have to make sure it's on our terms.\n\nOur forces are led by the capable Wang Lingji, a proven veteran of the war whose experience and tactical expertise should make up for the spent state of our army. The forces he commands are mostly veterans with several victories to their credit and a fair amount of heavy equipment still intact. Our enemies are the a force of equally veteran, but poorly equipped, Kuomintang irregulars led by the cunning Liu Bocheng, to be reinforced by the Pan Wenhua's Chongqing forces. All other things considered, both are proven military leaders and should not be underestimated.

sichuan.71.d.pincer:0 "Deeming the Chongqing force to be the easier foe to best on its own, Wang Lingji ordered his tired but determined forces eastwards to strike at them first, hoping to crush them before they could link up with the battle-hardened Kuomintang guerrillas. While not a pushover by any estimate, it's still a fact that Liu Xiang's military defeats had spent most of the Industrial Corps' best soldiers and equipment. What was left were reservists and conscripts that had weren't as well-trained as the regular army, particularly in the use of heavy equipment. The fate of this gamble would be decided outside of Tongnan, a town northwest of Chongqing.\n\nWhen the two armies made contact, Wang Lingji was suprise to learn that his opponents were not marching in the open, but had been able to create makeshift defenses outside of the old city. While hardly a formidable chain of defenses, the Chongqing reserve had still been able to dig fresh trenches overnight. Rather than being greeted by the confusion of ambushed marching columns, our troops were greeted by the artillery of Pan Wenhua's soldiers. It quickly dawned on Lingji that the guerrillas, with their extensive knowledge of the region, had been able to inform their new allies of the Armament Department's latest offensive. The greatest concern, of course, weren't the makeshift defenses, but rather the realisation that Bocheng knew of his plans as well.\n\nChoosing between a humbling retreat and a fast assault, Lingji opted for the latter, knowing that the former would likely put him in an even worse position and doom Chengdu. With little time to prepare, he had his forces deploy and set out against their enemies. Although they were caught off-guard, their veterancy showed as they acted with a skill and courage that their opponents couldn't match, but were nonetheless facing a steep uphill struggle. As day turned into night, Pan Wenhua's defenses were battered but not beaten. Worse yet, nightfall marked the arrival of Liu Bocheng and his soldiers, only making their presence known as they rushed up against the flanks of the exhausted Armament Department forces. This was the final straw and the army broke soon thereafter, surrendering in droves to the sudden and relentless attack on their rear.\n\nWang Lingji's whereabouts are currently unknown and the roads to Chengdu have been blown wide open. We fear for the worst."

In doing so and relying on a mix of static and elastic defenses against what turned out to be a very mobile and aggressive force, however, the clash around Ziliujing soon turned into a cage for its conquerors.\n\nRather than taking the bait, the Kuomintang guerrillas knew that attacking such an obvious strongpoint would be a disaster and would rely on their usual harassment tactics instead. In choosing to rely on a strong defense rather than a mobile offense, the Armament Department ceded the initiative to their enemies. After a few days of sporadic fighting with light losses on both sides, Pan Wenhua's Chongqing reserve arrived to relieve Bocheng's forces. Now, the hardened guerrillas were backed up by the remaining might of the Industrial Corps with its heavy equipment. The fort thus became a trap as the artillery of the Industrial Corps was now being guided by the superior local knowledge of the Kuomintang, restricting its movements. While the city itself was safe due to neither side wanting to risk the lives of its inhabitants, any attempt to move out would lead to large losses for Wang's forces. While portions of Pan Wenhua's and Liu Bocheng's forces remain committed in Ziliujing, a large detachment is moving towards Chengdu on the now open road, recruiting resentful civilians and deserters from Xiang's old army alike as they go. With every step they take, they grow stronger while we weaken behind our walls.\n\nDespite Wang's forces being tied down, he's already making plans for a safe withdrawal and should be able to make it out with most of his forces intact. The bad news is, by the time he does it's doubtful whether there's still a Chengdu for him to relieve."

Unwilling to endure another siege with absolutely no hope of relief, the garrison simply raised a white flag over the city's main gates rather than subjecting the city's people and historical legacy to needless death and destruction. Though the mighty walls of the Qing remain unbroken, the same can't be said for the will to fight among those behind them. Chengdu now flies the Kuomintang and Federalist flags and its surrender marks the end of Sichuan's bloodiest civil war yet. The victorious forces rejoice, celebrating in the mostly empty streets of the ancient city. Its inhabitants remain indoors and at this point most are just relieved that the war is over.\n\nA silver lining, at least, is that the decision to surrender swiftly has spared the ancient city from any looting and plundering by victors."

sichuan.73.d:0 "In the past, when fighting the guerrillas, they'd fought from the hills and forests. This was their territory and any attack directly into their areas where they would defend on their terms would be suicide. Knowing this, Wang Lingji knew that he'd have to draw out Liu Bocheng's forces into an open attack. Bocheng was no fool; he'd proven his tactical acumen many times over. He was famous for seizing opportunities presented to him and attacking aggressively from positions of strength and Lingji aimed to use this trait against him.\n\nThe plan was risky and he knew that sacrifices would be unavoidable. His main force was to remain concentrated in the rear, with a few forward detachments being sent out as bait for the KMT to take. Throughout the morning they made probing attacks against their enemies with sporadic attacks in the hills and forests. While unsuccessful at first, eventually Liu Bocheng decided that these forward forces were likely to be the only Armament Department forces in the area, as they had received no reinforcements, nor withdrawn and reported the KMT activities. Once the guerrillas switched tactics to Liu Bocheng's famous frontal infantry assaults, they were quick to withdraw as overwhelming numbers headed their way. Losses weren't light, but enough of them managed to return to friendly lines. Believing that he'd broken the enemy like he had on so many other occasions, Bocheng decided to press the perceived advantage and keep up the attack.\n\nClose to noon, the KMT forces caught up with the retreating forces, but were hammered by the artillery and machine gun emplacements that the Armament Department had set up. The trap had sprung, but now they had the unenviable task of trying to defeat a revolutionary force led by a noted war hero. Bocheng's forces lacked heavy equipment, but they were still a formidable force. They threw themselves at the enemy positions, only to be cut down. By the end of the first day the KMT withdrew hoping to draw the enemy out into a more favorable position. When Wang Lingji held his forces in place rather than falling for his own trick, the assaults continued well into the next day. All the while, the Chengdu forces failed to provide support as their heavy equipment meant that it'd be at least half a week before they could make contact with the two fighting generals.\n\nAfter days of fighting, Liu Bocheng had taken crippling losses and been forced to withdraw to regroup and recover his losses. Once Pan Wenhuareceived word that the force he was supposed to link up with was beaten in battle, he decided to turn around back towards Chongqing. The gambit was costly, but it'd won the day for the Armament Department. The road to Chongqing was now open."

After several days of fighting, the Upper City finally fell and with it the city's industries. The fighting did, however, leave parts of the city in ruins, including many of its factories and critical infrastructure. Once the dust settled Pan Wenhua was nowhere to be found, most likely either killed in the battle or long gone.\n\nWith any hopes of victory lost, along with their only ally, most of the remaining Officer Department troops have begun to desert or surrender, except for small pockets of die-hard KMT guerrillas in the countryside.

They were to seize not only the enemy's final stronghold, but also take on one of China's major industrial hubs. A battle for this city would surely be difficult as each of the mighty factories of the city could easily be turned into a fortress for any defender.\n\nWhile time is of the essence, a head-on assault is a very difficult task. The hilly areas around the hill could provide us with excellent positions for spotting and to place our artillery, giving us a tremendous strategic advantage going in. Some commanders on the ground are suggesting that the time it would take to secure those positions to take advantage of them is time that we simply do not have, preferring a swift assault against the battered remnants of the Industrial Corps instead."

Wasting no time, the forces charged under cover of artillery fire as they stormed the trenches surrounding the city. After hours of fighting, the Armament Department had seized these positions, albeit at a heavy cost in lives. The rushed deployment also meant that the inaccurate artillery had a fairly limited effect on the field. Worse yet, once the trenches were taken it was clear that Pan Wenhua had managed to gradually withdraw his forces as the attackers made progress. He was gambling for an effective delaying operation, and it was working.\n\nAs running into the city at night would be a disorganized suicide, the Armament Department could only wait in the ancient city's outskirts for daybreak while Pan Wenhua rushed to prepare new defenses inside the city itself and have the civilians evacuate towards the inner sections of Chongqing. Once daybreak came, every factory and every government facility had been turned into a makeshift fort. Progress was slow, and the Armament Department soon became bogged down in street fighting. After a second night with little progress, the situation grew desperate as the enemy's reinforcement were rapidly approaching. Knowing that they'd be destroyed if caught between the two armies, the next day saw no fighting. Instead, a few soldiers were sent with a white flag to discuss their surrender. It was accepted by Pan Wenhua shortly thereafter, ending the brief battle for Chongqing with a catastrophe for the Armament Department.\n\nIn the end, the attacking force became prisoners of war and with some of the most experienced soldiers wiped from their order of battle, it's now very unlikely for the Armament Department to be able to recover. Already word of this defeat is spreading among the people, despite the best effort of the censors in Chengdu. To say that their will to resist Xiang has diminished would be an understatement."

Before dawn, our engineers had established positions on the hills followed by the arrival of light artillery and observers under the cover of darkness. Once daybreak came, our soldiers were able to launch their assault on the city with the enemy forces still far behind them. Their charge was initiated by a barrage that was as accurate as it was devastating against the entrenchments of the defenders, and soon the fighting for the city itself raged.\n\nDespite the odds, the heart of the Industrial Corps was soon being overrun by Yang's forces. In the hours that followed, the ancient city's small garrison offered disorganized resistance as the Armament Department cleared them out street by street. The swiftness of the assault and ferocity of the bombardment had crushed Wenhua's plans of gradually falling back into the city, and now his forces were being mopped up at a rapid pace. Before long, the city and its mighty industries finally fell. The fighting did, however, leave parts of the city in ruins, including many of its factories and critical infrastructure. Once the dust settled, Pan Wenhua was nowhere to be found. He's presumed to either killed in the battle for the city, or having fled long ago.\n\nThe city had fallen so quickly that the Industrial Army sent to relieve it had no idea of its fate. Thus, they were greeted by shelling from the mountains and fire from the city's outskirts as they approached. Realizing quickly they they were too late as they saw the banners of the Armament Department flying over the city, they were quick to raise a white flag.

Two large armies on the march are impossible to conceal, however, and neither force would ever reach their destinations before word of our intentions reached the enemy.\n\nSeizing the initiative, Liu Xiang was quick to divert his forces at once, leaving behind a token force to make sure that the Chengdu garrison remains tied down. As our plan hinged on the enemy being committed to the siege, the moment Xiang's forces were on the move our forces were fighting time itself as fiercely as they were fighting scouts and local militias from the Industrial Corps. They were, however, oblivious to this fact before it was too late. The infrastructure in Sichuan was poor before the war and by this point our army was marching through broken roads with radio communications being all but non-existent. The two armies didn't realize they were being chased before Liu Xiang's forces attacked them from behind.\n\nThe plan had no room for error and once the two halves of the army were attacked in their rears and flanks any semblance of cohesion quickly broke down as they scrambled to assume defensive positions. It was only the tactical skills of Wang Lingji that saved the day, miraculously rallying the troops and fending off the first wave of attackers, buying time and allowing the two halves of our army to link up and re-group near the Yangtze. The losses on his side had been crippling, however, and he'd barely been able to begin entrenching before the final nail in the coffin was hammered in with the arrival of the Chongqing garrison's forces under the capable command of Pan Wenhua.

The bulk of this force stopped not far from the city's walls, with only a flatbed truck narrowing the gap between the besieging army and the city's walls. The truck wasn't loaded with enemy troops or bombs, but instead the vehicle was full of high-ranking officers fromt the Armament Department. One officer picked up a megaphone with shaky hands and as the man's identity dawned on the garrison,  he started to address the soldiers manning the walls. Wang Lingji told them that they were all that remained of the relief force, that their armies were broken and that their so-called leaders had fled to the Qing. But have no fear, he insisted, because Liu Xiang had been gracious enough to spare both them and the city if they surrendered.\n\nThe answer didn't let itself wait for too long. The commanders in charge of the garrison knew that with morale being as low as it was, once news got out that the entire Armament Department army had been crushed he'd surely have an insurrection on his hands. The tall walls of Chengdu still stood and the siege ended not with a bang, but with a white flag being raised above the now open city gates."

sichuan.81.d.sapped:0 "As the days went on, with no relief reaching the city, Xiang's engineers were slowly but surely able to map out the weak points of the Qing-era defenses around the city. Every night they toiled to dig beneath the city's walls and plant explosives in key locations. Just over a month into the siege, these explosively finally went off before the sun had risen. The massive explosions quickly caused large breaches in the walls, with the falling debris blocking some of the Dujiangyan levees that surrounded the city. In an instant, the walls that had stood for so long crumbled like dust with dozens of the city's defenders passing away in the initial explosions. This marked the final assault on Chengdu and it'd be a long and difficult battle for the large city.\n\nDespite the collapse of the walls and the capture of the East Gate, the garrison still put up stiff resistance against the attacking forces. Putting their knowledge of the city's layout to good use, the defenses that the Chengdu garrison and drafted civilians had built within the city proved difficult to overcome even for the massively superior attacking force. Wherever they went, they were greeted by machine guns, snipers, mines and ambushing infantry. Though the garrison fought valliantly, it was all for naught. By the end of the first day, a sort of calm was brought in by the night with a third of the city having fallen. The Industrial Corps regrouped and in the morning they attacked the city's center. Low on men and ammunition though, the half-starved defenders could only hold out for a few hours before they were forced to surrender the city hall to the advancing Industrial Corps. This marked the complete collapse of the city's defense with any remaining forces quickly surrendering. By the evening, Chengdu finally fell silent, a silence that would soon be broken by the cheers of the victorious Industrial Corps and its soldiers.\n\nAlthough he'd paid a high price for it, Liu Xiang's gamble for control over Sichuan had paid off."

sichuan.84.d.victory:0 "Wang Zuanxu had little time to prepare and even less to maneuver - though that did not seem to alarm the sometimes rash commander. Believing that a cunning offense would be the best defense, he had planned for a string of night-time attacks against the enemy, with our forces' eventual withdrawal being backed by artillery barrages against the enemy's encampments. After forcing Xiang's hand in a state of disarray, the first waves of his forces would be smashed by a mix of rear-guard actions and defensive artillery, with a series of infantry counter-attacks aimed at breaking up the exhausted attackers and force the Industrial Corps to retreat.\n\nAlthough the night-time raid was a success that disrupted Xiang's planned offensive, the battle for Guanxian itself would rage on for days. Most plans do not survive first contact with the enemy and this did not either. Both Xiang and Zuanxu's forces had their successes and setbacks as ground around the city was traded between the two. Wang Zuanxu's penchant for quick decisions meant, however, that any breakthrough made by Xiang was swiftly met by a counter-attack or artillery barrage. After three days of fighting, his forces had been badly damaged, but the Industrial Corps were also badly bloodied to the point where they called off any further attacks, opting instead to regroup to fight again another day. Though the battle may be recorded as a draw by the history books, it's a strategic victory that has prevented our enemy from advancing to the south against Liu Wenhui."
sichuan.84.t.flood:0 "The Baopingkou Floods"
sichuan.84.d.flood:0 "At the orders of Wang Zuanxu, military engineers set out to not build defenses, but to block the Baopingkou Channel in a way that'd cause a controlled flooding, one that wouldn't affect the Baoding positions and causes as little civilian damage as possible. The goal was to flood Xiang's forces and turn their encampments into a swamp. The military engineers worked hard to make sure that the damages to the Dujiangyan systems and the surrounding areas would be limited. Realizing that they were short on time however, they could only hope to mitigate the destruction at best.\n\nOnce the preparations were made, the channels were blockaded with wooden slabs and from there it didn't take long for the surrounding levees to overflow away from their determined paths, straight into the encampments of the Industrial Corps. Many soldiers were rudely awakened as their tents offered absolutely no protection against the rising waters that slowly turned the grounds into a soggy swampland. Cases of guns were drenched and the ground that many artillery pieces stood upon quickly turned into a soft mud that slowly swallowed the larger guns. A hasty retreat followed with the troops trying to save as much of their equipment as possible from the rising water. Needless to say, their abandoned equipment and positions are as useless to us as it is to them, but they certainly won't be able to mount an offensive now.\n\nAlthough a military victory, reports are coming in that despite our best efforts the damage to the Dujiangyan system has been considerable and that the floods have washed away many nearby crops. However, we have won the initiative in this war without losing a single soldier. Let's hope the risk was worth it."

sichuan.85.d.defeat:0 "Despite the strong defenses set up by Wang Zuanxu and various rear-guard actions taken against the enemy, the overwhelming numbers of the enemy and the strategic skills of Liu Xiang proved too much for our forces to handle. Although the Industrial Corps paid a heavy price for their victory thanks in no small part to the many artillery kill zones set up beforehand, by the third day they'd broken through the defenses through a mix of ruthless aggressiveness and discipline. A series of counter-attacks were mounted in an attempt to retake our defensive positions, but it was all for naught in the end and the banner of the Industrial Corps soon flew over the Er Wang Temple.\n\nHumbled by this defeat, the Baoding troops were forced to retreat further and further west. While a last-ditch defense of the Dujiangyan crossings has prevented a rout and allowed most troops to escape to Pixian to the southeast, our troops are now spread out defending the levees and will not be unable to reach Chengdu or Meishan in time to join Liu Wenhui's forces. They're now on their own and must do their best to defend against the Industrial Corps' southward thrust."
sichuan.85.d.insubordination:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures, so it was decided earlier in the war to hire local bandits to do our fighting for us. As our losses throughout the war have mounted, we've been forced to rely more and more upon them to replenish our ranks. This isn't terribly uncommon for warlords in China, though it's undeniable that these men aren't ideal troops. More often than not, they're ill-disciplined and can barely grasp military tactics. They often act like a mob - nonetheless, a mob of ruthless, heavily armed men. Only motivated by the prospect of gold and amnesty for past crimes however, their loyalty was always in doubt. Today, we've been made to pay dearly for relying on them.\n\nBefore the battle and contrary to how we'd operate under ideal circumstances, many bandits had been deployed with our forces at the front, even outnumbering our regular soldiers in a lot of key areas. As Xiang's forces advanced and the sheer overwhelming size of the assault dawned on them, many of these conscripted criminals simply deserted or refused to follow orders. With our reliance on them being as great as it was at this point, we simply weren't able to have our officers force them to stand and fight. Despite fierce resistance by the remaining loyal regiments, the Baoding troops were forced to retreat further and further west due to the betrayal in the ranks.\n\nWhile a last-ditch defense of the Dujiangyan crossings has prevented a rout and allowed most troops to escape to Pixian to the southeast, our troops are now spread out defending the levees and will not be unable to reach Chengdu or Meishan in time to join Liu Wenhui's forces.

With our armies finally linked up, we'll be able to finally bring an end to the traitor Liu Xiang and end this war."

Wasting no time, Liu Xiang has ordered his triumphant forces to advance south-west towards the Min River crossings. The arriving Xikang forces find themselves facing an entrenched enemy across one of Sichuan's larger rivers and unwilling to throw away his soldiers in a futile attack, Liu Wenhui has halted the planned offensive.\n\nBoth camps eye each other across the river, with only sporadic skirmishes and sniper fire being exchanged between the two sides. Both consider a river crossing to be suicide, a fact that spells doom for us and success for our foes. With any attempt at relief being halted at the river, Chengdu has been cut off. We can only pray that its defenders pull off a miracle."

He began to take measures to fortify his now exposed positions. Short of breaking the siege and retreating to Chongqing, this is the only card he was able to play and our commanders were well-aware of this fact. The resulting simultaneous movements led to both forces trying to outmaneuver each other, eventually leading to them crashing into each other in the village of Longquanyi, southeast of Chengdu.\n\nWhat started out as a small skirmish between scout detachments soon escalated into a full-blown battle. While Xiang had the upper hand initially thanks to his own skill and his vast numbers, a determined defence of the countryside and the good coordination between our commanders allowed our reinforcements from Chengdu and Guanxian to arrive in time to reinforce our positions and deal a decisive blow to the enemy forces. With the bulk of his forces broken, the only cohesive force that remains of the once mighty Industrial Corps outside of Chongqing is the token besieging force left around Chengdu, now trapped between our vast armies and the walls of the city. Rumor has it that the Industrial Corps' organisation has begun falling apart after this devastating defeat."

It is unknown at this point if he died in the field, or  simply fled from Sichuan altogether once his defeat became inevitable. Whatever the case may be, the fact that he's gone has sent shockwaves throughout the region, not least among the ranks of his army, now a demoralized shell of its former self."
sichuan.88.a:0 "A fitting end."

sichuan.89.t:0 "Pan Wenhua's Betrayal"
sichuan.89.d:0 "Despite the Industrial Corps' main force falling into disarray following the disappearance of Liu Xiang, the Chongqing garrison remained a formidable force. Under the capable command of Xiang's second-in-command, the mayor of Chongqing, Pan Wenhua, it numbered in the thousands and was being directly resupplied every day by the city's large factories. It was clear that if there ware to be a fight for the city, it'd be long and hard-fought, even with Liu Xiang out of the picture. When word reached us that forward detachments from the Officer Department were marching towards the city, our commanders were relieved. Surely expecting the Industrial Corps to not put up a fight, the Officers would march into a death trap as they neared the city.\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, this was not meant to be.\n\nInstead of being greeted with bullets and bombs from the city's defenses, they were greeted with open arms as the banner of the Industrial Corps flying over the city was quickly exchanged for the colors of the Kuomintang and of the Federalists. Pan Wenhua declared his loyalty to the cause of the revolutionary army. This was apparently not just the cowardly act of an opportunistic turncoat, but an act of planned deceitful and treachery. Not only had Pan Wenhua coordinated this with Lu Chao and Xiong Kewu of the Officer Department, but it became clear that he's likely been in contact with major KMT figures like Song Qingling and Lin Biao for a very long time.\n\nChongqing's considerable industrial output has effectively been given to the Officer's Department as a wrapped gift, all right under our noses.\n\nThis is dire news indeed and it has effectively changed the entire situation on the ground in an instant."
sichuan.89.a:0 "Wait, what?"

sichuan.90.t:0 "Chongqing Under The Officers"
sichuan.90.d:0 "In the days following the disappearance of Xiang and the defection of Pan Wenhua, Chongqing had been transformed as quickly as the Officer Department had. It'd gone from the fortress of a warlord to a fortress of republicanism, federalism and the Three Principles of Dr. Sun Yat Sen. Whether or not Pan Wenhua himself believes in this is anyone's guess, but he's certainly playing the part and the people of Chongqing hardly seem unhappy that the promises of glory through war are being replaced with promises of prosperity and freedom, at least given that the alternative seemed to an invasion by Baoding Department forces. The Officer Department itself, too, has been transformed. Gone are the days of being a rugged guerrilla force as they now receive the finest arms and uniforms that Chongqing's manufactories can produce. They're still the same revolutionary army in spirit, only this time they look the part of a professional force.\n\nThis could be a dire threat, but it may not have to be that way. Many members of the Officer Department, from the soldiers to its generals, are not inherently hostile to the Baoding Department. With the regime of Yang Sen gone and what little was left of Liu Xiang's forces having abandoned his foolish ambitions for domination by force, many on both sides are speaking openly of the possibility of a peaceful end to the conflict."

sichuan.91.d:0 "After the devastation wrought by Liu Xiang and the Armament Department in Sichuan, much of the country bears deep scars from the conflict. With both instigators of hostilities out of the picture, neither of the remaining parties were willing to continue this bloody war that they didn't start and never intended to fight, especially not against each other.\n\nIn light of this, a meeting between the leaders of the Baoding and Officer factions was arranged. Xiong Kewu, speaking on behalf of the Officers, was quick to offer an olive branch to his old friend Deng Xihou, who he long ago counted as a subordinate, more than willing to work together for the betterment of the province. If Pan Wenhua could see reason and choose cooperation over war, then surely we could work together as well."

sichuan.93.t:0 "The Officer Department"
sichuan.93.d:0 "After the war with Yunnan, the Officer Department had been reduced to a sorry state, a small, if resilient, guerrilla force, dependent on Tang Jiyao's regime for support. Because of the war, however, their fortunes have changed drastically. With Yang Sen and Liu Xiang destroying each others' forces, the Officer Department began to rise in strength to fill the vacuum created in the wake of the civil war, both by attracting defectors from the armies, but also by propagating skilled propaganda against the "bloody warlords". As Baoding entered the war after the collapse of Yang Sen's regime, it was only a matter of time before the two factions met in the south of the country. However, this needed not have be a hostile encounter between enemies, but perhaps a chance for cooperation instead.\n\nAs fate would have it, one of the leaders of the Officer Department, Xiong Kewu, is an old friend of Liu Wenhui. He has made him an offer: They'll fight for Baoding, in exchange for working together later. Although joining forces with our old friends would have great benefits for both of us, some of our generals and other high ranking officers are weary of the stability of an alliance with what up until now has been a rag-tag militia of radicals, dependent on Yunnanese aid."

A bold and risky move, to be sure, but far more realistic than beating Liu Xiang's massive army in the open.\n\nKeeping an army of this size concealed for long was going to be impossible It was a matter of when, not if, the Industrial Corps eventually caught on to the machinations of the Baoding army. Predictably, Liu Xiang ordered a detachment of his forces to leave the siege of Chengdu to intercept his uncle's army. This whole plan fell apart among the mountains and rivers of Sichuan, however, as the Industrial troops sent to attack Liu Wenhui's forces fell victim to the constant attacks of the hardy guerrillas of the Officer Department. Ambushes, traps and blocked roads meant that any hope to reinforce Chongqing was utterly futile. Pan Wenhua's city garrison in Chongqing was now on its own as nothing seemed capable of stopping the Baoding force at this point."
sichuan.95.a:0 "Now to make their efforts worthwhile."

sichuan.96.t:0 "The Fall of Chongqing"
sichuan.96.d:0 "Sending the bulk of the Baoding army towards Chongqing was an all-or-nothing gamble, but one where the odds seemed to be in our favour, thanks to our advantageous strategic position. Although Liu Xiang had foreseen this move, he'd not planned for the alliance formed between the Baoding and the Officers.\n\nBe that as it may, Chongqing was still a heavily defended city, being the beating heart of Sichuan's industry. The Baoding commanders are known for their skill and that'd show during this battle. Opting for a methodical approach, Chongqing's defenders were flushed out one street at a time. Despite the size of the city and its garrison, however, the city would not hold out for long. Once Pan Wenhua had learned that Liu Xiang's relief force wasn't going to arrive for at least another week thanks to the continuous attacks by the Officer guerrillas, he swallowed his pride and reached out with an offer of surrender, rather than seeing the city he was mayor of be reduced to rubble."
sichuan.96.a:0 "A great victory!"

sichuan.97.t:0 "Collapse of the Industrial Corps"
sichuan.97.d:0 "Chongqing was a vital stronghold for Xiang's forces, due to city's many factories and the control over the Yangtze River traffic. Cut off from this vital lifeline following Pan Wenhua's surrender, Xiang's troops currently besieging Chengdu have stopped receiving much-needed supplies such as food, ammunition and weapons. Perhaps most dire of all, the soldiers' paychecks have also ceased to arrive with the complete paralysis of Chongqing's administrative functions. Without guns, pay, or even a functional leadership structure, desertion and insubordination has become widespread. The siege of Chengdu has already faltered as most soldiers and officers feel that the war is lost and in the countryside the forces of the Industrial Corps began to melt away as news of the fall of Chongqing reached them. Most simply cast away their rifles and headed back towards their homes, unwilling to fight for a lost cause.\n\nAfter being outmatched in a mutual high-stakes gamble, Xiang has utterly lost control of the situation. Seeing his army disintegrate and unwilling to face justice for his treachery, he has opted to flee north towards the Ma Clique in Xibei along with what remains of his inner circle. Without their capital, without their factories and without their leader, the Industrial Corps has now been utterly defeated. Victory is ours, to share with our new friends in the Officer Department."
sichuan.97.a:0 "We stand triumphant."

sichuan.98.t:0 "Disaster in Beipei"
sichuan.98.d:0 "After rejecting the alliance with the Officer Department, Liu Wenhui marched towards Chongqing, aiming to take the city from his nephew while also fighting against the KMT-aligned guerrillas. Predicting this move, Liu Xiang was able to order a portion of his main force to move to intercept his uncle's advancing army without needing to worry about the Chengdu siege being broken. Thanks in no small part to persistent harassment by the guerrillas, Liu Wenhui's forces were slowed down significantly, allowing elements of Pan Wenhua's reserves from Chongqing to mobilize while Xiang chased the Baoding army. This eventually led to them being caught in a pincer between the two advancing Industrial armies near the city of Beipei, just north of Chongqing. A desperate defense was to follow.\n\nSurrounded and cut off, the Baoding army was in a terrible position. The areas around the city did not provide any good defensive positions, made even worse by a terrible supply situation. Skilled though he may be, Liu Wenhui only had hours to prepare anything resembling a defense. The task presented to him was simply impossible given his own dire situation and the enemy's superiority. The Baoding forces bravely stood their ground, but after less than an hour of actual fighting the makeshift defenses had crumbled under the combined assaults mounted by the Industrial Corps. With the permission of Liu Wenhui, the bulk of the soldiers and their officers surrendered soon thereafter, not wanting to cast their lives away for an unwinnable battle."

sichuan.99.d:0 "Part of being a good officer is to realize when you've been beaten and retreat while there's still a chance to save the lives of your soldiers. Though the Beipei catastrophe had marked the end of any effective resistance by the main Baoding army, their defense against the unexpected pincer move had allowed him to escape with a retinue of his closest men. It was a close call and he only narrowly evaded capture first by the advancing Industrial Corps and later by the Kuomintang guerrillas as he fled westward.\n\nWhile he is rallying his remaining forces in the relative safety of Xikang's mountains, Chengdu and its defenders are on their own."

sichuan.100.t:0 "Deng Xihou Surrenders"
sichuan.100.d:0 "As the Industrial Corps' vanguard headed back north to continue their siege of Chengdu in full force, it the Baoding Department has decided to accept the inevitable. With Liu Wenhui's forces defeated, Deng Xihou knows he has no chance to overcome the combined Industrial Corps forces and that continuing the fight would merely cause the needless deaths of his own soldiers and the people behind the walls of Chengdu. As a result, Xihou sent out an emissary to Xiang's field headquarters outside of Chengdu to ask for a ceasefire. Given his poor bargaining position, the only thing he asks in exchange for Chengdu's peaceful transfor over to Xiang is for the safe passage out of Sichuan for Deng and the Baoding leadership. Liu Xiang, knowing that a ruined city and high casualties wouldn't help him unite the country still beset by petty warlords and guerrillas, was quick to accept and honor the deal.\n\nAlthough Chengdu's walls still stand, the gates were opened for the triumphant Industrial Corps. At this point, most citizens of Chengdu are only relieved that the war may be over soon and that they were spared a direct assault."

sichuan.104.d.SZC:0 "After fierce fighting, [HNN.GetAdjective] soldiers under Peng Dehuai were able to flank the Industrial Corps' forces and encircle the town of Enshi. With the fall of Enshi, the Industrial Corps retreated to the [SZC.GetAdjective] border as the [HNN.GetAdjective] forces pushed them back. Enshi has been retaken by [HNN.GetNameDef] and the Industrial Corps' occupation over the area has ended, with only small pockets of control by Industrial Corps soldiers remaining."
sichuan.104.a:0 "A great success!"
sichuan.104.b:0 "A humbling defeat."

sichuan.105.t:0 "The Battle of Enshi"
sichuan.105.d.HNN:0 "The forces of General Peng Dehuai in Shihe have failed their assault on the town of Enshi. With [HNN.GetAdjective] soldiers tired out and outnumbered, a retreat was ordered and the Industrial Corps moved in to re-occupy the lands they had lost in our offensive. During the [HNN.GetAdjective] retreat, many men were lost on the road as the Industrial Corps made a vicious attack on the retreating forces."
sichuan.105.d.SZC:0 "With the arrival of reinforcements at the Battle of Enshi, the [HNN.GetAdjective] forces were tired out and outnumbered by the Industrial Corps. The [HNN.GetAdjective] forces in Shihe retreated from Enshi, with Industrial Corps forces forcing them back and launching vicious attacks on the road to the [HNN.GetAdjective] border. The [HNN.GetAdjective] offensive into Enshi has failed and the Industrial Corps continues their occupation of the region."
sichuan.105.a:0 "A disappointing failure."
sichuan.105.b:0 "Are they invincible?"

sichuan.120.t:0 "Drought?"
sichuan.120.d:0 "Just over a decade ago in 1925 a great famine wracked Sichuan province. Hundreds of thousands died and just as many fled the province. Exacerbated by the internecine warfare of that era,  the famine was sparked by a long-lasting drought and caused irreparable economic and financial damage to Sichuan. For the last ten years the farmers that survived the drought hurriedly pray whenever the sun stays in the sky for over a week - but it appears their prayers have gone unanswered this year. Rain has not fallen in the province for over a month and many are fearing a return to the catastrophe of 1925..."
sichuan.120.a:0 "The rain must come soon..."

sichuan.121.t:0 "Transport Links Severed"
sichuan.121.d:0 "With fears of a famine already high after the drought refused to let up, many in [SZC.GetLeader]'s inner circle advised stockpiling rice imported down the Yangtze. Now, however, that plan has been cast aside. High tides, caused by unusually large glacial melts in the mountains, prevented any river trade from reaching Chengdu this year and the ongoing chaos in the League has largely cut off all railroad trade from the Legation ports where food is imported to. With Yunnan's government taking more and more overtly hostile action towards us, the only route to a port is through the Liangguang clique. While the route is stable, they aren't exactly close friends of ours and we may be cut off from *any* international trade soon."
sichuan.121.a:0 "We need an alternative route, now!"

sichuan.122.t:0 "Rice Prices Spike"
sichuan.122.d:0 "With imports into our province becoming more and more scarce and public fears of a famine rising with every sunny day, marketplaces across Sichuan have widespread increases in food prices. Already, this has sparked riots and demonstrations from small mountain villages to Chengdu itself. Those who can afford it have started to leave the province, with most heading towards the relative safety of the north."
sichuan.122.a:0 "As if the war weren't a large enough problem!"

sichuan.123.t:0 "Famine!"
sichuan.123.d:0 "Our worst fears have come to pass - the looming threat of famine is now reality. The drought and the unrest in the League cutting off most of our import have created a perfect storm of misery and chaos as former neighbors turn on each other over scraps of food and officials across the province report mass food riots, looting, deaths from starvation. Public order has broken down as policemen become too weak with hunger to stop criminals and refugees stream out of the province through whatever means they can. If rains do not fall soon total anarchy is inevitable."
sichuan.123.a:0 "Not again!"

sichuan.124.t:0 "Famine Breaks Out in Sichuan"
sichuan.124.d:0 "The province of Sichuan has long struggled with famine. Rocky terrain and unpredictable weather kept populations low until the early Qing era, when widespread land clearances and immigration incentives brought hordes of peasants to the province. In 1925 a lengthy drought turned into a devastating famine that ravaged the province, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees.\n\nNow, with chaos in the League disrupting food shipments and another lengthy drought the specter of famine haunts Sichuan once more. Already horrifying stories are emerging of mothers selling their children into slavery for scraps of bread and anarchy gripping even the richest market towns."
sichuan.124.a:0 "This year just keeps getting worse!"

sichuan.125.t:0 "Rains Return to Sichuan"
sichuan.125.d:0 "[SZC.GetLeader] was hunched over his desk desperately writing letter after letter to [GXC.GetLeader] to negotiate importing rice when he heard it. It started as the occasional droplet, but within minutes [SZC.GetLeader] heard the steady drumming of rain on the roof of his building. Scarcely beveling it, he ran outside and was almost immediately drenched. Around him his soldiers celebrated and even the normally dour-faced guards to the Governor's mansion were practically dancing with joy.\n\nWhile it will take a while to grow a new crop of food, the rain will help calm down the peasantry and put a stop to the anarchy gripping most of the province."
sichuan.125.a:0 "Finally some good news!"

sichuan.126.t:0 "An Improving Situation"
sichuan.126.d:0 "Now that the rains have finally returned, after a seemingly unending year of drought, the famine seems to be slowly, but surely disappearing. Much work remains to be done, however, before we can truly call this famine over. It remains imperative that we continue the relief efforts with expediency, as many areas remain under dire straits."
sichuan.126.a:0 "Let's hope this famine ends as soon as possible."

sichuan.127.t:0 "The Famine Fades"
sichuan.127.d:0 "As more and more of the Sichuanese agricultural sector recovers its productivity, the dark cloud of famine has been steadily receding from the province. More and more farms have begun to increase their outputs, while the devastation of the civil war continues to fade from public memory. We may never know the full extent of the damage, but even so it certainly appears that we'll soon be able to declare an official end to the famine.\n\nNonetheless, with millions of our citizens dead from this catastrophe, the famine has left an indelible dark mark upon Sichuan, one that will take decades to fully remove. Even now, many areas are still in a limbo of sorts, with the grain supply still unsteady. As our first step, we must work to fully solve the lingering famine pockets."
sichuan.127.a:0 "An end to a dark era."

sichuan.128.t:0 "Sichuan petitions the Central Government"
sichuan.128.d.zhili:0 "As if things couldn't get any worse, the Sichuanese government recently informed us that the drought that has gripped their province for the last month is now a full-blown famine, with social order breaking down as food becomes increasingly scarce. Subsequently, they have petitioned our government for aid. While we do have more pressing concerns to attend do, the province is of critical importance to our regime and ensuring the loyalty of their government will be key in reuniting China."
sichuan.128.d.manchu:0 "Although our new government lacks recognition from many of the warlords surrounding it, the Sichuanese provincial administration of [SZC.GetLeader] recently reached out to our government asking for aid. This is a great opportunity to show that we are the new 'legitimate' government of China. The agricultural ministries, however, are still reeling from the shock of the coup and may take time to prepare the aid required to help Sichuan."
sichuan.128.a:0 "Order the ministries to send aid."
sichuan.128.b:0 "We have other concerns."

sichuan.129.t:0 "Ministerial Infighting!"
sichuan.129.d:0 "As is typical for Beijing, our order to the various ministries of agriculture sparked an intense war of contract bidding, bureaucratic infighting and general inaction that typifies the lackadaisical Beijing government apparatus. One example today particularly exemplifies this corruption: sacks of rice have been assembled in Beijing, but a dispute over which rail company is to actually ship them to Chendu sparked a week-long series of negotiations involving kickbacks, bribes and bizarrely, accusations that one company's owner was a homosexual. While lots of money is changing hands, only a few grains of rice have actually made it to the hands of the starving peasantry of Sichuan."
sichuan.129.a:0 "Get on with it!"

sichuan.130.t:0 "Continued Ministerial Infighting"
sichuan.130.d.zhili:0 "It appears the various agriculture ministries are still yet to actually deliver any of the food they have collected in Beijing. Sacks of grain sit rotting in warehouses across the city as the peasantry of Sichuan starve and Yang Sen's situation grows ever more tenuous by the day. Wu Peifu has devised a solution to get things moving - by threatening to fire the heads of the various ministries, Wu hopes he can light a fire under their chairs and push them into action. As always, however, this comes with a cost. Wu would have to spend political capital he can spend elsewhere in the government on reassuring the various patron networks backing the ministries that these threats are not *actually* serious. Or are they?"
sichuan.130.d.manchu:0 "It appears the various agriculture ministries are still yet to actually deliver any of the food they have collected in Beijing. Sacks of grain sit rotting in warehouses across the city as the peasantry of Sichuan starve. The new government has an opportunity to flex their muscles by threatening to fire the ministers in charge of food distribution - but this would be costly."
sichuan.130.a:0 "Pressure the ministries to start working!"
sichuan.130.b:0 "Let them keep squabbling..."

sichuan.131.t:0 "Famine relief from Beijing"
sichuan.131.d:0 "While were worried by the lack of trains from Beijing following our request for aid - their daily telegraphs that it was 'on its way' hardly relieving concerns - it seems he was able to whip the notoriously byzantine agriculture and aid ministries into some semblance of action. Even though some of the promised sacks of rice were less than full - no doubt skimmed by some salacious official - we've received enough food to temporarily alleviate the worst of the chaos."
sichuan.131.a:0 "Finally!"

sichuan.132.t:0 "Beijing Ignores our Petition"
sichuan.132.d.zhili:0 "While Yang had hoped his old ally Wu Peifu would come to his aid in this moment of need, it appears the Jade Marshal has larger fish to fry. While he telegraphed Yang a sympathetic note, he claimed that the ongoing chaos in the former League of Eight Provinces robbed him of any resources available for famine relief."
sichuan.132.d.manchu:0 "While we had always feared that the government in Beijing would ignore our requests, those fears proved well-warranted today when [QIE.GetLeader] formally informed us that he could not supply the necessary aid to counter our famine. Many suspect this is due to our 'warlord' loyalties and already [SZC.GetLeader]'s position looks increasingly tenuous by the day."
sichuan.132.a:0 "We shall remember this!"

sichuan.133.t:0 "NCERA Congratulates the Government"
sichuan.133.d:0 "Few groups within the Assembly loathe the Harmony Association and the Zhili more than the NCERA. Comprised of naive intellectuals, they frequently protest the 'warlord nature' of our government and claim we are simply corrupt kleptocrats more interested in robbing the peasantry than developing the nation. Following our promise to aid [SZC.GetLeader] and stop the famine gripping his province, however, they publicly praised our 'surprising display of compassion for the peasantry of China'.\n\nNobody in the HA is really sure if they are naive enough to believe we are doing this to actually help the peasantry, but the support is certainly better than their usual loud protests."
sichuan.133.a:0 "Thanks, I guess?"

sichuan.134.t:0 "NCERA Criticises the Government"
sichuan.134.d:0 "Our decision to turn down Governor [SZC.GetLeader]'s request for aid was met with mostly silence - until today. The NCERA - nominally the party of the 'peasantry' but really little more than a group of rich philanthropists convinced they can save China's peasantry by throwing their father's money at their problems - loudly denounced our inaction. This is certainly not unusual, as they seem to protest nearly everything we do. What, however, is unusual is the fact that people are starting to pay attention to them. While their protest pamphlets are normally only distributed in the cities, soldiers across our territory have reported seeing pamphlets denouncing the 'warlords that let their own people starve in the streets' in every city and village of our nation!"
sichuan.134.a:0 "Let them shout!"

sichuan.135.t:0 "The International Famine Relief Commission"
sichuan.135.d:0 "Our cries for help have not fallen on empty ears! A consortium of wealthy philanthropists in the Legation Cities have convened to organize the 'China International Famine Relief Commission' (CIFRC). While most of them are helping out desire more for international recognition Western cash is desperately needed to buy food for our starving peasants, as the leaders of the surrounding warlord cliques, recognizing our predicament, have jacked up prices. Hopefully these wealthy westerners can help save Sichuan!"
sichuan.135.a:0 "Any aid is welcome."

sichuan.136.t:0 "Support the CIFRC?"
sichuan.136.d:0 "The province of Sichuan has long been subject to food insecurity. Recently, however, this problem has greatly worsened and the province has officially entered a famine. Philanthropists from around the world have begun to assemble conferences to help the province and have organized internationally into the China International Famine Relief Commission (CIFRC). Many of these philanthropists, who have influence within our government, are petitioning we directly support famine relief efforts. This has the potential to greatly improve the international perception of our government, but it will be costly."
sichuan.136.a:0 "Send them a shipment of grain."
sichuan.136.b:0 "Give them financial support."

sichuan.139.a:0 "Proof of our legitimacy!"

sichuan.140.t:0 "Fengtian Sends Aid To Sichuan"
sichuan.140.d:0 "Our allies in the Fengtian Government have recently decided to send grain to Sichuan, both to help alleviate the famine there, but also to improve their legitimacy in the eyes of [SZC.GetLeader]. The grain will be sent down rivers under the Fengtian flag, which could cause problems.\n\nWe could pressure the Fengtian Government to fly our flag, which would no doubt prevent any hostile armies from attacking the transports due to fears of reprisal."
sichuan.140.a:0 "Pressure them to use the [Root.GetAdjective] flag."

The [GetZhiliManchu] would never dare provoke an international incident by attacking Japanese ships, though this would paint us as puppets to Tokyo in the eyes of those watching the ships."

Their moving words showing desperation, coupled with disturbing photographic evidence, made it feel far more real to the assemblymen than the newspaper headlines could ever convey.\n\nDisorganized and emotional discussions were quickly cut short by the assembly president bringing back order. An elected legislature ought to act like one; the matter will be thoroughly discussed before a vote will be held. At the very least, it was clear that the people of Guangdong understood the gravity of the situation of their countrymen further north."

sichuan.152.d:0 "Emotions ran high during the debates. Skeptics were quick to criticize the Sichuan provincial government that allowed for the situation to worsen so much and the intense factional disputes there. There were divided opinions on the matter even among the organized political parties in the Assembly. While few could argue about the morality of sending aid, it was clear that Sichuan was not only suffering from famine, but from endemic corruption, which could very-well make any relief effort a complete waste."

sichuan.153.d:0 "Chen Lianbo of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, head of the Merchant Corps, spoke to the Provincial Assembly about the Sichuan famine. The wealthy Cantonese businessmen, fond of philantropy, was highly critical of the skepticism of many assemblymen and made it very clear that the Provincial Assembly wouldn't act, he certainly would and would publicly denounce every single member of the Provincial Assembly that voted against relief.\n\nThe merchant was certainly influential among the higher strata of Cantonese society; his pressure could certainly affect the Assembly's final vote on the matter."

After all, it was clear that any relief to the province may never reach the starving people and that it would be yet another expense to the Provincial Government's fragile budget. Yet, Chen Jiongming believed that, despite the costs, not only was it the right thing to do, that it would put Guangdong in a good light and help the province's reputation throughout China. Of course, Chen also deeply believes in democracy and he must act within the law. While he could add further pressure to the Provincial Assembly, his intervention could backfire and open himself to public criticism, or set a dangerous precedent for future governors."

All too often when bags of rice arrive in the markets, fights break out over them. Allegations of hoarding, price rigging and other malicious practices are rife and sadly, not inaccurate a lot of the time. With anger fuming among the hungry citizenry of the cities, we've been forced to deploy military police in the cities to maintain order and prevent, or at least mitigate any future outbreaks of violence and vandalism. This is hardly a permanent solution though as the presence of what some may see as uniformed thugs is likely to cause tensions and discontent to rise even further if we can't solve these shortages."

sichuan.162.t:0 "Violence in the Markets"
sichuan.162.d:0 "The merchants in the cities are often bearing the brunt of the anger that the desperate food shortages in the cities have caused. Shouts that they're famine profiteers and food hoarders are rampant, with many of them being attacked in the broad daylight of the marketplaces. Sometimes, even the rumor of a merchant withholding bags of rice for himself is enough to cause them to be attacked, only for the rioters to find out all too late that the store they sacked was as empty as their stomachs. This has led to several stores and markets closing down out of fear for more violence, which has only had the effect of making food even harder to come by. If the merchants weren't hoarding their last few bags of rice before, they certainly are now. Extra police have been deployed to handle these situations, but the damage has already been done."

sichuan.163.d:0 "Eating grass, leaves and berries has become commonplace around Sichuan as people, especially in the countryside, have started to take to rather unorthodox solutions to feed themselves in lieu of any other alternatives. Many are turning to more outlandish solutions though, with various flora and fauna commonly regarded as inedible being used as substitutes for food. The creative solutions are sometimes almost as disturbing as the crisis itself and though having something to eat is better than having nothing to eat, this only underscores the urgency in getting proper relief out to the hungry masses."
sichuan.163.a:0 "We'll need to monitor this development."

sichuan.164.t:0 "Spike in Poisoning Cases"
sichuan.164.d:0 "The recent rise in makeshift solutions to the famine has led to tragic yet predictable results, despite our best efforts to spread awareness of the risks these practices bring with them. Hospitals and rural clinics are seeing a large increase in patients suffering from acute cases of poisoning, assuming they're even able to make it there in the first place. With our medical services being pressed to their limits, local administrators have been tasked with informing their people on the dangers of these activities. As long as the famine endures though, cases aren't likely to stop occurring."
sichuan.164.a:0 "We should've acted faster."

sichuan.165.t:0 "Child Poverty Rises"
sichuan.165.d:0 "Poverty has sadly been a companion to most of Sichuan throughout our history. With the famine sweeping the nation, it's only gotten worse as families already on the brink have been hit hard by this crisis. Where before there was scarcity, now there's hardly anything for them at all. Without any safety net in hard times, the youngest are some of the worst affected by this."
sichuan.165.a:0 "Sichuan can't take much more of this!"

sichuan.166.t:0 "The Abandoned Children"
sichuan.166.d:0 "Because of the terrible conditions gripping the province recently, there's been a massive increase in abandoned children being left to fend for themselves. Sometimes it's because their parents simply have no means to feed their families, although often the tragic reason is that they aren't even in the picture any more. With thousands of cases like this already and many more appearing every day, the people are pleading that the government takes action to help the children of the province."
sichuan.166.a:0 "We *must* help them. No one else will."

sichuan.167.t:0 "Children of the Famine"
sichuan.167.d:0 "The worst hit by the famine have been the children of Sichuan. With food being scarce and disorder being rampant, no one's spared from the effects of the famine. Worst hit of all are the children with the tragic tales being too many to count. We cannot stand for this. Together with our international relief partners we've established a special government operation to safeguard them and our future. This includes everything from special allocations of food and other aid resources to prevent future tragedies, all the way up to providing shelter and orphanages in the cases where tragedy has already struck.\n\nThese are small and costly steps on the road to recovery from the famine, but it's worth every effort to let our people know that no matter what, the children of our province will not be forced to fend for themselves."
sichuan.167.a:0 "We take care of our own."

sichuan.168.t:0 "Refugees Flee the Province"
sichuan.168.d:0 "Seeing no future in Sichuan, people are fleeing the province in their thousands for the literal greener pastures to the north, south and east. Several smaller villages have been turned into ghost towns due to the massive number of people leaving them. Unless we put a quick end to this disastrous famine, this will only be the first wave out of many."

Others believe and hardly without reason either, that given the crisis following the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces on top of our own struggles that there's little we can do to help.

sichuan.170.d:0 "It's a tale as old as time itself. Whether it's a crate of relief goods that simply disappeared or a colonel requesting food rations for regiments that only exist on paper, the chaos in the country has opened the doors for a lot of shameless individuals to take something extra for themselves. Whether it's desperation or greed, we cannot stand for any of this. More efforts need to be taken to root out this kind of thievery."
sichuan.170.a:0 "Seriously? Stealing from starving peasants?"

sichuan.171.t:0 "Corruption Delays Relief Efforts"
sichuan.171.d:0 "Recently there have been reports of soldiers and officials extorting people for bribes in order to allow aid shipments to pass through, calling it a toll fee or something similarly disingenuous. An order has been issued that anyone caught engaging in these kinds of activities will have disciplinary actions taken against them. That should get them to think twice before attempting to earn a few coins this way."
sichuan.171.a:0 "Not this again..."

sichuan.172.t:0 "Black Market on Foodstuffs"
sichuan.172.d:0 "With a bag of rice being worth its weight in gold, smuggling food has become a lucrative business for criminal syndicates and ruthless opium farmers alike. Some are using hoarded resources and selling them at a premium to desperate people across Sichuan while more brazen criminals simply steal the food relief packages to sell on the black market. The police is doing everything they can to combat this shameless criminality, but their efforts are so far coming up sort in eliminating the problem altogether."
sichuan.172.a:0 "More profiteering off the suffering?"

sichuan.173.t:0 "KMT Raids on Food Shipments"
sichuan.173.d:0 "China is hardly a stranger to war and although we recently concluded our civil war, conflicts are still gripping China. In a worrying new trend, some of our international aid shipments have been raided by Kuomintang guerrillas. While we have yet to determine if they're from Yunnan, Guangxi or even the left-Kuomintang fighting in what used to be the League of Eight Provinces, we need to step up security to prevent these actions from happening in the future."
sichuan.173.a:0 "Now this is just ridiculous."

sichuan.174.t:0 "Prayers for Rain"
sichuan.174.d:0 "Whether driven by genuine belief or if he simply wished to instill hope in a despairing public, Liu Xiang has gathered several religious leaders from across the province to pray for rains to come back to Sichuan and put an end to the drought. While it's certainly a nice display, it's hardly done anything to help matters on the ground as days after the prayers were called there still isn't a cloud in the skies, let alone rain."

sichuan.175.t:0 "Dujiangyan, Damaged"
sichuan.175.d:0 "During the civil the Dujiangyan system for irrigating the area around the Baopingkou Channel was tampered with, causing a flooding meant to repulse Liu Xiang's forces without having to fight them in the field. It turns out, however, that by taking the easy route that day we've made the famine situation worse for ourselves. The operation by our engineers caused lasting damages that have now caused the channel to dry up. Without any means or irrigating the area, a drought has stricken the nearby fields, worsening an already dire situation. We have no one to blame for this ordeal but ourselves and we must now take responsibility for our actions."

We have just received a missive from Yen, stating his desire to help with the famine relief efforts. To that end, his Rural Reconstruction Movement has made a hefty donation to our relief efforts, and more aid is to come."

sichuan.200.t:0 "Affairs of the Red Basin"
sichuan.200.d:0 "The Sichuan Basin, also named the Red Basin for the red sandstone lining the soil, is currently in a sorry state. The hilly region boasts some of China's most fertile land, as well as ample avenues for irrigation and terrace farming. However, the last decades have not been kind to the province. A succession of inept governments since the late Qing era has left the province stagnated and isolated relative to the Chinese economy.\n\nIn the last three decades, cultivation of opium has become perhaps Sichuan's largest and most important economic sector, due to the high profits obtainable from the growth of the poppy. Opium brings much wealth, but it is also a major problem due to its effects on the population. Its unregulated growth was one of the causes of the Famine and also a source of conflict due to both criminal associations and even the Sichuanese warlords attempting to control the trade.\n\nBefore we can even start to work on improving our economy, we must decide the fate of the opium industry. The status quo is unsustainable, but there are a few options we could choose..."
sichuan.200.a:0 "We must eradicate opium from the province."
sichuan.200.b:0 "We shall bring the opium under our control."

sichuan.201.t:0 "Assessing the Spread of Opium"
sichuan.201.d:0 "Sichuan can make the claim of being the world's largest producer and consumer of opium with thousands of tons of the plant being cultivated within our borders every years. It's often said that Sichuan is the very rotten core of the Chinese opium crisis and has been ever since the Anglo-Chinese wars of the 19th century. Given the enormity of the scale of both the production and consumption of opium that takes places in Sichuan, no one is under any illusions that this will be a tremendously difficult task to tackle."
sichuan.201.a:0 "It must be done."

sichuan.202.t:0 "The Scale of Corruption"
sichuan.202.d:0 "From top to bottom, every segment of Sichuanese society is affected by the opium trade and its associated vices, to the point where the everyday functions of government and society are impaired. For instance, a soldier being paid in opium while his commander pockets his wages is an alarmingly common practice. Not only does this foster corruption and bad morale within the army, but as our recent civil war tragically proved, widespread opium addiction within the ranks led to needless deaths and suffering on all sides of the conflict. Similar practices are seen in other branches of the government, from local mayors enriching themselves through the drug trade, all the way down to petty bureaucrats accepting bribes and harassing the local population. Even the common man in Sichuan isn't immune to the temptations of this corruption, despite more often than not being merely its victim.\n\nWe have to come to terms with the daunting fact that corruption infests every facet of our society - from top to bottom - with hardly a single entity in Sichuan being spared from it. We have a long and hard road ahead of us if we are to curb this problem."
sichuan.202.a:0 "It's *that* bad?!"

sichuan.203.t:0 "Addiction to Opium"
sichuan.203.d:0 "The scourge of opium is so widespread in Sichuan that it's part of every-day life in the province. Its effects can be seen wherever you look, from the people in the streets that cast away their lives over it to the very top of society. No one is spared from its consequences. It's truly a sign of the times that sights that would've shocked anyone throughout most of history is seen as part of the daily routine in Sichuan."
sichuan.203.a:0 "We'll need to deal with this sooner of later."

sichuan.204.t:0 "A Plan Against Opium"
sichuan.204.d:0 "The commission tasked with stamping out the opium abuse and profiteering in Sichuan has started to draft plans for the monumental task of ridding Sichuan from this blight. The measures proposed point towards a difficult road ahead with even the most optimistic projections suggesting that this will be an incredibly costly and hard-fought endeavor.\n\nSome of the lighter measures include reforms and rather conventional anti-corruption measures. The commission also insists on the urgency to rehabilitate addicts and force them off their dependency, something that will burden our healthcare system. A representative of the army was also present at the meeting and laid out plans for what they can do by aiding the police's efforts in curtailing production and smuggling, although some of their methods may be a bit heavy-handed.\n\nIt's a long road ahead for us. Let's see this one through to the end."
sichuan.204.a:0 "Let's get started."

sichuan.205.t:0 "Rise of the Black Market"
sichuan.205.d:0 "As soon as the government began its initiative to crack down on opium addiction an inevitable side-effect was an explosion in opium pries and the rise of a black market. Already this underground economy is one of the larger in Sichuan in terms of GDP, all of which goes straight to the pockets of the criminals. The price hike is also sure to cause immense hardships for the addicts in Sichuan's population unless we intervene and provide them with the help they need. Breaking the black market should, however, be our utmost priority."
sichuan.205.a:0 "They are thugs and shall be dealt with."

sichuan.206.t.delays:0 "Our Efforts Are Delayed"
sichuan.206.d.delays:0 "With opium becoming worth its weight in gold thanks to the supply being pushed underground, there's a lot of money to be made in turning a blind eye to it. Officials routinely 'forget' to report opium being transported through their districts as the temptation of getting a cut from the black market is often all too tempting. Without stricter measures against administrative corruption, these issues are unlikely to go away."
sichuan.206.t.bribery:0 "Bribery Scandal"
sichuan.206.d.bribery:0 "A major scandal has rocked our army. Several military officials tasked with overseeing the eradication of opium fields have been arrested for distributing the seized opium stocks they were meant to destroy. Under their command, conscripts were also paid in opium packages while the money meant to pay for their salaries went straight into the pockets of the officers. They'll be dealt with harshly, but as long as there's money to be gained from corruption this isn't likely to be the last case of this kind."
sichuan.206.t.no_enforcement:0 "Lack of Law Enforcement"
sichuan.206.d.no_enforcement:0 "It's no secret that a crate of opium can fetch a police officer's yearly salary. They're only human and as such a lot of previously honest police have been caught taking bribes or even participating in smuggling operations as middlemen. The most common practice though is that of officers simply not reporting what they see and turning a blind eye to things, all in exchange for money and drugs. It seems that we need to step up our efforts to straighten out our police force. If they falter, so will our anti-opium efforts."
sichuan.206.a:0 "How deep can this go?!"

sichuan.207.t:0 "Start of the Anti-Corruption Campaign"
sichuan.207.d:0 "The efforts to stamp out corruption are already bearing fruit. Though arrests and convictions are few so far, we've made it known that no one is safe from the long arm of the law. The serious threat of being thrown into a dungeon if caught is forcing a lot of these spineless cowards to comply and do their jobs. Slowly but surely, the bureaucracies are being brought in line with the rest of our anti-opium initiative."
sichuan.207.a:0 "We shall root them out, one by one if need be!"

sichuan.208.t:0 "Corruption In The Civil Service"
sichuan.208.d:0 "Even our administration isn't safe from the temptation of making a quick buck in the wake of the war on opium. Embezzlement, theft and bribery is running rampant with several quite embarrassing arrests already having been made. There's still a lot that needs to be done to rid our administration of these weak-willed two-bit criminals, it seems."
sichuan.208.a:0 "How did this become so huge?!"

sichuan.209.t:0 "Corruption In The Army"
sichuan.209.d:0 "Large parts of our army has long suffered from a poor reputation for a widespread lack of professionalism. A lot of this pertains to opium with a large portion of our force being addicts that are often covertly paid in opium while their commanding officers pocket their requisitioned wages. These practices have long been tacitly accepted, but when we announced our anti-opium initiative they could hardly expect to be made exempt from the law. This has already caused problems both with soldiers and officers. The generals are going to have a hard time sorting out this mess."
sichuan.209.a:0 "Even in the army?!"

sichuan.210.t:0 "Smugglers In The Administration"
sichuan.210.d:0 "With the amount of money to be made from opium smuggling it was inevitable that officials in our administration would give in to the temptation of money. Already many lower and even middle-ranking officials have been put behind bars for aiding smuggling efforts in the countryside, usually by taking bribes in exchange for letting smuggling operations go unhindered. It seems that no matter how many we catch, there's always more corrupt officials behind every corner."

The now former official had been taking large bribes in exchange for reporting that operations that didn't even take place were in fact successful, which in some cases led to resources being diverted from much-needed law enforcement in the region. While the arrest is a positive development, the fact that it happened at all has humiliated the committee."
sichuan.211.t.bureau:0 "Sales Bureau Involved in Smuggling"

This has not only harmed our efforts to establish a healthy state monopoly in this business, but it has also led to large sums of opium going untaxed right under our noses. Those arrested now faces long jail sentences while we're forced to increase our efforts against the smugglers if we are to regain our market share."

sichuan.212.t:0 "Political Murders"
sichuan.212.d:0 "As the saying goes, if you're above the target, they'll fire at you. With their market share shrinking thanks to the efforts of our law enforcement, military and administration, a sad reality is that the criminals will retaliate against us. Today two officials that had been stalwart fighters against corruption were assassinated in broad daylight by hired thugs. The criminals soon joined them thanks to our police, but it shows that the smugglers are ready to stop at nothing to win this war."

sichuan.213.t:0 "Opium Fades"
sichuan.213.d:0 "The efforts to tackle opium have finally yielded significant results. Though the fight has been tough and a lot of hardships have been endured, the role opium is playing in the Sichuanese economy has started to diminish. Addicts in the streets is becoming a scarcer sight and the debauchery associated with the opium dens is now gradually being phased out of society. Slowly but surely, we're winning this fight."
sichuan.213.a:0 "We can't stop now!"

sichuan.214.t:0 "Rising Grain Production"
sichuan.214.d:0 "Opium as a crop is very labor-intensive, requiring huge amounts of work, resources and attention to cultivate. With the amount of opium being produced in Sichuan, a massive portion of our province's arable lands were devoted to opium production. With the growth of opium likely to lead to a jail sentence or worse, however, fewer and fewer farmers are growing it these days. This is a positive development as it has led to a gradual but significant increase in food crops being grown by our farmers. From having endured a famine not long ago, we may not be far from an agricultural boom."
sichuan.214.a:0 "Never another famine!"

sichuan.215.t:0 "Tax Evasion Discovered"
sichuan.215.d:0 "Sichuan has long had a problem with corruption. In large part caused by a dysfunctional government split between various warlords, a relic from those times is that tax collection has been very ineffective. Only 10-20% of what's collected seem to end up in [SZC.Capital.GetName], while the rest is lost to waste and fraud along the way."
sichuan.215.a:0 "Do we need to do everything ourselves?"

sichuan.216.t:0 "Tax Evasion Increases Enormously"
sichuan.216.d:0 "The plans to monopolize and tax opium has proven to not only be wildly unpopular, but it's also facing stiff resistance. Tax evasion, already a big problem before, has exploded since we put our plans into effect. As resistance to taxation comes from every level of society and not just a handful of dejected merchants, this will be a tremendous hurdle to overcome if our monopoly is to gain legitimacy."
sichuan.216.a:0 "Get rid of those parasites!"

sichuan.217.t:0 "Merchants Revolt Against Our Policies"
sichuan.217.d:0 "Many of Sichuan's largest merchant houses and farm owners are beginning to mount stiff resistance against our monopoly. With their combined resources, they hold a very significant power base in the country through their economic influence alone. This has allowed them to actively defy our newly imposed rules and taxes. In hindsight, we should probably have expected them to put up this kind of fight when faced with the prospect of being parted from their ill-gotten gains. We have no choice but to fight fire with fire on this one."
sichuan.217.a:0 "Together or alone, they'll be crushed all the same."

sichuan.218.t:0 "Smugglers Cut Into Our Profits"
sichuan.218.d:0 "With new taxes being created and tax collection being streamlined, the smuggling of opium has become an even more lucrative business than ever before. The high taxes and - allegedly - 'draconian' measures by the state has allowed the gangs to undercut what the government is offering through its legal venues. Despite the best efforts of the police and army, they're still able to operate with relative ease."
sichuan.218.a:0 "Hunt down those thugs!"

sichuan.219.t:0 "Illegal Opium Production"
sichuan.219.d:0 "Before the establishment of the Sales Bureau, the growth of opium was completely unregulated and undocumented. This has caused tremendous difficulties in establishing just how much opium is being grown illegally as no reliable records exist. Already our tax collectors and police are complaining that their work is like searching through the dark and that they're having a lot of difficulties bringing it all under the auspices of the state. Measures ought to be taken to expand the state's abilities to track and tax these matters!"
sichuan.219.a:0 "New law: all producers must now have a license!"

sichuan.220.t:0 "The Bureau Takes Action"
sichuan.220.d:0 "The creation of the Sales Monopoly Bureau to control has already had some successes. Through their early work, they've managed to establish framework for how to operate and how both legal and illegal production is to be dealt with. Slowly but surely, we can expect their hard work to fill our coffers as the efficiency of their efforts rise by the hour."
sichuan.220.a:0 "This should be profitable!"

sichuan.221.t:0 "Taxation Hampered By Corruption"
sichuan.221.d:0 "The temptation of money gets to even the best of us. We're facing a growing problem of officials taking bribes in order to let smugglers cut into our profits. Others are simply collecting taxes and pocketing the money for themselves, only to then report it as a shortfall caused by merchants evading taxes. It seems evident by now that we simply haven't implemented sufficiently harsh punishments for this kind of selfish criminality."
sichuan.221.a:0 "Get rid of those idiots!"

sichuan.222.t:0 "First Opium Profits Arrive"
sichuan.222.d:0 "Step by step, the Sales Monopoly Bureau has grown in power to become an all-encompassing, nationwide institution. Through their hard work, they've managed to cut tax evasion to a record low and brought an end to most major smuggling operations in the province. We're already starting to see tremendous profits pour into the state's coffers. With the amount of riches we're seeing from our monopoly's success, we should have no problems funding future government projects."
sichuan.222.a:0 "Excellent!"

sichuan.223.t:0 "Army Crushes Smugglers!"
sichuan.223.d:0 "Utilizing a mix of good intelligence and brute force, the army has swept in against a series of opium fields and smuggling hubs across Sichuan, burning and bombing several to ashes and inflicting grievous losses on the criminals. By the end of the day, a large quantity of illegal fields and warehouses were destroyed and a significant portion of the known smuggling ships used along the Yangtze were destroyed as well. All around, this operation has dealt a devastating blow to these criminals. Not only has this operation utterly routed several of the smuggler outfits, but it's also sure to send a clear message to criminals that their profiteering from narcotics will lead to their demise.\n\nThis decisive victory by the army has helped us to significantly improve the situation in our fight to curb opium and taught our army valuable lessors in fighting unconventional enemies in varied environments."
sichuan.223.a:0 "A cutting blow!"

sichuan.224.t:0 "The Army Fights Smugglers"
sichuan.224.d:0 "Recent days have seen a large offensive by the military against the smugglers plaguing Sichuan. A series of raids on illegal farms, smuggling warehouses and other facilities used by criminal gangs around Sichuan. Although not decisive, the army has won a victory while taking relatively light casualties from enemies armed with light arms smuggled into the country. This operation has also taught our troops and commanders a few valuable lessons in fighting foes in forests and towns."
sichuan.224.a:0 "Our soldiers fought well today."

sichuan.225.t:0 "Army Struggles Against Smugglers"
sichuan.225.d:0 "Our recent military operations against the smugglers were met with mixed results. Utilizing weapons left behind during the civil war, they fought back and locked our forces in a series of guerrilla battles that bogged them down. While we were able to disrupt their operations and kill several criminals, their tenacity allowed them to evacuate and relocate large amount of opium and weapons before we could destroy them. Although losses were only moderate and some progress was made, even the biggest optimists are having a hard time spinning this as a victory."
sichuan.225.a:0 "We'll get them next time."

sichuan.226.t:0 "Army Routed By Smugglers!"
sichuan.226.d:0 "Terrible news from the latest round of anti-smuggling operations. As embarrassing as it may sound, our inept commanders have allowed their soldiers to be routed by common bandits. Using military-grade weapons salvaged from the civil war and likely knowing where we would strike, they were able to ambush and gun down our forces. Losses are said to be very heavy and the nature of the attacks leave little doubts that we may have several moles within our ranks acting on the behalf of the smugglers. An investigation is already being carried out into the matter.\n\nThere's no way to spin this other than as a complete defeat and despite our efforts to suppress it the newspapers in [SZC.Capital.GetName] are already reporting on it as a humiliating defeat that has tarnished the reputation of [SZC.GetLeader]. Some members of our government are even demanding that we urgently rethink the military's role in our campaign against opium."
sichuan.226.a:0 "A shameful display! Reprimand the commander!"

sichuan.250.t:0 "Tian Songyao Expands Into Industrial Territory"
sichuan.250.d:0 "With Eastern Sichuan still disorderly following Xiang's flight and the fall of Chongqing, Tian Songyao has taken the opportunity to send his forces into the region, ostensibly to 'restore order'. While he has been effective in this aspect, his dislike for Yang Sen is well known and his ambitions remain a mystery for now."
sichuan.250.a:0 "Keep an eye on him."

sichuan.251.t:0 "Liu Cunhou Expands Into Officer Territory"
sichuan.251.d:0 "As we continue our efforts to restore order in Southern Sichuan, following the defeat of the Officer Department in the war, we have received some... interesting reports from our commanders in the field. Our estrwhile ally, general and former governor of Sichuan Liu Cunhou, has been unusually active in sending his troops to the region. It's certainly a nice gesture and for all intents and purposes not something to worry about, but Yang Sen suspects something may be afoot..."
sichuan.251.a:0 "Is he planning something?"

sichuan.252.t:0 "Shadowy Meetings"
sichuan.252.d:0 "Conflicting reports continue to arrive from the Eastern and Southern Sichuan. While warlord activity is nothing new in Sichuan, it seems something else may be going on. There have been several meetings between minor warlords in the region. Our spies have not obtained much information for now, but general Fan Shaozeng, Yang Sen's second in command, strongly suspects they might be planning a coalition of minor warlords.\n\nFor what reason, it remains unknown."
sichuan.252.a:0 "Alright, what's really going on here?"

sichuan.253.t:0 "The Baoding Efforts"
sichuan.253.d:0 "It seems history is repeating. Once again, the Chengdu army is is a sorry state, following the heavy fighting in the last months. As in 1931, after the first Officer Department expedition, the Baoding Department has taken up efforts to restore order in the south. Reports continue to come of areas successfully being pacified.\n\nWhile Baoding may yet prove to be a threat, for now our alliance with them continues to bring dividends."
sichuan.253.a:0 "Thanks, comrades!"

sichuan.254.t:0 "Tian Songyao Pledges Allegiance to Liu Cuhhou"
sichuan.254.d:0 "Unexpected news out of Nanbu, warlord Tian Songyao's main base to the northeast. Songyao, a man known for his political neutrality - having blocked off his domain to all forces involved in the civil war a few months back - but also for ruthless opportunism, has suddenly and publicly declared his allegiance to the former governor of Sichuan and Armament Department leader Liu Cunhou. Songyao is not doing this out of loyalty for the Department. Something dangerous is happening and Liu Cunhou is certainly involved in it.\n\nWe may be facing betrayal in the ranks."
sichuan.254.a:0 "Investigate this, now!"

sichuan.255.t:0 "An Offer from the Baoding Department"
sichuan.255.d:0 "With tensions rising in the province after the unexpected alliance between Liu Cunhou and Tian Songyao, we have received a missive from Deng Xihou, who claims to have valuable information about Liu's movements and intentions. Our spies have found nothing on Cunhou's plans so far and this is a tempting offer. However, their demands might yet prove to be too much."
sichuan.255.a:0 "Arrange this meeting. Secretly."

sichuan.256.t:0 "Meeting Deng Xihou"
sichuan.256.d:0 "Deng Xihou arrived tonight in Chengdu under utmost secrecy. In a shoddy basement under the old Manchu palace and after a few rounds of discussion a deal has been hashed out: Deng Xihou informs that Liu Cunhou has contacted him recently, asking for a public declaration of loyalty or at least neutrality. In exchange for guarantees of autonomy and government influence for the Baoding Department, as well as a freer hand in implementing their economic projects, both Deng Xihou and Liu Wenhui will pledge their loyalty to Yang Sen and the Armament Department.\n\nThe Baoding Department has its own interests, but Yang Sen's modernisation program mostly aligns with their goals. Furthermore, the Baoding troops are the best-trained troops in Sichuan and will certainly prove invaluable.\n\nThe ultimate decision now rests with Yang Sen."
sichuan.256.a:0 "Very well, we accept your deal."
sichuan.256.b:0 "Deng cannot be trusted."

sichuan.257.t:0 "Plots in the Dark"
sichuan.257.d:0 "With our deal signed and Baoding being given their long-desired autonomy and influence, Deng Xihou now has given our agents all the information they have on Liu Cunhou's movements. Liu Cunhou is planning to execute a coup a week from now, with support from Tian Songyao and several minor warlords in the province, having bought their support with promises of wealth, power or influence.\n\nWith detailed knowledge of Cunhou's planned movements and with support from the Baoding Department, we can turn this to our advantage. Liu's coup will become an inescapable trap when he launches his plot."
sichuan.257.a:0 "We'll be ready for him."

sichuan.258.t:0 "A Declaration of Neutrality"
sichuan.258.d:0 "News coming from Ya'an and Guanxian today. Following our refusal of Deng Xihou's deal, both his Northern troops and Liu Wenhui's Xikang troops have been steadily withdrawing towards their home territories. This has been followed today by a joint declaration from the two leaders, denouncing the incompetence of the Chengdu leadership. However, they have stopped short of declaring for Liu Cunhou and have instead professed their full neutrality from this moment onward. Already our soldiers are being evicted from their areas."
sichuan.258.a:0 "We may have made a mistake..."

sichuan.259.t:0 "Fires in the Garrison"
sichuan.259.d.trap:0 "As dawn rises over Chengdu Liu Cunhou jumped into action and his troops have now begun taking over the Manchu garrison that forms the Armament headquarters. Tian Songyao is also present in the city, commanding troops to take control of several strategic points. Unfortunately for him, we are well prepared for his treason..."
sichuan.259.d.coup:0 "Dawn rises to find Chengdu in absolute chaos. Unexpected by anyone in the Armament leadership and believed to be still in his base of Daxian, Liu Cunhou's troops have now begun taking over the Manchu garrison that forms the Armament headquarters. On the city streets, Tian Songyao's goons have been quick to assert their control over our drowsy troops. Heavy fighting has broken inside the old Manchu garrison that is now the Armament Department headquarters and Yang Sen is nowhere to be seen."
sichuan.259.a:0 "Spring the trap!"
sichuan.259.b:0 "Chengdu hangs in the balance..."

sichuan.260.t:0 "The Countercoup"
sichuan.260.d:0 "Within hours of his attempted coup, Liu Cunhou has utterly failed in any of his objectives. With advance knowledge of the coup, Yang Sen and Fan Shaozeng feigned chaos in the garrison, which Liu Cunhou took as proof of his success. When they attempted to take the rest of the building, several battalions hidden around the enormous complex sprung into action, forming barricades and trapping Cunhou's soldiers. Looking down at Liu Cunhou's corpse on the floor, Yang Sen orders his loyal general Fan Shaozeng to sweep the building and force the surrender of any remnants of Liu's troops.\n\nDown in the lower city, Tian Songyao lays dead on the streets, killed by Baoding agents infiltrated among the populace.\n\nThe coup is over and peace can now finally return to Sichuan."
sichuan.260.a:0 "A traitor's death."

sichuan.261.t:0 "Liu Cunhou Assumes Leadership"
sichuan.261.d:0 "The fighting was heavy, but brief. Caught completely unaware, Yang Sen's troops were no match for Liu Cunhou and Tian Songyao's troops and by noon most of the city was solidly under their control. Yang Sen and Fan Shaozeng are dead, killed in the firefight, while their now-leaderless troops have surrendered.\n\nFrom the courtyard of the old Manchu garrison, Liu Cunhou has declared his assumption of the Armament leadership and nobody is left in the city to oppose him."
sichuan.261.a:0 "Once again, Liu is governor of Sichuan."

sichuan.262.t:0 "Sichuan declares support for the Central Government"
sichuan.262.d:0 "Despite their recent troubles, it seems [SZC.GetLeader]'s Armament Department has managed to beat the odds and retain control of the province, bringing it into our sphere. We have received a missive from [SZC.GetLeader] declaring his loyalty to our government."
sichuan.262.a:0 "One more province into the fold!"

sichuan.263.t:0 "Sichuan Sends Support"
sichuan.263.d:0 "In a positive turn of events, our ranks have recently been bolstered by a steady stream of reinforcements from our friends friends in Sichuan. The League may have fallen on hard times, but it seems that we still have allies to count on. We'll put these forces to good use as we stamp out the last of these insurrectionists from our lands!"
sichuan.263.a:0 "Some good news, at least."

sichuan.264.t:0 "Jiang Baili Arrives In Sichuan"
sichuan.264.d:0 "Jiang Baili, second-in-command to the former Jade Marshal, Wu Peifu, was feared dead after the fall of Luoyang. Late last night, however, a convoy of trucks arrived on the outskirts of Chengdu. Unmarked, a military patrolman ordered them to turn back from the city. When they stopped, however, the patrolman was shocked. Stepping out of the first truck, arm wrapped in a blood-soaked bandage and face covered in shrapnel wounds, was Jiang Baili.\n\nThe guardsman quickly flagged the convoy to [SZC.GetLeader]'s compound in the center of the city, where he received Jiang and the remnants of Beijing's command structure. Jiang pleaded to [SZC.GetLeader], imploring him to assemble his forces and prepare for a campaign of reconquest against the Manchu."
sichuan.264.a:0 "We will cast down the Manchu traitors, together!"
sichuan.264.b:0 "Send him away."

sichuan.265.t:0 "Jiang Baili Resurfaces!"
sichuan.265.d:0 "Though sources in Luoyang swore they saw Jiang Baili die in the viscous battle to recapture the city, rumors have surfaced that the Jade Marshal's protege escaped to Sichuan, where he and [SZC.GetLeader] are preparing some sort of a campaign of reconquest against us! [SZC.GetLeader] was loyal to Wu's old regime and these despicable Zhili remnants must be crushed soon!"
sichuan.265.a:0 "Drat."
sichuan.265.b:0 "(Play as the Zhili Remnants)"

sichuan.266.t:0 "Growing Rifts"
sichuan.266.d:0 "Ever since 1927 the military and political wings of the Zhili clique had never been entirely on the same page. While Wu Peifu's personal diplomacy and power held the two groups together, exile has somehow driven the two groups further apart. Yan Huiqing, a senior bureaucrat, has frequently argued with Jiang Baili and the rest of the Zhili military remnants over the best course of action and many in the former Sichuan provincial government are beginning to fear a deep rift opening."
sichuan.266.a:0 "We cannot be divided now!"

sichuan.267.t:0 "The Civilian Wing Dominant"
sichuan.267.d:0 "Yan Huiqing and the civilian wing of the clique have emerged victorious! Comprised of former Harmony Association bureaucrats, this group aims to assert civilian control over the military and avoid the missteps that lead to the Manchu Coup, though whether they can actually accomplish this is as of yet unclear."
sichuan.267.a:0 "We must learn from our mistakes."

sichuan.268.t:0 "The Military Wing Dominant"
sichuan.268.d:0 "The military wing of the Zhili remnants, lead by Jiang Baili, has emerged victorious in the power struggle in Chengdu. Promising a swift attack at the still-weak Manchu government, many across China are already preparing for the next major warlord conflict."
sichuan.268.a:0 "We must retake what we lost."

sichuan.269.t:0 "Modernising the Zhili Officer Corps"
sichuan.269.d:0 "Our high command was devastated following the disastrous coup and the ensuing civil war. Many who survived blame the coup itself on Wu Peifu's inability to enact meaningful reforms and in their new exile have begun a massive reform effort of the surviving forces. Western doctrines are being applied and Jiang and his surviving officers hope that these new measures will be enough to defeat the nascent and inexperienced Manchu armies."
sichuan.269.a:0 "Excellent."

sichuan.270.t:0 "Join the Zhili Alliance?"
sichuan.270.d:0 "The [SZC.GetName], claiming to represent the last remnants of the former Zhili order, have reached out to us with an offer. They propose we join together to bring down the Manchu menace and restore China to its former republican glory under the Zhili banner."
sichuan.270.a:0 "Of course! Old friends must stick together in trying times."
sichuan.270.b:0 "No, this is too risky."

sichuan.271.t.accept:0 "[From.GetName] has accepted"
sichuan.271.d.accept:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our request, pledging their troops to bring down the Manchu upstarts!"

sichuan.271.t.refuse:0 "[From.GetName] has accepted"
sichuan.271.d.refuse:0 "[FROM.GetName] has refused our request, not wishing to incur Beijing's wrath. No matter! We will crush them alone!"
sichuan.271.b:0 "Damnation!"

sichuan.272.t:0 "The Zhili Clique Returns"
sichuan.272.d:0 "After the assassination of Wu Peifu in Beijing in the Manchu Coup and the subsequent collapse of the Zhili Clique, most consigned the former warlord alliance to the dustbin of history. Yet, recent developments have cast doubt upon these assumptions.\n\nRumors swirl that Marshal Jiang Baili, thought dead after the fall of Luoyang, miraculously survived Luoyang and allied himself with the province's governor Yang Sen - a former ally of Wu Peifu. Both leaders are now rallying the disparate Zhili remnants that fled the North after the Coup and already anti-Manchu propaganda has begun to spread into the surrounding provinces. It seems the Zhili Clique is far more resilient than it was given credit for."
sichuan.272.a:0 "Do they ever give up?"
sichuan.272.b:0 "A new threat to the Manchu."

sichuan.273.t:0 "A Zhili General Arrives in Sichuan"
sichuan.273.d:0 "Following the fall of Luoyang and Wuhan, many feared a vast majority of the Zhili-aligned generalship dead. Early this morning, however, a general and some of his retainers straggled into Chengdu, hauling a small reserve of gold. "
sichuan.273.a:0 "Welcome back!"

sichuan.274.t:0 "Luoyang Retaken"
sichuan.274.d:0 "Great news, sir! Reports have arrived that our troops have retaken Luoyang, former seat of the Jade Marshal and the nexus of Zhili power. Already, some Manchu troops have begun to desert their old overlords and join our forces!"
sichuan.274.a:0 "One step closer to Beijing."

sichuan.275.t:0 "The Fall of Wuhan"
sichuan.275.d:0 "Wuhan - the site of the greatest battles of the last century - has fallen to our forces! Already our troops are praising this as a repeat of the 'Miracle of 1927' and there is a growing sense that we are on a path to retake Beijing and restore our rule to China!"
sichuan.275.a:0 "Where it ended. And where it shall begin again."

sichuan.276.t:0 "The Fall of Beijing"
sichuan.276.d:0 "Great news sire! A telegram arrived just minutes ago from our forces in Beijing! It is short but the message is clear - 'BEIJING VICTORY'. Already Chengdu has erupted into celebrations as the perfidious Manchu, the last remnants of a bygone era, are deposed!"
sichuan.276.a:0 "A triumphant return."

sichuan.277.t:0 "Fall of the Manchu"
sichuan.277.d:0 "During the fighting in Beijing, several detachments of troops broke into the Forbidden City, searching for the Emperor and his clan. They found him hiding behind his throne, cowering in fear. As they tried to drag him from the room his brother, Prince Pujie, burst in with a few guardsmen and they suicidally charged our forces.\n\nWith the Emperor captured and his brother dead, we have decided to throw Puyi into a prison, where he will rot forever!"
sichuan.277.a:0 "No more Emperors!"

sichuan.278.t:0 "Remembering the Jade Marshal"
sichuan.278.d:0 "Now that our reconquest of Beijing is complete, [SZC.GetLeader] has called for a day of mourning and remembrance across the nation for Wu Peifu. Some may claim that his hubris and pride lead to the Manchu Coup, but none will deny his steady leadership and brilliance through the 1920s and early 1930s."
sichuan.278.a:0 "A sad day."

sichuan.350.t:0 "Tian Songyao Rejoins the Department"
sichuan.350.d:0 "Ever the opportunist, Tian Songyao left us so as to not draw the ire of Yang Sen after his failed coup in 1923. Once Yang fell from his grace and we rose to power, the turncoat Tian has pleaded with us to bring allow him back into the department."
sichuan.350.a:0 "Welcome him back."
sichuan.350.b:0 "Kick him out of Sichuan!"

sichuan.351.t:0 "Order Restored in Chongqing"
sichuan.351.d:0 "After Xiang fled the city, the Industrial Corps and its administrative functions fell apart. The head of the snake was, as they say, cut off. Since then, the city and its nearby regions has suffered widespread turmoil. From commoners struggling to deal with the chaos to opportunists looting and robbing in the wake of the chaos, the city has hardly known a peaceful moment for a long time.\n\nWith this in mind, we're pleased to report that the efforts of our military police has finally managed to quell the worst unrest. For the most part, order in the city has been restored and the basic functions of the local administration are up and running again. It won't be long until business as usual can return to Chongqing."
sichuan.351.a:0 "Good news, at least."

sichuan.352.t:0 "The Diarchy"
sichuan.352.d:0 "The Baoding Department is unique in the sense that it's not controlled by one strong warlord. Instead, it's noted for its strong cooperation between its most dominant figures. On one side, there's Deng Xihou, a career officer mostly concerned with military theory, social reforms and rural development. On the other, there's Liu Wenhui, Liu Xiang's uncle, who is known for his dedication towards academic and administrative reform.\n\nTogether they form an equilibrium between traditionalism and reformism, having a good track record of working together. While having a system of balancing influences has saved the department from spiralling into the kinds of internal squabbling and feuding that has marked many other cliques in China, should this balance be broken and one said gain too much prominence over the other there's little doubt that the Baoding Department could fall victim to these kinds of problems as well. As such, care should be taken to preserve the diarchy and not have it become seen as yet another Chinese autocracy."
sichuan.352.a:0 "Together, for a better Sichuan."

sichuan.353.t:0 "Liu Wenhui Asserts Control"
sichuan.353.d:0 "With his efforts to modernize Sichuan bearing fruit, the people in the cities and beyond have seen a clear rise in their lives thanks to him. This has been accompanied by a well-oiled administrative body and state apparatus that, thanks in no small part to his initiative, have helped him rise to prominence. While the cooperative spirit of the diarchy remains, there's no doubt that Liu's successful reforms have made him the de-facto controller of the Baoding Department for the time being."
sichuan.353.a:0 "Sichuan's modernity will be the envy of China!"

sichuan.354.t:0 "Deng Xihou Asserts Control"
sichuan.354.d:0 "After a series of popular reforms, Deng Xihou's prominence has gone from strength to strength. With widespread support from the rural population and soldiers, his reforms are at the top of the Sichuanese agenda. While the diarchy remains in a spirit of healthy cooperation, it's evident that the more traditionally-minded Deng Xihou's faction currently stands out as the current de-facto controller of the Baoding Department."
sichuan.354.a:0 "Sichuan shall become a model for all of China!"

sichuan.355.t:0 "Liu Wenhui Protests Military Direction"
sichuan.355.d:0 "The strength of friendship and cooperation is measured not only by the positives, but the ability to withstand and overcome the negatives. Recently, Liu Wenhui's faction has urged a change in course as Deng Xihou has steered the department into an overwhelmingly militarist direction. While no one can doubt that Sichuan has some of the most well-drilled soldiers in China and that Deng has had great successes in helping out those in the countryside, this has come at the expense of other areas of reform. Indeed, the emphasis of one over the other has led to the administrative side being neglected. Deng is being urged to return to a more balanced approach, lest a more drastic correction becomes necessary."
sichuan.355.a:0 "He might have a point..."

sichuan.356.t:0 "Deng Xihou Protests Industrial Direction"
sichuan.356.d:0 "In light of the overwhelming focus on industrialization and great projects in the major cities, Deng Xihou has started to voice concerns that this has come at the expense of not only the army, but the rural development as well. Indeed, while no one doubts that he's had successes in his fields, this has come at the expense of an army nearing disarray and a rural population faring little better now than they did before the civil war. In light of this, Deng and other high-ranking members of the department are urging a swift change of course towards the balance that has previously been the hallmark of the department. If this doesn't happen, there's a certainty that a more drastic course correction measure will be seen."
sichuan.356.a:0 "He might have a point..."

sichuan.400.t:0 "The Warlord of Xikang"
sichuan.400.d:0 "The rivalry between Liu Xiang and his uncle Liu Wenhui is a long and bitter one. Now, however, it seems like it's about to reach its conclusion. In the wake of the routing of the Baoding Department during the war, Wenhui was able to escape to his power base in the mountainous region of Xikang, just to the east of Tibet. While the remnants of the Baoding force are badly scarred by their loss in the civil war, the sheer distance between Chongqing and Wenhui's mountain stronghold makes a swift military victory unlikely. The logistical nightmare of such a venture alone makes it unthinkable without serious preparations.\n\nOne way or another, this situation will need to be resolved if Liu Xiang is to fully consolidate his victory."
sichuan.400.a:0 "A matter to be dealt with, sooner or later."

sichuan.401.t:0 "A Question of Family"
sichuan.401.d:0 "Since the formal end of Sichuan's civil war, there's been an ongoing conflict between Liu Xiang and his uncle. The opium riches has allowed Wenhui to gradually recover his forces and with the control of the mountains he currently holds the initiative. As time goes by, Wenhui will grow stronger, making the already difficult task of invading his mountainous stronghold more difficult with each day that passes.\n\nLiu Xiang must now decide how to deal with his wayward uncle. A peaceful solution isn't impossible, but Xiang's price for an alliance will not be cheap. On the other hand, an open conflict is anything but a certain victory."
sichuan.401.a:0 "Our interests align - offer him an alliance!"
sichuan.401.b:0 "He will submit, like all the others."

sichuan.402.t:0 "A Letter From Xikang"
sichuan.402.d:0 "Today a courier arrived in Chongqing bearing a most important message for Liu Xiang. Sparse on the formalities, it was quick and to the point. In it, Xiang's uncle curtly stated that he would be open to working together with him, albeit at a price. \n\nFrustratingly enough, his price isn't gold, but reforms. He wants to see his dreams of a new Sichuan be realized under Xiang's rule. With widespread social and educational reforms that don't fully align with Xiang's own vision for Sichuan. Agreeing would mean a peaceful end to the conflict, but is this a price worth paying for such a thing?"
sichuan.402.a:0 "Very well, an affordable price."
sichuan.402.b:0 "Who does he think he is!?"

sichuan.403.t:0 "Alliance of Two Lius"
sichuan.403.d:0 "An uneasy alliance has formed between nephew and uncle, formalized by a tense meeting in Chongqing where the pair tried their best to pretend that everything was fine. Wenhui clearly doesn't trust his nephew and Xiang isn't pleased with the sacrifices he has been forced to commit to in order to secure this deal. Hands were shook, a picture was taken for the press and the meeting ended almost as soon as it started.\n\nWhile the situation isn't ideal, the truce seems to hold for now. With the warlord of Xikang brought into his fold, Liu Xiang can now return to pursuing his ambitions for a greater Sichuan."
sichuan.403.a:0 "Let's see if this will last..."

sichuan.404.t:0 "Xikang's Defiance"
sichuan.404.d:0 "To Xiang's great frustration, his uncle has been biding his time in the mountains since the civil war ended. It seems evident by now that if no action is taken, Xikang will remain a de-facto autonomous region beyond the control of Chongqing.\n\nFinding this situation intolerable, Liu Xiang must now decide how to act. Either remove him through undderhanded means, or prepare for an invasion of Xikang itself and evict Wenhui from his little mountain kingdom."
sichuan.404.a:0 "Have him assassinated."
sichuan.404.b:0 "Send in the troops!"

sichuan.405.t:0 "A Bullet, Narrowly Missed"
sichuan.405.d:0 "While Ya'an's remoteness from the rest of Sichuan has spared it from the worst of the civil war's violence, any illusions of it lasting were dashed today as Xiang fired the first shots in the war between him and his uncle.\n\nThe city hall which had become Wenhui's de-facto headquarters since assuming power was the scene of the attempted crime. With only a narrow window to take him out, an assassin opened for on him with a scoped Karabiner 98k rifle from a nearby building as Wenhui exited his car on the short way to the building itself. It was a brazen act that nearly succeeded. As luck would have it though, the shot miraculously missed Wenhui by a mere fraction of an inch, leaving a mark as it bassed near the very fabric of his uniform but spared the warlord from any injuries. His personal bodyguards then quickly covered him and rushed him into the building, leaving the sniper with no hopes to succeed with a second shot.\n\nThe tight security in the city meant that the culprit was apprehended by soldiers before he could escape. On pain of death, he confessed to everything, as if an admission of Xiang's involvement was really needed at this point. Absolutely furious at the cowardice and brazenness of his nephew for trying to kill him, Liu Wenhui ordered his forces into full war readiness. It seems that war will have to resolve this matter now."
sichuan.405.a:0 "Drat."

sichuan.406.t:0 "Liu Wenhui Invades the Basin"
sichuan.406.d:0 "Early this morning, the restructured remnants of the Baoding Department under the leadership of Liu Wenhui invaded the Sichuanese basin. After the attempt on his life, this was seen as an inevitability. Knowing that an invasion was imminent, Xiang had ordered his troops to prepare for the inevitable, meaning that it wasn't long until the two armies met.\n\nThe first battle took place between the bulk of Wenhui's forces and a few smaller brigades of troops from the Industrial Corps sent to guard the long border with Wenhui's domain. The length of this border, however, meant that Xiang had a hard time creating a defensive strongpoint, meaning that this force was mostly meant to hold off the invasion long enough to fall back once the rest of the Industrial Corps had mobilized and prepared for a counter-attack. The battle would be a draw, with Xiang's soldiers being forced to withdraw sooner than expected, but hampering the advance of Wenhui enough to prevent them from overrunning the basin. The war is far from over however and for now it seems like either side can win this."
sichuan.406.a:0 "It's war, then."

sichuan.407.t:0 "Liu Wenhui Blocks Entry into Xikang"
sichuan.407.d:0 "As expected, the march on Ya'an was proving to be a difficult venture. As soon as his forces entered Xikang, they were met with prepared defenses in the mountains with few roads to speak of, meaning that even small squads with machine guns and mortars could hold off Xiang's forces for hours and inflict debilitating losses upon them as narrow roads were turned into kill zones. Be that as it may, the Industrial Corps marches on, evidently determined to take the mountains by force no matter the costs."
sichuan.407.a:0 "It's war, then."

sichuan.408.t:0 "Two Lius' War"
sichuan.408.d:0 "What started out as border skirmishing quickly developed into the two standing armies trying to advance into one-another's territory. A back and forth followed, as neither side was initially able to gain a clear advantage over the other. While the Industrial Corps is stronger on paper, their task of taking Ya'an is a daunting one to say the least. Once more, Sichuan has fallen into a bloody civil war."
sichuan.408.a:0 "Punish this insolence!"

sichuan.409.t:0 "The Two Lius' War"
sichuan.409.d:0 "After the victory of the Industrial Corps in the recent Sichuanese civil war, the ambitious and aggressive Liu Xiang rose to power. Many observers both at home and abroad saw this as a worrisome development as few believe even for a second that his lust for power will stop at his own border. Recently, however, an opportunity to remove him has shown itself.\n\nThere is a known rivalry between Liu Xiang and his uncle Liu Wenhui, the latter still controlling large portions of the remnants of the Baoding Department which fought in the last civil war. This rivalry has now turned into yet another civil war between the two. While it's certain to harm Xiang's ambitions regardless of outcome, this does present the opportunity to bring the far less aggressive Baoding Department to power. Perhaps we should tip the scales of the conflict by providing covert aid to Liu Wenhui's efforts to oust his nephew?"
sichuan.409.a:0 "Send help to Liu Wenhui."

sichuan.410.d:0 "The rush to war seems to have had unintended consequences for the Industrial Corps. Tian the turncoat has switched sides numerous times in the past and served every master known to Sichuan. While a backstabbing opportunist, his considerable personal force has still allowed him to scrape by. It seems that now, however, he's officially declared himself loyal to the Baoding Department once more and sided with them, as he did over a decade ago. Why he had this convenient change of heart in the middle of a war is anyone's guess, but anyone that knows this snake ought to know that it likely won't be his last."
sichuan.410.a:0 "Traitor!"

sichuan.411.t:0 "The Battle of Meishan"
sichuan.411.d:0 "Regardless of who shot first, the Baoding remnants weren't going to survive for long if they advanced into the basin. As such, they had been predominantly relied on the harsh terrain of Xikang to wear down the Industrial Corps. They could hold off the superior enemy forces with relative ease and few numbers by simply funneling them through prepared defenses. While this slowed them down, this was a war of attrition where one side was able to replace their losses while Xikang was devoid of an industrial base.\n\nEventually, the slow push by the Industrial Corps put the bulk of their forces outside of the city of Meishan, the last major strategic obstacle on the road to Ya'an. While Baoding had bought themselves plenty of time to prepare their defenses, they were clearly in an unenviable position as they fought an enemy that, on paper, was superior. It had, however, been whithered down by attrition and a portion of the heavy equipment was still being transported through the mountain passes.\n\nLiu Xiang must now choose: mount a full-on assault without the support of the department's heavy equipment, or wait for it to arrive and utilize it to full effect. Attacking now should provide a good chance for surprise, but it's a risky gamble against the city's prepared defenses. On the other hand, it would at the very least take several days to bring the artillery pieces to the front, giving Baoding valuable time to prepare."
sichuan.411.a:0 "Storm the city now!"
sichuan.411.b:0 "Wait for reinforcements before attacking."

SZC_meishan_assault:0 "The mountains were their only ally. With them behind us, they have nothing. They're poorly supplied, disorganized and under-equipped. Even without our heavy guns, we should have enough firepower to make short work of them. Once we storm the city, their defenses are sure to crumble before the might of the Industrial Corps."
SZC_meishan_reinforce:0 "Although they're in a difficult position, without our artillery to take out their cannons and machine guns we'll endure staggering losses. Although getting them here will prove very difficult given the terrain, more cautious officers believe it's well worth the effort."

sichuan.412.t:0 "The Assault on Meishan"
sichuan.412.d:0 "Choosing to attack right away, the Industrial Corps was pitted against the city's defenders without their heavy equipment. Even without them however, the divisions had many more mortars, machine guns and light cannons to prove a match for the city's defenders. Baoding had already lost most of their heavy equipment in the first phase of the civil war that saw Xiang take Chengdu. With little chance to replace these losses, the city's defenses were rather simple, all told. Trenches, old machine guns and rifles made up the bulk of them, with an occasional cannon forming a handful of strong points in a wedge outline.\n\nAlthough Xiang's forces faced heavy losses in taking the city, the main defensive line was broken within hours of fighting. Wenhui wasn't a brilliant strategist by any stretch of the imagination and his primitive defensive lines offered few surprises for the attackers. After the centerpiece of the defensive line was broken, the Industrial Corps swarmed into the city and shattered the remaining defenses from the sides. Although Liu Wenhui managed to escape, prisoners of war already tell that morale is low and that even he has no hopes of winning."
sichuan.412.a:0 "The family feud will soon have a winner."

sichuan.413.t:0 "The Xikang Rout"
sichuan.413.d:0 "While opting to wait, not only did Xiang give the defenders more time to prepare, but his forces were constantly subjected to harassment by Baoding forces in the mountains. Getting supplies to the front was a logistical nightmare and many of the artillery pieces being moved were damaged or lost to the perilous mountain roads as Xiang had ordered haste to go before safety.\n\nOnce the attack was ready, the few artillery pieces that made it to the front did not make much of a difference. Xiang's forces had been whithered down by the thousands through attrition, both at the hands of the mountains and rear-guard actions by Baoding. It was a demoralized force that eventually attacked the well-prepared defenses and the losses suffered to nature quickly showed. While the defenses around the city were an unimaginative imitation of Weltkrieg-era fortifications, the few cannons and machine guns that Wenhui possessed were able to hold the line against the enemy, albeit narrowly. After several successive assaults, the city had been damaged, the defenses were badly battered, but Xiang's vanguard had been destroyed. Thousands laid dead on the ground, many more were injured or taken prisoner.\n\nWith no hopes of taking the city, Xiang is now forced to retreat from Xiking. While no force in Sichuan was able to match the Industrial Corps in the field, the Industrial Corps had finally been bested by the mountains themself more than anything else. As they retreated, it was a disaster akin to Napoleon's flight from Moscow as the terrain and pursuers kept whithering down the once might Industrial Corps. There's already talk about a mutiny within the Industrial Corps and Xiang's future seems very uncertain."
sichuan.413.a:0 "The family feud will soon have a winner."

sichuan.414.t:0 "The First Naval Exercise"
sichuan.414.d.landlocked:0 "Despite being a landlocked country, Liu Xiang insisted that a navy was of utmost importance. He envisioned a future where mighty ships that would rival the German Hochseeflotte in its finest days would patrol the Yangtze River and protect Sichuanese trade. The 'first steps towards greatness' have earned Sichuan complete naval dominance in the region, granted, but simply because no one bothered with contesting it. Nevertheless, a victory is a victory. Soon it was announced that a public display of this newly attained naval might was to be had. To impress the locals and terrify future foes, of course.\n\nThe public was invited to this first naval exercise showing off the strength of the Navy. The biggest warships on this part of the Yangtze were a handful of old steam-powered ships that had been hastily converted from their old civilian roles and pressed into military service. The makeshift warships had iron plates fitted onto them, as well as batteries of guns that had been taken from local artillery regiments and forcibly converted to fit this new role. Once the naval exercise kicked off in full force, it didn't take long before the obvious problems started to show up.\n\nSichuan's first admiral must've drawn a sigh of relief when the ships could actually move despite the increase in armor and armaments. Unbearably slowly, granted, but at least they didn't sink to the bottom of the river. It would all culminate into a triple gun salute, but when the old howitzers fired, the recoil of the shots nearly made the old steam ship capsize. Panic gripped the crew and several of them jumped off into the Yangtze, fearing that their ship would fully turn over. While their worst fears were not realized, this whole farce has led to a fair bit of ridicule as the narrowly avoided naval disaster led to more than a few satirical poems being written at Xiang's expense. While the people are laughing (at least when they're sure the secret police isn't around), the same can't be said for Xiang.\n\nOr Sichuan's first admiral, for that matter."
sichuan.414.d.not_landlocked:0 "Despite Sichuan's humble beginnings as a landlocked province, Liu Xiang always insisted that a navy was of utmost importance. He envisioned a future where mighty ships that would rival the German Hochseeflotte in its finest days would patrol the South China Sea to protect Sichuan's growing status as a regional power. The 'first steps towards greatness' have not impressed the other naval powers in the region, granted, but Xiang has nonetheless earned the attention of the naval powers in the region, if only by virtue of actually managing to building a navy in the first place. To commemorate this, it was soon announced that a public display of this newly attained naval might was to be had. To impress the locals and terrify future foes, of course.\n\nThe public was invited to this first naval exercise showing off the strength of the mighty navy. The "Grand Sichuanese Navy" currently only consisted of old steam-powered ships that had been hastily converted from their old civilian roles and pressed into military service.

sichuan.415.t:0 "The Mighty Air Force"
sichuan.415.d:0 "Today the first shipment of imported aircraft arrived in Chongqing for official inspection from none other than the triumphant Liu Xiang himself. The whole affair had a very ceremonial flair to it more than anything else, however. This was a way to show off the beginnings of Sichuan's so-called Mighty Air Force to the world, or at the very least the assembled Chinese press. While the triumphant bombast was over-the-top for the occasion, Xiang was right to mark this as an important occasion marking the modernization of Sichuan and the province's rapid adoption of contemporary military technology and methods.\n\nThe planes were hardly anything spectacular by global military standards, granted. While they were fine machines in the Weltkrieg, the assembled collection of formerly mothballed holdovers would hardly cause the lords in Beijing to quake in their boots - nor the emperor in Tokyo, for that matter. By the standards of China's oft-neglected interior, however, these were a great leap into the twentieth century. Given the state of the regional powers, these handful of relics could fly over the mountains and gather information on enemy positions that would be very difficult to gather on foot. The often narrow terrains of mountain passes and openness of the basins meant that even a Weltkrieg-era holdover with a pair of synchronized machine guns could effectively harass infantry formations that had never faced a strafing run before.\n\nFor all his bluster about an air force that could dominate the skies over China, he might be very right, at least as far as his own backyard is concerned. All that said, pictures were taken of Xiang shaking the hands of pilots and engineers and the stories would be printed the following day."
sichuan.415.a:0 "Mark my words, Sichuan shall rule the skies!"

sichuan.416.t:0 "The Chongqing Air Parade"
sichuan.416.d:0 "It wasn't long after the creation of Sichuan's 'mighty air force' that Liu Xiang declared that all of China and even the world was to tremble before its might. Eager to show to allies and enemies alike that Sichuan was to dominate the skies above China from here on out, the Chongqing Air Parade was hastily organized to demonstrate Sichuanese aerial dominance.\n\nWhile the air force itself was merely a collection of old interwar planes collecting dust in European and Japanese warehouses, it certainly impressed the crowds that had gathered to see the spectacle. After all, most of Sichuan's peasants and city-dwellers alike had scarcely even seen such flying machines in photographs. With this being the first time some of these pilots had set foot inside a cockpit, the air parade was a far cry from its counterparts in Canada and Germany and the rookie pilots would simply start and perform the most basic maneuvers  before landing, usually without any complications.\n\nSimple as it may have been, this was enough to draw applause from the crowds, many of whom were genuinely proud that their nation could boast such modern European airplanes. Towards the end of the show Xiang offered Pan Wenhua, the mayor of Chongqing, a chance to try flying along in one of the two-seat fighters. Pan, perhaps a bit weary from knowing just how inexperienced these pilots were, politely declined the offer, citing his busy schedule running the capital. His adjutant would get the honor in his place and thus the old fighter set off for the final display of the day, ordered by Xiang himself to push the plane to its limits. All remaining audience members saw the plane lift, but amazement soon turned into horror as black smoke started to pour out from the old plane's engine. The inexperienced pilot struggled to regain control of his plane as its altitude fluctuated back and forth until finally and tragically his attempts caused the plane's engine to stall, sending it down to the ground like a comet.\n\nBoth the pilot and the passenger died on the spot, to the shock and horror of the civilian and military members of the audience. It wasn't long afterwards that Pan, realizing of just how narrowly he cheated death, started to quietly suspect that this had been an assassination attempt on him by the paranoid Liu Xiang. This caused discord in the alliance between him and Liu Xiang, not to mention region-wide ridicule at the farcical, yet tragic, air parade over the outskirts of Chongqing."
sichuan.416.a:0 "Someone will be shot for this!"

sichuan_industrial.18.t:0 "Liu Xiang Falls Ill"
sichuan_industrial.18.d:0 "Today, Xiang gathered the general staff of Sichuan for a routine meeting. What started out as something as ordinary as a review of new uniforms and equipment took a turn for the bizarre, however, as Liu Xiang started to suddenly show signs of acute exhaustion. In the middle of a showing of new officer kits to be introduced in next year's army reform plan, the storied warlord suddenly collapsed onto the table, losing consciousness in the middle of the meeting.\n\nA military doctor was soon brought in and assessed that Xiang was suffering from a bad fever, but that it was impossible to tell what the issue is beyond these mere symptoms. The doctor advised that Xiang is to be taken to a hospital for further examination. However, the final decision on that lies with Xiang when he wakes up."
sichuan_industrial.18.a:0 "Seek a medical professional."

sichuan_industrial.19.t:0 "Death of Liu Xiang"
sichuan_industrial.19.d:0 "After days of worsening health, Liu Xiang has died. While outwardly it points to natural causes, the suddenness of the disease raises suspicions of an attempt at assassination. Pan Wenhua, mayor of Chongqing and Lu Xiang's second in command, is now in control of Sichuan. Xiang's grandiose plans for the province are over, most likely."
sichuan_industrial.19.a:0 "How convenient for general Wenhua..."

sichuan.500.t:0 "Successful Civil Service Reforms"
sichuan.500.d:0 "Sichuan province since the Xinhai Revolution developed a byzantine system because of the competing military and civilian cliques. With the Officer Department fully in charge, efforts were made to thoroughly reorganize the administration. The civil service in particular was thoroughly investigated, corrupt elements purged, capable hands hired to fill gaps and positions removed or shifted around for better efficiency. On the one hand, this disrupted the bureaucracy for quite some time, but visible improvements are already noted. It will take some more time, but the Sichuan civil service is on the way to becoming cleaner than ever."
sichuan.500.a:0 "A renewed service, for a renewed province."

sichuan.501.t:0 "Land Reform Shows Results"
sichuan.501.d:0 "Land reform is a tricky field. On one hand, few in China would argue against its necessity. On the other, however, reformists struggle to find the needed support such an expensive and arduous project regardless of the long-term benefits. Plus, the landowners in rural communities are lukewarm about it at best, openly hostile at worst, with the peasants unable to do anything about it despite being the principal beneficiaries.\n\nThe Officer Department is pushing through the Land to the Tiller program and while it has brought the provincial government significant expenses and temporary instability, their work is beginning to bear fruit. More land is being worked and more peasants actually own the land they work. Of course, the bar was low considering how thoroughly inadequate land distribution was beforehand, but visible progress is important to gauge the success of such an expensive program."
sichuan.501.a:0 "The first step of many."

sichuan.502.t:0 "A New Currency for Sichuan"
sichuan.502.d:0 "While there is a single currency for all of China on paper, this hasn't been true in reality for decades. Individual, provincial, national and foreign governments, as well as banks and so on, have been printing and minting currency independently with varying legality. Sichuan has had it particularly bad because of the various cliques fighting for control of the province. Monetary reform has entered a new stage with the Officers' takeover. With proper finances restored, inflation is being brought under control, useless currencies destroyed and illegal mints shut down. With currency issuing properly restored, economic stability is slowly being restored as the provincial government's ability to run finances improve."
sichuan.502.a:0 "Another successful step forward."

sichuan.503.t:0 "A Blow Against Corruption"
sichuan.503.d:0 "Corruption is endemic throughout China and Sichuan province is no exception. Too many cliques, unscrupulous and ambitious strongmen have been fighting over the province for too long and rooting out corrupt elements has been a serious challenge for our well-meaning, but young administration. Despite disruptions being noted in the administration and sometimes confrontations between government forces and powerful criminal organizations or hired goons leading to violence and damage, the Officers openly boast about different corrupt figures being arrested and punished. These events, with news spread to the people as much as possible, are helping restore confidence in the administration and, more importantly, the rule of law as corruption and banditry attain record lows."
sichuan.503.a:0 "You can't outrun the law. Not anymore."

sichuan.504.t:0 "The First Session of the Assembly"
sichuan.504.d:0 "The Federalists among the Officers have been working towards establishing a Provincial Assembly for Sichuan in the model of Guangdong province. Support from the pro-Nationalist faction has been lukewarm at first, but were convinced by the success of Song Qingling's democratic experiments in the JiangFu zone.\n\nWith the opening of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, delegates from the counties under Officer Department control were sent to attend and began work. Their first order of business was the drafting of a provincial constitution, also on the Guangdong model, which led to some debates between the Federalist and Kuomintang-aligned Officers. Nevertheless, the new assembly is proving to be a significant boost of legitimacy for the provincial government, helping them solidify their reputation among the people as true to their reformist promises."
sichuan.504.a:0 "The first of many."

sichuan.505.t:0 "Zhongchuan Military Act"
sichuan.505.d:0 "The Zhongchuan Act was drafted by Xiong Kewu, inspired by Chen Jiongming, intending to downsize the army and demilitarize the province to reduce expenditures. The bloated armies in Sichuan have been a massive burden on the government and, more importantly, the people. The measure is meant to help restructure the provincial army and free up revenue for public works and social programs. Since armed internal opposition has become marginal since the Officer Department's victory, it has become safe enough to implement such a radical step against warlordism and the remaining troops will focus on fighting bandits instead of each other."
sichuan.505.a:0 "The army shall serve the people now."

sichuan.506.t:0 "Army Reform Successful"
sichuan.506.d:0 "The armies in Sichuan have been bloated during the Warlord Era, fighting among each other, murdering and looting indiscriminately. Reforms have been a necessity for many years, but none of the warring cliques in the province were willing to open themselves to attacks. With the power struggle over, the provincial army has been transferred back under the government's control and measures were taken to avoid the buildup of paramilitaries. With bloat reduced, funds can be put elsewhere while the remaining military budget can be used to modernize our forces and focus on combating banditry."
sichuan.506.a:0 "A new army, for a new province."

sichuan.507.t:0 "The End of Banditry"
sichuan.507.d:0 "Banditry is inevitable when governments collapse and it has been endemic for years in Sichuan as the warlords struggled for control. Things became worse when rival cliques were defeated as those soldiers not integrated fled to the countryside and became bandits themselves. With reforms well-under way in the army and administration, the Provincial Army has been able to focus on rooting out the remaining bandit strongholds in the province and the latest campaign has been a major success. It won't be long before rule of law is restored across the entire province."
sichuan.507.a:0 "A warzone no more."

sichuan.508.t:0 "Parties Begin to Form"
sichuan.508.d:0 "With the growing strength of the Provincial Assembly came the emergence of political parties to organize representatives along clear sets of policies. While the Officers remain relatively united, two major parties naturally formed around the main factions of the Department, the Federalists and the Nationalists.\n\nThe Self-Government Party is aligned with Chen Jiongming's Public Interest Party, or Zhigongdang (CZGP) and have largely adopted their platform, focusing on provincial and county-level democratization and autonomy. Xiong Kewu is their chairman.\n\nThe pro-Kuomintang faction organized itself as the Three-Principles Party, or Sanmin Party, clearly united in their goal of implementing Sun Yat-sen's political theories. Lu Chao leads them as de facto head of Sichuan's Kuomintang.\n\nOutside of the question of provincial autonomy and their allegiance to different national parties, the two overlap significantly in terms of policy and a consensus government is likely."
sichuan.508.a:0 "Democracy has arrived in Sichuan."

sichuan.509.t:0 "The First Provincial Elections"
sichuan.509.d:0 "It has long been a goal for the Federalists and the Kuomintang to introduce democracy in Sichuan and their efforts are paying off. The people of the province are about to elect their own representatives to the Provincial Assembly and, in turn, their own provincial government. Two parties are running and while they are likely to form a grand coalition regardless of the outcome, they are aligned with two different national parties.\n\nThe Federalists are running as the Self-Government Party and are aligned with Chen Jiongming's Public Interest Party (Zhigongdang, CZGP). They wish to implement Chen's Reconstruction Plan and join in his effort to turn China into a federal republic.\n\nThe Nationalists of the Kuomintang are under the Three-Principles Party and wish to implement a program based on Sun Yat-sen's political theories. They are aligned with Song Qingling's faction within the Nationalist Party and want to support their efforts in unifying the country."
sichuan.509.a:0 "The Kuomintang controls the Assembly."

sichuan.510.d:0 "The people of Sichuan are about to exercise their civic duty once more as new provincial elections have been called. The Federalists and Nationalists remain the two major parties with a chance of winning.\n\nThe Federalists are running as the Self-Government Party and are aligned with Chen Jiongming's Public Interest Party (Zhigongdang, CZGP). They wish to implement Chen's Reconstruction Plan and join in his effort to turn China into a federal republic.\n\nThe Nationalists of the Kuomintang are under the Three-Principles Party and wish to implement a program based on Sun Yat-sen's political theories.

sichuan.511.t:0 "Chen Jiongming Arrives in Sichuan"
sichuan.511.d:0 "A few months ago, Chen Jiongming was ousted from Liangguang by [GXC.GetLeader] and fled with his trusted officers and closest supporters. Instead of going into exile to Hong Kong like in 1924, however, he instead made the trek from Guangzhou to Chongqing and arrived today, cheered by local Federalists.\n\nAfter briefly addressing the crowd to reaffirm that he had no intentions of abandoning the Federalist cause, he privately met with [SZC.GetLeader] to discuss the future.\n\nChen made it clear that he wanted to make Sichuan the new centre for the Federalist movement, being one of the few provinces left that had significant support, both with its government and people, for it. He promised that implementing the Guangdong model in Sichuan would help it not only recover, but prosper despite over a decade of misfortunes and the recent famine.\n\nWhile the promises seem lofty, Chen has extensive experience in provincial administration and a very good reputation, having turned Guangdong into one of the wealthiest provinces in China and, before that, governed Fujian with similar success. Among his entourage are experienced military officers and civil administrators, which Sichuan is in dire need of, making the deal quite convincing."

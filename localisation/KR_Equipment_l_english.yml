 AMA_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Grão Pará state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."

 AMA_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilizes a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."

 AMA_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 AMA_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest german semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."

 AMA_support_weapons:0 "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 AMA_support_weapons_1:0 "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_1_desc:0 "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 AMA_support_weapons2:0 "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_2_desc:0 "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstalces and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 AMA_support_weapons3:0 "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_3_desc:0 "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."
 AMA_infantry_at:0 "Metralhadora Anti-Tanque Imbel .50"
 AMA_infantry_at_desc:0 "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."
 AMA_infantry_at2:0 "Lança Rojão M44"
 AMA_infantry_at2_desc:0 "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."


 AMA_artillery_equipment_1:0 "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 AMA_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 AMA_artillery_equipment_2:0 "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 AMA_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 AMA_artillery_equipment_3:0 "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 AMA_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Northern A until the 1960s."

 AMA_anti_air_equipment_1_desc:0 "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_2:0 "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_2_desc:0 "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_3:0 "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_3_desc:0 "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_1:0 "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."

 ANG_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "A bolt action rifle with a long history of service, the 6,5 mm m/1904 is more commonly known by the moniker of 'Mauser-Vergueiro', as the main design of the gun is essentially that of the Mauser 98 (with a special bolt action mechanism heavily based on the Gewehr 1888) with the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro cartridge, one developed specifically for the portuguese variant. It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."

While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg.

In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Bahian army until the 1960s."

While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed.

This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

 BAY_artillery_equipment_3_Desc:0 "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

 BAY_anti_air_equipment_3_desc:0 "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon.

The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Brazilian army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear.."

Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."

Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."

 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_2:0 "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Fermany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_3:0 "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 CAN_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Ross Mk III"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."
 CAN_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk V"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "After the fall of the Home Isles, the loyal Dominions only had access to one arsenal capable of producing its service rifle. Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 CAN_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Carbine, Machine, Owen Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Owen Gun"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

 CAN_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 CAN_infantry_at:0 "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_at_desc:0 "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 CAN_infantry_at2:0 "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 CAN_infantry_at2_desc:0 "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."

 CAN_support_weapons2:0 "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons2_desc:0 "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 CAN_support_weapons3:0 "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons3_desc:0 "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 CAN_support_weapons4:0 "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 CAN_night_vision:0 "Tabby Scope"
 CAN_night_vision_desc:0 "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 CAN_infantry_weapons2:0 "Carbine, Machine, Thompson Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States."
 CAN_improved_infantry_weapons_2:0 "Carbine, Machine, Lanchester Mk I"
 CAN_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 CAN_advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "Carbine, Commando, De Lisle Mk I"
 CAN_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "What began as a private venture by engineer William Godfray de Lisle soon caught the attention of the RCMP's Special Branch looking to equip agents with improved weaponry. The De Lisle carbine is, essentially, a shortened SMLE converted to .45 ACP, a subsonic cartridge with an integrated suppressor. The suppressor and ammunition together produced as little as 85.5 decibels when firing, making it very suitable for commando operations."

 CRO_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades.

Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed.

Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute.

 DEH_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Ishapore SMLE Mk III"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Ishapore Rifle Factory was founded in 1904 and began producing the venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that would serve throughout the Great War. However, the loss of much of British India after the British Revolution also meant the loss of the Ishapore factory, one of the only two factories producing the SMLE outside of Britain, putting a serious strain in rifle production for the remnants of the Empire for years until what was salvaged from Ishapore could be set up in friendly territory."
 DEH_infantry_equipment_1:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 DEH_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Owen Mk 1"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Owen Machine Carbine"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 DEH_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Long Branch Mk 1"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "SLR Mk 1"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""
 DEH_infantry_at:0 "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 DEH_infantry_at_desc:0 "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 DEH_infantry_at2:0 "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 DEH_infantry_at2_desc:0 "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 DEH_support_weapons:0 "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 DEH_support_weapons_desc:0 "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 DEH_support_weapons2:0 "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 DEH_support_weapons2_desc:0 "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 DEH_support_weapons3:0 "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 DEH_support_weapons3_desc:0 "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 DEH_support_weapons4:0 "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 DEH_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 DEH_night_vision:0 "Tabby Scope"
 DEH_night_vision_desc:0 "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark.""
 DEH_infantry_weapons2:0 "BSA Thompson M1926"
 DEH_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 DEH_improved_infantry_weapons_2:0 "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 DEH_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 DEH_advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 DEH_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."

 DEN_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Gevær M/89 has been the primary Danish rifle since 1889. Considered to be on par with the rest of the rifles in Europe, the gun has a length of 133 cm, making it dangerous in the hands of a marksman. However, the gun's length sacrifices its mobility, and it can be pretty heavy and less manageable in close-range fighting. Thus, some variants of the weapon were modified into carbines for shorter engagements."

The foregrip was designed with ergonomic flexibility for the user when handling the weapon. After repeated trials, however, many infantrymen found the foregrip unnecessarily and outright expensive for the gun's production."

Firing in 7.92x57mm Mauser, the gun is gas operated, and initial testing has revealed that the weapon competes well against European and American models."

" Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.In 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, and a simplified bolt system." The No.4 is the newest member in the family of Lee-Enfield rifles. While similar to its predecessors, the No.4 is stronger and easier to produce. A bit heavier due to its barrel; an interesting fact about the No.4 is that it comes with an aperture sight that is set at increments of 100 yds (91m); calibrated for 200-1,300 yards (183-1189 metres)."

Seeing that these trucks can drive continuously in harsh environments, during the expedition's stay in Xinjiang, Yang Zengxin proposed to purchase a batch of Citroën P21 cars, and the expedition readily agreed to this request because the purpose of their expedition was to advertise for Citroën. Soon after the expedition arrived in Beijing in February 1932, the French shipped the first batch of auto parts and engineers to Xinjiang. This truck has also become the most common automobile in Xinjiang."

The KP/-41 itself began as a derivative of Lahti's own 'Suomi' submachine gun rechambered for his new cartridge, and indeed, while retention of the general shape and feel of the KP/-31 was preferred, ultimately, the new design's massive recoil impetus led to both further external changes to the weapon's body as well as a reduction in its cyclic rate."

 FNG_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "In 1931, the Japanese Army approached Kijiro Nambu to design a new semi-automatic rifle. His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

In 1935, a new pattern with improved ergonomics and a new larger magazine with more robust feed lips and loader was approved and entered into production shortly thereafter.

However, despite the hatred for this weapon, when it is not jammed with dirt and mud, the gun is quite reliable to control, and the Chauchat can be fired from the hip as well.

 GAL_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher Karabinek wzór 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 GAL_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Karabinek wzór 1935"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "FÉG wz. 35"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

 GAL_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While the Imperial and Royal forces were interested in self-loading rifles since the late 1920s, the political and economic situation along with repeated disapointments during trials delayed the project while the Army focused on other developments. When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

 GBR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."

The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."

 GBR_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

 GBR_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 GBR_infantry_at:0 "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tan, Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_at_desc:0 "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."

 GBR_infantry_at2_desc:0 "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."

 GBR_support_weapons2_desc:0 "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 GBR_support_weapons3:0 "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 GBR_support_weapons3_desc:0 "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 GBR_support_weapons4:0 "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 GBR_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 GBR_infantry_weapons2:0 "Carbine, Machine, Thompson Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States."

 GBR_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 GBR_advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "Carbine, Commando, De Lisle Mk I"
 GBR_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "What began as a private venture by engineer William Godfray de Lisle soon caught the attention of the RCMP's Special Branch looking to equip agents with improved weaponry. The De Lisle carbine is, essentially, a shortened SMLE converted to .45 ACP, a subsonic cartridge with an integrated suppressor. The suppressor and ammunition together produced as little as 85.5 decibels when firing, making it very suitable for commando operations."

 GER_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Mauser G. 98"
 GER_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Gewehr 98 (Rifle 98) was the standard German infantry weapon of the Weltkrieg. It is a good example of the type of military rifle designed around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when rifle development reached fever pitch. In common with other armies, the German infantry carried a full length rifle, while other troops were issued with shorter carbines. The bolt and magazine system of the Gewehr 98 was designed by the Mauser company, although the rifle was produced under licence by a number of other commercial manufacturers. It was a well-made and accurate weapon, but was not well suited to trench warfare."
 #Mauser Standardmodell :

 GER_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Mauser Kar. 98b"
 GER_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs."
 GER_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Selbstladegewehr Modell 40"
 GER_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "S.G. 40"
 GER_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed by the Mauser company in response to a desire of the German Army for a self-loading rifle with a backup bolt action, the Selbstladegewehr 40 is a massive leap forward in German small arms design. While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the Heer eventually dropped some of its other specific requirements for the rifle. The end result was the initial prototype with only a few design edits, and it proved effective."

 GER_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Maschinenkarabiner 42 is a revolutionary design chambered for a new intermediate cartridge, developed by famous German arms designer Hugo Schmeisser, in conjunction with the Haenel company. While the first prototype of the rifle was prone to jamming, both the military and even the Kaiser himself were extremely enthusiastic about the project, and immense resources were concentrated on improving the design, with the rifle deemed ready for adoption in 1942."

The rifle is rather short, at only one metre long. Originally designed for the Mountain troops, the G. 98/38 was soon adopted by other German forces, including some cavalry and infantry regiments."

 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "The M.P. 40, sometimes incorrectly called 'Schmeisser', was developed by Heinrich Vollmer and based on M.P. 38, with the aim of equipping German soldiers with an assault weapon. It uses magazines of 32 cartridges of 9mm, with its effective range being about 100-150 metres. It is a very reliable and particularly economical weapon to manufacture, usually used by officers, mechanised infantry and paratroopers."

As a result of the continuous development of M.Kb. 42, the M.Kb. 44 is devoid of many of the disadvantages of the previous design and is even sometimes called the 'Sturmgewehr' - the assault rifle. The final design has a shorter range than contemporary rifles due to German research that most of the combat in the European War takes place at distances less than 300 metres. At the sacrifice of range, close range firepower was greatly improved."

The range of the first Panzerabwehrrohr was only 30 metres, which made their use somewhat hazardous, until more developed variants with increased range came to production."

Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks’ armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers.

The Vampir weighs 2.25 kilograms and was fitted with lugs on the M.Kb. 44 at the C.G. Haenel weapons’ production facility in Suhl. As well as the sight and infrared spotlight, there is a 13.5 kilogram wooden cased battery for the light, and a second battery fitted inside a gas mask container to power the image converter.

In order to standardise their vehicle fleet, they opted for a commercial truck design by Adam Opel AG of Brandenburg to become their standard cargo truck. With only slight modifications to meet military requirements, presented in 1930, the Opel Blitz was accepted in service with designation Kraftfahrzeug 305 and by 1936 became the main truck of the German Army. Although well built, the Kfz.305 suffers from being rather too complicated for reliability in the rugged conditions, but still has better performance than other German trucks."

 GER_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."

 GER_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

 GER_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_3:0 "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

 GER_anti_air_equipment_2_short:0 "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_2_desc:0 "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

 GER_anti_air_equipment_3_desc:0 "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Guararapes state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."

Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."

The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."

Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."

 GRP_anti_air_equipment_1_desc:0 "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

 GRP_anti_air_equipment_2_desc:0 "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."

The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_1:0 "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_2:0 "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Fermany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_3:0 "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

 GRU_artillery_equipment_3_Desc:0 "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

 GUY_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."

 GUY_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 GUY_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."

 GUY_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""

 GUY_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."

 GUY_advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 GUY_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."

 HUN_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher 1895/1930 Minta karabély (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."

The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."

Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."

 GOY_anti_air_equipment_1_desc:0 "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_1:0 "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_2:0 "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Fermany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_3:0 "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

A well trained crew can fire between 8 to 10 rounds per minute making it capable for incredible suppressive fire."
 ITA_infantry_at2:0 "Fucile Anticarro S-2"
 ITA_infantry_at2_desc:0 "A 7.9mm anti-tank rife; the Fucile Anticarro S-2 is a Mauser-style bolt action rifle fed from a 4 round magazine. The barrel has a muzzle break that reduces recoil. It can penetrate 15mm of armour at 300 metres distance and 33mm of armour at 100 metres."
 ITA_support_weapons:0 "Fiat–Revelli M14 & Stokes mortar"
 ITA_support_weapons_desc:0 " The standard machine guns of the Italian Army during the Weltkrieg, the Fiat-Revelli M14 features selective fire and a strip-fed magazine box of 50 or 100 bullets. Like the Stokes mortar; these Weltkrieg-era weapons have been repurposed for the ever growing threat of the continuation of the civil war."
 ITA_support_weapons2:0 "Breda M30 & Mortaio da 81 M35"
 ITA_support_weapons2_desc:0 "The Breda M30 is an unusual weapon. It is fed from a fixed magazine attached to its side and is loaded with steel 20 round stripper clips. The firing rate and low magazine capacity makes the weapon more ideal as a semi-automatic rifle instead of a light machine gun. The Mortaio 81 is a lightweight Brandt-style mortar that has seen great feedback in the testing ranges due to its range capacity and reliability. The mortar uses two shells; one heavy high-explosive shell and another lighter shell for long-distance fire."
 ITA_support_weapons3:0 "Breda M37 & Mortaio da 81 CEMSA L.P."
 ITA_support_weapons3_desc:0 "The Breda M37 is a medium machine gun produced by Breda. The gas-operated air cooled medium machine gun is fairly reliable in the field. Its slow rate of fire helps prevent overheating during prolonged fire and its powerful heavy bullet cartridge has excellent range and penetration."
 ITA_support_weapons4:0 "Breda Mod.5C & Mortaio da 81 CEMSA L.P"
 ITA_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The Breda Mod.5C is an Italian heavy machine gun. A reflection of Italian military doctrine, the Breda was intended for ambushes and attacks. While its rate of fire is slow (as with most Italian machine guns); the Breda 5C was still regarded as one of the deadliest weapons in the Italian arsenal given the Italain Army's lack of heavy machine guns and submachine guns."
 ITA_infantry_weapons2:0 "Beretta M1918/38"
 ITA_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The Beretta M1918 is an Italian sub-machine gun used during the Weltkrieg. The gun was made from half of a Villar-Perosa aircraft submachine gun and features an incredible rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute. The 1938 variant features the same rate of fire as the iconic weapon but has been refined to reduce the weapon's recoil and increase its sturdiness."
 ITA_improved_infantry_weapons_2:0 "Pavesi M40"
 ITA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "The Pavesi M40 is an Italian semi-auto rifle chambered for the 8x59 Breda cartridge. It is a short recoil action with 4-lug rotating bolt and uses a Mannlicher bloc clip."
 ITA_advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "TZ-44"
 ITA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "Designed by a colonel and gunsmith (Tonon and Zorzoli hence the name 'TZ'); the TZ-44 is an impressive sub-machine gun capable of firing 9x19mm Parabellum at 800 rounds per minute. The gun action is simple blowback but the return spring is assembled around a guide rod which is in two pieces and telescopes as the bolt returns. Like other Italian weapons, the gun features selective fire. It also features a noteworthy 'double safety' to ensure that accidental discharges would not happen."

 JAM_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."

 JAM_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."

 JAM_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""

 JAM_advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 JAM_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."

His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "Japan has long relied on bolt action rifles, and their age is beginning to show. Thus, with the Type 14, the Imperial Army at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal has designed the Type 4 semi-automatic rifle. Charged with two 5-round stripper clips, Type 4 comes in two variants: the navy and the other for the army. The development of this weapon would give the Japanese infantryman significantly more firepower on the battlefield than previous weapons."
 JAP_infantry_at:0 "Type 97 Anti-Tank Rifle"
 JAP_infantry_at_desc:0 ""Given the fact that German tanks exist in China as well as the ever-present threat of the Russian bear on the borders, Type 97 was designed to combat armored vehicles. The gun is a monstrosity of a weapon; it has an overall length of 2.09 metres and weighs 52 kilograms (115 pounds). Capable of penetrating 30mm of armour at a range of 250 metres; it is truly a fearsome weapon in the right hands."

The Type 3 uses an ammo strip for loading rounds, and its tripod could be used for anti-aircraft mounting. The Type 11 mortar was developed in the 11th year of the Taisho Emperor. Exceptional amongst Japanese weapons; Type 11 is a muzzle-loaded weapon with a rifled bore."
 JAP_support_weapons2:0 "Type 11 LMG & Type 10 grenade discharger"
 JAP_support_weapons2_desc:0 "Combat experience in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 taught the Imperial Army the utility of machine guns providing covering fire. The Type 11 was developed by the famed arms designer Kijiro Nambu based on a French Hotchkiss M1909 and is air-cooled and gas-operated. A unique feature about the Type 11 machine gun is its detachable hopper; it can be refilled while attached and does not require removal during operation. The Type 10 grenade discharger was a smoothbore muzzle-loaded weapon with an incredible range of 175 metres."

 JAP_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "This 1944 modification of Type 100 includes several changes designed to simplify the weapon. The 1944 variant is longer than the earlier Type 100 with simple iron sights and a greatly simplified muzzle. The firing rate of the 1944 version is also considerably higher, with the gun firing at 800 rounds per minute. The gun is an absolute monster at close ranges with satisfactory accuracy and low recoil."

Although the No.1 Mk III* saw use in the Legation Cities well before the Weltkrieg in the hands of the old British garrison, the revolution in 1926 and the retreat of the China Station to Australasia in the same year saw the rifle continue service with police forces across the Legation Cities, as well as with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.\n\nAs most of these rifles were Weltkrieg-era surplus, and many have long been without proper maintenance or replaceable parts, attrition has taken its toll. Now that there may be too few rifles to furnish an expanded police force, some have come to regard the Lee-Enfield as necessarily obsolete."

 LIT_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. Many models were ordered by Lithuanian government."

The MP-35, designed by Emil Bergmann and notable for its horizontal magazine on the right side, is a popular choice thanks to its relative ruggedness and affordability, along with Bergmann's willingness to license the design."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage.

The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'.

It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."

While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg.

In 1930, Renault succeeded in his attempt to get his Renault NC accepted as the basis for further light infantry tank development, the final result of which was adopted by the army in 1932, under the name Char de Manœuvre Renault Modèle 1930. A new tank based largely on revision of the original design of the Renault FT, and armed with a Puteaux SA Mle 18 cannon and two Hotchkiss Mle 26 machine guns. By request of the French army, the tanks have a radio operator's assigned position, and are equipped with a huge and characteristic twin-boom antenna.

While the Krags proved superior at close ranges to comparable Mauser designs in the Spanish-American war, the rifle's flimsy action in comparison to newer bolt designs necessitated a replacement a mere decade after its adoption. During the American occupations of several Central American nations in the early 20th century, many stockpiled Krag rifles, mostly of the 1898 rifle pattern, were given to local forces along with droves of surplus ammunition."

The original five round internal magazine, however, was deemed insufficient and a new variant of the MAS-40/42, the 40/42, was developed featuring a detachable ten round box magazine. A small number of MAS-40/42 rifles were smuggled into Nicaragua along with production tooling specifications."

 NZL_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."

 NZL_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Owen Machine Carbine"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""

 NZL_night_vision_desc:0 "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark.""
 NZL_infantry_weapons2:0 "BSA Thompson M1926"
 NZL_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 NZL_improved_infantry_weapons_2:0 "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 NZL_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 NZL_advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 NZL_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 NZL_infantry_at:0 "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 NZL_infantry_at_desc:0 "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design.

 NZL_infantry_at2_desc:0 "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar.

 NZL_support_weapons2_desc:0 "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg.

 NZL_support_weapons3_desc:0 "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 NZL_support_weapons4:0 "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors.

 PIR_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."

 POR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "A bolt action rifle with a long history of service, the 6,5 mm m/1904 is more commonly known by the moniker of 'Mauser-Vergueiro', as the main design of the gun is essentially that of the Mauser 98 (with a special bolt action mechanism heavily based on the Gewehr 1888) with the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro cartridge, one developed specifically for the portuguese variant. It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."

While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg."

 RJM_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Mauser M08"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Veracruz state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."
 RJM_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Fusil Mauser Modelo 1935"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Mauser M35"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilizes a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."
 RJM_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Submetralhadora Bergmann Modelo 1938"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Bergmann M38"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 RJM_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest german semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."

 RJM_support_weapons:0 "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 RJM_support_weapons_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 RJM_support_weapons_1:0 "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 RJM_support_weapons_1_desc:0 "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 RJM_support_weapons2:0 "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 RJM_support_weapons_2_desc:0 "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstalces and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 RJM_support_weapons3:0 "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 RJM_support_weapons_3_desc:0 "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."
 RJM_infantry_at:0 "Metralhadora Anti-Tanque Imbel .50"
 RJM_infantry_at_desc:0 "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."
 RJM_infantry_at2:0 "Lança Rojão M44"
 RJM_infantry_at2_desc:0 "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."


 RJM_artillery_equipment_1:0 "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 RJM_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 RJM_artillery_equipment_2:0 "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 RJM_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 RJM_artillery_equipment_3:0 "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 RJM_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Carioca army until the 1960s."

 RJM_anti_air_equipment_1:0 "Canhão Antiaéreo M2 de 2cm"
 RJM_anti_air_equipment_1_desc:0 "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 RJM_anti_air_equipment_2:0 "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 RJM_anti_air_equipment_2_desc:0 "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 RJM_anti_air_equipment_3:0 "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 RJM_anti_air_equipment_3_desc:0 "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_1:0 "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_2:0 "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_3:0 "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 RJM_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Following the specifications of the original models, rockets of 32cm were used in these weapons, and a lack of said rockets is exactly why they were seldom used."

 SAF_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk III"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "SMLE Mk III"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 SAF_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Owen Mk 1"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Owen Machine Carbine"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 SAF_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Long Branch Mk 1"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "SLR Mk 1"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""
 SAF_night_vision:0 "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 SAF_night_vision_short:0 "Tabby Scope"
 SAF_night_vision_desc:0 "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark.""
 SAF_infantry_weapons2:0 "BSA Thompson M1926"
 SAF_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 SAF_improved_infantry_weapons_2:0 "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 SAF_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 SAF_advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 SAF_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 SAF_infantry_at:0 "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 SAF_infantry_at_desc:0 "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 SAF_infantry_at2:0 "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 SAF_infantry_at2_desc:0 "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 SAF_infantry_at2_short:0 "PIAT"
 SAF_support_weapons:0 "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 SAF_support_weapons_desc:0 "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 SAF_support_weapons2:0 "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 SAF_support_weapons2_desc:0 "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the First Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 SAF_support_weapons3:0 "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 SAF_support_weapons3_desc:0 "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 SAF_support_weapons4:0 "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 SAF_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

Unfortunately, due to Shanxi's narrow roads and mountainous terrain, and the technical blockade imposed by the Qing government on Shanxi, it was difficult for Yan Xishan to buy trucks directly from the Japanese. Therefore, in March 1932, he ordered the engineer Jiang Shouting to go to Tianjin to negotiate with the representatives from the American Federal Motor Truck Company. The Americans eventually agreed to transfer the 1.5 ton truck technology to Shanxi, and Jiang Shouting used this as a basis to create the reliable and durable Type Shanxi by the end of the same year."

 SIC_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. As part of Sicilian-German cooperation in response to the red threat of the north, large quantities of the 98b were shipped to Sicily."

The SME state run electrical company, which had begun to produce and design small arms only a few years prior, was set to the task. The end result, designated the SME M38 upon adoption, while improved over its Czech predecessor, still bears many of the latter's design quirks."

While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the German Heer eventually dropped some of its other specific requirements for the rifle. The end result was the initial prototype with only a few design edits, and it proved effective. As a response to growing tensions on the Italian peninsula, large numbers of these rifles were sent to the Sicilian Armed Forces."

Seeing that these trucks can drive continuously in harsh environments, during the expedition's stay in Xinjiang, Yang Zengxin proposed to purchase a batch of Citroën P21 cars, and the expedition readily agreed to this request because the purpose of their expedition was to advertise for Citroën. Soon after the expedition arrived in Beijing in February 1932, the French shipped the first batch of auto parts and engineers to Xinjiang. This truck has also become the most common truck in Xinjiang."

Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation.

Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."

The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."

Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday.

Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_1:0 "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_2:0 "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Fermany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_3:0 "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the German army eventually dropped some its other specific requirements for the rifle, and the end result, the predecessor the rifle that would ultimately be adopted, proved effective."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'.

 WHR_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "V-91/98/25"
 WHR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Germany's eastern allies all had large stocks of Russian Mosin rifles, but they all adopted the 8mm Mauser cartridge to match German standards. Wanting to make cost-effective use of existing stocks until more Mauser rifles were available, Polish arsenals worked to convert Mosin rifles into carbines chambering the new official cartridge. The wz. 91/98/25 pattern would quickly be adopted by other Oststaaten to modernise their existing stocks."

 WHR_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "V-24"
 WHR_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. Many models were ordered by Belarusian government."

 WHR_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While the sub-machine gun concept was well-proven during the latter phase of the Weltkrieg, many nations see serious shortage of the weapon type as the Second Weltkrieg broke out. Unable to secure the German Army's standard MP-40, the Oststaaten often have to make due with what is commercially available through private firms. The MP-35, designed by Emil Bergmann and notable for its horizontal magazine on the right side, is a popular choice thanks to its relative ruggedness and affordability, along with Bergmann's willingness to license the design."

 WHR_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "With Germany's machine carbines becoming increasingly present on the battlefield with its intermediate cartridge and select-fire capabilities, Karl Barnitzke of Waffenfabrik Suhl offered a new design as a cheaper, mass-produceable alternative to the M.Kb. 42. The design is very simple and easy to produce, mechanically an enlarged pistol made from extensive use of stamped sheetmetal, using the same intermediate cartridge and 30-round magazines. This semi-automatic rifle, while failing to impress the German Army, caught the interest of Oststaaten, especially Belarus, looking for a cheap alternative to the M.Kb. 42, as the Germans were unwilling to share them. Waffenfabrik Suhl is happy to produce and license the design for local production, significantly raising the firepower of the otherwise-light infantry of Germany's eastern allies."

Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks’ armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers. As a drawback, the R.Pz.B. 54 produces a lot of smoke upon firing. Many shipped over from Germany given Belarus' lack of anti tank weapons."

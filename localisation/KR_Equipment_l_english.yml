 ALB_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The development of a portable automatic rifle using an intermediate cartridge was born in the Monarchy thanks to the success of the Király series of "heavy" submachine guns and the realisation that combat ranges were far shorter than anticipated. Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

 ALB_mechanized_equipment_1_short: "TPz M.38/40"
 ALB_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "The need for an armoured transport for mechanised infantry led to the conversion of several different vehicles to fill the role. The Saurer R77 artillery tractor was one of the first of such conversions and was relatively simple: An armoured \"box\" was added to the chasis that protected the driver and personnel inside. The deployment of these conversions helped cement the concept of armoured transports in Austrian doctrine."

 ALB_mechanized_equipment_2_desc: "In 1942, the Hungarian company Weiss Manfréd began to convert the obsolete Nimród SPAT/SPAA vehicles into APCs and armoured ambulances nicknamed Lehel by the Hungarians. They proved to be superior to the TPz38/40 in every way with stronger armour and a better engine."

### Land ###
 AMA_infantry_equipment_0: "Espingarda Mauser Modelo 1908"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser M08"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Grão Pará state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."
 AMA_infantry_equipment_1: "Fusil Mauser Modelo 1935"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser M35"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilizes a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."
 AMA_infantry_equipment_2: "Submetralhadora Bergmann Modelo 1938"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Bergmann M38"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 AMA_infantry_equipment_3: "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 AMA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest german semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."
 AMA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Rossi M44"
 AMA_support_weapons: "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 AMA_support_weapons_1: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 AMA_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_2_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstalces and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 AMA_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 AMA_support_weapons_3_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."
 AMA_infantry_at: "Metralhadora Anti-Tanque Imbel .50"
 AMA_infantry_at_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."
 AMA_infantry_at2: "Lança Rojão M44"
 AMA_infantry_at2_desc: "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."


 AMA_artillery_equipment_1: "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 AMA_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 AMA_artillery_equipment_2: "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 AMA_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 AMA_artillery_equipment_3: "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 AMA_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Northern A until the 1960s."

 AMA_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "CAA M5 de 3,7cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "CAA M7 de 8,8cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_1: "Canhão Antiaéreo M2 de 2cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_2: "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_3: "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 AMA_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Fermany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "CAT de 7,5 cm"
 AMA_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "CAT M6 de 12,8 cm"
 AMA_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 32cm"
 AMA_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Following the specifications of the original models, rockets of 32cm were used in these weapons, and a lack of said rockets is exactly why they were seldom used."
 AMA_rocket_artillery_equipment_2: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 21cm"
 AMA_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Changes to the size of the rockets required for usage made later models more common, but still far from standard issue and few pieces of the LF de 21cm were used in the field when compared to even the M43."

 ANG_infantry_equipment_0: "Espingarda 6,5 mm m/1904"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser-Vergueiro"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "A bolt action rifle with a long history of service, the 6,5 mm m/1904 is more commonly known by the moniker of 'Mauser-Vergueiro', as the main design of the gun is essentially that of the Mauser 98 (with a special bolt action mechanism heavily based on the Gewehr 1888) with the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro cartridge, one developed specifically for the portuguese variant. It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."
 ANG_infantry_equipment_1: "Espingarda 7.92 mm m/1904/36"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser-Vergueiro M36"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Fundamentally little more than an updated version of the Mauser-Vergueiro, it was introduced to Africa amid rising tensions between Portugal and Germany. A significant amount of these weapons later found themselves under use by the forces of the states in former Portuguese Africa."
 ANG_infantry_equipment_2: "Carabina C.A.P Modelo 01"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_2_short: "C.A.P M40"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "A prototype carbine that saw little widespread use in Portugal's army as a whole was the country's first attempt at a standard issue, nationally produced design. As such, the nationalist Integralist junta supported the development of the C.A.P carbine intensely, but by the time it was ready for production, realities on the ground made it more worthwhile to switch to the FBP overall directly from the older Mauser-Vergueiro and variants already widely in use by the armed forces."
 ANG_infantry_equipment_3: "Pistola-Metralhadora FBP M/945"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_3_short: "FBP M/945"
 ANG_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The FBP submachine gun is named after the acronym for the Braço de Prata Factory, the manufacturer for the weapon, a foundry owned and controlled by the Portuguese government itself. While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg. While few of the models made it overseas when compared to the old Mauser-Vergueiro, the government of Angola was capable of starting production domestically relatively swiftly after decolonisation."
 ANG_support_weapons: "Metralhadora Vickers & Morteiro Stokes"
 ANG_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the British Empire during the Weltkrieg. During its rearmament after the conflict, the restored Portuguese monarchy purchased and fabricated them with the intention of widespread use among infantry both at home and overseas."
 ANG_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora Lewis Modelo DEMS & Morteiro SBML de 2 Polegadas"
 ANG_support_weapons_2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis served the Entente since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. The MKIII variant had a pistol grip that allowed it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML, while small, is incredibly portable and had greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 ANG_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Vickers Modelo II & Morteiro ML de 3 Polegadas"
 ANG_support_weapons_3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG featured a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It had been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar was a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it was reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 ANG_support_weapons4: "Metralhadora Vickers-Vedras & Morteiro de 4.2 Polegadas"
 ANG_support_weapons_4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar was a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 ANG_infantry_at: "Morteiro-Bombarda"
 ANG_infantry_at_desc: "Developed in Canada and sold in substantial amounts to Portugal, the mortar design was that of a 'spigot' mortar. Arguing that the design could serve as both an artillery piece and an anti-tank weapon, the design was eagerly adopted by several allies of the Entente, including Portugal. Many ended up stranded in its former overseas possessions."
 ANG_infantry_at2: "LATI"
 ANG_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the LATI (A direct translation of its Canadian English name) was developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device was well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there were concerns about its intense recoil."

 ANQ_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Originally a product of late Guangxu era 'Self Strengthening' efforts, the Type 88 was designed as a copy of the German Gewehr 88 with export modifications. While collectively inferior to newer rifles despite improvements, and often poorly maintained, the weapon is known to be rugged and reliable if unwieldy.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Hanyang Arsenal, the model's place of design, though equipment shortages often see it used alongside non-standard weapons."
 ANQ_infantry_equipment_1: "Hanyang Type 27"
 ANQ_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Hanyang Type 27"
 ANQ_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Officially called the 'Xuantong Type 27', this rifle was put into service in 1935 thanks to German assistance after the Qing Restoration. The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Hanyang Arsenal with German tools, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."

While appearing similar, the Type 35 is shorter, has the rear of the receiver covered, and the gas-trap system replaced by a simply gas port.

 AST_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Lithgow Small Arms Factory in New South Wales opened in 1912, starting local production of the venerable Lee-Enfield rifle that would serve throughout the Great War. After the British Revolution, however, and the fall of large parts of British India, LSAF was the last remaining arsenal capable of producing Lee-Enfields to remain in Entente hands, making it a very important strategic asset."
 AST_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk VI"
 AST_infantry_equipment_1_short: "LSAF SMLE Mk VI"
 AST_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "In cooperation with British-Canadian engineers and the Lithgow factory, the Lee-Enfield Mk III was modernised with new and improved aperture sights on the receiver instead of at the mid-point of the rifle, becoming the new standard for the Dominions. However, experience in jungle warfare brought to attention new needs for the service rifle, specifically in weight, length, and handling. Lithgow thus developed the \"Jungle carbine\" (a commercial name from the post-war), featuring a 18.75 inches (476mm) barrel compared to 25.2 inches (640mm) of the Mk III and V."
 AST_infantry_equipment_2: "Carbine, Machine, Owen Mk I"
 AST_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Gun"
 AST_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the looming war and experience during the war in the US, the Entente armies grew increasingly interested in a mass-produceable submachine-gun. Evelyn Owen, a private in the Australasian Army and hobbyist gunsmith, caught the attention of both Canadian and Australasian armies with a design of his own. The Owen gun was a very simple, but unorthodox design with its top-loaded magazine and two vertical grips. Not only is it relatively inexpensive, but it proved to be extremely rugged, surviving in even the worst of conditions, earning it the nickname \"Digger's Darling\"."
 AST_infantry_equipment_3: "Rifle, Self-Loading, Long Branch Mk I"
 AST_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk I"
 AST_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 AST_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 AST_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."

With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."

 AUS_infantry_equipment_0: "Karabiner Modell 1895/30"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mannlicher M.95/30"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Modell 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."

 AUS_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabiner Modell 1935"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG M.35"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."
 #Danuvia 39M
 AUS_infantry_equipment_2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 1939"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Danuvia M.39"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."

 AUS_infantry_equipment_3: "Maschinenkarabiner Modell 1942"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zbrojovka Brno M.42"
 AUS_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."
 #MP 34:
 AUS_infantry_weapons2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 1934"
 AUS_infantry_weapons2_short: "Steyr-Solothurn M.34"
 AUS_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While a German design by Louis Stange, the  MP 34 was mainly produced by Steyr and was adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army. As common with early submachine guns, this design was heavy, expensive, but reliable, with a horizontal magazine using the potent 9x25mm Mauser cartridge."
 #ZK 383:
 AUS_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 38"
 AUS_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "Zbrojovka Brno M.38"
 AUS_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Seeing the need for a submachine-gun using the standard pistol cartridge of the Army, the Monarchy would adopt the ZK 383, designed by brothers Josef and František Koucký at Zbrojovka Brno, as the MP 38. Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

The 43M redesign with a folding metal stock and a new, more reliable foldable magazine design allowed it to be much more compact during transport or storage, without sacrificing firepower."

 BAH_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser M08"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Bahia state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."
 BAH_infantry_equipment_1: "Fusil Mauser Modelo 1935"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser M35"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilizes a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."
 BAH_infantry_equipment_2: "Submetralhadora Bergmann Modelo 1938"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Bergmann M38"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 BAH_infantry_equipment_3: "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 BAH_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest german semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."
 BAH_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Rossi M44"
 BAH_support_weapons: "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 BAH_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 BAH_support_weapons_1: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 BAH_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 BAH_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 BAH_support_weapons_2_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstalces and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 BAH_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 BAH_support_weapons_3_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."

When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."
 BAH_infantry_at2: "Lança Rojão M44"
 BAH_infantry_at2_desc: "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."

 BAH_artillery_equipment_1: "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 BAH_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 BAH_artillery_equipment_2: "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 BAH_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 BAH_artillery_equipment_3: "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 BAH_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Bahian army until the 1960s."

 BAH_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 BAH_anti_air_equipment_2: "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 BAH_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 BAH_anti_air_equipment_3: "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 BAH_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Fermany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 BAH_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 BAT_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 BAT_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 BAT_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 BAT_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

 BAT_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 BAT_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 BAT_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 BAT_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

 BAT_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 BAT_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

Initially developed in 1932 as 6 wheels variants, it was obvious that this variant will be obsolete in the nearest future. In 1937 the 8 wheels variant armed with 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon was introduced in service. The all-wheel drive four-axle Sd.Kfz. 231 are one of the most technically advanced armoured vehicles and are able to operate on rough terrain, with a cross-country comparable to that of tanks."

This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 BAY_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 BAY_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 BAY_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

 BAY_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 BAY_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 BOS_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Karabin Model 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 BOS_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabin Model 1935"
 BOS_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG M.35"
 BOS_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon.

 BRA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilizes a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers quickly became a priority for the government."

 BRA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."

 BRA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest german semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Brazilian army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear.."

 BRA_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome MG. Model 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance and found newfound efficiency. Many such older pieces of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 BRA_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 BRA_support_weapons2_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 BRA_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"

The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstalces and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."

 BRA_support_weapons4_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production.

Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Fermany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 BRA_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 CAF_infantry_equipment_0_short: "SMLE Mk III"
 CAF_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 CAF_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 CAF_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 CAF_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 CAF_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 CAF_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 CAF_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 CAF_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 CAF_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 CAF_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""
 CAF_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 CAF_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 CAF_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 CAF_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 CAF_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"

 CAF_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 CAF_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 CAF_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 CAF_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 CAF_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 CAF_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 CAF_night_vision: "Tabby Scope"
 CAF_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark.""
 CAF_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 CAF_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 CAF_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 CAF_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 CAF_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 CAF_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."

Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."
 CAN_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk V"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the loyal Dominions only had access to one arsenal capable of producing its service rifle. Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 CAN_infantry_equipment_2: "Carbine, Machine, Owen Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Gun"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 CAN_infantry_equipment_3: "Rifle, Self-Loading, Long Branch Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 CAN_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 CAN_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 CAN_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."

 CAN_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 CAN_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 CAN_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 CAN_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 CAN_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 CAN_night_vision: "Tabby Scope"
 CAN_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 CAN_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Machine, Thompson Mk I"
 CAN_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States."
 CAN_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Carbine, Machine, Lanchester Mk I"
 CAN_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 CAN_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Commando, De Lisle Mk I"
 CAN_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "What began as a private venture by engineer William Godfray de Lisle soon caught the attention of the RCMP's Special Branch looking to equip agents with improved weaponry. The De Lisle carbine is, essentially, a shortened SMLE converted to .45 ACP, a subsonic cartridge with an integrated suppressor. The suppressor and ammunition together produced as little as 85.5 decibels when firing, making it very suitable for commando operations."

 CRO_infantry_equipment_0: "Karabin Model 1895/30"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mannlicher M.95/30"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Karabin Model 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 CRO_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabin Model 1935"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG M.35"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."
 CRO_infantry_equipment_2: "Kratka strojnica Model 1939"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Danuvia M.39"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."
 CRO_infantry_equipment_3: "Strojokarabin Model 1942"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zbrojovka Brno M.42"
 CRO_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."
 CRO_infantry_weapons2: "Kratka strojnica Model 1934"
 CRO_infantry_weapons2_short: "Steyr-Solothurn M.34"
 CRO_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While a German design by Louis Stange, the  MP 34 was mainly produced by Steyr and was adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army. As common with early submachine guns, this design was heavy, expensive, but reliable, with a horizontal magazine using the potent 9x25mm Mauser cartridge."

Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

An abject failure in the U.S. Army's 1929 self-loading rifle trials, the design was taken up again after the outbreak of the American Civil War. Due to the CSA's need to develop the rifle as quickly as possible, interchangability of parts and ease of construction were important to the design process.

 CUB_infantry_equipment_0_short: "M1903 Springfield"
 CUB_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Model 1903 was developed at Springfield Arsenal when, following the Spanish-American war, the United States deemed the Krag–Jørgensen rifle inadequate on account of its weak action; at its core, the 1903 was an attempt to combine beneficial features of both the Krag and captured Spanish Mausers. The rifle was gradually adopted along with the .30-06 cartridge both before and while the rest of the world waged the Weltkrieg."

The Cristóbal is a development of those SMGs redesigned around a new intermediate calibre cartride. While it was ultimately rejected by the Dual Monarchy, the Dominican Republic, where Király had once considered immigrating, proved more receptive, adopting the gun as the 'Cristóbal' Carbine after the city of San Cristóbal. Cuba licensed production soon after its Dominican introduction."

Starting in 1933, the Ottoman Empire updated their old rifles to a common configuration known as the Model of 1938 and all in 8x57 Mauser cartridge.

 CVG_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser-Vergueiro"
 CVG_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "A bolt action rifle with a long history of service, the 6,5 mm m/1904 is more commonly known by the moniker of 'Mauser-Vergueiro', as the main design of the gun is essentially that of the Mauser 98 (with a special bolt action mechanism heavily based on the Gewehr 1888) with the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro cartridge, one developed specifically for the portuguese variant. It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese Africa."
 CVG_infantry_equipment_1: "Espingarda 7.92 mm m/1904/36 "
 CVG_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser-Vergueiro M36"
 CVG_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Fundamentally little more than an updated version of the Mauser-Vergueiro, it was introduced to Africa amid rising tensions between Portugal and Germany. A significant amount of these weapons later found themselves under use by the forces of the states in former Portuguese Africa."
 CVG_infantry_equipment_2: "Carabina C.A.P Modelo 01"
 CVG_infantry_equipment_2_short: "C.A.P M40"
 CVG_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "A prototype carbine that saw little widespread use in Portugal's army as a whole was the country's first attempt at a standard issue, nationally produced design. As such, the nationalist Integralist junta supported the development of the C.A.P carbine intensely, but by the time it was ready for production, realities on the ground made it more worthwhile to switch to the FBP overall directly from the older Mauser-Vergueiro and variants already widely in use by the armed forces."
 CVG_infantry_equipment_3: "Pistola-Metralhadora FBP M/945"
 CVG_infantry_equipment_3_short: "FBP M/945"
 CVG_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The FBP submachine gun is named after the acronym for the Braço de Prata Factory, the manufacturer for the weapon, a foundry owned and controlled by the Portuguese government itself. While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The relative proximity both geographically and administratively with Portugal made it so the gun was unusually common in Cape Verde and was a common sight in the early forces of the newly founded republic after decolonisation."
 CVG_support_weapons: "Metralhadora Vickers & Morteiro Stokes"
 CVG_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the British Empire during the Weltkrieg. During its rearmament after the conflict, the restored Portuguese monarchy purchased and fabricated them with the intention of widespread use among infantry both at home and overseas."
 CVG_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora Lewis Modelo DEMS & Morteiro SBML de 2 Polegadas"
 CVG_support_weapons_2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis served the Entente since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. The MKIII variant had a pistol grip that allowed it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML, while small, is incredibly portable and had greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 CVG_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Vickers Modelo II & Morteiro ML de 3 Polegadas"
 CVG_support_weapons_3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG featured a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It had been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar was a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it was reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 CVG_support_weapons4: "Metralhadora Vickers-Vedras & Morteiro de 4.2 Polegadas"
 CVG_support_weapons_4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar was a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 CVG_infantry_at: "Morteiro-Bombarda"
 CVG_infantry_at_desc: "Developed in Canada and sold in substantial amounts to Portugal, the mortar design was that of a 'spigot' mortar. Arguing that the design could serve as both an artillery piece and an anti-tank weapon, the design was eagerly adopted by several allies of the Entente, including Portugal. Many ended up stranded in its former overseas possessions."
 CVG_infantry_at2: "LATI"
 CVG_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the LATI (A direct translation of its Canadian English name) was developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device was well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there were concerns about its intense recoil."

 CZE_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Karabina vzor 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."

 CZE_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG vz. 35"
 CZE_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

 CZE_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Seeing the need for a submachine-gun using the standard pistol cartridge of the Army, the Monarchy would adopt the ZK 383, designed by brothers Josef and František Koucký at Zbrojovka Brno, as the MP 38. Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

 DDR_mechanized_equipment_1: "Sonderkraftfahrzeug 11"
 DDR_mechanized_equipment_1_short: "Sd.Kfz. 11"
 DDR_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "The Sonderkraftfahrzeug 11 was developed from 1934 to 1938 and involved Borgward AG and, from 1937 onwards, the design became associated with Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG. Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent. Capable of carrying eight soldiers in addition to towing a gun or a trailer, the truck became the main vehicle of panzergrenadiers."
 DDR_mechanized_equipment_2: "Sonderkraftfahrzeug 251"

 DDR_mechanized_equipment_2_desc: "Developed on the chassis of Sd.Kfz. 11, the Schützenpanzerwagen Sonderkraftfahrzeug 251 half-tracks (commonly referred to as "SWP") are built by Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG specifically to quickly transport a squad of infantrymen to the front lines with adequate armour protection from small arms fire. The truck examples are usually assigned to armour units for the purpose of helping troops stay right behind the fast moving tanks."
 DDR_mechanized_equipment_3: "Sonderkraftfahrzeug 256"
 DDR_mechanized_equipment_3_short: "Sd.Kfz. 256"
 DDR_mechanized_equipment_3_desc: "In late 1943, the German Army asked Auto-Union to develop a light, fully tracked reconnaissance vehicle, capable of carrying 6-8 men in an open-top superstructure. Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

 DDR_gw_armored_car_equipment_short: "Sd.Kfz. 222"
 DDR_gw_armored_car_equipment_desc: "Introduced in 1936, the Leichter Panzerspähwagen ('light armoured reconnaissance vehicle') Sd. Kfz. 222 is a modernised version of the Sd. Kfz. 221. Being a road armoured car, manned by a three-man crew and has 4-wheel drive, the Sd.Kfz. 222 armed with a 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon and a 7,92-mm M.G. 13 machine gun. Performing well on the good road network, the reconnaissance vehicle suffered in performance on the rough terrain and was badly received by colonial troops."
 DDR_armored_car_equipment_1: "Schwerer Panzerspähwagen, 8-rad, Sonderkraftfahrzeug 231"
 DDR_armored_car_equipment_1_short: "Sd.Kfz. 231"
 DDR_armored_car_equipment_1_desc: "The Sd.Kfz. 231 Schwerer Panzerspähwagen ('heavy armoured reconnaissance vehicle') is a military designation for a line of reconnaissance armoured cars intended for armoured divisions. Initially developed in 1932 as 6 wheels variants, it was obvious that this variant will be obsolete in the nearest future. In 1937 the 8 wheels variant armed with 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon was introduced in service. The all-wheel drive four-axle Sd.Kfz. 231 are one of the most technically advanced armoured vehicles and are able to operate on rough terrain, with a cross-country comparable to that of tanks."
 DDR_armored_car_equipment_2: "Schwerer Panzerspähwagen, Sonderkraftfahrzeug 234"
 DDR_armored_car_equipment_2_short: "Sd. Kfz. 234"
 DDR_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "This new armoured car is seen as a successor to the eight-wheeled Panzerspähwagen Sd.Kfz.231. Among other priorities, better protection and heavier armament were viewed as crucial for the new armoured car. The production vehicle is heavier and bulkier than the Sd.Kfz.231, with mudguards that went along the side from end to end, with four storage compartments located inside. The main version of the vehicle, also known as Sd.Kfz.234/1, is armed with open-top turret fitted with a 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon and coaxial M.G. 34."

 DDR_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "A respectable armoured car, the Sd.Kfz.234/2 (also known as 'Puma') presents great speed and a significant 50 mm KwK.39/1 cannon. With improved frontal armour and formidable main gun, the car can traverse into volatile areas that are generally restricted to other like-minded vehicles. Being the greatly improved variant of the Sd.Kfz.234, the 'Puma' is intended to be used in a 6-strong platoon as a support vehicle. More often, though, commanders use the Sd.Kfz. 234/2 as fast tank hunters."

#Artillery

 DDR_artillery_equipment_1: "10,5-cm leichte Feldhaubitze Modell 33"
 DDR_artillery_equipment_1_short: "10,5-cm le.F.H. 33"
 DDR_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 DDR_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 DDR_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 DDR_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 DDR_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 DDR_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 DDR_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 DDR_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 DDR_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 DDR_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 DDR_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 DDR_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 DDR_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 DDR_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 DDR_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 DDR_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 DDR_anti_air_equipment_1: "2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 DDR_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 DDR_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 DDR_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 DDR_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 DDR_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 DDR_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 DDR_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 DDR_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

 DDR_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "28/32-cm Schweres Wurfgerät Modell 40"
 DDR_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_short: "s.W.G. 40"
 DDR_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed for Nebeltruppen (Smoke Troops) for smokescreen setting, the schwere Wurfgerät 40 exists in two variants - with wooden and steel frames. The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."
 DDR_rocket_artillery_equipment_2: "21-cm Raketenwerfer Modell 42"
 DDR_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_short: "R.W. 42"
 DDR_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

 DEH_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Ishapore SMLE Mk III"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Ishapore Rifle Factory was founded in 1904 and began producing the venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that would serve throughout the Great War. However, the loss of much of British India after the British Revolution also meant the loss of the Ishapore factory, one of the only two factories producing the SMLE outside of Britain, putting a serious strain in rifle production for the remnants of the Empire for years until what was salvaged from Ishapore could be set up in friendly territory."
 DEH_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 DEH_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 DEH_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 DEH_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""
 DEH_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 DEH_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 DEH_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 DEH_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 DEH_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"

 DEH_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 DEH_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 DEH_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 DEH_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 DEH_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 DEH_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 DEH_night_vision: "Tabby Scope"
 DEH_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark.""
 DEH_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 DEH_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 DEH_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 DEH_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 DEH_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 DEH_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."

 DEN_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Gevær M/89"
 DEN_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Gevær M/89 has been the primary Danish rifle since 1889. Considered to be on par with the rest of the rifles in Europe, the gun has a length of 133 cm, making it dangerous in the hands of a marksman. However, the gun's length sacrifices its mobility, and it can be pretty heavy and less manageable in close-range fighting. Thus, some variants of the weapon were modified into carbines for shorter engagements."

 DEN_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Fodfolkskarabin M/89-24"
 DEN_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Danish variation of the Krag–Jørgensen features a forward-hinged magazine door, rimmed ammunition, and outer steel liner for the barrel. Chambered for an 8x58R cartridge, the Danish rifle was often placed in the hands of the reserves as an infantry carbine. As Scandanavia finds itself increasingly on the frontline of a potential European war, the Danish Army has pushed for more 89/24s for frontline military service."
 DEN_infantry_equipment_2: "Lettet–Forsøgs Maskinpistol 31"

 DEN_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "A submachine gun of Danish origin, the \"Lettet–Forsøgs M/31\" is based on the Finnish Suomi KP-31. With the desire for greater firepower for Danish squads, the M/31 was made from stainless steel with a tubular buttstock and a distinctive ball-shaped wooden foregrip. The foregrip was designed with ergonomic flexibility for the user when handling the weapon. After repeated trials, however, many infantrymen found the foregrip unnecessarily and outright expensive for the gun's production."

 DEN_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "A semi-automatic rifle of Belgian origin, the Fabrique Nationale Model 1943, was shipped to various countries in Europe. As the Danish military command desired a semi-automatic battle rifle to improve the efficiency and firepower of the Danish riflemen, many orders were placed on the FN-1943. Firing in 7.92x57mm Mauser, the gun is gas operated, and initial testing has revealed that the weapon competes well against European and American models."

 DOM_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Krag–Jørgensen rifle was adopted by the United States in 1892 to replace the ageing Springfield Model 1884. While the Krags proved superior at close ranges to comparable Mauser designs in the Spanish-American war, the rifle's flimsy action in comparison to newer bolt designs necessitated a replacement a mere decade after its adoption. During the American occupations of several Central American nations in the early 20th century, many stockpiled Krag rifles, mostly of the 1898 rifle pattern, were given to local forces along with droves of surplus ammunition."

The SMLE Mk III came with the 1907 Pattern bayonet and a simplified rear sight arrangement, and a fixed charger guide. During the Weltkrieg, demand outstripped supply and thus many copies of the Mk III comes with the deletion of the magazine cutoff."
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle No.4 Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_short: "No.4 Mk I"
 ENG_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the revolution and civil war it became apparent that the No.3 Enfield was not fit for urban combat. " Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.In 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, and a simplified bolt system." The No.4 is the newest member in the family of Lee-Enfield rifles. While similar to its predecessors, the No.4 is stronger and easier to produce. A bit heavier due to its barrel; an interesting fact about the No.4 is that it comes with an aperture sight that is set at increments of 100 yds (91m); calibrated for 200-1,300 yards (183-1189 metres)."

Seeking a replacement for the Vickers and Lewis; the Enfield-Automatic is magazine fed which reduces its rate of fire - however this prevents overheating. Much lighter than belt fed machine guns; the Enfield Automatic will serve the next generation of Tommies in the trenches. The ML 3inch mortar is able to provide effective close artillery support while being portable."

 ENG_support_weapons4_desc: "As the war drags on; improvements to existing models are constantly being made. The Mk V variant of the Enfield-Automatic features a telescopic sight and an improved cooling system. The ML 4.2 inch mortar is a heavy mortar.

 ERI_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "In response to several commercially successful short rifles produced on the basis of the Mauser 1898 by competing arms manufacturers, the Mauser company developed its owned moderately shortened 1898 rifle. Two related patterns of this design were given the designation 'standard modell' by Mauser. Many small nations, including Ethiopia purchased these new guns in large quantites; the Ethiopian variant is the older of the two and is chambered in 7.65×53mm Mauser. With the revolt, large quantities of these rifles were captured by Eritrea and became the main rifle of its fledgling armed forces."

Yang Zengxin, the governor of Xinjiang, was surprised by the French expedition across the Silk Road, and warmly received the expedition team. Seeing that these trucks can drive continuously in harsh environments, during the expedition's stay in Xinjiang, Yang Zengxin proposed to purchase a batch of Citroën P21 cars, and the expedition readily agreed to this request because the purpose of their expedition was to advertise for Citroën. Soon after the expedition arrived in Beijing in February 1932, the French shipped the first batch of auto parts and engineers to Xinjiang. This truck has also become the most common automobile in Xinjiang."

His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

Many of these carbines eventually fell into the hands of the Chilean Carabinieros, who found the rifle unsatisfactory and lobbied for its replacement. In 1935, a new pattern with improved ergonomics and a new larger magazine with more robust feed lips and loader was approved and entered into production shortly thereafter.

 FRA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Lebel is an 8mm bolt action rifle that has entered French military service since 1887. The world's first firearm to utilize smokeless powder, the rifle is known for its durability and long range. The primary weapon of the French soldier in the trenches of the Weltkrieg; large quantities of the rifle still exist even now under the new regime of the Commune."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1: "MAS Modèle 1936"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "MAS-36"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The proximity of France to the destested German Empire has hastened the call for a more modern bolt action rifle. The new MAS 36 rifle has been chosen by the Commune as the new bolt-action rifle for the revolution. A short 'carbine' style rifle that features dirt resistance and is relatively cheap to produce; the MAS 36 shall serve as the new standard arm to defend France from all her enemies."
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2: "MAS Modèle 1938"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "MAS-38"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Following the end of the Weltkrieg, a small arms development program took place in the Service Technique de l'Armement. With the help of MAS (the weapon's industry , the MAS 38 would be France's first submachine gun. An extremely high quality weapon, the MAS 38 features a fire rate of 650 rounds per minute although its appearance is rather odd given its unorthodox layout."

 FRA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "MAS-40/42"
 FRA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The MAS-40/42 is the latest in a series of Communard semi-automatic rifles. Unlike its predecessors, however, the MAS-40/42 was found to be exceptionally reliable in French military testing. The original five round internal magazine, however, was deemed insufficient and a new variant of the MAS-40/42, the 40/42, was developed featuring a detachable ten round box magazine."
 FRA_support_weapons: "FM Chauchat & Brandt Mle 27/31"
 FRA_support_weapons_desc: "Tried and tested in the trenches of the Weltkrieg, the Chauchat has long been hated by the French infantryman. However, despite the hatred for this weapon, when it is not jammed with dirt and mud, the gun is quite reliable to control, and the Chauchat can be fired from the hip as well. The Brandt mortar is a relic from the Weltkrieg, a refinement of the British 'Stokes' trench mortar. A simple and effective weapon, the mortar can be dissembled into three parts and requires a crew of ten."

 FRA_support_weapons3_desc: "It is clear to the command of the Commune that the Chauchat and Hotchkiss are seriously outdated. Our designers have come up with a much lighter gun in preparation for the coming war than the Hotchkiss. While the Chatelleraut features a low fire rate, it is a robust and reliable weapon; well-liked by our troops for its consistency and weight. The Brandt Mle 35 is a 60mm mortar to be used by infantry companies for indirect fire. Simple and effective, it only requires a crew of five to operate."
 FRA_support_weapons4: "MAS AA-42 & Brandt Mle 1942"
 FRA_support_weapons4_desc: "Experience in the Second Weltkrieg has led to an interest in general purpose machine guns to serve a variety of tactical roles. With nearly double the rate of fire of the Chatelleraut, the AA-42 is a belt-fed monster that will mow down anything in its path. The Mle 42 is a considerable improvement over its predecessor, with an emphasis on a greater close quarters support weapon."

While earlier varients were long and limited mobility, the carbine version allows for greater movement on the battlefield. This 1938 version features numerous changes to its predecessors such as simpler production, takedown, and cleaning of the rifle."

 GAL_infantry_equipment_0: "Karabinek wzór 1895/30"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mannlicher wz. 95/30"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Karabinek wzór 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 GAL_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabinek wzór 1935"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG wz. 35"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."
 GAL_infantry_equipment_2: "Pistolet maszynowy wzór 1939"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Danuvia wz. 39"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."
 GAL_infantry_equipment_3: "Karabinek maszynowy wzór 1942"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zbrojovka Brno wz. 42"
 GAL_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."
 GAL_infantry_weapons2: "Pistolet maszynowy wzór 1934"
 GAL_infantry_weapons2_short: "Steyr-Solothurn wz. 34"
 GAL_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While a German design by Louis Stange, the  MP 34 was mainly produced by Steyr and was adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army. As common with early submachine guns, this design was heavy, expensive, but reliable, with a horizontal magazine using the potent 9x25mm Mauser cartridge."
 GAL_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Pistolet maszynowy wzór 38"
 GAL_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "Zbrojovka Brno wz. 38"
 GAL_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Seeing the need for a submachine-gun using the standard pistol cartridge of the Army, the Monarchy would adopt the ZK 383, designed by brothers Josef and František Koucký at Zbrojovka Brno, as the MP 38. Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

#GBR_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Long, Ross Mk III"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Ross Mk III"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Initially adopted in 1903, the Ross rifle saw several upgrades before the Great War, culminating in the Mk III in 1910. Initially a symbol of patriotism among Canadians as the British refused to license the Lee-Enfield to them, the rifle received an abysmal reputation within the first year of the war, unable to handle the lower quality of British-made ammunition and significantly worse with trench conditions than its contemporaries, and was officially pulled out of service in 1916. Nevertheless, the SMLE was never produced in Canada before the British Revolution, prompting its unwanted return to service as a stopgap until production of the SMLE could begin at Long Branch, Ontario."
 GBR_infantry_equipment_1: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk V"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the loyal Dominions only had access to one arsenal capable of producing its service rifle. Some British engineers from Enfield took refuge in Ontario. With the help of the Lithgow factory in Australia, they continued their work on upgrading the venerable SMLE, resulting in the Mk V. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the receiver instead of the middle, improving sighting radius, accuracy, and speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 GBR_infantry_equipment_2: "Carbine, Machine, Owen Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Gun"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 GBR_infantry_equipment_3: "Rifle, Self-Loading, Long Branch Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat."
 GBR_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 GBR_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 GBR_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 GBR_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 GBR_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 GBR_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 GBR_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 GBR_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 GBR_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 GBR_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 GBR_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 GBR_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 GBR_night_vision: "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 GBR_night_vision_short: "Tabby Scope"
 GBR_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 GBR_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Machine, Thompson Mk I"
 GBR_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States."
 GBR_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Carbine, Machine, Lanchester Mk I"
 GBR_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 GBR_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Commando, De Lisle Mk I"
 GBR_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "What began as a private venture by engineer William Godfray de Lisle soon caught the attention of the RCMP's Special Branch looking to equip agents with improved weaponry. The De Lisle carbine is, essentially, a shortened SMLE converted to .45 ACP, a subsonic cartridge with an integrated suppressor. The suppressor and ammunition together produced as little as 85.5 decibels when firing, making it very suitable for commando operations."

 GBR_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "With the success of the Rover under its belt, the Ruskin Motor Bodies company designed the Rhino in response to an Australasian government request for a substantially heavier armoured car built upon the CMP chassis. Though substantial changes were made to that CMP chassis, after much work the Rhino was born, and with substantial interchangability of parts with other CMP-based designs to boot."

 GBR_armored_car_at_equipment_short: "Hippo"
 GBR_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "To accommodate a substantially larger gun, the Rhino's coaxial machine had to be removed and its turret slightly enlarged. The 'Hippo' as this model has been designated, proved to be quite the headache for its design team, as these changes caused the already heavy vehicle to run into weight issues like its predecessors which had to be slowly worked out prior to the vehicle's adoption."

Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent. Capable of carrying eight soldiers in addition to towing a gun or a trailer, the truck became the main vehicle of panzergrenadiers."

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen 'Kätzchen' (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

 GER_infantry_equipment_0: "Gewehr Modell 98"
 GER_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser G. 98"
 GER_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Gewehr 98 (Rifle 98) was the standard German infantry weapon of the Weltkrieg. It is a good example of the type of military rifle designed around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when rifle development reached fever pitch. In common with other armies, the German infantry carried a full length rifle, while other troops were issued with shorter carbines. The bolt and magazine system of the Gewehr 98 was designed by the Mauser company, although the rifle was produced under licence by a number of other commercial manufacturers. It was a well-made and accurate weapon, but was not well suited to trench warfare."
 #Mauser Standardmodell :
 GER_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabiner Modell 98 Ausführung B"
 GER_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser Kar. 98b"
 GER_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs."
 GER_infantry_equipment_2: "Selbstladegewehr Modell 40"
 GER_infantry_equipment_2_short: "S.G. 40"
 GER_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by the Mauser company in response to a desire of the German Army for a self-loading rifle with a backup bolt action, the Selbstladegewehr 40 is a massive leap forward in German small arms design. While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the Heer eventually dropped some of its other specific requirements for the rifle. The end result was the initial prototype with only a few design edits, and it proved effective."
 GER_infantry_equipment_3: "Maschinenkarabiner Modell 42"
 GER_infantry_equipment_3_short: "M.Kb. 42"
 GER_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Maschinenkarabiner 42 is a revolutionary design chambered for a new intermediate cartridge, developed by famous German arms designer Hugo Schmeisser, in conjunction with the Haenel company. While the first prototype of the rifle was prone to jamming, both the military and even the Kaiser himself were extremely enthusiastic about the project, and immense resources were concentrated on improving the design, with the rifle deemed ready for adoption in 1942."
 #G33/40:

 GER_infantry_weapons2_short: "G. 98/38"
 GER_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Gewehr 98/38, also simply known as the G. 98/38, is a bolt-action rifle, sometimes considered a carbine, and based heavily on the Gewehr 98. The rifle is rather short, at only one metre long. Originally designed for the Mountain troops, the G. 98/38 was soon adopted by other German forces, including some cavalry and infantry regiments."
 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 40"
 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "M.P. 40"
 GER_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The M.P. 40, sometimes incorrectly called 'Schmeisser', was developed by Heinrich Vollmer and based on M.P. 38, with the aim of equipping German soldiers with an assault weapon. It uses magazines of 32 cartridges of 9mm, with its effective range being about 100-150 metres. It is a very reliable and particularly economical weapon to manufacture, usually used by officers, mechanised infantry and paratroopers."

 GER_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Maschinenkarabiner 44 is the outcome of the German need to provide infantrymen with heavier firepower from their rifles. As a result of the continuous development of M.Kb. 42, the M.Kb. 44 is devoid of many of the disadvantages of the previous design and is even sometimes called the 'Sturmgewehr' - the assault rifle. The final design has a shorter range than contemporary rifles due to German research that most of the combat in the European War takes place at distances less than 300 metres. At the sacrifice of range, close range firepower was greatly improved."

 GER_infantry_at: "Panzerabwehrrohr"
 GER_infantry_at_short: "Pa.R."
 GER_infantry_at_desc: "The Panzerabwehrrohr is the brainchild of Dr. Heinrich Langweiler, in response to an urgent requirement for a light one-shot throw-away infantry weapon with which infantry could use to tackle the growing numbers of enemy heavy and medium tanks, that are frequently overwhelming German defences. The range of the first Panzerabwehrrohr was only 30 metres, which made their use somewhat hazardous, until more developed variants with increased range came to production."

Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks’ armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers. As a drawback, the R.Pz.B. 54 produces a lot of smoke upon firing."

In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Now, as we find ourselves watched by enemies such as the Commune of France, these weapons from the Weltkrieg will be brought back into service."

 GER_support_weapons2_desc: "The Maschinengewehr Modell 34 (M.G. 34) is a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility make it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world; a testament to the power of the Kaiserreich. The 8-cm schwerer Granatwerfer Modell 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."

 GER_support_weapons3_desc: "The Maschinengewehr Modell 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and was suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Ladungswerfer Modell 40 was a spigot mortar designed for striking obstalces and strong points."

 GER_support_weapons4_short: "M.G. 42 & Kz. 8-cm G.W. 42"
 GER_support_weapons4_desc: "Nicknamed the "Kaiser's Buzzsaw" given its incredibly high rate of fire at 1,200 rounds per minute, the M.G. 42 was the most effective support weapon of its time. Designed to be low cost and easy to build, the MG-42 proved to be highly reliable and easy to operate. It ws most notable for its very high cyclic rate for a gun using full power catridges and was adopted for both light machine gun fire roles and medium machine gun fire roles."
 GER_night_vision: "Zielgerät 1229"

 GER_night_vision_desc: "The Z.G. 1229, also known in its code name 'Vampir', is an active infrared device developed for the M.Kb. 44 rifle. The Vampir weighs 2.25 kilograms and was fitted with lugs on the M.Kb. 44 at the C.G. Haenel weapons’ production facility in Suhl. As well as the sight and infrared spotlight, there is a 13.5 kilogram wooden cased battery for the light, and a second battery fitted inside a gas mask container to power the image converter. A grenadier carrying the Z.G. 1229 is known as a Nachtjäger (night-hunter)."

 GER_motorized_equipment_1_desc: "The German Army in the early 1930s had more than 100 different vehicle designs in service, leading to massive logistical difficulties. In order to standardise their vehicle fleet, they opted for a commercial truck design by Adam Opel AG of Brandenburg to become their standard cargo truck. With only slight modifications to meet military requirements, presented in 1930, the Opel Blitz was accepted in service with designation Kraftfahrzeug 305 and by 1936 became the main truck of the German Army. Although well built, the Kfz.305 suffers from being rather too complicated for reliability in the rugged conditions, but still has better performance than other German trucks."

 GER_mechanized_equipment_1_short: "Sd.Kfz. 11"
 GER_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "The Sonderkraftfahrzeug 11 was developed from 1934 to 1938, involving Borgward AG. Fom 1937 onwards, the design became associated with Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG. Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent. Capable of carrying eight soldiers in addition to towing a gun or a trailer, the truck became the main vehicle of panzergrenadiers."

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen “Kätzchen” (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour. Warmly met by the German Military despite not very high speed, the vehicle was adopted in service under the name Sd.Kfz. 256."

Ordered in 1935 for use by German Army engineers, the Landwasserschlepper (Land Water Tractor) was intended as a lightweight river tug with some capacity to operate on land. Designed by Borsig of Düsseldorf, the hull of the L.W.S. is similar to that of a motor launch, resembling a tracked boat with twin rear-mounted tunnelled propellers and twin rudders. On land, it moves on steel-shod tracks with four bogies per side."

Being the greatly improved variant of the Sd.Kfz.234, the 'Puma' is intended to be used in a 6-strong platoon as a support vehicle. More often, though, commanders use the Sd.Kfz. 234/2 as fast tank hunters."

 GER_train_equipment_2_short: "Prussian G 13"
 GER_train_equipment_2_desc: "Designed with the experience of operating the Prussian G 12 locomotives in the Great War and prioritising ease of manufacture, a long service life and ease of maintenance, the G 13 was the answer. It could haul up to 40% more freight than the other locomotives they were replacing, and were cheaper to produce."

 GER_train_equipment_3_desc: "As railways started to be attacked by enemy aircraft, new locomotives to serve on the fronts need to be able to take hits from up to 20mm cannons. To protect the locomotive for service against air attack, some Prussian G 13 locomotives are fitted with three-inch-thick armour plates along the locomotive to protect the vital parts."

 GER_artillery_equipment_1_short: "10,5-cm le.F.H. 33"
 GER_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 GER_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 GER_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 GER_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 GER_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 GER_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 GER_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 GER_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 GER_anti_air_equipment_1: "2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 GER_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 GER_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 GER_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

 GER_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed for Nebeltruppen (Smoke Troops) for smokescreen setting, the schwere Wurfgerät 40 exists in two variants - with wooden and steel frames. The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."

 GER_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."

 GRP_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest german semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."

 GRP_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."

 GRP_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Fermany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 GRP_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 GRU_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 GRU_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 GRU_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 GRU_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 GRU_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"

 GRU_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"

 GRU_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 GRU_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."

 GRU_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 GRU_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"

 GRU_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

 HUN_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher 1895/1930 Minta karabély (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 HUN_infantry_equipment_1: "1935 Minta karabély"
 HUN_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG 35.M"
 HUN_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

 HUN_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Seeing the need for a submachine-gun using the standard pistol cartridge of the Army, the Monarchy would adopt the ZK 383, designed by brothers Josef and František Koucký at Zbrojovka Brno, as the MP 38. Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority.

The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."

Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."

Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 GOY_anti_air_equipment_3: "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 GOY_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Fermany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 GOY_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 GOY_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Following the specifications of the original models, rockets of 32cm were used in these weapons, and a lack of said rockets is exactly why they were seldom used."

 GOY_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Changes to the size of the rockets required for usage made later models more common, but still far from standard issue and few pieces of the LF de 21cm were used in the field when compared to even the M43."

 ITA_infantry_equipment_0: "Carcano Modello 1891"
 ITA_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Carcano M91"
 ITA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Carcano M91 is an Italian bolt action carbine. Designed by Salvatore Carcano at the Turin Army Arsenal in 1891, the carbine fires 6.5 x 52mm Carcano cartridges. The magazine system uses en bloc charger clips which were originally developed by Ferdinand Mannlicher - hence why the gun is often referred to as the 'Mannlicher-Carcano.' Popular during the Weltkrieg and the civil war, the M91 is a staple in the Italian Federation's military."
 ITA_infantry_equipment_1: "Carcano M38"
 ITA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Carcano M38"
 ITA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Carcano M38 is the 1938 variant in the Carcano family of infantry rifles. Adopted in 1938 and features 7.35x51 mm calibre, fixed sights, detachable folding knife bayonet, and 20.9 inches barrel."
 ITA_infantry_equipment_2: "Moschetto Automatico Beretta 1938"
 ITA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "MAB-38"
 ITA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Also known as the 'Modello 38', the MAB-38 is a submachine gun designed by Beretta. The MAB-38 can be recognised by its machined steel receiver, fine craftsmanship, and perforated cooling jacket over the barrel. The gun fires 9x19mm Parabellum at 600 rounds per minute, making it a deadly weapon in close quarters and urban combat. Interestingly enough, the gun features two triggers for two firing modes; the fore trigger is for semi-automatic fire while the rear trigger is for fully automatic."
 ITA_infantry_equipment_3: "Pavesi FNAB-42"
 ITA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "FNAB-42"
 ITA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "An expensive weapon to manufacture; the Pavesi FNAB-42's design reflects the extensive milling and percisive engineering in its manufacture. The FNAB-42 uses a delayed-blowback system that fires from a closed bolt position - this allows the rate of fire to be kept at a steady 400 rpm without having to use a heavy bolt and strong spring. The complexity of this weapon reflects the latest sophistication of Italian ingenuity."
 ITA_infantry_at: "Mortaio d'Assalto 45/5"
 ITA_infantry_at_desc: "Like all modern European militaries; the Italian Federation adopted light infantry mortars for the purpose of indirect fire support. The mortar features an unusual feature, a folding steel tripod mounting affixed to a launch tube. A well trained crew can fire between 8 to 10 rounds per minute making it capable for incredible suppressive fire."
 ITA_infantry_at2: "Fucile Anticarro S-2"
 ITA_infantry_at2_desc: "A 7.9mm anti-tank rife; the Fucile Anticarro S-2 is a Mauser-style bolt action rifle fed from a 4 round magazine. The barrel has a muzzle break that reduces recoil. It can penetrate 15mm of armour at 300 metres distance and 33mm of armour at 100 metres."
 ITA_support_weapons: "Fiat–Revelli M14 & Stokes mortar"
 ITA_support_weapons_desc: " The standard machine guns of the Italian Army during the Weltkrieg, the Fiat-Revelli M14 features selective fire and a strip-fed magazine box of 50 or 100 bullets. Like the Stokes mortar; these Weltkrieg-era weapons have been repurposed for the ever growing threat of the continuation of the civil war."
 ITA_support_weapons2: "Breda M30 & Mortaio da 81 M35"
 ITA_support_weapons2_desc: "The Breda M30 is an unusual weapon. It is fed from a fixed magazine attached to its side and is loaded with steel 20 round stripper clips. The firing rate and low magazine capacity makes the weapon more ideal as a semi-automatic rifle instead of a light machine gun. The Mortaio 81 is a lightweight Brandt-style mortar that has seen great feedback in the testing ranges due to its range capacity and reliability. The mortar uses two shells; one heavy high-explosive shell and another lighter shell for long-distance fire."
 ITA_support_weapons3: "Breda M37 & Mortaio da 81 CEMSA L.P."
 ITA_support_weapons3_desc: "The Breda M37 is a medium machine gun produced by Breda. The gas-operated air cooled medium machine gun is fairly reliable in the field. Its slow rate of fire helps prevent overheating during prolonged fire and its powerful heavy bullet cartridge has excellent range and penetration."
 ITA_support_weapons4: "Breda Mod.5C & Mortaio da 81 CEMSA L.P"
 ITA_support_weapons4_desc: "The Breda Mod.5C is an Italian heavy machine gun. A reflection of Italian military doctrine, the Breda was intended for ambushes and attacks. While its rate of fire is slow (as with most Italian machine guns); the Breda 5C was still regarded as one of the deadliest weapons in the Italian arsenal given the Italain Army's lack of heavy machine guns and submachine guns."
 ITA_infantry_weapons2: "Beretta M1918/38"
 ITA_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Beretta M1918 is an Italian sub-machine gun used during the Weltkrieg. The gun was made from half of a Villar-Perosa aircraft submachine gun and features an incredible rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute. The 1938 variant features the same rate of fire as the iconic weapon but has been refined to reduce the weapon's recoil and increase its sturdiness."
 ITA_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Pavesi M40"
 ITA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The Pavesi M40 is an Italian semi-auto rifle chambered for the 8x59 Breda cartridge. It is a short recoil action with 4-lug rotating bolt and uses a Mannlicher bloc clip."
 ITA_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "TZ-44"
 ITA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "Designed by a colonel and gunsmith (Tonon and Zorzoli hence the name 'TZ'); the TZ-44 is an impressive sub-machine gun capable of firing 9x19mm Parabellum at 800 rounds per minute. The gun action is simple blowback but the return spring is assembled around a guide rod which is in two pieces and telescopes as the bolt returns. Like other Italian weapons, the gun features selective fire. It also features a noteworthy 'double safety' to ensure that accidental discharges would not happen."

 ITA_train_equipment_1_desc: "Designed by the Adriatic Railways shortly before the nationalisation of the railways in 1905, the 740 Group is a series of 'Consolidation' class locomotives. Built to haul heavy trains on the mountainous lines of the Northern Appennine, while keeping a comparatively low axle load of 14 tons to run on older, less frequently mantained tracks, these engines excelled in their task, and were subsequently built in copious number before the Great War. Distributed across the Peninsula to relieve the older pre-nationalisation engines, a good number of those engines ended up hauling heavy military trains (tradotte) during the War, and subsequently remained in our hands."
 ITA_train_equipment_2: "FS Gruppo 480"
 ITA_train_equipment_2_short: "FS Gr. 480"
 ITA_train_equipment_2_desc: "An evolution of the Austrian design for the pre-war Südbahn 580 Class, the 480 Group is a series of 'Decapod' class locomotives designed with heavy service on the Brenner Line towards Central Europe in mind. Though their higher axle load compared to their predecessors makes them harder to operate on older lines, various improvements such as the Caprotti valve gear make them both more powerful and cheaper to operate."

 JAM_infantry_equipment_0_short: "SMLE Mk III"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 JAM_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 JAM_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 JAM_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 JAM_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""

 JAM_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark.""
 JAM_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 JAM_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 JAM_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 JAM_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 JAM_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 JAM_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 JAM_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 JAM_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 JAM_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 JAM_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."

 JAM_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 JAM_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 JAM_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 JAM_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 JAM_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 JAM_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors.

 JAP_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1905, the '38th year 'of the Meiji Period (hence its name); the Type 38 uses the 6.5x50mm Arisaka cartridges. This cartridge produces little recoil when fired. The Type 38 at 128 cm is a long rifle due to the emphasis on bayonet training for Japanese soldiers of this era."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_1: "Arisaka Type 99"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Type 99"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Type 99 is intended to serve as a replacement for the Type 38. The Imperial Army recognised the weaknesses of the Type 38 and pushed for the Type 99 to serve as its replacement. The Type 99 was produced in four versions: the regular issue rifle, the 'long' rifle, a paratroop rifle, and a sniper variant."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2: "Kawamura Type 14"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Type 14"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "In 1931, the Japanese Army approached Kijiro Nambu to design a new semi-automatic rifle. His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3: "Yokosuka Type 4"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Type 4"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "Japan has long relied on bolt action rifles, and their age is beginning to show. Thus, with the Type 14, the Imperial Army at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal has designed the Type 4 semi-automatic rifle. Charged with two 5-round stripper clips, Type 4 comes in two variants: the navy and the other for the army. The development of this weapon would give the Japanese infantryman significantly more firepower on the battlefield than previous weapons."
 JAP_infantry_at: "Type 97 Anti-Tank Rifle"
 JAP_infantry_at_desc: "Given the fact that German tanks exist in China as well as the ever-present threat of the Russian bear on the borders, Type 97 was designed to combat armoured vehicles. The gun is a monstrosity of a weapon; it has an overall length of 2.09 metres and weighs 52 kilograms (115 pounds). Capable of penetrating 30mm of armour at a range of 250 metres; it is truly a fearsome weapon in the right hands."
 JAP_infantry_at2: "Type 4 70mm anti-tank Rocket Launcher"
 JAP_infantry_at2_desc: "The rocket launcher was made in two parts that are to be joined in the middle. Intended to be fired while lying down prone; the Type 4 rocket launcher uses a bipod and a mortar fuze. Interestingly enough, the Type 4 rocket uses angled venturis in the base to spin the rocket for stability."
 JAP_support_weapons: "Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun & Type 11 mortar"
 JAP_support_weapons_desc: "The Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun was based on the design of the French Hotchkiss M1914. The Type 3 uses an ammo strip for loading rounds, and its tripod could be used for anti-aircraft mounting. The Type 11 mortar was developed in the 11th year of the Taisho Emperor. Exceptional amongst Japanese weapons; Type 11 is a muzzle-loaded weapon with a rifled bore."
 JAP_support_weapons2: "Type 11 LMG & Type 10 grenade discharger"
 JAP_support_weapons2_desc: "Combat experience in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 taught the Imperial Army the utility of machine guns providing covering fire. The Type 11 was developed by the famed arms designer Kijiro Nambu based on a French Hotchkiss M1909 and is air-cooled and gas-operated. A unique feature about the Type 11 machine gun is its detachable hopper; it can be refilled while attached and does not require removal during operation. The Type 10 grenade discharger was a smoothbore muzzle-loaded weapon with an incredible range of 175 metres."
 JAP_support_weapons3: "Type 99 LMG & Type 94 mortar"
 JAP_support_weapons3_desc: "The Type 99 LMG uses the new rounds found in the Arisaka Type 99. Retaining the same design as previous light machine guns and bears a resemblance to the English Enfield-Automatic. The Type 99 also allows for the attachment of a standard-issue bayonet and 2.5x telescopic sight for marksmanship. The Type 94 mortar is a heavy mortar that has a range of 4000 yards. It is intended to serve as an artillery piece that could be hauled in pieces to remote areas."
 JAP_support_weapons4: "Type 1 HMG & Type 2 12 cm Mortar"
 JAP_support_weapons4_desc: "The Type 1 is a meatgrinder of a weapon. This gas operated heavy machine gun can also be fielded as an anti-aircraft weapon. The Type 2 mortar is virtually identical to the Stokes-Brandt 81mm mortar with the only difference being that the bipod legs of the Type 2 can be removed."
 JAP_infantry_weapons2: "Model 2 submachine gun"
 JAP_infantry_weapons2_desc: "Designed by famed arms designer Kijiro Nambu, the Model 2 is a blowback-operated submachine gun. One of Japan's first attempts at a submachine gun, the Model 2 features an incredible high rate of fire while also being light and portable. A pnuematic buffer device cushions the action of the gun and acts as a bolt delay."
 JAP_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Type 100"
 JAP_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Type 100 is Japan's first mass-produced submachine gun. Although there are variants with bipods and increased sights for cavalry units, it is designed for infantry use. The gun fires 8mm at 450 rounds per minute. Interestingly some variants have been converted to folding stocks for use by army paratroopers."
 JAP_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Type 100/44"
 JAP_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "This 1944 modification of Type 100 includes several changes designed to simplify the weapon. The 1944 variant is longer than the earlier Type 100 with simple iron sights and a greatly simplified muzzle. The firing rate of the 1944 version is also considerably higher, with the gun firing at 800 rounds per minute. The gun is an absolute monster at close ranges with satisfactory accuracy and low recoil."

 JAP_train_equipment_1_desc: "While the Class D50 was well liked, the financial situation of the early 1930s led to no new freight locomotive designs until 1936. The latest freight locomotive design, the Class D51 had numerous improvements, from the use of welding, implementing a higher pressure boiler, revised cylinders, reduced axle load and overall shortening the locomotive, it proved a great step up from its predecessor."

 JAP_train_equipment_2_desc: "Based on the D51 design, the D52 incorporated numerous austerity modifications to improve the performance of the locomotive and reduce the cost of production. The design has a larger boiler and grate area, leading to higher tractive effort, while austerity considerations allow for replacing the running board with wood and looser production standards for most components."

 LEC_infantry_equipment_0_short: "No.1 Mk III*"
 LEC_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Alongside the German Mauser, the Lee-Enfield is perhaps one of the most recognisable rifles in service with any military. Although the No.1 Mk III* saw use in the Legation Cities well before the Weltkrieg in the hands of the old British garrison, the revolution in 1926 and the retreat of the China Station to Australasia in the same year saw the rifle continue service with police forces across the Legation Cities, as well as with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.\n\nAs most of these rifles were Weltkrieg-era surplus, and many have long been without proper maintenance or replaceable parts, attrition has taken its toll. Now that there may be too few rifles to furnish an expanded police force, some have come to regard the Lee-Enfield as necessarily obsolete."

 LEC_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser 98b is the cutting edge of German bolt-action rifle technology. With an easier to operate bolt, superior ironsights, an improved stock, and a lighter build, this weapon is a substantial improvement over its predecessors. The 98b is also especially practical in China, as the most common rifle beyond the Neutral Zone is the Hanyang 88, a copy of the older Mauser 1888, with which it shares ammunition."
 LEC_infantry_equipment_2: "Selbstladegewehr 40"
 LEC_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Selbstlader 40"
 LEC_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by the Mauser company in response to a German Army desire for a self-loading rifle with a backup bolt action, the Selbstladegewehr 40 was a massive leap forward in German small arms design. While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the German army eventually dropped some its other specific requirements for the rifle, and the end result, the predecessor the rifle that would ultimately be adopted, proved effective."

 LEC_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The MKb 42 is a revolutionary design chambered for a new intermediate cartridge, developed by famous German arms designer Hugo Schmeisser in conjunction with the Haenel company. While the first prototype of the rifle was prone to jamming, both the military and even the Kaiser himself were extremely enthusiastic about the project and immense resources were concentrated on improving the design, with the rifle deemed ready for adoption in 1942."

The top of the carriage is equipped with a machine gun or infantry support gun, with several shooting holes at the rear. The compartment of the armoured vehicle has skylights, allowing the crews to reach out of the compartment, in order to suppress a crowd with strong light or high-pressure water guns. The huge carriage of the armoured vehicle made it look like a prison vehicle, so people gave this unnamed riot control vehicle a derogatory nickname: 'Feixing Baolei' or 'Flying Fortress'.

Liberia acquired its Krags as highly discounted military assistance from the United States shortly after the fall of France in Europe, thanks largely to American fears of Nationalist French invasion of the country."

 LIT_infantry_equipment_0_short: "25 MM"
 LIT_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Germany's eastern allies all had large stocks of Russian Mosin rifles, but they all adopted the 8mm Mauser cartridge to match German standards. Wanting to make cost-effective use of existing stocks until more Mauser rifles were available, Polish arsenals worked to convert Mosin rifles into carbines chambering the new official cartridge.

 LIT_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. Many models were ordered by Lithuanian government."

 LIT_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "While the sub-machine gun concept was well-proven during the latter phase of the Weltkrieg, many nations see serious shortage of the weapon type as the Second Weltkrieg broke out. Unable to secure the German Army's standard MP-40, the Oststaaten often have to make due with what is commercially available through private firms. The MP-35, designed by Emil Bergmann and notable for its horizontal magazine on the right side, is a popular choice thanks to its relative ruggedness and affordability, along with Bergmann's willingness to license the design."

Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks' armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers. As a drawback, the R.Pz.B. 54 produces a lot of smoke upon firing. Many shipped over from Germany given Lithuania's lack of anti tank weapons."

Initially developed in 1932 as 6 wheels variants, it was obvious that this variant will be obsolete in the nearest future. In 1937 the 8 wheels variant armed with 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon was introduced in service. The all-wheel drive four-axle Sd.Kfz. 231 are one of the most technically advanced armoured vehicles and are able to operate on rough terrain, with a cross-country comparable to that of tanks."

 MAF_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 MAF_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 MAF_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 MAF_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 MAF_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 MAF_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 MAF_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 MAF_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 MAF_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 MAF_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."

The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

 MZB_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "A bolt action rifle with a long history of service, the 6,5 mm m/1904 is more commonly known by the moniker of 'Mauser-Vergueiro', as the main design of the gun is essentially that of the Mauser 98 (with a special bolt action mechanism heavily based on the Gewehr 1888) with the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro cartridge, one developed specifically for the portuguese variant. It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."

 MZB_infantry_equipment_2_short: "C.A.P M40"
 MZB_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "A prototype carbine that saw little widespread use in Portugal's army as a whole was the country's first attempt at a standard issue, nationally produced design. As such, the nationalist Integralist junta supported the development of the C.A.P carbine intensely, but by the time it was ready for production, realities on the ground made it more worthwhile to switch to the FBP overall directly from the older Mauser-Vergueiro and variants already widely in use by the armed forces."
 MZB_infantry_equipment_3: "Pistola-Metralhadora FBP M/945"
 MZB_infantry_equipment_3_short: "FBP M/945"
 MZB_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The FBP submachine gun is named after the acronym for the Braço de Prata Factory, the manufacturer for the weapon, a foundry owned and controlled by the Portuguese government itself. While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg. While few of the models made it overseas when compared to the old Mauser-Vergueiro, the government of Mozambique was capable of starting production domestically relatively swiftly after decolonisation."
 MZB_support_weapons: "Metralhadora Vickers & Morteiro Stokes"
 MZB_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the British Empire during the Weltkrieg.

 MZB_support_weapons_2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis served the Entente since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. The MKIII variant had a pistol grip that allowed it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML, while small, is incredibly portable and had greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 MZB_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Vickers Modelo II & Morteiro ML de 3 Polegadas"
 MZB_support_weapons_3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG featured a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It had been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar was a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it was reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 MZB_support_weapons4: "Metralhadora Vickers-Vedras & Morteiro de 4.2 Polegadas"
 MZB_support_weapons_4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar was a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 MZB_infantry_at: "Morteiro-Bombarda"
 MZB_infantry_at_desc: "Developed in Canada and sold in substantial amounts to Portugal, the mortar design was that of a 'spigot' mortar. Arguing that the design could serve as both an artillery piece and an anti-tank weapon, the design was eagerly adopted by several allies of the Entente, including Portugal. Many ended up stranded in its former overseas possessions."
 MZB_infantry_at2: "LATI"
 MZB_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the LATI (A direct translation of its Canadian English name) was developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device was well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there were concerns about its intense recoil."

 NEE_night_vision2_short: "M3 Sniperscope"
 NEE_night_vision2_desc: "In response to the poor reception of the M1 Sniperscope, the Sniperscope M3 was adopted. With almost twice the effective range of the M1, a more robust infrared light source, and the T23 flash hider, the M3 is a vast improvement over its predecessor, though some soldiers complain of the light source bleeding into the visible spectrum and thus giving away their position."
 NEE_infantry_weapons2: "Carbine, Machine, Thompson Mk I"
 NEE_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The British Army became vaguely interested in the American submachine guns in around 1925 when Auto-Ordnance attempted to secure a licensing deal with Birmingham Small Arms. The British Revolution sabotaged the deal, but interest was picked back up by the Canadian Army, which secured the licensing of the M1926 to produce at home, albeit in small numbers until the outbreak of civil war in the United States. As part of New England's ties to the Entente, the classic American submachine gun was among some of the weapons sent to the new Provisional Government."
  #Reising Model 50
 NEE_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "M50 Reising"
 NEE_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Manufactured by Harrington & Richardson Arms Company in Worcester, Massachusetts, John Reising was an assistant to esteemed firearm inventor John M. Browning. As the Civil War raged across America, Reising turned his attention towards developing a submachine gun. A rival to the 1928A1, the M50 is considerably cheaper to produce and features a closed bolt system that gives it more accuracy in semi-automatic fire."
  #M25
 NEE_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "M25"
 NEE_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "Following the successful adoption of the M1E2 Auto-Carbine, the US Army began searching for a new lightweight rifle to replace the M1 Garand. Developed by Harvey Earle, the M-25 features a reworked gas system along with component parts designed to be fabricated with general tools and machines. The rifle also fires 0.30 ammunition and is incredibly light, a mere 7 pounds. Initial testings have been favorable with many praising the M-25's accuracy over the M1 Garand's."

 NFA_infantry_equipment_0: "Fusil Lebel Modèle 1886 modifié 93"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Lebel Mle M93"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mle 1886 Lebel rifle is the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition. This propellant powder, made of stabilised nitrocellulose, is called "Poudre B" ("Powder B") and was invented in 1884 by Paul Vieille. In 1893, an improved version of the M1886 Lebel was designated "Fusil Mle 1886 Modifié 93" and was one of the main rifles of the French Army in the Weltkrieg. The Lebel rifle is quite accurate up to 300 yards and still deadly at three times that distance, but has its flaws, such as slow-to-reload tube magazine and lack of a wooden handguard on top of the barrel."
 #Bethrier M34:
 NFA_infantry_equipment_1: "Fusil Berthier Modèle 1915 modifié 32"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Berthier Mle M32"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the Weltkrieg, the French military recognised the need to replace the 8mm Lebel cartridge, which is poorly suited to large-capacity rifle magazines and to automatic weapons. After the replacement of the cartridge by the Commune, a modern 7.5mm Mle 1931 rimless cartridge was finally introduced - mostly copying the Communard 7.5mm Mle 1929 cartridge. The Berthier rifle, which quickly became the main rifle of the French army after its retreat to Algeria, was modified in 1932 to use Mauser type magazines and another new cartridge."
 NFA_infantry_equipment_2: "Carabine-Mitrailleuses Hotchkiss Type M2"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Hotchkiss Mle CMH2"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "The CMH2 is an ambitiously-engineered and well-built submachine gun submitted by Hotchkiss in 1938 as the Type 017, which entered service as the Carabine-Mitrailleuses Hotchkiss Type M2 (along with its police variant Type M1). The CMH2’s extreme compactness is both its best and worst feature - the complexity of having every protruding part fold or retract make the weapon expensive to produce and also reduces ergonomics, which isn't ideal for quick target acquisition."
 #MAS 55 combined with MAT-49 police variant:
 NFA_infantry_equipment_3: "Fusil MAT Modèle 43"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_3_short: "MAT Mle 43"
 NFA_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Fusil MAT Modèle 43 is an automatic rifle, using a 7.5x54mm cartridge and a foldable magazine, which allows it to be a little more compact than its regular counterparts. Along with this, the MAT-43 is produced by machine-stamping process which allows the economical production of large numbers of rifles, then urgently required by the French Government. Despite some issues with rate of fire and reliability, the MAT-43 is considered as the next step in personal weapons."
 NFA_support_weapons: "Mitrailleuse Darne Mle 1919 & Mortier Stokes"
 NFA_support_weapons_short: "Darne Mle 1919 & Mortier Stokes"
 NFA_support_weapons_desc: "The Darne Mle 1919 is a light machine gun of French origin. It is gas operated, firing from open bolt in fully automatic only (at an incredible rate of 1100 rounds per minute). The Darne machine gun has an unusual belt feed between the gas piston and barrel, using the two-stage cartridge feed system (cartridge withdrawn from the belt to the rear, and then pushed forward into the barrel). It is chambered in French 7.5mm Mle 1931. The Stokes mortar is a Weltkrieg-era mortar known for its reliability and rate of fire."
 NFA_support_weapons2: "Mitrailleuse Hotchkiss Mle 1926 & Mortier Brandt Mle 27/31"
 NFA_support_weapons2_desc: "The Hotchkiss Mle 1926 served as a replacement for the Darne Mle 1919. While the Hotchkiss's rate of fire was significantly lower than the Darne, its stability and ease of production makes it a more preferred light machine gun. The Brandt mortar is the first in the family of mortars by Edgar Brandt. A simple and effective weapon that has a metal tube to reduce recoil, the Brandt Mortar is able to dish out nearly 18 rounds a minute."
 NFA_support_weapons2_short: "Hotchkiss Mle 1926 & Brandt Mle 27/31"

 NFA_support_weapons3_short: "Hotchkiss Mle 26/37 & Brandt Mle 35/38"
 NFA_support_weapons3_desc: "The 1937 version of the Hotchkiss machine gun features an increased rate of fire as its predecessor while maintaining the gun's low recoil. The Brandt Mle 35/38 also features improvements to the mortar system to reduce the mortar's recoil and improve its accuracy."
 NFA_support_weapons4: "Mitrailleuse Hotchkiss Mle 26/41 & Mortier Brandt Mle 1942"
 NFA_support_weapons4_short: "Hotchkiss Mle 26/41 & Brandt Mle 42"
 NFA_support_weapons4_desc: "The 41 version of the Hotchkiss features a telescopic sight and a slight increase in rate of fire, allowing the gun to be effective in close quarters while maintaining accuracy. The 1942 version of the Brandt mortar has a slight improvement in its rate of fire making it an effective close range support weapon."
 NFA_infantry_weapons2: "BSA M1926 'Thompson Submachine Gun'"
 NFA_infantry_weapons2_desc: "As part of National France's cooperation with the Entente, the French forces have adopted the BSA M1926. The BSA M1926 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines. The gun has been well received and praised by the French infantry who value its incredible stopping power."
 NFA_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 NFA_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "The Lanchester is a submachine gun of Canadian origin, a near carbon copy based on the German MP28. As part of Anglo-French cooperation, number of the Lanchester were sent to National French forces in Africa and loyalist cells on the mainland."
 NFA_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "De Lisle Carbine"
 NFA_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "This weapon has achieved popularity amongst those in the special forces. The weapon is a Frankenstein of a weapon, as it combines features from both the SMLE and the MI1928AI. Fitted with an internal suppressor, the gun is extremely quiet which makes it perfect for partisan action or assassination."

#Motorised

 NFA_motorized_equipment_1: "Laffly S-20 Tracteur, Chassis Long"
 NFA_motorized_equipment_1_short: "S-20TL"
 NFA_motorized_equipment_1_desc: "In 1934, the French army ordered S-35C trucks from Laffly - a cumbersome six-wheel drive vehicle, unpopular with crews. The new Laffly S-20TL, proposed (and adopted) a year later, is generally superior to the previous S-35C, has a better power-to-weight ratio, and offers ample storage boxes in which passengers can store equipment. The truck is recognised as more innovative compared to its Communard analogue, due to only one body type being needed to transport different types of platoons, which allows the C-20TL to be mass-produced in large quantities, even in colonies."
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_1: "Citroën Tracteur Semi-Chenille P-107"
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_1_short: "P-107"
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "After the Weltkrieg, Citroën developed a long line of half-tracks based on the Kégresse patent. In 1937, the company introduced its newer and more powerful P-107 model as a successor to the Citroën-Kégresse P-17. The P-107 has two main variants: a light prime mover for artillery guns, and a platform cargo transport for units. Many commanders use them in various standard and non-standard roles, which makes the P-107 a versatile truck."

 NFA_mechanized_equipment_2: "Berliet Tracteur Chenillé Modèle 39"
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_2_short: "TC-39"
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_2_desc: "The Tracteur Chenillé Modèle 39, developed by Berliet in 1938 and adopted in 1941 after numerous modifications, is a tracked carrier with a total capacity of ten people: 1 driver and 9 passengers. Unlike the 1938 model, which was equipped with a trailer for transporting main part of troops, the final variant has extended cargo hold with high box-like armoured superstructures with doors at their back, protecting the platoon on the way to the battlefield. Despite rumours that the TC-39 was largely inspired by the designs of Commune (or even a direct copy), it was adopted by the French army."
 #Renault DAJ-1:
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_3: "Véhicule de Transport de Troupes Blindé - Renault"
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_3_short: "VTTB-R"
 NFA_mechanized_equipment_3_desc: "The Véhicule de Transport de Troupes Blindé - Renault is a closed tracked carrier vehicle developed in 1941, when the Army had doubts that Berliet would be able to meet army specifications for its TC-39. Originally introduced in 1942, the VTTB-R was rejected due to its low capacity and was only accepted into service after increasing the total capacity to 11 people, including the driver. Considered by many specialists to be the one of most modern personnel carriers, the VTTB-R is quite expensive to manufacture."

 NFA_amphibious_mechanized_equipment_1_short: "C-40"
 NFA_amphibious_mechanized_equipment_1_desc: "The Schneider-Citroën C-40 was first introduced as an amphibious armoured car in 1933, but was rejected by the French government in favour of the AM-80. The project was abandoned until 1939, when the French army requested an amphibious vehicle. Updated as an amphibious transport with a capacity of 10 people, the S-40 was introduced in 1941 and adopted, despite worse characteristics than the Communard counterpart."
 #Very Modified SCHNEIDER-LAURENT:
 NFA_amphibious_mechanized_equipment_2: "Schneider-Citroën Tracteur Chenillé Amphibie Modèle 1943"
 NFA_amphibious_mechanized_equipment_2_short: "TCA-43"
 NFA_amphibious_mechanized_equipment_2_desc: "The TCA-43 is an improved version of the C-40. After initial feedback on the use of the C-40 in the field, the wheels were replaced with tracks, and the cargo bay was expanded along with installation of several mounts for machine guns."

#Armoured Car
 NFA_gw_armored_car_equipment: "Laffly Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1917/80"
 NFA_gw_armored_car_equipment_short: "AM-80"
 NFA_gw_armored_car_equipment_desc: "The Laffly Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1917/80 is a car based on the White-Laffly 1917 heavy armoured car, but updated in 1934 with a new bodywork and engine. Manufactured by Laffly factory in Algeria, the vehicle can climb a 40° slope, and cruise at about 80 km/h on the North African roads, quickly making the AM-80 the main vehicle of the French army, despite the fact that the model is considered outdated."
 #Panhard AM 40 P - constructor of this tech probably in NFA:
 NFA_armored_car_equipment_1: "Citroën Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1940"
 NFA_armored_car_equipment_1_short: "AM-40"
 NFA_armored_car_equipment_1_desc: "The Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1940, designed by Louis Delyagard to the 1938 specifications of the French army, is a very innovative low profile armoured car with 8-wheel drive and monocoque 2-man body. The process of development of the AM-40 was accompanied by constant design modifications, but with a change in the geopolitical situation, despite the demands of the military to equip the car with a 47-mm cannon, the version with a 20-mm cannon was adopted in 1940."
 #Combined CDM Armoured Car and Panhard AML (body from AML and tower from CDM):
 NFA_armored_car_equipment_2: "Citroën Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1942"
 NFA_armored_car_equipment_2_short: "AM-42"
 NFA_armored_car_equipment_2_desc: "After evaluating the use of the heavy and complex AM-40, the General Staff stated that it needed a lighter and even faster reconnaissance vehicle to patrol colonial areas and perform many other tasks available for cheaper vehicles. Citroën engineers, after a detailed study of Canadian armoured cars, developed the Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1942 to meet the requirements of the army. The new AM-42, a lightweight 4-wheeled vehicle armed with a 20mm cannon, was warmly received by French soldiers."
 #Combined Panhard AM 40 P and Panhard AML, also 47mm gun (body from AML and tower from Panhard):
 NFA_armored_car_at_equipment: "Citroën Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1942 Canon de 47mm"
 NFA_armored_car_at_equipment_short: "AM-42-C47"
 NFA_armored_car_at_equipment_desc: "The Auto-Mitrailleuse Modèle 1942 Canon de 47mm is a combined product of Louis Delyagard and other Citroën engineers who installed a 47mm cannon on the AM-40 tower. Like the replacement of the AM-40 in service with the AM-42, the new tower was also mounted on its hull, which made the AM-42 a tank hunter in accordance with the original requirements of the army for the AM-40."

###Artillery
 NFA_artillery_equipment_1: "Matériel de 75mm Modèle 1897"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_1_short: "Matériel de 75mm"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The Matériel de 75mm Mle 1897, also known as the French 75 or 'Soixante-Quinze' ('seventy-five'), is widely regarded as the first modern artillery piece. In service since 1898, the Soixante-Quinze was heavily used in the Weltkrieg, where it was used as an anti-personnel, anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapon. After the retreat to Algeria, the French army continued to use these weapons, mainly because they still mostly meet modern criteria."
 #Canon de 105 court mle 1934 Schneider:
 NFA_artillery_equipment_2: "Matériel de 105mm Court Modèle 1935 Schneider"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_2_short: "Matériel de 105mm C S"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Matériel de 105mm Court Mle 1935 is a conservative design by Schneider. Developed to replace Soixante-Quinze in service, the Matériel de 105mm is more a howitzer than a cannon, and is primarily intended to destroy enemy fortifications."
 NFA_artillery_equipment_3: "Canon de 155mm Grande Puissance Filloux Modèle 1917/1942"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_3_short: "Canon de 155mm GPF"
 NFA_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "The Canon de 155mm Grande Puissance Filloux Modèle 1917, also known as the GPF, was developed during the Weltkrieg by Colonel Louis Filloux to meet the urgent need for modern heavy artillery, and is used by both the Communard and the National governments. Due to problems with the production of GPFs in the colonies by the French government, only a limited numbers were in service until 1942, when the GPF design was updated to facilitate production and meet modern standards."

 #25mm SA 34:
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Matériel de 25mm Semi-Automatique Modèle 1934"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "Matériel de 25mm SA"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "By the early 1920s, the French Army had come to the realisation that the armour-piercing capability of the 37mm TRP infantry gun would be insufficient against modern tanks. In 1926 Hotchkiss proposed a 25mm gun design, which was not immediately adopted due to financial issues, and the availability of the Matériel de 75mm. The Matériel de 25mm, which entered service only in 1936 with the realisation of the approaching battle for France, is a reliable weapon inspired by the Filloux concept."
 #Modified Matériel de 75mm Modèle 1897:
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Matériel Antichar de 75mm Modèle 1897/1937"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "Matériel de 75mm AC"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "With the adoption of the Matériel de 105mm, the old Matériel de 75mm were mainly redesigned into anti-tank guns with an updated chassis. Considered too heavy for modern anti-tank guns, the Soixante-Quinze have higher penetration than their counterparts."
 #Very modified Matériel de 75mm:
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Matériel Antichar de 75mm Semi-Automatique Modèle 1943"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "Matériel de 75mm AC SA"
 NFA_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The Matériel de 75mm SA is a new semi-automatic gun based on the 75mm Matériel de 75mm AC cannon. With a higher rate of fire, the Matériel de 75mm CA SA is still a slightly outdated weapon, but can compete with its modern counterparts, thanks to a modernised mechanism and a new approach to the chassis design."

 #Hotchkiss 25mm:
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_1: "Mitrailleuse de 25mm Contre-Aéroplanes Modèle 1936"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "Mitrailleuse 25mm CA"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "After the retreat to Algeria, the French military announced the need for a specialised anti-aircraft autocannon. Hotchkiss introduced the 25 mm project in 1936, which was adopted due to the slow development of a more promising Schneider variant. Despite the acceptance of the Mitrailleuse 25mm CA into service, the original tripod was replaced to a triangular base with a two-wheel carriage as per the army’s request."
 #Schneider 37 mm:
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_2: "Mitrailleuse de 37 mm Contre-Aérien Modèle 1939"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "Mitrailleuse 37mm CA"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "Developed since 1930, the Mitrailleuse 37mm CA was finally ready for production in 1939. After a bitter controversy with the French military, who had already adopted the Hotchkiss variant, the Mitrailleuse 37mm CA from Schneider was adopted after initial testing as a more advanced variant than the Hotchkiss's 25mm gun."

 NFA_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "Matériel de 75mm CA"
 NFA_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "During the late 1920s, it was realised that the Matériel de 75mm Modèle 1897 was outdated as an anti-aircraft weapon and development of a new gun was begun in 1931. The Matériel de 75mm Contre-Aérien Modèle 1940 by Schneider has faster rate of fire, higher muzzle velocity, increased vertical range, modern fire control and greater mobility with new gun carriages, than the old Soixante-Quinze. Impressed by the performance of the former Mitrailleuse 37mm CA from Schneider, the French command quickly adopted the new 75mm gun."

 NFL_infantry_equipment_0_short: "SMLE Mk III"
 NFL_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 NFL_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 NFL_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 NFL_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 NFL_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 NFL_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 NFL_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

 NFL_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 NFL_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""

 NFL_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark.""
 NFL_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 NFL_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 NFL_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 NFL_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 NFL_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 NFL_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 NFL_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 NFL_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 NFL_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 NFL_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."

 NFL_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 NFL_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 NFL_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 NFL_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 NFL_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

Initially developed in 1932 as 6 wheels variants, it was obvious that this variant will be obsolete in the nearest future. In 1937 the 8 wheels variant armed with 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon was introduced in service.

This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

 NGF_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."

 NGF_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 NGF_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 NGF_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 NGF_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 NGF_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 NGF_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 NGF_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

 NGF_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

 NIC_infantry_equipment_0: "Springfield Krag–Jørgensen Modelo 1898"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Springfield M1898"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Krag–Jørgensen rifle was adopted by the United States in 1892 to replace the ageing Springfield Model 1884. While the Krags proved superior at close ranges to comparable Mauser designs in the Spanish-American war, the rifle's flimsy action in comparison to newer bolt designs necessitated a replacement a mere decade after its adoption. During the American occupations of several Central American nations in the early 20th century, many stockpiled Krag rifles, mostly of the 1898 rifle pattern, were given to local forces along with droves of surplus ammunition."
 NIC_infantry_equipment_1: "Carabina del Pueblo Modelo 1934"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Carabina M1934"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "With the socialist revolution, Nicaragua found itself with a rapidly ageing stock of surplus American Krags and little ammunition to supply its meagre arsenal. To alleviate these problems, in 1934, it began an ambitious effort to retrofit and convert its Krag rifles to carbines chambered in 7.5×54mm French, which had successfully been smuggled into the country in large quantities."
 NIC_infantry_equipment_2: "Metralleta Modelo 1935"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Metralleta M1935"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "While Nicaragua had yet to formally adopt a submachine prior to the socialist revolution, many Model 1921 Thompsons had entered the country along with the capability of domestic manufacturers to produce .45 ACP ammunition. The Metralleta Model 1935 is a Nicaraguan modified Thompson 1921 with several upgrades and a simplified manufacturing process."
 NIC_infantry_equipment_3: "MAS Modèle 1940/42"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_3_short: "MAS-40/42"
 NIC_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The MAS-40/42 is the latest in a series of Communard semi-automatic rifles. Unlike its predecessors, however, the MAS-40/42 was found to be exceptionally reliable in French military testing. The original five round internal magazine, however, was deemed insufficient and a new variant of the MAS-40/42, the 40/42, was developed featuring a detachable ten round box magazine. A small number of MAS-40/42 rifles were smuggled into Nicaragua along with production tooling specifications."

 NZL_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk III"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_0_short: "SMLE Mk III"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 NZL_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 NZL_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""
 NZL_night_vision: "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 NZL_night_vision_short: "Tabby Scope"
 NZL_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark.""
 NZL_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 NZL_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 NZL_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 NZL_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 NZL_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 NZL_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 NZL_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 NZL_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 NZL_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 NZL_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 NZL_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 NZL_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 NZL_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 NZL_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 NZL_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 NZL_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

The rifle was gradually adopted along with the .30-06 cartridge both before and while the rest of the world waged the Weltkrieg.

Built to haul heavy trains on the mountainous lines of the Northern Appennine, while keeping a comparatively low axle load of 14 tons to run on older, less frequently mantained tracks, these engines excelled in their task, and were subsequently built in copious number before the Great War. Distributed across the Peninsula to relieve the older pre-nationalisation engines, a good number of those engines ended up in service around Rome, and subsequently remained in our hands."

Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."

The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."

 PIR_support_weapons: "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 PIR_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 PIR_support_weapons_1: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 PIR_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 PIR_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"

The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstalces and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 PIR_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 PIR_support_weapons_3_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production.

 PIR_artillery_equipment_1: "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 PIR_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 PIR_artillery_equipment_2: "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 PIR_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 PIR_artillery_equipment_3: "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 PIR_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Paulista army until the 1960s."

 PIR_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 PIR_anti_air_equipment_2: "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 PIR_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 PIR_anti_air_equipment_3: "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 PIR_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 PIR_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 PIR_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 PIR_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 PIR_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 PIR_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 PIR_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 POR_infantry_equipment_0: "Espingarda 6,5 mm m/1904"
 POR_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mauser-Vergueiro"
 POR_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "A bolt action rifle with a long history of service, the 6,5 mm m/1904 is more commonly known by the moniker of 'Mauser-Vergueiro', as the main design of the gun is essentially that of the Mauser 98 (with a special bolt action mechanism heavily based on the Gewehr 1888) with the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro cartridge, one developed specifically for the portuguese variant. It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."
 POR_infantry_equipment_1: "Espingarda 7.92 mm m/1904/36 "
 POR_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser-Vergueiro M36"
 POR_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Fundamentally little more than an updated version of the Mauser-Vergueiro to work with different sets of ammunition, it was introduced to Africa amid rising tensions between Portugal and Germany, and it became associated with Portugal's heavy handed reprisals in those areas. Its usage in Europe, while less famous, was far more widespread, but it was utterly supplanted by the FBP on later years."
 POR_infantry_equipment_2: "Carabina C.A.P Modelo 01"
 POR_infantry_equipment_2_short: "C.A.P M40"
 POR_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "A prototype carbine that saw little widespread use in Portugal's army as a whole was the country's first attempt at a standard issue, nationally produced design. As such, the nationalist Integralist junta supported the development of the C.A.P carbine intensely, but by the time it was ready for production, realities on the ground made it more worthwhile to switch to the FBP overall directly from the older Mauser-Vergueiro and variants already widely in use by the armed forces."
 POR_infantry_equipment_3: "Pistola-Metralhadora FBP M/945"
 POR_infantry_equipment_3_short: "FBP M/945"
 POR_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The FBP submachine gun is named after the acronym for the Braço de Prata Factory, the manufacturer for the weapon, a foundry owned and controlled by the Portuguese government itself. While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg."
 POR_support_weapons: "Metralhadora Vickers & Morteiro Stokes"
 POR_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the British Empire during the Weltkrieg. During its rearmament after the conflict, the restored Portuguese monarchy purchased and fabricated them with the intention of widespread use among infantry both at home and overseas."
 POR_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora Lewis Modelo DEMS & Morteiro SBML de 2 Polegadas"
 POR_support_weapons_2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis served the Entente since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. The MKIII variant had a pistol grip that allowed it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML, while small, is incredibly portable and had greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 POR_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Vickers Modelo II & Morteiro ML de 3 Polegadas"
 POR_support_weapons_3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG featured a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It had been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar was a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it was reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 POR_support_weapons4: "Metralhadora Vickers-Vedras & Morteiro de 4.2 Polegadas"
 POR_support_weapons_4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar was a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."
 POR_infantry_at: "Morteiro-Bombarda"
 POR_infantry_at_desc: "Developed in Canada and sold in substantial amounts to Portugal, the mortar design was that of a 'spigot' mortar. Arguing that the design could serve as both an artillery piece and an anti-tank weapon, the design was eagerly adopted by several allies of the Entente, including Portugal."
 POR_infantry_at2: "LATI"
 POR_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the LATI (A direct translation of its Canadian English name) was developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device was well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there were concerns about its intense recoil."

 RJM_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Veracruz state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."
 RJM_infantry_equipment_1: "Fusil Mauser Modelo 1935"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser M35"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilises a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the German model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."

 RJM_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Bergmann M38"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 RJM_infantry_equipment_3: "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest German semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."

 RJM_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 RJM_support_weapons_1: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 RJM_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."

 RJM_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."

The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant.

While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 RJM_rocket_artillery_equipment_1: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 32cm"
 RJM_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Following the specifications of the original models, rockets of 32cm were used in these weapons, and a lack of said rockets is exactly why they were seldom used."
 RJM_rocket_artillery_equipment_2: "Bateria Lança Foguetes de 21cm"
 RJM_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Changes to the size of the rockets required for usage made later models more common, but still far from standard issue and few pieces of the LF de 21cm were used in the field when compared to even the M43."

 SAF_infantry_equipment_0: "Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield Mk III"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_0_short: "SMLE Mk III"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1: "SMLE Mk V"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1_short: "SMLE Mk V"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."
 SAF_infantry_equipment_2: "Owen Mk 1"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Owen Machine Carbine"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterizes the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."
 SAF_infantry_equipment_3: "Long Branch Mk 1"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_3_short: "SLR Mk 1"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""
 SAF_night_vision: "Receivers, Tabby, Periscope Mk 1"
 SAF_night_vision_short: "Tabby Scope"
 SAF_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark.""
 SAF_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 SAF_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 SAF_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 SAF_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 SAF_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 SAF_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 SAF_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 SAF_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 SAF_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 SAF_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 SAF_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 SAF_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 SAF_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 SAF_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 SAF_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 SAF_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 SAF_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 SAF_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 SAF_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

 SHX_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Originally called the 'Xuantong Type 27', this rifle was put into Qing service in 1935 through German assistance after the Restoration. The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nFirst produced at the Hanyang arsenal with German tools, manufacturing methods have already spread to Taiyuan, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."

Unfortunately, due to Shanxi's narrow roads and mountainous terrain, and the technical blockade imposed by the Qing government on Shanxi, it was difficult for Yan Xishan to buy trucks directly from the Japanese. Therefore, in March 1932, he ordered the engineer Jiang Shouting to go to Tianjin to negotiate with the representatives from the American Federal Motor Truck Company. The Americans eventually agreed to transfer the 1.5 ton truck technology to Shanxi, and Jiang Shouting used this as a basis to create the reliable and durable Type Shanxi by the end of the same year."

 SIC_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. As part of Sicilian-German cooperation in response to the red threat of the north, large quantities of the 98b were shipped to Sicily."

The Two Sicilies tested the rifle and like the Austrians, found the rifle unreliable in harsh conditions and difficult to disassemble, but sought to redesign the gun to fix its shortcomings. The SME state run electrical company, which had begun to produce and design small arms only a few years prior, was set to the task. The end result, designated the SME M38 upon adoption, while improved over its Czech predecessor, still bears many of the latter's design quirks."

While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the German Heer eventually dropped some of its other specific requirements for the rifle. The end result was the initial prototype with only a few design edits, and it proved effective. As a response to growing tensions on the Italian peninsula, large numbers of these rifles were sent to the Sicilian Armed Forces."

Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end.

 SOM_infantry_equipment_0: "Karcan Nooc 1891"
 SOM_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Carcano M91"
 SOM_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Somalia's armed forces in the early 1930s had a variety of non standarized rifle models, but by far the most common, especially in Mogadishu and in the forces of the Hobyo was the Carcano rifle. Designed by Salvatore Carcano at the Turin Army Arsenal in 1891, the carbine fires 6.5 x 52mm Carcano cartridges. The magazine system uses en bloc charger clips which were originally developed by Ferdinand Mannlicher - hence why the gun is often referred to as the 'Mannlicher-Carcano', but in Somalia its also known as simply the 'Karcan', and large amounts of the gun were in use by native Askari and colonial troops alike during their disorganized withdrawl at the tail end of the Weltkrieg, wherein much material was left behind."
 SOM_infantry_equipment_1: "Kirkale Nooc 55"
 SOM_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Kirkale Q55"
 SOM_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The initial standardisation and modernisation efforts for the military in Somalia were based greatly on the Ottoman Empire, as the two nations enjoyed quite amicable relations in the 1930s. Starting in 1933, the Ottoman Empire updated their old rifles to a common configuration known in the Empire as the Model of 1936 and all in 8x57 Mauser cartridge. Many of these weapons were sold to Somalia, as the state had a difficult time establishing a local manufacturing plant for weapons. As the years went by, Somalia copied the 55 model (Named after its model Hegira Year) and made a respectable amount of domestic versions, usually quite inferior to Turkish and German equivalents."
 SOM_infantry_equipment_2: "Rayfal Soomaali Nooc 61"
 SOM_infantry_equipment_2_short: "RSN1.61"
 SOM_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "As the Ottoman strategic concerns turned towards arming their own Empire, Somalia found itself somewhat lacking in willing trade partners in the Middle East, and really Europe as a whole, in terms of weapons trade. The Model 61 was for all intents an unauthorized liscenced copy of the Kirikkale T60 which saw limited usage, but retains symbolic importance as the first firearms made and designed within the modern Somali nation."
 SOM_infantry_equipment_3: "Rayfal Soomaali Nooc 65"
 SOM_infantry_equipment_3_short: "RSN2.65"
 SOM_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Model 65 saw extended use in the post-war era in Somalia, too few of the model were deployed to be truly relevant in the wars the nation found itself during said timeframe. It's semi automatic design was very obviously inspired by German weaponry, but in its finer details it's closer to Turkish models of the same timeframe, as the Red Sea was flooded with Ottoman war material after the Levantine War.

 SPO_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The São Paulo state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."

 SPO_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser M35"
 SPO_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilizes a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."

 SPO_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Bergmann M38"
 SPO_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 SPO_infantry_equipment_3: "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 SPO_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest german semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."
 SPO_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Rossi M44"
 SPO_support_weapons: "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 SPO_support_weapons_desc: "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 SPO_support_weapons_1: "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 SPO_support_weapons_1_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 SPO_support_weapons2: "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 SPO_support_weapons_2_desc: "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstalces and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 SPO_support_weapons3: "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 SPO_support_weapons_3_desc: "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."

When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."

Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."

 SPO_artillery_equipment_1: "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 SPO_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 SPO_artillery_equipment_2: "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 SPO_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 SPO_artillery_equipment_3: "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 SPO_artillery_equipment_3_desc: "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Gaucho army until the 1960s."

 SPO_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 SPO_anti_air_equipment_2: "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 SPO_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 SPO_anti_air_equipment_3: "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 SPO_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had avaliable, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_2: "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Fermany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_3: "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 SPO_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

Often mistakenly called the Mannlicher-Carcano, the rifle's magazine uses en bloc charger clips initially from Ferdinand Mannlicher, but the actual shape and design of the Carcano clip come from the German Model 1888. As the royal family fled from the peninsula to Sardinia in haste, these rifles will have to do to defend Sardinia from godless revolutionaries."

 SRD_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Fucile Enfield"
 SRD_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "As Sardinia lacks heavy military industry, it relies on weapons from the other Entente powers. The Enfield-Ontario (designed by the Canadian Army) is a gas-operated semi-automatic conversion of the classic SMLE rifle. Even if Sardinia cannot produce her arms, the Entente is more than happy to help."

 SRD_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Carabina Hotchkiss"
 SRD_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "A weapon of National French origin, large quantities of the Carabina automatica Hotchkiss were shipped to Sardinia. The Carabina is an ambitiously-engineered and well-built submachine gun submitted by Hotchkiss in 1938 as the Type 017, which entered service as the Carabine-Mitrailleuses Hotchkiss Type M2 (along with its police variant Type M1). The CMH2’s extreme compactness is both its best and worst feature - the complexity of having every protruding part fold or retract make the weapon expensive to produce and also reduces ergonomics, which isn't ideal for quick target acquisition."
 SRD_infantry_equipment_3: "Fucile Automatico MAS Modello 1943"
 SRD_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Fucile Automatico M1943"
 SRD_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "Like most of Sardinia's arsenal, the Fucile Automatico MAS modello 1943 is a French weapon. The Fusil MAT Modèle 43 is an automatic rifle, using a 7.5x54mm cartridge and a foldable magazine, which allows it to be a little more compact than its regular counterparts. Along with this, the MAT-43 is produced by machine-stamping process which allows the economical production of large numbers of rifles, then urgently required by the Sardinian Government. Despite some issues with rate of fire and reliability, the MAS-43 is considered as the next step in personal weapons."
 SRD_support_weapons: "Darne M1919 & Stokes mortar"
 SRD_support_weapons_desc: "The Darne M1919 is a machine gun of French origin. The weapon's appearance is crude and the belt fed monster of a machine gun was designed for rapid manufacturing technologies due to the exile of National France. The Stokes mortar is a Weltkrieg era British smoothbore trench mortar that allows for higher angles of fire."

 SRD_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The Matériel de 75mm Mle 1897, also known as the French 75 or 'Soixante-Quinze' ('seventy-five'), is widely regarded as the first modern artillery piece. In service since 1898, the Soixante-Quinze was heavily used in the Weltkrieg, where it was used as an anti-personnel, anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapon. After the retreat to Algeria, the French army continued to use these weapons, mainly because they still mostly meet modern criteria."

 SRD_anti_tank_equipment_1: "Cannone da 25mm Semiautomatico Modello 1934"
 SRD_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "Cannone da 25mm SA"
 SRD_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "By the early 1920s, the French Army had come to the realisation that the armour-piercing capability of the 37mm TRP infantry gun would be insufficient against modern tanks. In 1926 Hotchkiss proposed a 25mm gun design, which was not immediately adopted due to financial issues, and the availability of the Matériel de 75mm. The Matériel de 25mm, which entered service only in 1936 with the realisation of the approaching battle for France, is a reliable weapon inspired by the Filloux concept."

 SRD_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "Cannone-Mitragliera da 25mm CA"
 SRD_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "After the retreat to Algeria, the French military announced the need for a specialised anti-aircraft autocannon. Hotchkiss introduced the 25 mm project in 1936, which was adopted due to the slow development of a more promising Schneider variant. Despite the acceptance of the Mitrailleuse 25mm CA into service, the original tripod was replaced to a triangular base with a two-wheel carriage as per the army’s request."

 SRD_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "Developed since 1930, the Mitrailleuse 37mm CA was finally ready for production in 1939. After a bitter controversy with the French military, who had already adopted the Hotchkiss variant, the Mitrailleuse 37mm CA from Schneider was adopted after initial testing as a more advanced variant than the Hotchkiss's 25mm gun."

 SRD_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "Cannone da 75mm CA"
 SRD_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "During the late 1920s, it was realised that the Matériel de 75mm Modèle 1897 was outdated as an anti-aircraft weapon and development of a new gun was begun in 1931. The Matériel de 75mm Contre-Aérien Modèle 1940 by Schneider has faster rate of fire, higher muzzle velocity, increased vertical range, modern fire control and greater mobility with new gun carriages, than the old Soixante-Quinze. Impressed by the performance of the former Mitrailleuse 37mm CA from Schneider, the French command quickly adopted the new 75mm gun."

Built to haul heavy trains on the mountainous lines of the Northern Appennine, while keeping a comparatively low axle load of 14 tons to run on older, less frequently mantained tracks, these engines excelled in their task, and were subsequently built in copious number before the Great War. Distributed across the Peninsula to relieve the older pre-nationalisation engines, a good number of those engines ended up hauling trains on the Sardinian Dorsal Railway, and subsequently remained in our hands."

In order to deflect or stop small arms fire, the sloped hull was 20 mm thick at the front glacis and 12 mm thick at the sides and rear. The main cab counted one driver armoured hinged panel and a side vision slit, while the commander position received a three-faced casemate housing an air-cooled cal.30 (7.62 mm) Browning machine gun or a liquid-cooled .303 (7.7 mm) Vickers and a rear hatch."

 SVK_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Karabina vzor 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."

 SVK_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

 TIB_infantry_equipment_0_short: "No.1 Mk III"
 TIB_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "With the collapse of the British Raj, the steady trickle of British rifles and ammunition into the country became a deluge and in the span of a year, Tibetan small arms advanced perhaps over fifty years. Further, the influx of German ammunition into Tibet following the German intervention in China led to Tibet converting its SMLE rifles to 7.65×53mm Mauser. The equipment shortages and personal preference often see it used alongside non-standard weapons such as the Dpa'dam."
 TIB_infantry_equipment_1: "Mauser Model 1898"
 TIB_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Mauser 1898"
 TIB_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "In response to several commercially successful short rifles produced on the basis of the Mauser 1898 by competing arms manufacturers, the Mauser company developed its owned moderately shortened 1898 rifle. Two related patterns of this design were given the designation 'standard modell' by Mauser. Many small nations, including Tibet purchased these new guns in large quantities; the Tibetan variant is the older of the two and is chambered in 7.65×53mm Mauser.\nSoon after receiving the rifles, the Tibetan government converted several rifles to carbines, cannibalising older British rifles for material."

 TRI_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming.""

 TRI_night_vision_short: "Tabby Scope"
 TRI_night_vision_desc: "The Tabby Scope is one of the Canadian government's most closesly guarded secrets; the process of development is even hidden from the fellow members of the Entente. A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark.""
 TRI_infantry_weapons2: "BSA Thompson M1926"
 TRI_infantry_weapons2_desc: "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 TRI_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 TRI_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 TRI_advanced_infantry_weapons2: "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 TRI_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc: "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."
 TRI_infantry_at: "Grenade, Rifle, Anti-Tank, Mk I"
 TRI_infantry_at_desc: "Witnessing a demonstration of Henry Mohaupt's anti-tank rifle grenade in Switzerland, a Canadian commission, guessing that the weapon used the shaped charge principle, began work on their own design. The resulting high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rifle grenade is hoped to provide greater capabilities for the infantry to fight enemy armour using the cup launchers already in service."
 TRI_infantry_at2: "Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I "
 TRI_infantry_at2_desc: "With the need for a hand-held anti tank weapon for use on the frontlines, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank Mk I (PIAT) has been developed based on the design of the bombard mortar. With an effective range of 105 metres in direct fire mode, the device has been well liked due to its lack of backblast - however there has been concerns about its intense recoil."
 TRI_infantry_at2_short: "PIAT"
 TRI_support_weapons: "Vickers MG & Stokes mortar"
 TRI_support_weapons_desc: "The water cooled Vickers MG and the Stokes trench mortar were the standard support arms of the Canadian Army during the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the Canadian Army has recommissioned them back into service."
 TRI_support_weapons2: "Lewis Mk III DEMS & SBML two-inch mortar"
 TRI_support_weapons2_desc: "With its iconic 'pan' magazine, the Lewis has served the Tommy since the darkest days of the Weltkrieg. With the threat of war ever so near, the MKIII variant has a pistol grip that allows it to be fired from the shoulder on any part of a ship's deck. The SBML while small, is incredibly portable and has greater firepower and range than most rifle grenades."
 TRI_support_weapons3: "Vickers M Mk II & ML 3 inch mortar"
 TRI_support_weapons3_desc: "The Mark II variant of the Vickers MG features a selective fire option and a pistol grip. It has been primarily adopted for the armoured vehicles. The ML 3 inch mortar is a considerable upgrade from the Stokes, as it is reliable and sturdy for close artillery support."
 TRI_support_weapons4: "Vickers M Mk III & ML 4.2 inch Mortar"
 TRI_support_weapons4_desc: "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors. Likewise, the 4.2 inch mortar is a heavier upgrade of previous Canadian mortar models and capable of dropping intense and effective support."

His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

 TRS_infantry_equipment_0: "Karabiner Modell 1895/30"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Mannlicher M.95/30"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Mannlicher Modell 1895/1930 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later after the war, most rifles were converted into the carbine configuration."
 TRS_infantry_equipment_1: "Karabiner Modell 1935"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_1_short: "FÉG M.35"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1935 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."
 TRS_infantry_equipment_2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 1939"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Danuvia M.39"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_2_desc: "Designed by Pál Király, this \"heavy\" submachine gun used specially-loaded 9x25mm ammunition in a folding magazine for transport and storage. This made it very potent and reliable compared to its contemporaries, making it reminiscent of later assault rifle designs."
 TRS_infantry_equipment_3: "Maschinenkarabiner Modell 1942"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_3_short: "Zbrojovka Brno M.42"
 TRS_infantry_equipment_3_desc: "As it became clear that engagement distances had significantly shortened since the Weltkrieg, the Monarchy became interested in developing an intermediate cartridge and the \"machine-carbine\" idea. The Koucký brothers at Zbrojovka Brno presented their ZK 412 design using the 8x35mm \"Rapid\" cartridge with similar performance to the German 8x33mm Kurz."
 TRS_infantry_weapons2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 1934"
 TRS_infantry_weapons2_short: "Steyr-Solothurn M.34"
 TRS_infantry_weapons2_desc: "While a German design by Louis Stange, the  MP 34 was mainly produced by Steyr and was adopted by the Austro-Hungarian Army. As common with early submachine guns, this design was heavy, expensive, but reliable, with a horizontal magazine using the potent 9x25mm Mauser cartridge."
 TRS_improved_infantry_weapons_2: "Maschinenpistole Modell 38"
 TRS_improved_infantry_weapons_2_short: "Zbrojovka Brno M.38"
 TRS_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc: "Seeing the need for a submachine-gun using the standard pistol cartridge of the Army, the Monarchy would adopt the ZK 383, designed by brothers Josef and František Koucký at Zbrojovka Brno, as the MP 38. Using a horizontal magazine like the MP 34, the ZK 383 is known for having a light bipod, allowing it to be used as a substitute squad automatic weapon. Later models were heavily simplified for cheaper and faster production, along with a vertical foldable magazine like the Danuvia SMGs."

The 43M redesign with a folding metal stock and a new, more reliable foldable magazine design allowed it to be much more compact during transport or storage, without sacrificing firepower."

 WSU_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 WSU_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 WSU_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 WSU_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 WSU_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 WSU_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 WSU_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 WSU_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 WSU_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 WSU_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 WSU_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 WSU_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 WSU_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 WSU_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 WSU_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 WSU_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 WSU_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 WSU_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 WSU_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 WSU_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 WSU_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 WSU_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 WSU_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 WSU_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

Initially developed in 1932 as 6 wheels variants, it was obvious that this variant will be obsolete in the nearest future. In 1937 the 8 wheels variant armed with 2-cm Kw.K. 30 L/55 autocannon was introduced in service. The all-wheel drive four-axle Sd.Kfz. 231 are one of the most technically advanced armoured vehicles and are able to operate on rough terrain, with a cross-country comparable to that of tanks."

 WGR_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33 is the standard artillery piece of the Deutsches Heer, adopted for service in 1933 and used by all divisions and artillery battalions. This gun was developed in 1928-29 by Rheinmetall, and was a major advance on its predecessor the 10,5-cm le.F.H. 16 - a completely new three-point split trail gun carriage provides more stability and increases the traverse to 56 degrees alongside with the sighting mechanism to make it easier to fire at moving targets."
 WGR_artillery_equipment_2: "15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze Modell 36"
 WGR_artillery_equipment_2_short: "15-cm s.F.H. 36"
 WGR_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 15-cm schwere Feldhaubitze 36, nicknamed Immergrün ('Evergreen'), is the basic division-level heavy howitzer, serving alongside the smaller but more numerous 10,5-cm le.F.H. 33. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."
 WGR_artillery_equipment_3: "17-cm Kanone Modell 40 in Mörserlafette"
 WGR_artillery_equipment_3_short: "17-cm K. 40 Mrs.Laf."
 WGR_artillery_equipment_3_Desc: "The 17-cm Kanone 40, built by Krupp and Hannoversche Maschinenbau, is heavy corps-level gun. In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

 WGR_anti_tank_equipment_1: "3,7-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 WGR_anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "3,7-cm Pa.K. 36"
 WGR_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Design of a horse-drawn, 3,7-cm anti-tank gun (designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 28) by Rheinmetall commenced in 1924. By the early 1930s, it became apparent that horse-drawn artillery is obsolete, and the gun was modified for motorised transport, allowing it to be towed at highway speeds. Nicknamed by soldiers 'Heeresanklopfgerät' ('army door-knocking device'), the re-designated 3,7-cm Pa.K. 36 is the main anti-tank weapon of Deutsches Heer and easily can manage with enemy light tanks."
 WGR_anti_tank_equipment_2: "7,5-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 40"
 WGR_anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "7,5-cm Pa.K. 40"
 WGR_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "The 7,5-cm Pa.K. 40 was developed after reports of new enemy tank designs began to reach Berlin in 1939. The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."
 WGR_anti_tank_equipment_3: "12,8-cm Panzerabwehrkanone Modell 43"
 WGR_anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "12,8-cm Pa.K. 43"
 WGR_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 43 is the new anti-tank gun developed initially as a field gun known as the Kanone 43. However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

 WGR_anti_air_equipment_1: "2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 36"
 WGR_anti_air_equipment_1_short: "2-cm Fla.K. 36"
 WGR_anti_air_equipment_1_desc: "The 2-cm Fla.K. 30 automatic anti-aircraft cannon was developed by Rheinmetall in 1930, and the Deutsches Heer began to receive guns in 1933. In 1936, due to the growth of tensions, Mauser modernised the gun - the upgraded model received the designation 2-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 36 and was adopted by the German army. The principle of operation of the Fla.K. 36 mechanisms remains the same - the use of recoil force with a short barrel stroke, but otherwise is similar with only increased the rate of fire to 220 rounds per minute and slightly lowered overall weight to 420 kg."
 WGR_anti_air_equipment_2: "3,7-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 37"
 WGR_anti_air_equipment_2_short: "3,7-cm Fla.K. 37"
 WGR_anti_air_equipment_2_desc: "The original 3,7-cm gun was developed by Rheinmetall in 1935. The cannon had an overall length of 89 calibres, which allowed a 4,800 metres maximum ceiling. The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."
 WGR_anti_air_equipment_3: "8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone Modell 41"
 WGR_anti_air_equipment_3_short: "8,8-cm Fla.K. 41"
 WGR_anti_air_equipment_3_desc: "Initially developed in 1930 by Krupp the 8,8-cm Flugzeugabwehrkanone 30, commonly known as 'acht-acht' ('eight-eight'), was later modified by Rheinmetall. The versatile carriage allows the 8,8-cm Fla.K. to fire in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels, and many consider the 8,8-cm Fla.K. line to be one of the best of its time. The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'. While having good characteristics, the Fla.K. 41 has problems in service, and is used mainly where it can be properly maintained."

 WGR_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_short: "s.W.G. 40"
 WGR_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed for Nebeltruppen (Smoke Troops) for smokescreen setting, the schwere Wurfgerät 40 exists in two variants - with wooden and steel frames. The open frames of the most common steel version have short hinged legs to adjust elevation and are sized to fit the 32-centimetre rocket, but adapter rails are provided to allow the 28-centimetre rockets to fit. The s.W.G. 40 also can be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 frames attached to the sides of different vehicles."
 WGR_rocket_artillery_equipment_2: "21-cm Raketenwerfer Modell 42"
 WGR_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_short: "R.W. 42"
 WGR_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc: "The 21-cm Raketenwerfer 42 is a five-barreled multiple rocket launcher mounted on the towed carriage derived from that of the 3,7 cm Pa.K. 36 anti-tank gun. The launchers are organised into batteries of six with three batteries per battalion. Intended to provide the fire support and settle smokescreens, the R.W. 42 are mainly used as rocket artillery and almost don't participate in chemical warfare."

 WHR_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Germany's eastern allies all had large stocks of Russian Mosin rifles, but they all adopted the 8mm Mauser cartridge to match German standards. Wanting to make cost-effective use of existing stocks until more Mauser rifles were available, Polish arsenals worked to convert Mosin rifles into carbines chambering the new official cartridge.

Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. Many models were ordered by Belarusian government."

Unable to secure the German Army's standard MP-40, the Oststaaten often have to make due with what is commercially available through private firms. The MP-35, designed by Emil Bergmann and notable for its horizontal magazine on the right side, is a popular choice thanks to its relative ruggedness and affordability, along with Bergmann's willingness to license the design."

The design is very simple and easy to produce, mechanically an enlarged pistol made from extensive use of stamped sheetmetal, using the same intermediate cartridge and 30-round magazines. This semi-automatic rifle, while failing to impress the German Army, caught the interest of Oststaaten, especially Belarus, looking for a cheap alternative to the M.Kb. 42, as the Germans were unwilling to share them. Waffenfabrik Suhl is happy to produce and license the design for local production, significantly raising the firepower of the otherwise-light infantry of Germany's eastern allies."

Najman's \"hand mortar\" was a Mosin rifle with the barrel replaced by a shortened tube of a 5 cm leGrW 36.

 XSM_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Kunming Type 88"
 XSM_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "Originally a product of late Guangxu era 'Self Strengthening' efforts, the Type 88 was designed as a close copy of the German Gewehr 88 with export modifications. While collectively inferior to newer rifles despite improvements, and often poorly maintained, the weapon is known to be rugged and reliable if unwieldy.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Xining Arsenal in Qinghai, though equipment shortages and personal preference often see it used alongside non-standard weapons such as the Dadao."
 XSM_infantry_equipment_1: "Kunming Type 27"
 XSM_infantry_equipment_1_short: "Kunming Type 27"
 XSM_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Originally called the 'Xuantong Type 27', this rifle was put into Qing service in 1935 through German assistance after the Restoration. The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nFirst produced at the Hanyang arsenal with German tools, manufacturing methods have already spread to Xining, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."

While appearing similar, the Type 35 is shorter, has the rear of the receiver covered, and the gas-trap system replaced by a simply gas port. The new rifle is also no longer able to switch to manual action and uses magazines from the Bohemian ZH-29 rifle and ZB-26 light machine gun."

Chambered in 7x57mm, the Model 1902 is a highly modified Spanish Model 1893 Mauser integrating several parts and design elements from the later Mauser Model 1898. The Model 1902, which was purchased in large quantities from the German company DWM, is nearly identical to the domestically produced Model 1910."

While effective, the Mondragón has always suffered reliability issues and is expensive to produce. The Model 1929 is a modernised and easier to manufacture version of the original Mondragón."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MICHAEL_COLLINS_DESC:0 "Michael Collins is the saviour and national hero of Ireland, with wide scale popularity keeping him in power. Born in Cork, Collins fought in the 1916 Easter Rising and afterwards became the president of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. During the war he organised the IRA into an effective guerrilla force, seeking to avoid the mistakes of 1916. In 1921 he was sent to negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Although by threatening to continue the war with German backing he was able to acquire all thirty-two counties in the treaty, he was unable to secure a republic, with the British fearing that an independent Irish republic would immediately become a German base. When he was expelled from Sinn Féin by Éamon de Valera he managed to form his own party, Fine Gael, which quickly overtook Sinn Féin in popularity. After the British Revolution he declared an independent Republic of Ireland and defeated a Unionist uprising in Ulster. Now with the Second Weltkrieg approaching Collins advocates revitalising Ireland's economy and military in order to assert Ireland's independence."
POLITICS_CATHAL_BRUGHA_DESC:0 "Born Charles William St. John Burgess of mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage, and later changing his name after joining the Gaelic League, Cathal Brugha is a war hero from the Easter Rising and leader of the rump Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He, already being a staunch rival of Collins during the War of Independence, became leader of the democratic opposition, a coalition of democratic parties opposing Collins, although he has increasingly become a figurehead to rally around in his old age as a new generation rises in the Republican movement. He and his party, bolstered in strength by many ex-Labourites following the 1923 ban after Larkin's failed uprising, advocate a social democratic Ireland as per the Democratic Programme of 1919, and a pro-German alignment to oppose Ireland's enemies in Britain and Canada."
POLITICS_FRANK_MACDERMOT_DESC:0 "Frank MacDermot is the youngest son of Hugh O'Rorke MacDermot, the Prince of Coolavin. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps during the Weltkrieg. Afterwards, he emigrated to America only to return to Ireland after the American economic collapse, and joined the anglophile National Centre Party, eventually becoming its leader due to his great oratory skills. A persistent critic of both the Collins' government and the democratic opposition's sympathies towards isolationism or Germanophilia, he is a strong advocate of a pro-Entente policy and rapprochement with the Unionist community."
POLITICS_JIM_LARKIN_DESC:0 "James Larkin, born in England before moving with his family to Ireland grew up in poverty and became a trade union organiser; eventually forming the Labour Party with James Connolly, most famously participating in the failed Dublin Lockout of 1913. After the failure of the lockout, he moved to America and became a member of the Socialist Party of America. Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists; eventually taking control of the IWL, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand. The Labour Party eventually fell apart, and Larkin split off to form the IWL, eventually going on to win the 1937 election. The Irish Citizen Army suffered dear for their loyalty, with their role in the Easter Rising being erased from the official history and their founder James Connolly's role downplayed."
POLITICS_GEAROID_O_CUINNEAGAIN_DESC:0 "Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin is a radical Irish language scholar, born in Belfast to a middle-class Catholic family, he joined the Army Comrades Association and managed to work his way up to Minister for Justice of Ireland as a result of his charisma, leadership and radical ideas which attracted the interest of ACA leader Eoin O'Duffy. As Minister for Justice, he passed laws repressing syndicalism as well as anti-traveler settlement laws against the Pavee community, as well as using his influence to encourage the Irish language. He also maintained links with the Romanian Iron Guard, expressing sympathy for establishing a similar regime in Ireland. To this end, he formed his own party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe that would revive the Irish language, ban the English language after a period of five years, and establish strong anti-syndicalist and anti-Semitic policies."

As a result of his anti-syndicalist views, he almost fell victim to an assassination attempt by the ICA in 1932, but managed to survive despite being badly wounded."
POLITICS_SEAN_LEMASS_DESC:0 "Seán Lemass was a volunteer during the Easter Rising and War of Independence and rose to become the head of the CPNH party, another breakaway party following the decline of Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish treaty. Lemass is an advocate for industrialisation and while he is a believer in capitalism, he also believes that normalising relations with the Union of Britain could have a beneficial effect on Irish trade and the economy. He is in favour of a flexible Irish foreign policy depending on the nation's needs, contrasting the CPNH from the other democratic parties who have their own biases in regards to Irish foreign policy."
POLITICS_DE_VALERA_DESC:0 "Eamon de Valera, born in New York to a Spanish father and Irish mother and taken to Ireland at the age of two, was a commander in the Easter Rising and a political leader during the War of Independence, however ending up slipping into political irrelevancy due to some poor political moves and misfortune following the Anglo-Irish treaty, having expelled Michael Collins from the Sinn Féin party despite Collins' incredible popularity, and then left SF himself later due to the influx of ex-Labourites into the party after the 1923 ban of the Labour Party as well as disputes with nationalists preferring a pro-German alignment which were in contrast with de Valera's belief in isolationism and neutrality. His breakaway party, Fianna Fáil, ultimately failed to be a success, becoming a minor party in the democratic opposition..."

IRE_Unraveling_Political_Scene_desc: "Fine Gael has enjoyed an almost unopposed hold on Ireland's democratic political system ever since the foundation of the free republic, but that has begun to change in recent years. Collins' old adversary Éamon de Valera has been steadily gaining more power within Ireland as the economic situation worsens under Collins' rule; and as Fine Gael's power wanes, violent clashes between supporters of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have become more common. This swell in political violence has led to a significant increase in Sinn Féin's popularity as Cathal Brugha's ideas gain more traction with the masses, branding themselves as a peaceful third way between de Valera and Collins. Additionally, Socialists of various ilks have been steadily clawing their way into political relevance, largely thanks to support from the Union of Britain and the American SPA. With all this in mind, the election of 1937 is set to be the most contentious one in recent memory, and if Fine Gael is to remain in their position of unchecked dominance,they will need to prove to the people of Ireland of their commitment to overhauling Ireland's stagnant economic and political scenes in order to end the Troubles once and for all.

We once thought that Imperialism was only a symptom of Britain's monarchist system, but as the Syndicalists continue to continue all the old royalist tricks, we have now come to the inescapable conclusion that the desire to subjugate our Emerald Isle is simply within the Englishmen's blood, leading many to be convinced that our rivalry with London will only end when Brittania has been wiped off of the face of the earth for good."

ire.71.d:0 "We've received news today that the Irish are doing their best to promote a newly modernised Dublin as a prospective centre of trade and finance. Several of our leading industrial companies have been contacted and it has been suggested that we encourage them to set up shop in the Irish capital. We will naturally reap some of the profits of this arrangement, which could be quite profitable in the long-run. Of course, it will be even more beneficial for the Irish."

ire.72.t:0 "The Germans Reply"
ire.72.d:0 "Our attempt at flirting with German businesses has been a success. The renown Krupp armaments manufacturer has announced the construction of a new Dublin subsidiary. This is bound to create a significant amount of new jobs, and the military complex will be selling directly to the Irish government. A win-win, as they say."
ire.72.d1:0 "Our attempt at flirting with German businesses has sadly been a failure. The Germans have decided to take a more protectionist approach to their domestic industries and have forbidden any foreign investment in Dublin."

IRE_RTN:0 "Revitalise the North"
IRE_RTN_desc:0 "After the 1925 ceasefire, the northern most region of Ulster has been in an industrial slump relative to the rest of the nation. Belfast once used to be a thriving industrial city and other towns and cities such as Derry and Coleraine were looking likely to follow. Revisiting this issue and energising the north with industrial investments will help to lift the region."
ire.67.t:0 "The Harland & Wolff Shipyard"
ire.67.d:0 "During the early 1900s, the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast had the prestigious honour of being the world's largest shipyard. After the capitulation of the British Empire during the first Weltkrieg and their second capitulation not long after to the Trade Unionists, it has fallen into disrepair and has been overtaken by other yards throughout the world. With refurbishment, it could once again be a great asset, but this time for Ireland, not the British Imperialists."
ire.67.a:0 "With some repairs and a recruiting effort, the shipyard will create a good few jobs."

Having seen their business suffer significant losses thanks to the fate of the British Empire, they are now looking for new opportunities and see expansion in Ulster as their highest priority. We can subsidise their venture at some cost to our nation, but the benefits of having a prominent aerospace industry are obvious in peace and wartime."
ire.68.a:0 "Help them settle."

IRE_SHORTBROS_desc:0 "Founded in 1908, the Short Brothers private limited company was the world's first private aircraft manufacturer.

ire.92.t:0 "A Small Step for Ireland..."
ire.92.d:0 "The Éireann Scientific Innovation Council (ESIC) is a newly created sub-department of the government, with one simple purpose in mind: a devotion to academia and scientific progress. Ireland has long been seen as a rural backwater by other world powers, a place that progress seemed to leave behind. Whilst a cruel opinion, it is not without truth. Centuries of British rule left Ireland largely neglected whilst the rest of the world raced on. It's time to catch up. The ESIC will be composed of expert scientists recruited from both the Irish population and from friendly foreign allies. ESIC research teams will increase our overall research efficiency and may even occasionally produce major breakthroughs in certain fields. The government must now decide how important the ESIC is to the nation: how much funds should they receive?"
ire.92.a:0 "Science is important, but it's not the only priority. A low amount of funding."
ire.92.b:0 "We will give them a prudent amount for such a key issue."
ire.92.c:0 "Ireland must leap from the past so that she can walk in the future. Massively fund the project."
ire.93.t:0 "Advances in Research Efficiency"
ire.93.d:0 "Thanks to steady funding by the Irish government, the ESIC has gradually been expanding over time and has grown in experience and efficiency, allowing them to tackle multiple research projects simultaneously. Ireland's scientific development is rapidly improving alongside the ESIC's own progress, and the investment is obviously paying off."
ire.93.a:0 "The news we've all been waiting for."

IRE_IRF_desc:0 "Our national has a vital need for industry, and that need is coupled with an equal requirement for research and development. Many of our factories are decrepit and out of date. To build a modern industry, Ireland needs modern factories. Investing into industrial research will allow us to move further towards progress."
IRE_ISP_OIL:0 "Irish Synthetics Project"
IRE_ISP_OIL_desc:0 "Although our people are industrious and our island ripe for industrialisation, there is no accounting for the unfortunate lack of natural resources available to us relative to the major powers of the world.

IRE_XPESIC:0 "Expand the ESIC"
IRE_XPESIC_desc:0 "The ESIC have been doing a fantastic job to date, but they still have room to grow.

ire.96.t:0 "The Dáil Decides: Immigration"
ire.96.d:0 "As part of their new IEAA initiative, the Dáil have argued for the expansion of Ireland's immigration policies. Under British rule, immigration to Ireland was almost non-existent and actively discouraged. Now that Ireland is free and her economy is growing at a rapid rate, there is an opportunity to start actively encouraging immigration. This process could prove extremely costly however, as significant funds will have to be invested in housing developments and administrative processes. There may also be social unrest with a large influx of immigrants arriving on Irish shores. Our choice of policy going forward will be very important for our nation, and it's important to consider the potential consequences."

We must cleanse Ireland of this failed group and their vile taint so that our Emerald Isle can finally be free and truly, wholly Celtic once again. We shall move to slowly limit the usage of the English language until it has been entirely eradicated from the local vernacular, and laws shall be passed to limit the rights and privileges of any Anglos foolish enough to stay on our Island.

While serving as one of the most successful rebel leaders of the IRA, Collins stood as a guiding beacon that helped lit our way through The Troubles and towards true but cautious freedom before his untimely and violent demise. We shall honor Collins and all he endured and sacrificed during his time as a freedom fighter and great negotiator, granting him the respect he deserves while also solidifying his legacy as a proud and honorable, but permanently retired relic of the past that ultimately failed where our Blueshirts have now triumphed. Carving off our rough edges and dusting them under the rug of Collins' tremendous reputation, we will ensure that our interpretation of the republican Irish dream can truly come to fruition while using the image of the fallen Big Fellow to uphold our new regime and our standing in the eyes of the masses."
IRE_Maintain_Social_Order: "Restore Societal Order"
IRE_Maintain_Social_Order_desc: "The very fabric and well-being of Irish society has deteriorated in recent years as our nation tries to tear itself apart at the seams under the pressures of radical extremism, Socialism, Liberalism, and foreign or other subversive influences. We must restore this deteriorating fabric while ensuring that a sense of true law, order, and justice is ushered in with this new era of order and peace. Under O'Duffy and the Army Comrades Association, Ireland shall be healed and made orderly and obedient once again, for the good of all Irishmen and for the good of all Ireland."
IRE_Oppose_Syndicalism: "Defang the Red Dogs"
IRE_Oppose_Syndicalism_desc: "We shall oppose Syndicalism and all its vile alternate forms, for nothing is less Irish than following the predatory ideology of the perfidious Anglo menace. All Leftist political parties and other similar organizations shall be outlawed, their members and known associates put on government watch-lists, and their activities closely monitored by our growing police force and by Blueshirt militias, facing the penalty of law if any should step out of line. The Emerald Isle shall be cleansed and purified for the good of all true Irishmen as we defang the Red Dogs once and for all."
IRE_Organize_Public_Service: "Public Service Reorganization"
IRE_Organize_Public_Service_desc: "The apparatus of state has decayed, endlessly assailed by Crypto-Syndicalist and Liberal radicalisms thinly-veiled as reforms and populism. We will need a new civil service and bureaucracy entirely distinct from and untainted by these naive ideological viruses that have infected our beloved Emerald Isle. From the smallest local government and clan organization to the halls of the Oireachtas itself and our own police force, every aspect of our administration shall be cleansed, reorganized, and re-staffed in order to ensure all public services and government institutions are loyal, well-functioning, and firmly in our control at the end of our leash."
IRE_Christian_Ireland: "A Purely Catholic Ireland"
IRE_Christian_Ireland_desc: "Mharascail O'Duffy and his militiamen in the IRA and the Blueshirts made a name for themselves early in our fight for freedom as prominent pro-Catholic zealots and anti-Protestant patriots. Raiding Protestant homes and storefronts for weapons and supplies while allowing the occasional slaughter of resistant Protestant traitors and apparent pro-Anglo agents, these pious Catholics have brought these attitudes to Ireland on a national level. Catholicism shall be the only religion accepted in our Ireland, and all shall follow the one true faith, or otherwise will keep their true beliefs to themselves if they know what is good for them, for our island will not be subjected to dangerous, traitorous, and heretical Protestant sectarianism ever again."
IRE_Organize_Employers: "Organize the Employers"
IRE_Organize_Employers_desc: "As the O'Duffy regime works to retool the economy to fit our new Catholic Corporatist direction, a major hurdle has arisen in how to go about the shift from predatory and unhinged Capitalism towards our more beneficial, stable, and prosperous economic model. The employers of the nation, including the managerial class, and all other cogs of the Capitalist machine shall be reeducated and reorganized in order to create a far more fair economic and profitable financial system that benefits all true Irishmen as opposed to a select group of elitist beneficiaries. By removing any lasting influence of both Capitalism and Socialism from the economy, we shall construct a more equal yet authoritarian Corporatist state built around class cooperation, trade protectionism, and nation-wide economic parity so that all loyal sons and daughters of Éire can truly prosper, all without falling to dangerous and predatory radicalism."
IRE_Organize_Farmers: "Organize the Farmers"
IRE_Organize_Farmers_desc: "A farmboy himself as a youth growing up in an impoverished smallholder family, O'Duffy has always held a soft spot for Agrarian pursuits. A proponent of more modern and efficient tillage farming as opposed to traditionalist pasture farming, which drove a wedge between himself and his former Sinn Féin allies, O'Duffy has begun to orchestrate Ireland's own agricultural revolution. With modernized and mechanized Agrarianism supporting the new Corporatist economic structure, paired with protectionist trade policies and new legislation and reserve funds for our farmers, Ireland's fields and fens shall be turned into the most lush and fertile farm plots we can muster, reawakening our agrarian traditions while creating a modern agriculturally-based economy that both feeds and enrichens the masses as we make the Emerald Isle truly green."
IRE_Awaken_Ireland: "Awaken the Emerald Isle"
IRE_Awaken_Ireland_desc: "Ireland nearly collapsed into radicalism under the rotting structure of our old democracy, but all that calamity was avoided thanks to the intervention of the Blueshirts and the resurgence of Irish Nationalism. By the hand of the Mharascail Eoin O'Duffy, the old wretched Liberal and Crypto-Syndicalist regime has been torn down, replaced with a new Catholic Corporatist state apparatus that supports Ireland's one true faith and her loyal patriots. The Emerald Isle shall now prosper strong and free forevermore, fully awoken to our natural and pious destiny by the new administration, and all guided by O'Duffy's genius vision and by God's holy light."

IRE_Democratic_Mandate_desc: "Irish democracy has been preserved, and despite these hard times, the goals of the Easter Rising shall not falter! The original dream of a Democratic Irish Republic shall continue on as new elections are prepared, with the major parties of the Oireachtas all being in the running, such as Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, the National Centre Party, and the returning incumbents from Fine Gael. We have given the people of Ireland their voices again, so now let those voices finally be heard!"

IRE_Valera: "Fianna Fáil Victory"
IRE_Valera_desc: "Fianna Fáil, literally meaning the 'Soldiers of Destiny' or the 'Warriors of Fáil', have come out victorious in the recent democratic elections. Known as the Republican Party of Ireland, these conservative Christian Democrats adhere closely to the ideas espoused by Irish national father and Fianna Fáil founder Éamon de Valera, pushing for Center-Right populism, non-radical Irish nationalism, Gaelic conservatism, and Christian piety. Under these populist conservatives, Ireland shall heal and prosper as one nation, one republic, and one people under God."
IRE_Christian_Democracy: "True Christian Democracy"
IRE_Christian_Democracy_desc: "Fianna Fáil has always prided itself on the pursuit of a good and holy, Christian and pious Irish democracy. With de Valera and his clique of Catholic democrats finally at the helm, Ireland shall once again march along under the light of the Lord, promoting Catholic morals and sensibilities as a fair and untampered conservative democratic system is established in order to give power to the voices to the masses."
IRE_Cultural_Conservatism: "Cultural Conservatism"
IRE_Cultural_Conservatism_desc: "Ireland is a Conservative nation at heart, wary to drastic change and deeply tied to centuries-old traditions and ideas. This legacy of cultural conservatism tied to the Catholic faith and to Celtic traditions shall not only be safeguarded and upheld, but also expanded and promoted throughout the state, ensuring that Irish Conservatism remains the dominant thoughtform among the people for generations to come."
IRE_New_Constitution: "A New Constitution"
IRE_New_Constitution_desc: "Deciding to distance ourselves from the original Constitution of the Irish Free State established in 1922, de Valera and Fianna Fáil have decided to draft a new Constitution of Ireland, or the Bunreacht na hÉireann. Asserting the national sovereignty of the Irish people, this document will become the foundation of our reformed democratic system, enshrining traditions of Conservative Democracy and Catholic Traditionalism while guaranteeing certain fundamental rights, the existence and power of our bicameral legislature the Oireachtas, the separation of powers between branches of the government balanced with checks, and judicial independence and review. By this document, we shall build a stronger and more unified Irish democracy."
IRE_Irish_Soverignty: "Cement Irish Sovereignty"
IRE_Irish_Soverignty_desc: "One of the main pillars of the Fianna Fáil platform is the establishment of a wholly independent and sovereign Irish state supported by modern and non-radical notions of Irish Nationalism and Catholic pride along with Gaelic language revivalism and anti-Anglo reform. With these unified positions in mind, we shall slowly march to build a fully Irish Emerald Isle, detached from the dark shadow of the Troubles and from English identities, and with the best intentions in mind for the Irish people and the Irish people alone."
IRE_Special_Status_Church: "A Special Status for the Church"
IRE_Special_Status_Church_desc: "The Catholic Church has always held a special and lofty position within Irish society, sometimes reigning as the most influential organization within the state over the government or the English imperialists themselves. Ever the staunch ally and the foundational body that supports our faith and our Conservative Traditionalism, we shall grant the Catholic Church and its subsidies a special status within the state, eroding the idea of secularism without fully breaking it, and ensuring that our beloved Church remains closely tied to the functions and developments of the state for ages to come."
IRE_Fiscal_Conservatism: "Classical Fiscal Liberalism"
IRE_Fiscal_Conservatism_desc: "Though the Americans have muddied the term 'Liberalism' and conflated it with progressive, semi-Socialist and welfare based practices, we here in Europe know the true meaning. We shall pursue a policy of Fiscal Classical Liberalism, advocating for tax-cuts, reduced government spending, free markets, financial deregulation, privatization, free and open trade, and an attempt at limiting government debt over all other economic goals. We will build a strong and self-standing economy linked with the wider Capitalist world, bringing about the end of Irish economic stagnace as we rise to the global financial stage."
IRE_Smear_Collins: "Tarnish Collins' Legacy"
IRE_Smear_Collins_desc: "Though a renowned freedom fighter with the IRA and a well-respected orator, negotiator, and politician, Collins was always a wolf in sheep's clothing. A potential tyrant and unabashed strongman lying in wait, he has ever plotted to wrap Ireland within the palm of his hands despite his otherwise noble notions of creating an independent Ireland. We must reveal the varied truth of Collins' grey reality, showing the masses the true man behind the mask as we further uphold the real hero of Irish independence, our own de Valera."
IRE_A_Conservative_Ireland: "A Conservative Ireland Under God"
IRE_A_Conservative_Ireland_desc: "By the will of the Father of Irish Conservatism and his allies in Fianna Fáil, the Emerald Isles have once again been wrapped in the safe and prosperous arms of Catholic morality and modernized traditionalism. By the will of Éamon de Valera, non-Liberal and anti-Socialist Catholic populism has risen to support the masses as measured Capitalism and Catholic morals breathe life into our once-stagnating socio-economic reality. Under God and under de Valera's Fianna Fáil, the reborn Irish nation shall stand proud, pious, and strong against corruptive and sinful outside forces, blazing a path towards prosperity for all true children of Éire guided by the glorious light of the Lord."

IRE_Collins_Democracy: "Fine Gael Re-Elected"
IRE_Collins_Democracy_desc: "Fine Gael, or the 'Family of the Irish', has secured yet another win for themselves, once again rising to the top of Irish democracy as the champions of a United Ireland. Practicing Liberal Conservatism and espousing Christian Democracy, Fine Gael has always preached a pragmatic, non-ideologically constrained approach to serving the masses, stating that their way is the right way for Ireland, regardless of dogma or ideology. Headed by former-freedom fighter turned national father Michael Collins, Fine Gael shall guide Irish democracy towards a mediated and pragmatic center partyline while supporting the masses and paying respect to our history and traditions."
IRE_Use_Collins_Popularity: "Collins' Useful Heroism"
IRE_Use_Collins_Popularity_desc: "No single modern man or figure stands higher than Michael Collins, for millions across Ireland hold this freedom fighter and father of Irish independence in the highest regard. Though this pseudo-cult of personality has its dangers, the potential usefulness far outweighs the minor risks it holds as we inflate the Big Fellow's power and ego. Fine Gael shall utilize Collins' popularity and unmatched position in Irish culture and politics in order to ensure that our party and our platform is as widely beloved and followed as Collins is."
IRE_Old_Dog_New_Tricks: "Old Dog, New Tricks"
IRE_Old_Dog_New_Tricks_desc: "Collins has been in power for quite a long time, ruling the free and independent Irish Republic for roughly a decade since our rise to freedom in the wake of the British Revolution and defeated Unionist Uprising in Ulster. Though he has done much to create a prosperous and free Ireland, the state has stagnated in recent years as the German economy began to slump, and many fear that Collins now merely stands as a fallen hero living on the good graces of his past achievements, but that shall not become a reality! Collins has endeavored to not just coast on his old popularity as a war hero and founder of the Irish Republic and Fine Gael itself, instead beginning a new series of reforms and legislations aimed at breathing life into the economy and wider society once more. This old dog shall learn new tricks in order to solidify his legacy as the greatest Irish statesman of the modern age as the Emerald Isle is guided towards prosperous modernity under Fine Gael."
IRE_Hands_Across_The_Isle: "Hands Across the Isle"
IRE_Hands_Across_The_Isle_desc: "If Ireland is to survive the coming tumult, the government of our Emerald Isle must be united like never before. Fools like de Valera have only sought to sow division as they push for their uncompromising Christian Conservative vision, but this shall not be allowed! Using non-radical notions of Irish Nationalism with non-partisan populism and other universally liked positions, Fine Gael shall unite the disparate political masses of our island against the coming maelstrom. We must work with our fellow anti-de Valera rivals across the aisle and all true Irish statesmen across the Isle if we are to create a strong, pious, and prosperous Irish Republic for all, for we cannot unite the masses if our own government is in factionalist shambles."
IRE_The_Threat_To_The_East: "The Eastern Villain Looms"
IRE_The_Threat_To_The_East_desc: "To the East, the one true enemy of the Irish people waits, ever-plotting for our downfall and subjugation just as they have for hundreds upon hundreds of years. The Anglo-Saxon menace of England can never be trusted, for even despite Collins' expert skills as a negotiator and diplomat, the foul English denied our demand for home rule and the creation of the Irish Free State all those years ago. Luckily for us, their own hubris led to their downfall, for the British Revolution turned their empire to ash and gave freedom to the Irish people at long last, but that does not mean we are safe. Under new banners and now puppets of the Red Star of Syndicalism, the English wolves may wear new coats, but these rabid dogs still are up to their same old tricks. We must never lower our guard against the Angloid menace, for we shall never allow another Time of Troubles ever again!"
IRE_Pragmatic_Liberalism: "Pragmatic Liberalism"
IRE_Pragmatic_Liberalism_desc: "The Liberalism of Fine Gael is far from the decadent and perverse idea of 'Liberalism' as spawned by the faltering Continentals and Americans or their ideological allies, for Collins and our united Ireland stand strong by the ideas of true Liberalism and the Enlightenment. Conservative by the standards of some, we walk the truth path to a Liberal and Republican society, free from the vices and dangers of stagnant Traditionalism and overly-cautious Conservatism, or from predatory Socialism and naive Progressivism, and ever pragmatic as to deduce the most correct path forward for our society at any one moment. This true incarnation of Liberal Capitalism shall form the foundation of the state, ensuring that Ireland always walks the path best suited for it, now and forever."
IRE_Irish_Unity: "United by Irish Nationalism"
IRE_Irish_Unity_desc: "Though often tainted by radicalism and ideology, Nationalism itself is not an inherently dangerous or harmful idea; in fact, it is these notions of non-radical Irish Nationalism that is the basis of Fine Gael's foundations. By spreading these ideas of nonviolent patriotism and national loyalty to the masses while revitalizing our local Gaelic culture and language, we shall work to unite the Irish people like never before. Though we shall face difficult resistance in parts of the nation, particularly around Ulster due to the Unionists, Fine Gael shall persevere in order to promote nationwide Irish Unity, for this union shall form the bulwark against the corrosive foreign elements that seek to subjugate and weaken the Irish people."
IRE_Defend_Democracy: "Defenders of the Emerald Isle"
IRE_Defend_Democracy_desc: "Ireland for the Irish! That is the dream we uphold and maintain, for Fine Gael is the sword and shield of the Emerald Isle that Collins and his loyalists wield against anti-Irish forces and the Anglo-Saxon plague. Using controlled militarism, a renewed industrial and urban-focused economy, and the devotion of the masses, we shall defend Ireland and our liberal democratic republic against all those who would seek to undermine our platform. No Syndicalist swine or Reactionary wretch shall lay a finger on the gingered hair of our beloved masses, for Ireland stands strong and free, forever."
IRE_Democracy_Under_The_Big_Fellow: "Democracy Under the 'Big Fellow'"
IRE_Democracy_Under_The_Big_Fellow_desc: "Under the Big Fellow Michael Collins, Ireland has run the gauntlet of independence, prevented Syndicalism from spreading from English shores, stopped the Unionist threat, united the Emerald Isles, and ushered in true democratic republicanism for the masses, supported by Christian Conservative Liberalism, Irish Nationalism, and regulated Capitalism. Once just a warrior and diplomat, the Big Fellow now stands as the uncontested master statesman of Ireland, and in the eyes of some he stands as the greatest Irishman of the modern age. Our beautiful and verdant island breathes strong and free, prosperous and pious as it is guided by the brilliance of Fine Gael, and we owe it all to the Big Fellow."

IRE_National_Center: "National Centre Victory"
IRE_National_Center_desc: "In a shocking turn of events, the relatively small National Centre Party has seized control of Irish democracy by mandate of the masses. Formerly known as the National Farmers and Ratepayers League, at first glance the NCP seems to hold many similarities to their hated rivals in Fianna Fáil. However, where they differ truly matters, with the NCP pushing for Agrarianism and pro-farmer agricultural reform, Christian Conservatism, moderated Irish nationalism and patriotism, and most differentiating of all, a detente with our former Anglo enemies, all while reforming the economy along agricultural and rural lines with support from the agrestic masses which make up the bulk of the NCP's base. Battling against the urban-focused Fianna Fáil, party leaders Frank MacDermot and James Dillon shall guide Ireland back towards its traditional Christian roots as a nation of farmers, shepherds, and bucolic paradise, ensuring an end to rural neglect."
IRE_End_Anglo_Irish_Hostilities: "End Anglo-Irish Hostilities"
IRE_End_Anglo_Irish_Hostilities_desc: "Hibernia and Brittania are truly brothers till the end, and while our history with the Anglos has been checkered at best, we can not deny our shared ties, history, and future. The National Centre Party has always aimed to end the Anglo-Irish Trade War, and now that these rural agrarians run the show, this goal of rapprochement can finally begin. The vendetta against our Eastern brethren will slowly come to an end as we move closer to our former foes economically and diplomatically, ensuring prosperity, peace, and pastoral paradise reigns free across our shared Isles."
IRE_Language_Equality: "One Ireland, Two Tongues"
IRE_Language_Equality_desc: "While our fair Irish mothertongue has survived into this modern day and age, it has done so under fire, constantly being erased and driven back into the annals of history by the far more dominant and widespread Anglo lexicon. In accordance with our goals of detente with the English, while still keeping true to our ideas of Gaelic revivalism and Irish cultural protectionism that we share with most Irishmen here on the Emerald Isle, we shall pursue a policy of bilingualism. Irish-Gaelic and English shall be able to be used in both official and private capacities, standing side-by-side as the two official languages of Ireland. Though we shall still pursue a revival of Goidelic language, culture, and identity, English too shall always have a place here as well."
IRE_Protectionism: "Hibernian Protectionism"
IRE_Protectionism_desc: "Ireland stands in a unique position in Europe, cast off the northern seas at the edge of this chaotic continent, stuck between economic zones and trade areas as we flutter in the seabreeze and try to find our own footing. In order to safeguard our own economic prosperity and progress, the NCP has moved to pursue their beloved policy of economic protectionism. In order to continue to ease relations with England, these tariffs, import quotas, and other protections shall be mediated for English markets - for the most part - while we direct our attention to the Continentals and the Americas. We will build a strong and stable economy built by Irishmen, for Irishmen, all upon the backs of our proud and supported farmers and our growing rural population."
IRE_Middle_of_The_Road_Politics: "Stick to the Middle Road"
IRE_Middle_of_The_Road_Politics_desc: "The radicals of the ANH or of O'Duffy's Blueshirts are no different from the rotten Syndicalists of the Irish Workers League and their Socialist allies in groups like Sinn Féin. Both factions seek to dismantle the independent and democratic republic we have toiled so hard to build; we can not allow this! The policy of the National Center Party is one of opposing radicalism at every step, safeguarding the democratic system that every true Irishman knows and loves. We shall safeguard the middle way; a blazing and righteous path between Leftist naivety and Rightist shortsightedness, between the authoritarian liberalism of Fine Gael and the urban-focused greed of our main rivals Fianna Fáil, for the good of all on the Emerald Isle."
IRE_Agrarianism: "Farmers at the Foundation"
IRE_Agrarianism_desc: "The National Center party was founded by and for farmers, originally being called the National Farmers and Ratepayers League for a reason. Despite the urbanist focus of our main rivals across the democratic spectrum, it is we who have seized the mandate of the masses to lead the republic into a new bucolic age. The rates system of property taxes that exists as a holdover from the British system shall be removed from all agricultural land, allowing our farmers to reinvest that money into their fields and pastures while new modernization and mechanization measures are taken to drag our agricultural processes out of the stone age. Pastoralist practices traditional to the Emerald Isle shall also be revived, further distancing ourselves from the antiquated and foreign farming methods of our old oppressors. With farmers as the foundation and with ruralism and pastoralism in our hearts, Ireland shall come to embody the arcadian idyll as we make the Emerald Isle even more verdant and green."
IRE_Central_Bank: "Reform the Central Bank"
IRE_Central_Bank_desc: "A central goal of the NCP platform has always been to reform the banking system of Ireland. Despite being an independent nation, our monetary system is still heavily tied to the British pound sterling area, and though Collins attempted to create an independent Irish bank during his time in office, he largely failed in this pursuit, leaving our finances in limbo. A new central bank shall be created for Ireland, independent of other currencies and centered around the Irish Punt. Furthermore, this move shall be paired with deflation measures through nation-wide pay cuts and other protectionist policies, finally freeing our economy from the vices and virtues of foreigners for the benefit of all in Éire."
IRE_Oppose_Valera: "Oppose Valera's Conservatism"
IRE_Oppose_Valera_desc: "Éamon de Valera and his lackeys in Fianna Fáil have long been our largest rivals, with our parties sharing much of the same Conservative positions and policies. However, de Valera's idea of Conservatism and Nationalism hinges far too much on faux populism, urbanist decadence, rural neglect, and a sinful interpretation of Irish Christianity as he wields these positions as tools to win over the masses instead of bringing true prosperity to our people. We shall work to weaken Fianna Fáil, taking their members and supporters under our wing so that we may grow to become the face of Irish Conservatism and Center-Right republicanism, revealing the truth to all those that will see it."
IRE_Centrist_Ireland: "A Rural Ireland of the Centre"
IRE_Centrist_Ireland_desc: "Under the guidance of the National Centre Party, Ireland has begun to embrace its pastoralist past, ushering in a new age of rural prosperity across the Emerald Isle. Our farmers and laborers are supported by conservative populism and our strong financial reform, our fields blow in the wind more verdant and fertile than ever before, our economy hums along strong and independent, and our people rejoice under God and united by a non-radical yet devout sense of patriotism and Gaelic nationalism. The English no longer bite at our heels, and the British Isles have seen peace and cooperation for the first time in centuries. Let us rejoice and sally forth as the NCP continues to breathe life into our free Irish agrarian democracy."

IRE_Brugha: "Sinn Féin Victory"
IRE_Brugha_desc: "In a shocking win for the Irish working-class that deals a tremendous blow to the traditionally Conservative atmosphere of our democracy, Sinn Féin has risen as victors in the recent elections. Founded by Arthur Griffith in 1905, the original members of Sinn Féin went on to found the revolutionary Irish Republic and its first domestic parliament, the Revolutionary, or First, Dáil before splitting up and fracturing during our civil war and fight for freedom. Translating to 'We, Ourselves', Sinn Féin is expected to pursue the dream of a Democratic Socialist Republic for Ireland, supported by Left-wing Irish Nationalism, socioeconomic progressivism, and secularism, though many within the party still support and push Christian ethics and morality, driving a wedge in the party's unified front. Regardless of this debate, Sinn Féin shall endure in order to transform Ireland into the pink pearl of our archipelago."
IRE_Solidify_Irish_Republicanism: "Solidify Irish Republicanism"
IRE_Solidify_Irish_Republicanism_desc: "Ireland stands free and alone, for We, Ourselves have guided our people to independence. We must enshrine this freedom to be a paramount aspect of our state and identity, for never again shall Ireland be subjected to the whims of foreign powers or subjugated to the desires of far-off tyrants. Social Democracy and incorruptible Republicanism shall ring far and true across the Emerald Isle, cemented by Sinn Féin's ideas of Leftist nationalism and social patriotism as we rise to be the shepherds of this new air of liberty and national pride."
IRE_Promote_Gaelic: "Revitalize and Adapt Gaelic Tradition"
IRE_Promote_Gaelic_desc: "One of the only near-universally accepted policies among Irish political parties is the revival of the Gaelic language and wider Irish-Celtic culture, and our party is no different. Where our righteous platform differs however is in that we do not wish to merely revive the old and deeply conservative traditions of our past, for we also seek to reform them to better fit our modern sensibilities while distancing it from ideas of religion and traditionalism. We must revive this past legacy and drag it into the light of modernity, creating a reborn and reformed Gaelic identity, language, and culture to support this free and independent Irish republic."
IRE_Call_For_Peace: "A Renewed Call for National Peace"
IRE_Call_For_Peace_desc: "Ireland has been torn asunder by civil debate and conflict, with the people each pining for their own idealized version of an Irish state. We must work to usher in a new age of peace and unity across the Emerald Isle so that all may be united in purpose and direction. Though we do not expect all to join our party, the goal is to create a peaceful and open nation where cooperation and debate can happen naturally and peacefully regardless of party lines or ideology, allowing us to create a truly fair and free democracy upheld by our Leftist vision but open to the opinions and desires of all."
IRE_Populist_Socialism: "Populist Socialism Without Syndicalism"
IRE_Populist_Socialism_desc: "Syndicalism has scared the populace; of that we are certain. However, we cannot allow these dangerous radicals to sully the good name of our progressive mission. We must make it clear to the masses that while we pursue a Socialist democracy and seek to evolve the predatory Capitalist system, we in no way support the violent radicalism of the Syndicalist menace and their authoritarian allies, or their English benefactors. We will blaze a reform-oriented path towards true and open Leftist, supported by Irish nationalism, Socialist populism, welfare economics, and a desire to ever remain free and independent, all for the good of the Irish masses."
IRE_Threats_to_the_East_and_West: "Barbarians at Both Gates"
IRE_Threats_to_the_East_and_West_desc: "We fought hard for independence from the British, but despite their 'noble' intentions, the Union of Britain has seemed to be no better than the tyrants of old. Of course, the Royalists in Canada are no better, desiring Irish subjugation just the same. We will not hitch our wagon to either side, for we know that they only desire the domination of the Irish people and state. We shall remain steadfastly independent, resisting the machnications of both London and Ottawa as we build up a glorious social city upon the hill to protect ourselves from these rabid barbarians."
IRE_Patriotic_Leftism: "Leftist Patriotism Free From Radicalism"
IRE_Patriotic_Leftism_desc: "Irish nationalism has formed the basis of our party's platform, for despite our Leftist inclinations, we are Irishmen first and foremost. However, nationalism is often tied to ideas of violent radicalism and destructive extremism, souring these notions in the minds of the masses. We must work to foster an idea of Leftist Patriotism, for having pride in one's own nation should be as natural as breathing, as we work to create a Socialist democracy and welfare economy that supports the citizens and culture of the Emerald Isle above all other pursuits."
IRE_The_True_Hero: "Ireland's True Hero"
IRE_The_True_Hero_desc: "Despite being a divisie hero in his own right, Michael Collins stole Cathal Brugha's credit when it comes to who was the true hero of Irish Independence. Collins sought to bend to the British, and would have been happy selling our sovereignty to the Angloids in exchange for power and dominance over our Emerald Isle. We must reveal the truth to the masses, sullying the so-called 'good' name of Collins as we raise Brugha to be the one and true Father of our free and sovereign Ireland."
IRE_We_Ourselves: "We, Ourselves"
IRE_We_Ourselves_desc: "Sinn Féin Amháin, or We, Ourselves Alone, is the motto of not only Sinn Féin, but of our free Ireland at large. Coined by Irish nationalists at the beginning of the century, this motto has binded us together in our struggle for true freedom and independent prosperity. Under the ingenious and unifying vision of Brugha and his Sinn Féin, Ireland has prospered and flourished like never before, opening every door to the people as we create a Social Democratic paradise. Though our party still argues over matters of religion and economics, we shall sally forth and continue this prosperous new era for the good of all in Éire."

IRE_Socialism_desc: "Despite the expectations of our political rivals, we have triumphed, and Ireland now stands bathed in a new glow of red and crimson. Socialism has made its way to the Emerald Isle, and now our island stands at the mercy of these radical ideologues. An Chomhdháil Siondacáiteach, or the Syndicate Conference, shall now commence in order to determine the direction of this new Leftist-dominated democratic republic we have forged. To the Revolutionary Dáil!"
IRE_Arms_From_Internationale: "Aid from the Internationale"
IRE_Arms_From_Internationale_desc: "Do we hate subjugation at the hands of foreign powers? Yes, we do; however we can not deny the strength and prowess of the Third Internationale. If we are to survive as a socialist state, we need the backing of the world's foremost group of socialists, even if that means groveling to London. While the Union of Britain is our nextdoor neighbor, many within the government favor working with the French Commune, likening their support to the support France granted in the Irish Rebellion of 1798 under Jean Humbert. This prospect is more palatable to many mainline Socialists, and as such, this policy of begrudging cooperation more closely tied to Paris over London shall become Irish policy."
IRE_Deal_With_Collins: "Dethrone the 'Big Fellow'"
IRE_Deal_With_Collins_desc: "Despite losing his seat of power, Collins has continued to decry the new Syndicalist government; claiming Larkin to be no more than a puppet of London's machinations. He and his supporters have declared that the IWL and its allies have sold out to the Union of Britain, and that Ireland will soon fall under Britannia's grasp just as in the days of old; this time with a new coat of red paint. While there is no truth to these absurdities, Collins still remains a dangerous force; and one that must be reckoned with soon. We will take out the 'Big Fellow' once and for all, and lay waste to his mindless mob of pro-German supporters."

Though there exists quite a large variety of various Socialist and Laborist organizations that have worked together to make this dream a reality, the looming elections are dominated by three main factions, being the radical Social Nationalists of Saor Éire led by Peadar O'Donnell, the Syndicalist Irish Worker League led by Jim Larkin, the new Labour party led by William O'Brien, and the Revolutionary Workers Group led by Totalist James Gralton. As our first elections of this infantiles socialist democracy are now organized, our Emerald Isle prepares itself for its crimson transformation as we decide as a free people who shall push the Starry Plow."

IRE_Labour_Victory: "Labour Victory"
IRE_Labour_Victory_desc: "Príomh Aire, or President of the Dáil, William X. O'Brien and his faction of Irish Labourists and Social Democrats have won out in the first elections of the Revolutionary Dáil. The Labour party's return from the dead has surprised even the most ardent socialists, as moderates flock to the reborn party as the former conservative Irish system is dismantled.  Larkin may have split the Labour movement in twain, almost dooming them, but he is the true heir of Connolly's vision, and while Larkin was the man to bring the revolution to Ireland, O'Brien has had the last laugh, for Labour is once again on top of the Irish socialist scene. Now, promising to pave an Irish pathway to socialism while keeping the nation's democratic system intact, we shall bring true egalitarian prosperity to the Emerald Isle!"
IRE_Moderate_Revolution: "A Moderate Irish Revolution"
IRE_Moderate_Revolution_desc: "While our nation's revolution by ballot might tempt certain groups who want to revolutionize the system beyond all recognition, we will not allow them to turn Ireland into a dictatorship or some Communist or Syndicalist hellhole. The Red Revolution that Labour pledges to bring to Ireland will be an outstandingly moderate one; turning Ireland into a pink-red socialist state that will bring prosperity and liberty to all of its citizens without destroying what makes Ireland Ireland."
IRE_Weaken_Executive: "Weaken the Executive Position"
IRE_Weaken_Executive_desc: "Rivals like Larkin might want to centralize the power of the state within the hands of one man, but O'Brien and the Labour party knows that the solution is not more executive power, but rather less. By weakening the Príomh Aire's position, we will ensure that no man will come to bring tyranny to Ireland once more. Many radicals may have been tempted by Ireland's red dawn, but we will not let them strip away from us the rights we have toiled so hard to guarantee, and the advent of a strong Legislative Dáil and Cúirt Uachtarach na hÉireann, the three branches of government shall work together equally with checks and balances to ensure authoritarianism never crops up. The Emerald Isle will remain a haven of democracy and liberty; now and forevermore."
IRE_Workers_Army: "The Irish Citizen's Army"
IRE_Workers_Army_desc: "While paramilitaries are typically the mark of radicals who wish to bully the citizenry into submission,the ICA, or Irish Citizen Army will work for the safety of the people of Ireland; not against. Formed from Trade Union members to defend the workers against police brutality, the ICA fell apart due to ideological infighting along with the Labour party, but with the Labour party firmly in power and united in purpose, the ICA has been revived and expanded without fear of another collapse. With the ICA by our side, the workers of our fair Éire will be free and safe from all those who wish to see them in chains."
IRE_True_Democratic_Socialism: "True Democratic Socialism"
IRE_True_Democratic_Socialism_desc: "Ireland's path to socialism was paved at the ballot box; the people used their collective voice to cast down the corrupt, ending our old system of reactionary opression without a drop of blood shed. And while many have tried to strip away our inalienable democratic rights, we shall not allow radicals to destroy what our forefathers worked so hard to achieve. We will not yield to autocrats, not the reactionaries who are now nothing but underground rebels, or radical leftists who wish to completely replace the Irish system as it stands."

IRE_Trade_Union_Commitment: "Unionize Ireland"
IRE_Trade_Union_Commitment_desc: "Through the ballot box, we have won the first great battle for the soul of Ireland; however our work is not done yet. The time has come to unionize Ireland, keeping the oppressive ruling class from undermining the liberty of the workers, forming a new collective that will keep our Labour force safe from the politicking of unjust capitalists. James Connolly was not the first to try and bring the safety of unionization to the Emerald Isle, and by God he won't be the last. Under the leadership of O'Briens ICTU, unionism shall spread to all of Ireland's disciplines without fear of radicalism or reactionary thought."

IRE_IWL_Victory: "Triumph of the IWL"
IRE_IWL_Victory_desc: "Cathaoirleach, or Chairman of the Dáil, Jim Larkin and his faction of Irish Syndicalists and Unionists have won out in the first elections of the Revolutionary Dáil. Under the watch of the IW, Ireland shall bathe itself in the crimson glow of Syndicalism as the new dominant form of Leftist thought entrenches itself here in Ireland. Trade Unionism, Syndicalist economics, Labourism, and international cooperation with the wider Syndicalist powers shall ensure as the gears of the Revolution begin to mesh and spin together in unison for the good of all cogs."
IRE_Irish_Trade_Union_Unity: "Unite Under the ICTU"
IRE_Irish_Trade_Union_Unity_desc: "Unionism in Ireland is an uneasy topic, to say the least. The Irish Trades Union Congress was formed in 1894, and serves as the main labor federation and national trade union centre on the island, uniting disparate industries and trades under a shared banner. However, many fear that this organization has been tainted by the Anglos and their selfish ideas, while the radicals within our ranks feel as though this dated organization is not nearly Syndicalist enough. To remedy this split while also centralizing power and economic control into the hands of the government and the people, a new trade union congress shall be created, called the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, or the ICTU. This new Labourist and Trade Unionist body shall unite the varied craft unions with the unions of our larger industries, creating a uniform and nationalized economy to benefit our rise to Syndicalism."
IRE_Christian_Syndicalism: "Syndicalism Under God"
IRE_Christian_Syndicalism_desc: "There is no antagonism between the Cross and Socialism! A man can pray to Jesus the Carpenter, and be a better Socialist for it, for some of our most important craft unions are unions of carpenters who labor away for God and Nation. Rightly understood, there is no conflict between our Syndicalist vision and the holy and righteous vision of Christ. We stand by the Cross just as we stand by Proudhoun and Bakunin. Both 'What is Property' and the Bible are to me Holy Books, now and forever!"
IRE_Gallant_Allies_Abroad: "Old Allies and New Opportunities"
IRE_Gallant_Allies_Abroad_desc: "Cathaoirleach Jim Larkin has allies across the Syndicalist world, particularly within the American IWW led by his dear friend and fellow labor leader Big Bill Haywood, and within the French CGT. By utilizing these ties and connections, Larkin hopes to begin a new age for Ireland, supported by International Syndicalism for the betterment of the global Proletariat, and for all Irishmen. Through new trade deals, diplomatic agreements, alliances, and more, we and our allies, both old and new, shall prosper like never before as we walk side-by-side into this new crimson dawn."

IRE_Anti_Capitalist_Crusade: "Commitment Against Capitalism"
IRE_Anti_Capitalist_Crusade_desc: "Predatory Capitalism has proven again and again to be behind the many evils that have terrorized our fair Emerald Isle. British greed caused the Potato Famine, British greed proposed that the people of Ireland sell their own children, and British greed has led to centuries of unjust exploitation of our people, and Irish Capitalism has been an ally to British interests the whole time!. The bloodlust for money that the British upper class holds, and the aided at every step by domestic capitalist parasites; has devastated our people for long enough, the system that profigates the suffering of our people must end here and now."

IRE_Saor_Eire_Victory: "Saor Éire Victory"
IRE_Saor_Eire_Victory_desc: "Uachtarán, or President of the Dáil, Peadar O'Donnell and his zealous faction of radicals have won out in the first elections of the Revolutionary Dáil. Deeply tied to Agrarian Socialism, Ruralism, Gaelic Revivalism, and radical democratic Irish Nationalism, the party of 'Free Ireland' is expected to bring about a societal overhaul of our island as they shift away from the urban focus that has stagnated and bastardized Ireland, instead bathing the nation in the deep red of Republican Socialism."
IRE_Irish_Social_Revolution: "Towards an Irish Social Revolution"
IRE_Irish_Social_Revolution_desc: "Inspired by his work running a commune out on Arranmore Island during his time as a teacher before our independence, O'Donnell has advocated heavily for a complete social revolution in Ireland. Changing the political and economic face of Ireland is not nearly enough, for our culture, technology, philosophy, culture, and very identity all must become free and crimson if we are to achieve true Socialism. However, such a sudden upheaval is likely to cause growing pains, so we must be careful as to not bring about more harm and violence than good as we endeavor to transform the very meaning of being Irish itself."
IRE_Paint_IRA_Red: "Shift the IRA Towards the Left"
IRE_Paint_IRA_Red_desc: "O'Donnell believed that the IRA should have adopted the people's cause and supported land redistribution and workers' rights, but instead the IRA largely has fallen to Catholic Nationalism and Conservative stagnace as a group of petit bourgeoisie, and has largely left the South fall into destitution as they rampaged across Ulster. To remedy this, the IRA must be reclaimed as the workers organization it was always meant to be, fused with the noble Socialist heroes in the Irish Citizen Army and the Irishwomen's Council (Cumann na mBan) to become the Social Nationalist militant arm of our social revolution and the defenders of our new Red dogma. Only then can Connolly's dream be made a reality."
IRE_Connollys_Dream_Made_Real: "Connolly's Dream Made Reality"
IRE_Connollys_Dream_Made_Real_desc: "James Connoly is the one true hero of Irish independence and Socialism. Always opposing British dominance over our island, Connolly led the Irish Citizen Army against our foes before being tragically murdered at the hands of the British. Though this hero has passed on, his vision and dream is carried on by Saor Éire, and under Cathaoirleach O'Donnell, this Socialist dream is finally being realized across the Ruby Isle. We shall endeavor to always honor Connolly as the Father of Free Ireland, and shall continue his ideas of Leftist Nationalism and Agrarian social progress as we continue to free Ireland's proletariat from the chains that bind them."

IRE_Socialist_Irish_Nationalism: "Irish Social Nationalism"
IRE_Socialist_Irish_Nationalism_desc: "Nationalism is a concept that has long been tainted by deluded dreamers and radical ultranationalists, and while many weaker socialists have been led astray by internationalist ideals, we in Ireland know that nationalism and socialism are not contradictory concepts. We shall embrace Irish nationalism fused with our Gaelic language and traditions, supporting the will of the people to be a seperate, independent, and undoubtedly superior state from our neighbors to the East. To that end, we shall aid in the preservation and expansion of Galic culture, restoring and fostering the Irish language, culture, and games."

IRE_RWG_Victory: "Victory of the RWP"
IRE_RWG_Victory_desc: "Ceannasaí, or Boss of the Dáil, James Gralton and his radical group of Communist extremists have won the first elections of the Revolutionary Dáil. The success of the various Revolutionary Workers Groups that once acted independently to achieve a revolution is now apparent, and now united as one, a true Revolutionary Workers' Party can now rise to bring industrialized and urban-focused Marxism to Ireland."
IRE_Renovate_Irish_Culture: "Renovate Irish Culture"
IRE_Renovate_Irish_Culture_desc: "One of Gralton's key beliefs is that Irish culture is inherently Conservative, Traditionalist, and all-around backwards, which has caused Leftism and revolutionary thought to have trouble gaining traction in the past. In order to rectify this reality, Ceannasaí Gralton has pushed for a complete overhaul of Irish culture modeled on modern American 'liberal' Leftist culture and ideas as spouted by the likes of Earl Browder, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr., Meyer London, Gus Hall, and other contemporaries. With a new Irish identity and culture linked to Socialism from the start, there is no way that the Revolution can fail!"
IRE_Campaign_Against_the_Church: "Campaign Against the Church"
IRE_Campaign_Against_the_Church_desc: "Unlike most parties in Ireland, our RWP is vehemently against the Catholic Church. Though we are not an atheistic party outright despite the beliefs of some of our members, we do preach Secularism, and we woefully despise the power the Church and the Pope in Rome has over our island. No longer shall we let a foreign body meddle in the affairs of this red republic, and no longer shall we let them infect the minds and souls of the masses with Conservative nonsense. If Christianity is to survive in Ireland, it must adapt and modernize along with us, lest it fall before the sword of the Revolution."
IRE_New_Red_IRA: "A New, Red IRA"
IRE_New_Red_IRA_desc: "The IRA, though once a proud group of freedom fighters, has fallen to Catholic Nationalism, Capitalist decadence, and stagnating Conservatism, creating a cesspit of reactionary thought and petit bourgeois. Unlike our allies on the Left however, we know the truth is that the IRA is truly too far gone to be saved. Instead of trying to salvage a failed system, we shall create a new form of the IRA, dubbed the Irish Citizens Army after the various Leftist militias that helped fight for our independence. This newly reforged ICA shall defend our island and the Revolution as Ceannasaí Gralton continues to bring about a true Marxist paradise."
IRE_Secret_Police: "Create the CPAI"
IRE_Secret_Police_desc: "While Comrádaí Gralton has worked hard to transform Ireland into a proletarian paradise, many within Ireland still cling to the past, and are determined to resist Gralton's new order at any cost. To alleviate the pressure caused by these traitors, the Ceannasaí has authorized the creation of the Coimisiún an Phobail um Ghnóthaí Inmheánacha, an agency with powers exceeding the power of the regular legal system."

IRE_Gaelic_Socialism: "Gaelic Socialism"
IRE_Gaelic_Socialism_desc: "We shall pursue a policy of Gaelic Socialism, reviving the near-dead Gaelic language and wider Celtic culture and identity while bathing it all in our own shade of red. The beliefs and customs of our ancestors shall be revitalized and modernized, truly making Ireland wholly Irish again while also removing the foul taint of the Anglos."
IRE_Socialist_Language_Equality: "Pursue Language Equality"
IRE_Socialist_Language_Equality_desc: "In order to not distance ourselves from our allies in the Internationale, we shall pursue a policy of language equality between the revived Gaelic language and the English tongue. Both shall be allowed in the nation, taught in schools, and used by the government domestically and internationally, proving to the world that peaceful bilingualism is the way to unity and the Revolution."
IRE_Ruby_Isle: "The Ruby Isle"
IRE_Ruby_Isle_desc: "Ireland is free, and the people rejoice, for the Revolution has bathed this once-Emerald Isle in a shade of wondrous red. From the fingers of County Cork to the islands off County Donegal, from the pristine forests of Cloosh Valley and the placid waters of the Black Lake to the hustle and bustle of Dublin itself, all of Ireland has embraced the Revolution. Our island now stands shining and crimson and the people are finally free in this paradise; a true Ruby Isle that sticks out like a claret pearl amid the dark waves of the Atlantic. Erin go Bragh!"

IRE_Monarchy: "A Monarchist Irish Nation Once Again"
IRE_Monarchy_desc: "Shocking nearly all in the nation, de Valera and his group of Conservatives have come together to recreate the monarchist system of old, not seen in nearly 700 years. Mainly created to serve as a unifying force above the democratic system, this new monarchy shall be a far-cry from the Absolutists on the Continent, but our eventual ruler shall be a king all the same - the uniting figurehead our disparate and divided nation sorely needs. Now, with the groundwork laid, we must decide on the future of this reborn monarchy and all those that shall live under the new crown."

IRE_Irish_Monarch: "An Irish Monarch"
IRE_Irish_Monarch_desc: "Refusing to bend to any foreign king, our monarchist coalition has decided upon crowning a truly Irish monarch. The old Great Clans may have lost their power, but their descendants still fill this land, while many others have installed themselves into the nobility of foreign powers in many centuries the throne has been left vacant. With a truly Irish monarch on the throne, Ireland shall stand proud and strong against all that comes our way as we build a Conservative and pious paradise here under the new High King."
IRE_Legacy_of_High_Kings: "Legacy of the High Kings"
IRE_Legacy_of_High_Kings_desc: "The old High Kings of Ireland, or the Ardrí na hÉireann or simply Ard-Rí, were the greatest among our ancestors. Crowned at the Hill of Tara under the Stone of Destiny, or Lia Fáil, these champions and heroes of old Ireland defended the nation and united the tribes, clans, and people until they were savagely dethroned by the raiding Norsemen during the reign of the last king Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair. Our new Ard-Rí must embody their legacy and learn their history if he is to become a truly noble and wise monarch, and if he is to truly unite the divided Irish people."
IRE_Truly_Irish_Monarchy: "Irish Nationalism Under the Crown"
IRE_Truly_Irish_Monarchy_desc: "Under our truly Irish monarchy, Irish Nationalism shall flourish and spread, for all Irishmen and Irishwomen must have pride in their reborn kingdom. Co-opting the nationlist movements alive and well in the democratic arena, our monarchy shall unite the masses with a shared and prideful identity and culture, ensuring that no foreign ideas or forces come to subjugate the hearts and minds of our people ever again."
IRE_Constitutionalism: "Fate of the Constitution"
IRE_Constitutionalism_desc: "Though de Valera initially envisioned this new monarchist system to merely serve as a unifying force above the democratic process, many radicals within our coalition have pushed to take this one step further, creating a truly monarchist system headed by a powerful king along the lines of Integralist thought. Despised by many, this idea would do away with the old constitution in order to make way for a new one designed entirely around the crown from the start. We must decide on the fate of the Constitution, and in turn, the fate of our political system and government in whole."
IRE_Modernized_Monarchy: "A Modernized Kingdom"
IRE_Modernized_Monarchy_desc: "Under our Irish Ard-Rí, Ireland has managed to keep one foot in our storied past as the other rockets towards modernity and ever-inching progress. Supported by mediated Capitalist economics, modernized but still traditionally-sensitive cultural sensibilities, Valeraian Conservatism, and local democracy, our Kingdom is a shining example of what monarchism can achieve in this modern age. We shine out like a prosperous beacon to the world under the Crown of the Ard-Rí, so let us rejoice, for we have built a paradise like none other here on the Emerald Isle."

IRE_German_Monarch: "A German King"
IRE_German_Monarch_desc: "It is clear that without outside support, Ireland shall fall to invaders, be they from the West across the Atlantic or from the East across the Irish sea. If we wish to remain truly independent, we must align ourselves with the Hegemon of Europe, and to that end we will crown one of their royal sons as our king, earning the favour of the Kaiser and the protection of his mighty fleet, for the good of all Ireland."
IRE_Draw_Closer_to_Germany: "Draw to Germany's Side"
IRE_Draw_Closer_to_Germany_desc: "Now that we have invited the Germans to occupy the Irish throne, it is only natural for us to draw closer to our new ally. The Germans are more than willing to accept our membership into their sphere, granting them greater influence in the Irish Sea and placing the English in a stranglehold, though this might draw us into an inevitable war with the British."
IRE_Prussian_Constitutionalism: "Adapting to Prussian Constitutionalism"
IRE_Prussian_Constitutionalism_desc: "Prussian Constitutionalism is the German federal monarchy system. Under this system, the President of the Federation is automatically the Emperor, who in-turn personally appoints the Chancellor while the legislative Reichstag had its positions filled through popular representative election. Though this system as it is would not work for Ireland, it can be adjusted to more accurately fit what we wanted from our Monarchy. As such, the High King will rule effectively as 'president' of Ireland, overseeing free and fair elections for the legislature and the Taoiseach, who will be doing most of the actual work ruling the country."
IRE_Go_Native: "Going Native"
IRE_Go_Native_desc: "The King had not expected to find Ireland such a comfortable seat to rule over, and now that he has held the crown for some time he has come to see Ireland as his true home. More so, the King has announced his disinterest in returning home to visit Germany, and has come to embrace Ireland as his own native land. He has begun to show an interest in Irish tradition, and has even voiced his interest in learning Gaelic, allowing him to feel more at one with the people he rules over. Furthermore the King has expressed an interest in receiving a true 'Irish' name, to better represent his people and his newfound nation."
IRE_German_Monarch_Irish_Spirit: "German King, Irish Spirit"
IRE_German_Monarch_Irish_Spirit_desc: "German blood may run through his veins, but our High King is as true an Irishman as any laborer in Dublin or farmer in Cork. His spirit is that of a true Irishman, and he has not been shy to show this love of his new homeland and his new kin to all. May all rejoice and prosper, for our kingdom finally has a High King who shall care for the people and protect them as needed, all while truly immersing himself in everything that is good and righteous on our Emerald Isle under the Iron Cross."

IRE_Re_Structure_The_Laws: "Governmental Restructuring"
IRE_Re_Structure_The_Laws_desc: "The creation of a new monarchist system is no easy task, and our administration is just now beginning to realize how daunting of a task this shall be. The entirety of the government must be restructured to account for the Ard-Rí now serving as the Head of State over the Dail and the county offices. From top to bottom, the nation shall be revamped and reorganized, for we are a kingdom once again!"
IRE_Legacy_of_Pearse: "Legacy of Pearse"
IRE_Legacy_of_Pearse_desc: "Patrick Henry Pearse was a beloved poet, political theorist, and revolutionary who helped create our free and independent Ireland before being wrongfully executed by the English dogs. However, Pearse was also known to many as one of the few open monarchists among our Founding Fathers along with Joseph Plunkett, Thomas MacDonagh, and de Valera himself, once predicting that by the year 2006, Ireland would be an Irish-speaking Kingdom under a new Ard-Rí as the head of state. We shall work to honor their legacy and to ensure Pearse's prediction comes true as we work to build the noble kingdom he never got to live to see."

With the IWL's victory in a fair election (or so Larkin claims), the stage is now set to completely replace the Irish system as it stands. The abolition of Irish Capitalism and the formation of the Revolutionary Dáil are the first steps in Ireland's long path towards socialism, however as the broad coalition inches closer towards a complete grasp on power, the further the coalition splinters. On the radical camp are the radical communist James Gralton and Irish Social Nationalist Peadar O'Donnell, who both stand to completely abolish Irish Democracy as we know it. In the more moderate camp are William X. O'Brien and James Larkin, who is the current head of the IWL. Larkin has risen to prominence as the paramount leader of the Irish Left ever since the Labour Party collapsed due to internal disagreements, however with the Red Tide washing over Ireland, the Labour Party has made a stunning comeback, filling the vacuum left by Sinn Féin after its dissolution. Ironically, Sinn Féin was the party that took in many of the Labour Party's supporters when it fell apart, fueling the once defunct party's surge in power. While many more radical elements have denounced the Labour Party's opposition to more 'radical' policies as paramount to treason, it is clear that Larkin may have to begrudgingly work with his old adversary if he wants to keep Ireland from falling to the grips of radicals."

ire.2.d:0 "After countless years of arduous rebellion and weathering oppressive British rule, the Irish people have won their freedom, and their country back. But as one enemy was vanquished, another rose in her place, perhaps yet more dangerous still. Michael Collins sits as President, eager to defend the independence of his nation at any cost, yet his political enemies are many as the 1937 election approaches. Violence between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is rife, while Sinn Féin; while as not popular as the other two, presents itself as a moderate alternative. Ireland is a powder keg, and it's only a matter of time until it explodes. "
ire.2.a:0 "These are turbulent times."

ire.53.t:0 "Problems Up North"
ire.53.d:0 "Edward Carson, the former leader of the Unionist Party, died last year aged 81. He was an extremely divisive figure whilst alive and fled to England when Ireland gained her independence and took back Ulster. He was particularly reviled outside of Ulster for his persecution of beloved Irish poet and author Oscar Wilde. His memory was venerated today by loyalists in the north of Ireland, who held a memorial service in Belfast with several leading members of the UUP speaking in his name. The memorial attracted quite a crowd, showing that Carson still has power even in death. His spectre is looming over Ulster, just as the tensions and threat of rebellion loom over it as well."

ire.5.t:0 "Disgruntled Populace in Ulster"
ire.5.d:0 "For some time now, there has been a slow but surely growing unrest in the northern region of Ireland, Ulster. Stirred up by predominantly Protestant Unionists, who advocate for closer ties with England, Ulster has become something of a problem region for the Dáil. If this situation is not handled carefully, the issues that divide the region are sure to grow more incendiary."
ire.5.a:0 "This is a delicate matter."
ire.6.t:0 "Radical Movements Mobilising"
ire.6.d:0 "In response to what they see as oppressive policies towards the people of Ulster, Unionist organisations are growing more radical and attracting the most disenfranchised and angry Northerners to their cause.

ire.132.t:0 "Riots Dispersed"
ire.132.d:0 "The streets of Belfast have been silenced and there are no riots anymore. Bricks, newspapers and trash litter the sideways as people return to work. However, the people who participated believe they have only lost a battle, not the war. In their work-place, at the pub and at home they whisper of when to strike next, not if."

# Election Events
ire.14.t:0 "The 1937 Elections"
ire.14.d:0 "The time for elections in Ireland has come at last, and with that the people head to the polls to elect Ireland's new government. Unlike every other election in recent memory, Collins is not the overwhelming favourite to win, as Fianna Fail wages a brutal campaign against Collins; denouncing him as a jaded old war hero only kept in power by the weight of his name. Collins has shot back; both refuting these claims, and steadily working to prove to Ireland that he still has policies to bring to the table.\n Meanwhile, Sinn Fein continues positioning themselves as a non-violent and non-radical option compared to Fine Gael and Socialists; receiving a surge in power not seen since the fall of the now-defunct Irish Labour Party.\n Another dark-horse party that has been steadily gaining power is the National Center Party; which has been steadily growing since the economic slump began. While most of the major parties in contention for the seek to preserve Ireland's democratic system as-is, the Socialist Irish Worker League has been steadily gaining power with funding and support from the Union of Britain. The IWL promises to tear down Ireland's current system and usher in a Syndicalist Revolution in the Emerald Isle, and while their chances of winning the elections are very slim, if they manage to pull off a win then it would surely shake the world of Irish Politics to the core; possibly even leading to its end.\n As the votes come in, who has won?"
ire.14.a:0 "Fine Gael party wins once more."
ire.14.b:0 "Brugha and Sinn Fein!"
ire.14.c:0 "De Valera and Fianna Fail!"
ire.14.e:0 "MacDermot and the NCP!"
ire.14.f:0 "The Socialist Broad Coalition edges out a win!"
ire.14.g:0 "No faction manages to gain a majority in the Dáil."

ire.15.t:0 "The Socialists Win!"
ire.15.d:0 "It seems that the Black Monday crisis was too much of a storm for Collins to whether and the Syndicalists have managed to win despite the odds against them. Senior Fine Gael member, Richard Mulcahy has advised Collins to maintain some dignity and step down though Prime Minister O'Duffy has told him to take 'extreme measures' to save Ireland."
ire.15.a:0 "Collins disbands the Oireachtas!"

ire.16.t:0 "Collins Assassinated?"
ire.16.d:0 "With Collins' dissolving the Oireachtas, in the immediate aftermath there have been angry riots from the socialist opposition. In the chaos a disgruntled FF supporter has attempted to assassinate our president! Should he fall, the socialists will no doubt attempt to overthrow the government!"
ire.16.a:0 "Collins is dead and the ICA storm Leinster House!"
ire.16.b:0 "Collins is dead and O'Duffy takes command of Ireland!"
ire.16.c:0 "The would-be assassin is killed and Collins lives!"

ire.250.t:0 "The Fate of Ireland"
ire.250.d:0 "The outcome of Collins' death has resulted in nothing short of disaster for the Irish nation. In the wake of Collins' death, Eoin O'Duffy, Collin's Taoiseach and leader of the Army Comrade Association, better known as the Blueshirts has taken 'temporary' control of Ireland. However with the situation in Ireland deteriorating rapidly, O'Duffy has considered simply handing control of the state to a group eager to restore order to the Emerald Isle. Stepping up with an offer to lead is the the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe or Architects of Resurrection; lead by a curious man named Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin. This movement promises O'Duffy a place in the cabinet if he authorizes them to take charge, an ideal situation for O'Duffy, who desires not leadership but rather a place as a militia leader. Will O'Duffy take the ANH up on their offer?"
ire.250.a:0 "O'Duffy appoints Ó Cuinneagáin and the ANH!"
ire.250.b:0 "O'Duffy takes charge, crushing all in his wake!"

ire.251.t:0 "The Fate of The Government"
ire.251.d:0 "With Collins' control of the Irish state now solidified, the question of how he will govern the nation has been raised. Collins has served as a civilian president for more than 10 years, and many see it fit to continue with Collins' now lifelong presidency; albeit enforced with an iron fist instead of leaving it to the hands of the people in corrupt and fraudulent elections. However, many in Collins' cabinet, namely one Taoiseach Eoin O'Duffy, have suggested dissolving Ireland's civilian government entirely, and formalizing Ireland as a Military Dictatorship under the Irish Republican Army watchful eye. With all powers held within Collins' hands, he is fit to shape Ireland in his vision, no longer abided by the gullible masses, what will our Ceannaire make of the government? "
ire.251.a:0 "Collins elects to replace the Civilian Government with the IRA!"
ire.251.b:0 "Collins solidifies his position as President for Life!"

ire.252.t:0 "Collins steps aside from Politics"
ire.252.d:0 "After Collins' devastating loss in the 1937 elections, the 'Big Fellow' has finally decided to step away from leadership of the party. Taking the hint that the populace of Ireland has grown tired of him, Collins has sworn off politics forever and seeks to maintain a quiet life as a mere officer in the Irish Army. Replacing him as the leader of Fine Gael is Richard Mulcahy, a long-time member of Fine Gael and fellow general and freedom fighter in the Irish Republican Army. This marks the end of an era for Ireland, as Fine Gael begins moving away from being just the 'Party of Collins', and instead as a party dedicated to pragmatic liberalism, Irish unity and defense against English influence. "
ire.252.a:0 "A New face for Fine Gael."

ire.253.t:0 "Forging a Coalition"
ire.253.d:0 "The worst case scenario for Ireland's elections has come to pass; no party has managed to gain a majority in the Dáil. Collins still stands to lead Ireland, but to get any meaningful governing done he must secure the support of another party to sponsor Fine Gael's legislation. While forming a coalition with Fianna Fáil is out of the question, the agrarian National Center Party and the social-democratic Sinn Féin both are open to working with Collins, at the price of concessions to their groups in the form of policies favourable to their ideals. "
ire.253.a:0 "Sinn Féin and Fine Gael form a coalition."
ire.253.b:0 "The NCP and Fine Gael form a coalition."
ire.253.c:0 "No coalition is formed, Fine Gael rules as a minority government."

ire.254.t:0 "Re-Uniting Sinn Féin"
ire.254.d:0 "Sinn Féin's near death was only averted by the death of another party, the former leader of Ireland's radical left: the labour party. And while Sinn Féin has not seized the reins of power in Ireland's 1937 elections, they did manage to save Collins' presidency and forge a coalition with Fine Gael. With Sinn Féin and Fine Gael united in a new spirit of cooperation, some have proposed that Fine Gael and Sinn Féin unify into a single party. Collins was at a time one of Sinn Féin's most powerful members, who would have surely risen to lead if not for Valera casting Ireland's hero of independence out. This reckless movie born out of petty squabbles and jealousy almost doomed Sinn Féin, and once the gravity of Valera's mistake became clear, he left the party to rot. Now, with Valera gone and Sinn Féin and Fine Gael united in a spirit of cooperation, many have proposed re-unifying the two parties with Collins at its head. While Sinn Féin's leader, Cathal Brugha has not always gotten along with Collins, a united coalition of Ireland's moderate left under Collins would prove to be nearly unstoppable, guaranteeing Ireland's safety against the likes of the IWL and Fianna Fáil."
ire.254.a:0 "Time to fix Valera's biggest mistake, re-unite the parties!"
ire.254.b:0 "The SF are allies, however we would prefer to remain separate."

ire.255.t:0 "Absorbing the NCP"
ire.255.d:0 "While the National Center Party is a relatively minor force in Irish politics, the coalition agreement which managed to save Collins' government has given them significant pull in the Dáil. The NCP stands as Fine Gael's main sponsor, and with the alliance forged between the two parties, some have proposed unifying Fine Gael and the NCP into a single party. While the proposed absorption of the NCP into Fine Gael is not universally agreed upon, nobody can deny that a unification between the parties would provide benefit to both. Nobody can deny that the NCP is a minor party, perhaps the best chance of getting their agrarian policies put forward is to hitch their wagon to Fine Gael. "
ire.255.a:0 "The time for the FG to embrace agrarianism has come, unite the parties!"
ire.255.b:0 "The NCP are allies, however we would prefer to remain separate."

With the democratic opposition more or less destroyed since the previous election, Fine Gael has gone in completely unopposed with many seats only having FG on the ballot. As the polls come in, Collins and FG have won every single seat in the Dail and his rule on Ireland has been cemented."
ire.17.a:0 "Another smashing victory for our hero."

ire.21.d.pataut:0 "With the 1947 elections finally arriving, the time has come for Ireland to once again go to the polls. With practically no opposition, Fine Gael has once again won every seat in the Dail and Collins has gave a momentous speech commemorating his victory."

Led by Hugo MacNeill, the commission has presented their initial report. MacNeill believes that, contrary to the claims by Liam Lynch and his soldiers, it was not the Unionist protesters who instigated the fatal clashes with the army. Instead, he believes that Lynch and his men were looking for a fight all along and later planted weapons on dead protesters to give themselves an alibi. If these allegations are true, it's a shocking revelation and may have wide reaching consequences for the IRA."

The wealthier note the lack of democracy as they knew it in the US while the less well off feel that their situation is being exploited by Irish business. Locals also have grievances as they feel the newcomers are stealing jobs from them as well as seeing their cultural traditions as not in keeping with native Irish culture. To top it off Unionists view the immigrants as an attempt by the Republic to colonise Ulster, where many have settled."

# Unionist Protest March
ire.36.t:0 "Unionists Organise Protest March"
ire.36.d:0 "News has spread from Belfast this morning that the Unionists are organising a protest march against what they perceive to be unfair treatment from the government in Dublin. Since Ireland gained her independence, the people of Ulster have become increasingly marginalised and attempts to 'green' up the region and purge the British legacy there have thus far failed. The idea of letting this march go undeterred does not sit well with the majority of the Irish people, or the government. But stopping it may only make the situation worse..."

Her body had obviously been taken some distance from the site of the murder itself. A letter claiming responsibility arrived at the Gardaí headquarters in Belfast, sent allegedly by the Ulster Volunteer Force. The murder appears to have been an act of retaliation for the government's recent decision to ban an attempted Unionist Protest March. News of the murder has spread like wildfire across the nation, and the populace are shocked."

ire.37.t:0 "Unionist Preparations Cause Tensions"
ire.37.d:0 "After a local government representative announced that there would be no official efforts made to prevent the Unionist protest march, local Catholic residents have loudly voiced concerns to the regional Gardaí. They claim that the protest march is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to intimidate the Catholic community in Belfast, who find themselves still partially outnumbered by the Protestant, largely Unionist, majority. The demands have not fallen on deaf ears and there is a growing call for the Irish Republican Army to be deployed along the planned march route to protect the Catholic community and make sure things don't get out of hand."

ire.40.d:0 "Sighs of relief were breathed up and down the country today as the Ulster Unionist Protest March went ahead without any trouble breaking out. Whilst there were concerns that the Unionists may turn their frustration into violence, these fears in the end turned out to go unrealised. Whilst this march has proven to be a contentious affair for the nation, at least it didn't result in any bloodshed today. Nonetheless, the Unionists growing demand for independence can no longer be ignored. There must be decisive action to address the question of Ulster, lest the situation grow out of control."
ire.40.d2:0 "Terrible news has spread throughout the country following the Ulster Unionist Protest March. Whilst it is still difficult to understand the full scale of what happened, it is understood that a conflict broke out between the IRA forces commanded by Eoin O'Duffy, and several of the protesters. The resulting violence left many of the protesters dead at the hands of army rifles, and the incident has quickly set the region of Ulster alight in a furore. Some cry for vengeance, others for justice, but one thing is certain: this is a black day for Ireland."
ire.40.d3:0 "Sighs of relief were breathed up and down the country today as the Ulster Unionist Protest March went ahead without serious trouble breaking out. Under the watchful eyes of the Irish Republican Army commanded by Richard Mulcahy, the protesters were escorted through Catholic regions with only minor incidents taking place. The march has been an extremely contentious affair among the public at large and in politics, and many are glad that it has passed by without any serious issues. However, it's clear that the atmosphere in Belfast is a tense one at the moment, and many Unionists did not take kindly to the presence of the military."
ire.40.d4:0 "Violent scenes marred the Ulster Unionist Protest March today as widespread fighting erupted between Unionist protesters and outraged Catholic citizens. It's unclear who threw the first stone or fired the first shot, but several people have been killed and many more injured. This incident is just another worrying sign of the turmoil quickly starting to grow in the north of Ireland. Truly a black day for the nation."

Led by Richard Mulcahy, the commission has presented their initial report. Mulcahy believes that, contrary to the claims by Eoin O'Duffy and his soldiers, it was not the Unionist protesters who instigated the fatal clashes with the army. Instead, he believes that O'Duffy and his men were looking for a fight all along and later planted weapons on dead protesters to give themselves an alibi. If these allegations are true, it's a shocking revelation and may have wide reaching consequences for the IRA."

ire.43.t:0 "Unionist Workers Clash in Belfast"
ire.43.d:0 "Following the shift in power that occurred when the British were chased out of Ireland, many Catholic business owners rose to prominence in Ulster. However, their rise in socio-economic status came often at cost to the Protestant residents of the region, who had previously enjoyed such unbridled dominance over the Catholic minority. A group of Ulster Unionist factory workers went on strike today citing unfair pay and unwarranted treatment by their Catholic employer. Their strike soon turned violent when they were attacked by what some believe to be hired thugs. Nobody was killed, although Belfast City Hospital had plenty of patients in the immediate aftermath. This will not do the tense situation in Ulster any favours."
ire.43.a:0 "This is worrying."

ire.44.t:0 "Murder in Derry"
ire.44.d:0 "The body of a young man was found this morning in a cold and desolate alleyway near the centre of Derry. According to a follow-up police report, he had been stabbed several times and left for dead. The man was previously known to the local police force as a prominent member of a Unionist volunteers group with local ties in the Waterside. There have already been cries that the murder was committed by a Catholic and that the police will turn a blind eye. However warranted or unwarranted these claims may be, the situation in Ulster is, as ever, volatile."
ire.44.a:0 "Frightening times for Derry."

ire.45.t:0 "Ulster Unionist Party Holds Rally"
ire.45.d:0 "There was a massive turn out this afternoon for a UUP rally held in the city centre of Belfast. Thousands of Ulstermen and women came out in the sunshine to listen to prominent Unionist speakers. There was plenty of time for song and dance, but just as much time for increasingly violent rhetoric regarding the status of Ulster in relation to the rest of Ireland. Whilst the words 'revolt' or 'uprising' might not have been spoken out loud, they were certainly thought. Of great concern to the Irish government will be the sheer number of people attending the rally. Clearly, the Unionist movement enjoys widespread popular support."
ire.45.a:0 "This movement is becoming increasingly popular."

ire.46.t:0 "Concert Hall Attacked in Antrim"
ire.46.d:0 "In the latest shocking incident from Ulster, a concert hall in County Antrim was subjected to a violent attack. Believed to have been carried out by the Protestant dissident group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, the attack saw several members of a Dublin band shot dead, as well as several concert goers. The motivation for the attack is believed to be another act of terrorism against the Irish state, acts that will continue as long as Ulster remains a part of Ireland, according to the movements occasional cryptic communications with the police and the public."
ire.46.a:0 "Awful."

ire.47.t:0 "Reprisal Shootings"
ire.47.d:0 "Seemingly in response to the recent violence carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force, five men with known ties to the group were found dead in a field near a farm twenty miles outside of Belfast. The victims appear to have been executed. It is believed that the men were rounded up during the night and taken together to be killed, although it is unknown at this time who might have orchestrated such an action. The tensions in Ulster are growing as the situation grows more violent, and the Irish government are facing increasing outcry at their apparent inability to address the instability of their nation."
ire.47.a:0 "The cycle of violence continues."

ire.48.t:0 "Craig Speaks Out"
ire.48.d:0 "After several years of inactivity and silence, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party has spoken out regarding the status of Ulster in the Republic of Ireland. James Craig, reported by some to have grown senile in his elder years, appeared lively and in a good mood as he viciously attacked the Irish government in his first major address of such a kind since the ceasefire of 1925. He particularly chastised the current regime and the economic neglect paid towards Ulster during the past decade, and demanded that every son and daughter of Ulster be prepared to fight for the prosperity and, if needs be, freedom of the region."
ire.48.a:0 "He should have kept his mouth shut."

ire.49.t:0 "Belfast City Hall Bombing"
ire.49.d:0 "Terror awaited Belfast as the Belfast City Hall was subjected to a massive bombing that left over fifty people dead and many more injured. The shocking attack appears to be the latest in a long line of escalating UVF attacks, and was carried out during a meeting of local political representatives. Among those killed was Thomas Carlin, local party chief for the National Centre Party. This attack has frightened the nation, and the tension in Ulster has once again reared it's ugly head but this time with devastating consequences."
ire.49.a:0 "The times we live in."

ire.50.t:0 "Grand Opera House Fire"
ire.50.d:0 "Horror at the Grand Opera House in Belfast. Several hundred people had to be evacuated in the midst of the evening's entertainment when a massive fire broke out, consuming much of the historic hall. Thirty-five people are believed to have died in the disaster and the toll could soon rise, with many still reported missing as search efforts comb through the debris hoping to find any signs of life. It is unknown what caused the fire to break out but the government is already being criticised yet again by Ulster Unionists, who claim the incident could have been avoided had the Opera House been refurbished, as a previous request to the government had suggested."
ire.50.a:0 "What a disaster."

ire.51.t:0 "Bank of Ireland Robbery"
ire.51.d:0 "Today in Belfast, the Bank of Ireland was robbed by masked gunmen, believed to be unionist dissidents. The Gardaí are searching for them as we speak, but they are most likely taking refuge and being shielded within the Unionist community."
ire.51.a:0 "Let no man rest until these men are found!"

ire.52.t:0 "Dublin Bombing"
ire.52.d:0 "At 10:30am this morning, a massive explosion went off near the Four Courts in Dublin. Five hundred people are believed dead and many more could follow when an official death count is taken. Two men believed to have been responsible for the bombing were shot dead by the Gardaí as they attempted to flee the scene and put up resistance when asked to stand down. At least one of the men has been identified as a Belfast native with known Unionist ties. This terrifying escalation of the on-going conflict in Ulster is tantamount to a declaration of war upon Ireland and her people, and the public outcry has been enormous. The Irish people are baying for blood, and it is Ulster that may have to pay the price."
ire.52.a:0 "This can't go on."

ire.58.t:0 "Unionists Planning An Uprising?"
ire.58.d:0 "Now that we find ourselves in an unfortunate state of war, there has been an unusual amount of dissent pouring in from the north of Ireland. Ulster Unionists are said to be considering their options whilst the Irish Republican Army is preoccupied with the on-going conflict, and they very well may use this opportunity to try and break free from the Republic. The consequences of such an action could be grave for the nation, as they might very well attempt to align themselves with our enemies and would provide a perfect base for an invasion of Ireland."

However, now that hostile volunteer forces have joined the Republican forces, it would be fair to say that the civil war in Ireland is not necessarily developing to our advantage. If we were to invest any more of our own military even as 'volunteers' then it could be seen as a direct act of war by our hostile neighbours in Europe and across the Atlantic.

This is another clear attempt by the Union of Britain to steal Ireland back through a Unionist puppet.

Many scramble to find solutions, most parties proposing either Irish economic development or maintaining stability while the German economy recovers.

Collins has declared that must be dealt with; and with an iron grip on the state, Collins is in a position to deal with this traitor once and for all. Thus, Ceannaire Collins' has ordered Valera's political party, Fianna Fáil to be dissolved and banned, and for de Valera himself to be placed under arrest.\n Unfortunately, Valera seems to have been a step ahead of Collins, as he had fled to America mere days before the police were set to haul him off to prison. While having Valera lost to a land beyond the waves is not ideal, the chaotic situation in America is nowhere close to comfortable for the disgraced rebel Valera. Despite losing Valera, he has been dealt with in a fitting matter, and now the most major democratic opposition to Collins' has been thoroughly removed.

Luckily President Collins saw through the Syndicalist false election and intervened; keeping Ireland safe from the British and the reds. With the the true results of the election being uncovered, we have found that Collins had been the true winner, gaining the vast majority of the vote from the public.\n\n Collins has organized a election security task force, ensuring that elections in the future are safe from the influence of subversive forces and threats to Ireland's independence."

However, as Ireland falls to radicalism and authoritarianism once more, our old friend De Valera has returned to our newly independent state, seeking refuge and respite like we offered to his ancestors all those years ago.

However, we could choose to pick up the scraps of the peerage system in order to truly pay homage to our ancestors by recreating the old Clan system, dividing our society up in Clans that administer their designated areas, cooperate with each other through trade and services, and that pay tribute and send military aid to Ceannaire Ó Cuinneagáin should he need it as he runs the national government and his own highest Great Clan.

Led by the 'Three Macs' - Tony Magan, Paddy McLogan, and Tomás Óg Mac Curtain - the new SF has taken a right-ward shift, embracing a fusion of ANH-inspired Corporatism pulling from the Papal Encyclicals of Pope Pius XI, as well as from the Integralist ideas of Portugal's Estado Novo movement, with radical Christian nationalism and their own decentralized Left-wing socioeconomic positions. Far from the first time the ANH has taken inspiration from the Left, with ANH founder Ó Cuinneagáin already pulling ideas from American progressives such as Fiorello La Guardia and the Roosevelts, many have pushed for our party to ally with these newly reformed 'Right-wing Leftists', while others still spit in their direction with disdain over their so-called 'crypto-Syndicalist' ideas.

Ó Cuinneagáin has fired back at these groups with full fury, decrying the ideals of monarchism as insane and outdated, and declaring his intention to dismantle all systems of aristocracy in Ireland. O'Neill is not the first person to attempt to sway the ANH towards the idiotic ideals of Monarchism, Raymond Moulton O'Brien has also made feeble attempts to claim the Irish throne, attempts that were met with nothing but ridicule and mockery.

The hall was also used as a makeshift Dáil Court, which was often used around Ireland to counter the British legal system, often to settle matters such as land disputes. Tragically, the hall was burnt down in 1932, and as Gralton was deported not a year later, he never had a chance to rebuild. However, with Gralton's exile ending once Ireland embraced the red glow of socialism, he was given a golden opportunity to rebuild his beloved hall. And while he had previously been too wrapped up in executive matters to attend to its re-construction, today the Ceannasaí has ordered a building crew into Effrinagh, where they will rebuild the hall just as it stood. While the hall's reconstruction was met with jubilation from Republicans, farmers, and trade unionists, several priests within the area decried the hall as a 'den of prostitution and syndicalism', and rallied several local citizens in a protest against it; quickly leading to violent indicents. Following these protests, Gralton ordered the local red guard to capture all who were part of these incidents, and to find the local priests responsible for the agitation and swiftly imprison them."

Gralton's first stay in the United States saw him working as a taxi driver and bartender, it was in America where he first became immersed in American culture, eventually coming to the belief that the only way Ireland would ever accept socialism would be if Ireland's inherently conservative culture was completely replaced with an American model. Now that Gralton is in power, he has the power to put his radical plan into action; and while there has been significant resistance to Gralton's 'Irish Social Revolution, even within the traditionally revolutionary IRA, there is no doubt that with the Ceannasaí in charge, Ireland will never be the same again"

The newest one of these factions is greatly inspired by the theory of 'Popular Communism' which has been pioneered by the Socialist Party of America's Earl Browder. While remaining mostly loyal to orthodox Marxist teaching, Popular Communism seeks to unite the entire Left in a single front, both to increase the Party's own popularity but also to end any infighting within the Left, and to hype focus the entirety of the Proletariat against its oppressors. Due to this, and due to our own ties with the SPA, the faction has reached quite the popularity.

However, many within her ranks have pushed for Sinclair to not only be made a major cabinet member of the government, but further push to have her made executive of the nation.

Tragically, Larkin's rally was cut short, as the stage Larkin was delivering his speech on collapsed due to shoddy construction, killing Larkin along with 10 others. The death of Larkin along with several other high ranking members of the IWL has killed most of the movement's momentum, as various factions tear the party apart as they jockey for leadership.

Getting involved with the Gaelic revival as a young man and later using it as his entry-point into politics, de Valera as since served as an independence hero and freedom fighter, narrowly avoiding execution at the hands of the British and since rising to lead the largest Conservative Republican party in Ireland in Fianna Fáil, and now leading the nation itself. Throughout it all however, de Valera has remained close to his two other homelands of America and Spain, and has kept close contacts with surviving family and friends, as well as new allies, in both locales, even remaining in contact with the St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Jersey City, New Jersey in which his parents were married and the church he himself was baptized at.

Though at the time we were trapped under the British heel, even with the great effort they expended they were unable to find the Jewels, once we gained our freedom, our Fledgling Republic had much more to worry about than finding some shiny regalia and fancy stars. However, the lack of the stones has become something of an embarrassment to the new Monarch, who has expressed a strong desire to see the stones found and restored to their rightful place as a new symbol of Irish unity under the Crown. Of course we could invest a great deal of time and effort in finding the Original Jewels, dedicating our entire Police force to the job, though who knows how long this could take and perhaps the Jewels have been taken from Ireland entirely, It is also an option to simply forge new Crown Jewels, free of British taint and truly Irish.

With little to no will to lead whatsoever, Uilliam goes about his days reading endless books on various pseudoscientific topics while tinkering with his own dubious research into UFOs and the wider unknown. Where our government's current dilemma lies is how much influence in the runnings of the government should we allot the King? No matter our decision, democratic elections shall always run within the Dáil and the lower governments across the counties, but if we were to allow King Uilliam's eccentricities to have an effect on the government, we could allow our monarchy to outwardly reflect its esoteric nature.

Close with his allies in Iberia, and a born and raised aristocrat, High King Luitbald may have Irish blood and noble legitimacy, but he is far from a true Irishman. Despite this foreign nature, de Valera and Fianna Fáil throw their support behind this Spanish aristocrat, for de Valera has friendly ties to his family, and his position as king grants us friendly relations with another relatively powerful and relatively neutral power in Spain.

With such blood legitimacy, High King Brian II has been seen by many as the rightful High King, or even rightful Emperor, and as such, he has tried to flex the muscles of the Crown on more than one occasion. Though still bound by constitutionalism, King Brian has tried time and time again to rule as a more and more absolute monarchy, wishing to guide his people in the way he sees best and fit. Despite these ambitions, he is a noble leader, caring for his people and working with the democratic government in the Dáil in order to create a better Ireland while fostering Gaelic revivalism and Irish independence more than most.

Taking a great interest in the culture of his adopted homeland, this Prince of Hohenzollern has begun activity taking part in Irish culture. Oft found in any number of pubs in Dublin or playing football with his loyal subjects, His Royal Highness also begun learning Gaelic, although he is still far from being a master of it. Indeed, His Worship has proved to be quite the popular monarch. What's more, His Grace has taken a page from his brother Adalbert's playbook, and has undergone conversion to Catholicism of his own volition. Despite him converting mainly to further endear himself to his people, his wife has not seen it this way. Refusing to fall to the 'barbarity of Rome,' Her Royal Majesty formally filled for divorce, which the King had little choice but to accept. Viewing this as an opportunity to endear himself to the people of Eire, the King declared that he will be seeking the hand of an Irish noblewoman, although further details beyond this have not been released to the public.

While less dramatic than, say imposing a Monarchy on a nation such as America, the people of Ireland have still been greatly affected by this change in governmental structure. With this rapid change, many have begun finding things of the past to latch onto, in hopes of having some sort of normality. Once such structure of the past is that of the Irish Honours system and the Order of St. Patrick. With formal honors being abolished upon the declaration of the Republic and the Order of St. Patrick existing in a state of limo since the British fled to Canada, with the Monarchical order returning to Ireland many are expecting the return of this aspect of the old order. With the Peerage system itself seeing a return, many are expecting the same of the honours system, to make an example of those who prove themselves to the King and Ireland. However, many of the various Republican parties, themselves having sworn oaths of loyalty more or less to the new Monarch, have expressed distraught over the proposed reconstruction of the honours system. While agreeing that showing merit is indeed a good thing, they believe that the existing system of medals is more than enough, and that by restoring something like the honours system we would be one step closer to tyranny. Even more, by restoring the Order of Saint Patrick, we would in essence be creating a rival Order, as nominally it still exists among the Exiles in Canada. Either way, it remains the sole choice of His Majesty if such a system should be rebuilt."

With war seemingly on the horizon and a want for some kind of plan to deal with the British in want, the plan has been adopted, with the intension being to expand the idea into a general plan for dealing with the various treasures of the British. With the draft already being accepted, another small group has proposed that we actually adopt the flag of '16 as the national flag. While having less impact than the tricolor, the proclamation flag is still a very powerful symbol, if not more powerful in some cases, for those who fight for Ireland. If we were to adopt the flag, it would be a clear sign to the Brits and their ilk that we shall not rest until our freedom is truly secure.

The first Pan-Celtic congress was held in 1839, and carried on into the early 1900s, but with the start of the Weltkrieg the movement lost most of its followers to political squabbling. Now that Ireland is once again stable and unified, there are calls from prominent Pan-Celtic speakers such as Ruaraidh Erskine and Wendy Wood, calling for the gathering of a 4th Pan-Celtic conference where all members of the Celtic speaking world would be invited to discuss who would be granted access to this prospective 'Celtic Union'. Though Erskine himself has declared he only supports a union between Ireland and Scotland other prominent voices such as the Breton Author Camille Le Mercier d'Erm and the Breton Druid Taldir have called for all Celts regardless of location be admitted into the Union, though this would no doubt draw the fledgling union into conflict with European powers."

However, the Pan Gaelic voices in the government are pressing for an answer as to how the Local Pictish traditions shall be treated. The Picts were a group who occupied Scotland and northern England before the spread of Gaelicism from Ireland. In the Early 11th Century, however, the local Picts merged with Irish Immigrants and invaders and formed a true Gaelic identity. Our occupation has given us the opportunity to embrace the long extinct Picts as Celtic brothers, perhaps gathering some sympathy from the more remote Scots, some of whom still feel a strange relation to their Pictish ancestors.

Panic spread among the ranks of the squad, and soon two other soldiers ran off in different directions, being similarly explosive and meaty fates. It would seem that the ruling regime were employing fragmentation 'bouncing betty' mines against their foes, mining off critical areas with bombs designed to bounce up to waist level before detonation for maximum maiming effect. There have been rumors of traitors to the regime being executed by being tied to landmines before detonation, but to mine your own homeland to such an extent was previously unthinkable, and yet, here these traitors were, being blasted to fleshy bits.

In an effort to avoid our various distillers from taking shortcuts and ruining what has the chance to turn into a truly unique national industry, factions within the government have proposed that we offer the distillers a small lump sum. Hoping that the money could be used to expand their operations without compromising their processes, these factions believe that while in the short term little return could be expected, in the long term the boon could far out way the cost. A smaller portion of these same factions wish for us to also subsidize farmers whom grow Rye, Wheat and other various grains used to make whiskey, to ensure that the expanded distilleries aren't left without stalk to make their mashes with.

Modeled after our own Free State, this plan calls for the creation of a State that is for technically part of Ireland proper, just with an unprecedented level of autonomy. Finally, the most radical solution calls for us to give the Anglo a taste of his own medicine.

People have begun to attend the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass daily, feast days that once were a mainly secular affairs have once again taken on a religious atmosphere, among many other things. Along with this, Catholicism's influence on the political realm has also greatly expanded, as fringe Catholic groups once relegated to obscurity have seen a massive uptick in popularity. Once such grouping is Maria Duce or With Mary as our Leader, led by Father Denis Fahey. While the group itself is small, even an uptick in popularity, their leader is far from it. Father Fahey has become something of a local legend when it comes to his writings on Christ the King, specifically the Social Kingship of Christ. While a complex topic, in essence the Social Kingship of Christ calls for the Kingship of Christ to be recognized on the temporal level. Demanding that all governments conform themselves to Christ's teachings, the teaching calls  for the Catholic Church and her teachings to be the supreme law of the land, regardless if that land is Catholic or not. On a personal level, Father Fahey is known to be an avid anti-Semite, oft declaring 'we must combat Jewish efforts to permeate the world with naturalism. In that sense, as there is only one divine plan for order in the world, every sane thinker must be an anti-Semite.'\n\nDespite this, there have been some calls from within the government to embrace Fahey's teachings, which indeed are preeminent in terms of Christ's Kingship. With us being a Catholic nation by decree, surely we must take this to it's logically conclusion. Others, oft of a more leftist or secular bent, believe that Fahey, for both his radical interpretation of Catholicism and anti-semitism, should be censured and Maria Duce itself banned. Others simply want us to leave this recluse of a Priest alone, and simply ignore the more radical trends within Catholicism. In any case, Father Denis Fahey is possibly Christ the King's strongest solider and he shall continue to be, regardless of our actions."

ire.356.d:0 "As every year on the 24th of April, the Irish people gathered together as one, to celebrate and mourn the Rising in 1916. Despite having been a nominally failure, it was the rising that gave birth to Free Ireland, and all but Ulster view the day with great reverence. This year, being the 20th anniversary of the Rising, was home to much more grand festiveness than usual. This being the case, very few took note of the posting, all around Ireland, of a proclamation by a group claiming to be the 'Executive Council of the Second Dáil.' Chaired by Seán Ó Ceallaigh, himself an elected member of Ireland's second Dáil, the group transferred their 'legitimate authority' to what they call the 'Army Council of the Irish Republican Army' as was their right as per a resolution based by the First Dáil. Of course, when the day was done, people did finally start to take note of such a strange proclamation. Nothing was expected to come of such an odd occurrence. However, with just a few weeks past it's posting, the 'Army Council' has issued an ultimatum to our government, which they consider to still be the Free State.\nActing less as an ultimatum and more like a manifesto, the document, sent in an unmarked letter, details in brief the 'legitimacy' of the Army Council, explains their aims and finally concludes with demands. The Army Council explains their legitimacy by stating that they represent the final remnants of the Irish Republic proclaimed in 1916. They claim that they can trace their legacy to the IRA's splitting upon the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. With those against the Treaty carrying on the fight, even when Collins declared an end to the Free State upon the British Revolution. As for the so-called 'Executive Council,' they are made up of members of the Second Dáil, and with the Second Dáil never formally dissolving itself, they claim to carry on it's mission. The Army Council's goals are simple, the complete abolishing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and everything associated with it, and the reestablishment of the 'true' Republic of '16.\nDespite these quite grandiose claims, the IRA even with the support of the 'Executive Council' are quite fringe. Although this position did once share some popularity, mostly among Sinn Féin. With a 32 country Ireland finally free however, almost all popular support dried up. Even Sinn Féin dropped their support in it's most recent Ardfheis, although this did cause a split in the Party, wherein Seán Ó Ceallaig, Party President, along with few others left in defiance.\n\nDue to it's almost nonexistent popular support, a majority of those within the government believe that such an ultimatum will lead nowhere, and suggest that our current measures are more than enough. However, a few believe that we should ramp up anti-terrorism measures, before more civilians get hurt or worse. A very small minority actually believe we should sit down and work out some kind of deal. After all, if we can become the 'true' Republic, there will be nothing left to fight for. Either way, Collins is expected to make a decision soon, lest the already tense situation get even worse."

The agreement, officially called the Belfast Agreement due to the meetings taking place in Ulster's capital, in essence answers every objection that the Army Council had against the Republican government. First and foremost, the Republic of Ireland, declared by President Collins using the machinery of the Free State and considered by the IRA to in nature still be the Free State, shall be completely dissolved. In it's place, the Irish Republic, declared in 1916 and continue on by the IRA, shall be given control of Ireland. Secondly, the Anglo-Irish Treaty, itself already discarded in all but name by the Republic, shall be declared null and void. Thirdly, a caretaker government, headed by Collins as a show of goodwill but made up of members of the Army Council along with a quorum of the Dáil shall rule over the Republic until the 1937 elections. Fourthly, the Seanad Éireann shall be temporarily dissolved, however the body shall reform following the up-and-coming 1937 elections. Fifthly, every law passed by the various Dáils of the 'Free State' shall be adopted by the Irish Republic, although following the 1937 elections, the Dáil shall be the Third, to coincide with the Second finally closing. Finally, the IRA and our own Defense Forces shall be merged, and the leadership of both shall combine.\n\nWhile in effect, very little will truly change, in the minds of these 'legitimists,' Ireland shall be under it's rightful government. Even despite this, the agreement has yet to be ratified by the Dáil, as many few it as a needless and worthless change to win over such a small amount of the population. As the debate within the Irish parliament comes to a close, it appears that..."

As part of the reunion, the break off led by Seán Ua Ceallaigh has formally dropped it's process of abstentionism.  While the process was mainly painless, the exact details of the reunification are a bit puzzling. Both parts of the Party, in their statements of reunion, welcomed the other half back into the fold. The reason for this strange wording is due to the fact that both claimed to be the true Sinn Féin party. Regardless of this strange wording, with the two halves reunited, Sinn Féin is bigger and stronger then ever."

ire.359.d:0 "Today from atop Áras an Uachtaráin, President Michael Collins declared that the Republic of Ireland had been formally dissolved. Far from being a coup or Revolution, the Republic dissolving comes as a result of the Belfast Agreement, a treaty between Collins' government and a remnant of the Irish Republican Army. In the agreement, the Republic of Ireland was to be formally dissolved, replaced by the original Irish Republic declared in 1916 during the Easter Rising, which the IRA claimed to be the legitimate heirs of. The newly reestablished Irish Republic has been given a caretaker government, made up of members of the IRA Army Council whom decided to allow Collins to remain President, at least until the 1937 Irish elections. Exactly what is going to change in Ireland as a result of the Belfast Agreement, remains to be seen."

While the collection was not left unharmed by the British Revolution, some of the most valuable artifacts fled to Canada with the Exiles, it still remains one of the world's largest collection of historical items. With the museum now falling into Irish hands however, the fate of this house of history has come into debate. Quite a large faction within the government believe that we should return these artifacts to their rightful owners and convert the museum into one that tells the story of British Imperialism. While such an undertaking would be no doubt greatly expensive, the nations of the world could rejoice, not only for their lost items, but for the destruction of one of the final remnants of the old Empire. Others believe, much to the shock of the Irish Left, that we should not only keep the Museum, but bring the treasures home to Dublin. After all, no matter their old owners, they are ours by right of conquest, not to mention the prestige we could gain by being home to these items. Other still think we should simply leave the Museum alone. Why should we bother ourselves with matters of a dead nation? Besides, if the true owners want them, they can simply ask for them back. In any case, the British Museum's fate is just one more question to be answered on England's legacy, and answer it we shall."

ire_monarch.1.t:0 "On the Fate of the Irish Republic"
ire_monarch.1.d:0 "President de Valera has long stood for Irish independence, conservatism, nationalism, and unity, but has internally struggled over one detail: the debate of republicanism versus monarchism. Usually a proponent of Republican Democracy, de Valera has been known to support the ideas of Parliamentary Monarchism based on a modernized form of the former High Kingship that would serve as a unifying force over a democratic government with most of the power. With de Valera and Fianna Fáil firmly in control of Ireland now by democratic mandate, he must decide if Fianna Fáil is to guide Ireland towards Conservative Republicanism or Conservative Constitutional Monarchism."
ire_monarch.1.a:0 "The Republic has stood for long enough. Prepare for the Monarchist restoration!"
ire_monarch.1.b:0 "An Irish Monarchy? how insane...We stand with Republicanism."

ire_monarch.2.t:0 "A Candidate for the Throne"
ire_monarch.2.d:0 "Now that the debate over monarchism has ended, it has come time to decide where that Monarch will come from. Though a majority of the voices in the government under Fianna Fáil have called for an Irish monarch for an Irish kingdom, some dissenters - inspired by Patrick Pearse's legacy - have offered an alternative, warning that Ireland may not be able to stand against the Syndicalist powers of Britain and France, let alone against the Plotting Monarch in Canada across the sea, without foreign protection. To this end, Fianna Fáil has selected Prince Joachim of Prussia, the sixth son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, as a possible candidate for the throne. Joachim does not speak English, and some hope that his complete lack of ties to the Anglos will allow us to influence his government towards the de-anglicisation of Ireland, and perhaps the entire Isles. This fusion of Irish monarchy with Prussian Constitutionalism would allow for Ireland to seek protection under the Kaiser's watchful eye. Though this would, naturally, require us to reject a Native candidate, which is the most popular alternative. Some have voiced their fears that picking Joachim would be selling Ireland to the Germans, and that German occupation will be no better than the English; of course this is but fear-mongering, and appropriate balances will be placed on the monarchy, assuring that the King is merely a representative of Ireland on the world stage. Should we go with the plan of crowning a German monarch, or is a native High King what Ireland truly needs to maintain its hard-fought freedom?"
ire_monarch.2.a:0 "Pearse was right, we need German protection, choose Prince Joachim."
ire_monarch.2.b:0 "We don't need a Kraut on the throne, choose an Irish Candidate."

ire_monarch.3.t:0 "An Irish King"
ire_monarch.3.d:0 "Now that we have chosen to choose a native Irish High King, we must now pick a specific monarch. Many of the Great Clans still have surviving bloodlines among the non-Anglo nobility, and so we must choose one of these fine souls to lead us as the new High King of Ireland. De Valera himself personally prefers the father of an old friend, Leopoldo O'Donnell y Vargas, who hails from the Clan O'Donnell and was born in Spain and has since fallen in with the Carlist movement. His appointment would likely tie us to the foreign affairs of the Spanish, but would grant us a strong Catholic ally. Opposing him, loudly by his supporters, is Hugo José Jorge O'Neill, of the Clan O'Neil. Born and raised in Portugal, this Irish-Portuguese noble has strong ties to Lisbon's Estado Novo and Catholic Luso-Integralist movements, being the main pusher of Integralist ideology in Ireland and introducing de Valera and the rest of Ireland's monarchists to the concept. \n\nWidely seen as the most legitimate candidate, Donough O'Brien stands between these two bickering foreign nationals, who some profess only carry half-Irish blood. O'Brien of Clan O'Brien is the direct descendant of Brian Boru, greatest of the old High Kings that topped the O'Neill dynasty, ended the Viking invasion of Ireland, and established his dynasty own that would last for over five centuries, cementing himself as the oen of the greatest Irish leaders in history. As his sire, Donough O'Brien is beloved by Irish Nationalists across the Emerald Isle. The dark horse candidate of the race is William Francis Brinsley Le Poer Trench, 8th Earl of Clancarty, 7th Marquess of Heusdem. A member of the Dutch nobility, and of the Clan MacCarty, he has every right to be king, but he has little interest in ruling. Instead, Trench adores the occult and the strange, having a passion for UFOlogy and other esoteric pseudosciences. Ireland has a long tradition of electing its king from among the Great Clans, so let this election begin!"

ire_monarch.4.t:0 "A Slight Problem"
ire_monarch.4.d:0 "An issue has arisen with Joachim of Prussia that no one had taken into account. As the Ruling king of Georgia, some have warned that it would be far too much of a strain on the Man to name him king of both; considering the extreme distance between Ireland and Georgia, it would be unreasonable to expect him to be able to effectively occupy the crowns of both separate countries at once. To this end the Government has instead suggested offering the crown to Oskar of Prussia, the older brother of Joachim, who would be less burdened by the crown than his younger brother. Of course, we don't have to reject Joachim simply because he is already king; it's not as if he will be actively required for day-to-day ruling regardless. However, there is a third option, forming a personal union between the two kingdoms of Georgia and Ireland; though the two crowns have little in common; this merger would allow Joachim to rule both countries from whichever country he resides in, and would further integrate Ireland into the crowns of Europe."
ire_monarch.4.a:0 "We don't want to put stress on the King, choose Oskar instead."

Our independence is assured, so long as we remain strong, resolute, and determined to Ireland and our freedom above all else.

Here, at this hallowed and ancient site used by generations upon generations of our ancestors, the new High King [root.getleader] has been crowned in a ceremony fusing modern Irish Catholicism with Gaelic and Druidic motifs, creating a syncretic fusion of Ireland's unique culture to be protected and spread by this new Ard-Rí.

ire_monarch.9.t:0 "An Irish-Welsh Union?"
ire_monarch.9.d:0 "Through sheer coincidence it appears as if Prince Oskar of Prussia has been chosen independently by two Celtic countries to rule over it. With both Ireland and Wales naming the 5th son of Kaiser Wilhelm II as their monarch, though the Irish initially passed over Oskar's brother Joachim for the throne as he already had his own crown; it has come to both the Irish and Welsh legislatures attention that King Oskar of Wales and Ireland has expressed a desire to merge his two kingdoms into one, allowing for more effective rulership. In this situation both Welsh and Irish legislatures would remain separate, but would be unified as one kingdom under Oskar. This would no doubt please some of the few Pan-Celtic voices left within the government of both nations, and would naturally allow for a more prosperous state than if both kingdoms operated independently. Though of course some within both states are concerned that the king will favor one kingdom over the other, and would feel more comfortable if the kingdoms remained firmly separate, though maintaining friendly relations."

Once plotting to overthrow the government of the Republic in order to create a monarchist system that would guarantee Irish independence, the group at one point has suggested numerous different kings, such as Joachim Hohenzollern and Juan O'Donnell, but eventually landed upon the heir of the O'Neill dynasty. However, with the rise of de Valera's monarchist movement, the IMS has largely lost their purpose and way, with the group splintering and dissolving over many different ideas. This large coalition of likely allies could easily bolster our movement, but their links to Far-Right ideology and radicalism may harm our movement's public appearance. How should we handle them?"
ire_monarch.11.a:0 "Allow them to integrate into our movement, but keep their radical ideas at a distance."

ire_monarch.12.t:0 "The True Legacy of Griffith Restored"
ire_monarch.12.d:0 "With Sinn Féin winning the most recent elections under the restored Irish monarchy, the true original position of Sinn Féin and our founder Arthur Griffith has been achieved, somewhat. Formed in 1905 by Griffith and other Leftist Revolutionaries, Sinn Féin originally sought to create a monarchist-republican fusion inspired by the politics and organization of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Seeking to create an Anglo-Irish dual monarchy that would put Ireland on equal footing with the English, Sinn Féin pursued this idea as the best conceivable path to Irish Home Rule at the time. Naturally this plan later fell apart, with the plan only being accepted by the Irish masses so long as Sinn Féin promised to never crown a Windsor monarch, but even with these promises, the movement would die out, and Sinn Féin itself would be split over the growing Republican faction and the dwindling monarchists in the coming years, further weakening their position as de Valera and Collins made their rises. However, with our democratic victory under this new Crown, we have fulfilled the wishes of Griffith and early Sinn Féin all without bending to the English pigs. Finally, our original purpose is fulfilled, and now we shall lead Ireland into greatness."

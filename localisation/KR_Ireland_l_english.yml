### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MICHAEL_COLLINS_DESC:0 "Michael Collins is the saviour and national hero of Ireland, with wide scale popularity keeping him in power. Born in Cork, Collins fought in the 1916 Easter Rising and afterwards became the president of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. During the war he organised the IRA into an effective guerrilla force, seeking to avoid the mistakes of 1916. In 1921 he was sent to negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Although by threatening to continue the war with German backing he was able to acquire all thirty-two counties in the treaty, he was unable to secure a republic, with the British fearing that an independent Irish republic would immediately become a German base. When he was expelled from Sinn Féin by Éamon de Valera he managed to form his own party, Fine Gael, which quickly overtook Sinn Féin in popularity. After the British Revolution he declared an independent Republic of Ireland and defeated a Unionist uprising in Ulster. Now with another war approaching Collins advocates revitalising Ireland's economy and military in order to assert Ireland's independence."
POLITICS_CATHAL_BRUGHA_DESC:0 "Born Charles William St. John Burgess of mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage, and later changing his name after joining the Gaelic League, Cathal Brugha is a war hero from the Easter Rising and leader of the rump Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He, already being a staunch rival of Collins during the War of Independence, became leader of the democratic opposition, a coalition of democratic parties opposing Collins, although he has increasingly become a figurehead to rally around in his old age as a new generation rises in the Republican movement. He and his party, bolstered in strength by many ex-Labourites following the party's collapse, advocate a social democratic Ireland as per the Democratic Programme of 1919, and a pro-German alignment to oppose Ireland's enemies in Britain and Canada."
POLITICS_FRANK_MACDERMOT_DESC:0 "Frank MacDermot is the youngest son of Hugh O'Rorke MacDermot, the Prince of Coolavin. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps during the Weltkrieg. Afterwards, he emigrated to America only to return to Ireland after the American economic collapse, and joined the anglophile National Centre Party, eventually becoming its leader due to his great oratory skills. A persistent critic of both the Collins' government and the democratic opposition's sympathies towards isolationism or Germanophilia, he is a strong advocate of a pro-Entente policy and rapprochement with the Unionist community."
POLITICS_JIM_LARKIN_DESC:0 "James Larkin, born in England before moving with his family to Ireland grew up in poverty and became a trade union organiser; eventually forming the Labour Party with James Connolly, most famously participating in the failed Dublin Lockout of 1913. After the failure of the lockout, he moved to America and became a member of the Socialist Party of America. Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists; eventually taking control of the IWL, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand. The Labour Party eventually fell apart, and Larkin split off to form the IWL, eventually going on to win the 1937 election. The Irish Citizen Army suffered dear for their loyalty, with their role in the Easter Rising being erased from the official history and their founder James Connolly's role downplayed."
POLITICS_GEAROID_O_CUINNEAGAIN_DESC:0 "Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin is a radical Irish language scholar, born in Belfast to a middle-class Catholic family, he joined the Army Comrades Association and managed to work his way up to Minister for Justice of Ireland as a result of his charisma, leadership and radical ideas which attracted the interest of ACA leader Eoin O'Duffy. As Minister for Justice, he passed laws repressing syndicalism as well as anti-traveler settlement laws against the Pavee community, as well as using his influence to encourage the Irish language. He also maintained links with the Romanian Iron Guard, expressing sympathy for establishing a similar regime in Ireland. To this end, he formed his own party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe that would revive the Irish language, ban the English language after a period of five years, and establish strong anti-syndicalist policies."
POLITICS_PADRAIC_O_MAILLE_DESC:0 "Pádraic Ó Máille was one of the founding members of Sinn Féin and a member of the Irish volunteers, and leader of the radically Catholic and anti-syndicalist Irish Christian Front, supporting Catholic corporatism and an alliance with the Spanish Carlists. As a result of his anti-syndicalist views, he almost fell victim to an assassination attempt by the ICA in 1932, but managed to survive despite being badly wounded."
POLITICS_SEAN_LEMASS_DESC:0 "Seán Lemass was a volunteer during the Easter Rising and War of Independence and rose to become the head of the CPNH party, another breakaway party following the decline of Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish treaty. Lemass is an advocate for industrialisation and while he is a believer in capitalism, he also believes that normalising relations with the Union of Britain could have a beneficial effect on Irish trade and the economy. He is in favour of a flexible Irish foreign policy depending on the nation's needs, contrasting the CPNH from the other democratic parties who have their own biases in regards to Irish foreign policy."
POLITICS_DE_VALERA_DESC:0 "Eamon de Valera, born in New York to a Spanish father and Irish mother and taken to Ireland at the age of two, was a commander in the Easter Rising and a political leader during the War of Independence, however ending up slipping into political irrelevancy due to some poor political moves and misfortune following the Anglo-Irish treaty, having expelled Michael Collins from the Sinn Féin party despite Collins' incredible popularity, and then left SF himself later due to the influx of ex-Labourites into the party after the collapse of the Labour Party as well as disputes with nationalists preferring a pro-German alignment which were in contrast with de Valera's belief in isolationism and neutrality. His breakaway party, Fianna Fáil, ultimately failed to be a success, becoming a minor party in the democratic opposition..."


POLITICS_ERNIE_O_MALLEY_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! May 26th, 1897, in Castlebar, Co. Mayo, Ireland\n§YAlso known as:§! Earnán Ó Maille\n§YPolitical Career:§! Now that Ireland has moved the office of President into a ceremonial role, it was perhaps evitable that those who now fill the role would be chosen more for their ability to serve as figureheads than make executive decisions. Ernie O'Malley was able to fit that criteria.\n\nA notable figure during the War of Independence, in the years that followed, the County Mayo man left the armed forces and became one of Ireland's best known and most read authors, penning a number of much-loved novels about the revolutionary period and the years that followed. Well respected across Irish society, O'Malley has the rare ability to be able to converse with the rich, the poor, the urban, the rural and everyone in-between.\n\nA complex figure, to some he is known as a well-travelled bohemian lover of art and an intellectual, sympathetic to the labour movement, to others an advocate for speaking Irish, Gaelicism and the \"Gentleman Farmer\" lifestyle, so cherished by agrarians and traditionalists.\n\nO'Malley's broad appeal made him a successful presidential candidate, but it should not be taken to mean he's not without moment of controversy; from time to time he's known to remind the establishment of his habit of making forceful comments, often creating much conversation and analysis in the Irish media."
POLITICS_KATHLEEN_CLARKE_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! April 11th, 1878, in Limerick, Co. Limerick, Ireland\n§YAlso known as:§! Caitlín Bean Uí Chléirigh\n§YPolitical Career:§! Kathleen Clarke (née Daly) has lived a life steeped in Irish republicanism.\nShe was born in County Limerick to a strongly republican family, with her uncle John Daly a leading figure in the Irish Republican Brotherhood. It was through him that she would meet her future husband Tom, recently released from serving fifteen years in an English prison. Kathleen at the time was the manager of a flourishing dressmaking business in Limerick City, when she married Tom, twenty-one years her senior.\n\nThe couple moved to New York for some time, working and gathering support for the Fenians among recently emigrated Irish-Americans, before returning to Ireland and settling in Dublin. There they opened a suite of tobacconists' shops, with Kathleen running the business with her husband, while also joining the Gaelic League and engaging in republican activities herself. Most notably, in 1914 she was a founder member of Cumann na mBan, the women's paramilitary association that was essential in the struggle for independence during the revolutionary period. Tom would later be forever remembered as the primary instigator of the Easter Rising, and the first signatory in the Proclamation of the Republic. For Kathleen however, the Rising meant the loss of her husband, brother, uncle and unborn child. She spent its immediate aftermath organising relief efforts for all those who had family members killed or imprisoned during the rebellion.\n\nDespite the great personal losses Clarke endured, she continued to engage in the republican movement, joining Sinn Féin in 1917 and serving in its executive. During the War of Independence, she was elected as a TD and acted as a District Judge in the Republican Courts set up by the Dáil. Since then, she has been elected as a TD, Senator and Lord Mayor of Dublin. Clarke has championed the rights of women in particular to be enshrined in law, both in the original 1922 Constitution, but also in any subsequent legislation. In gaining support for this, she cites the Proclamation of 1916, with its vision of cherishing all children of the nation equally.\n\nThere is no person in Ireland that can be considered more of a living symbol of the sacrifice made by the martyrs of 1916. It is fitting that she now holds the role of President, where above the banality of wielding executive power, Clarke will act as first citizen of the Republic, and among other duties, have the responsibility of honouring the memory of all of those men and women who gave their lives for the cause of Irish freedom."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_HYDE_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 17th, 1860, in Castlerea, Co. Roscommon, Ireland\n§YAlso known as:§! Dubhglas de hÍde\n§YPolitical Career:§! The linguist and academic Douglas Hyde was born to a Church of Ireland rector in County Roscommon. At an early age, he developed a fascination with the form of Irish spoken in the area, and despite his Ascendency background, gained a keen motivation for the usage and preservation of the language as a whole, particularly following the calamitous drop its prevalence that occurred with the Great Famine.\n\nHyde originally wrote poems and essays in the Irish language under the name \"An Craoibhín Aoibhinn\", or \"The Pleasant Little Branch\", alongside his career in academia. This eventually led him in 1893 to found the Gaelic League, or Conradh na Gaeilge, a society dedicated to the promotion of Irish language and culture, with its initial manifesto, written by Hyde, entitled \"The necessity for de-anglicising the Irish nation\".\n\nThe Gaelic League became the wellspring of a generation of Irish nationalists and republicans, despite being founded with a non-partisan ethos. While a nationalist himself, Hyde wished for the League to be accessible to those of any allegiance, later resigning in favour of Eoin MacNeill when the movement became increasingly politicised. Since then, he has served as the inaugural Professor of Modern Irish in University College Dublin, and as a Senator.\n\nEven considering his numerous credentials, the selection of a non-Catholic to the office of President is a message to the world that the Irish identity is based on the nation's culture and heritage, and not any sole religious affiliation. The new President is comfortable with his largely apolitical new role, where he acts mostly in a ceremonial capacity as a national representative and cultural ambassador. Hyde brings a dignified and understated presence to the position, and continues to hold the almost universal respect of the people."
POLITICS_ERSKINE_CHILDERS_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! June 25th, 1870, in Mayfair, London, England\n§YAlso known as:§! R. Arascain Mac an Choire"\n§YPolitical Career:§! Robert Erskine Childers has travelled a long and varied path to arrive in the office of President.\n\nBorn in London to an English father and Anglo-Irish mother, he was raised by mother's family in County Wicklow after his parents' untimely death. He received his education in Britain, and with his family prominent in British political circles, it was no surprise when he became a civil servant in the House of Commons, at the heart of the establishment. Partly due to the British conservative values that he grew up with, Childers volunteered during the Boer War. This became his first sense of disillusionment with the imperialist project, and led him to become passionate about the cause of Home Rule for Ireland. His wartime experiences also began his penchant for writing, completing two books on military theory, as well as an influential espionage novel.\n\nChilders was a keen yachtsman, and frustrated with Home Rule's endless delays, he furthered his unruly streak by sailing to Germany on the eve of the Weltkrieg and smuggling hundreds of rifles to the Irish Volunteers on his yacht the \"Asgard\". He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by the British government for his efforts as an intelligence and reconnaissance officer during the Weltkrieg, but was enraged by the violent suppression of the Easter Rising, and the attempted introduction of conscription in Ireland.\n\nEventually, departing entirely from moderate nationalism, Childers permanently moved back to Ireland and joined Sinn Féin, utilising his literary abilities as Director of Publicity for the first Dáil. His arrival was met with suspicion, as many considered him as at best a renegade and traitor to Britain, or at worst as a British spy. His doubters were muted by the forthright republican views that he displayed as part of the delegation for the successful Treaty negotiations.\n\nChilders has since then lived his life out of the spotlight, spending his time writing, sailing with his wife Molly, and serving as occasional government advisor on maritime matters. As President, he leaves the day-to-day running of the government to the Taoiseach, while frequently publishing articles and essays on Irish international relations, in addition to his formal appearances. Childers represents an Irish Republic that is comfortable with its past, and recognises the contributions of the Anglo-Irish to Irish nationalism and republicanism — from Tone, to Emmet, to Parnell, and to Casement."

ARMY_LIAM_LYNCH_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gNovember 20th, 1892, in Baurnagurrahy, Co. Limerick, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §gLiam Ó Loingsigh§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gBaptised William Fanaghan Lynch, Liam was born into a politically active farming family, in the shade of the Galtee mountains on the Cork-Limerick border. His paternal uncle took part in the 1867 Rising, while his mother had been joint secretary of a local Ladies' branch of the Land League, seeking to break up the large estates of the Anglo-Irish gentry.\nLike many young men his age, Lynch joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913, seeking to secure Home Rule, while completing his apprenticeship in the hardware trade, and being a member of the Gaelic League. Also typical of most, he elected to not join the more militant group of the Volunteers, and as such did not take part of the Easter Rising, while also not enlisting in the British Army. This more moderate approach ended after the Rising, particularly when he witnessed the British Army shooting and capturing the prominent Kent family of Bawnard. After leading the four brothers and their octogenarian mother in handcuffs over the bridge of Fermoy, one brother would die of the wounds sustained in the capture, while another would be executed the following week. It was at this point that Lynch decided to dedicate his life to the cause of Irish freedom.\nHe quickly made a name for himself as the leader of the North Cork No. 2 Brigade of the IRA during the War of Independence, leading multiple successful skirmishes, raids and ambushes. Lynch narrowly escaped capture and death numerous times, with his notoriety to the extent that two other men named Lynch were mistakenly killed by British forces, seeking him out.\nLynch's experiences in the War of Independence have stayed with him, as he enjoys an influential position in the Army. He maintains a low tolerance for politicians, and during the War of Independence was noted to say \"The Army has to hew the way to freedom for politics to follow.\" Known for his attention to detail, he was even at an early stage recognised to have an affinity to military life. Such was his devotion to the cause, that during the War he was frequently compared to a priest. Though that war has ended, for Lynch the Army remains his vocation.§!"

Braonáin-Móinbhán§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gIn the aftermath of the takeover of Ireland by far-right radicals, and the resultant upheaval in the armed forces, William James Brennan-Whitmore has emerged as a figure willing to assist the new government in their military endeavours.\nWilliam James Brennan was born to a journalist and printer from County Wexford. As both his parents passed away unexpectedly, he was raised by his maternal uncle and aunt, adding their surname to his own. He joined the Royal Irish Regiment in his youth, being promoted to Sergeant due to his service in India. This time with the British Army did anything but ingratiate him to the political status-quo however, as he resigned in 1907, then with a commitment to a particularly Catholic-focused Irish nationalism.\nUpon returning to Ireland and working as a journalist, he also was an early member of Sinn Féin, as well as prominent local member of the Gaelic League. As could be expected, he joined the Irish Volunteers on their foundation in 1913, with his previous military experience welcome. He served as a Commandant during the Easter Rising at the GPO under James Connolly, at which time he was wounded and captured.\nBrennan-Whitmore was heavily involved in the efforts that took place in Frongoch Prison in Wales, whereby the imprisoned veterans of the Rising took to developing the military tactics that would later be implemented in the War of Independence. During the war itself, he was involved in the North Wexford IRA, but mainly spent his time assisting Collins' creation of intelligence networks.\nSince independence, Brennan-Whitmore has become disillusioned with the more liberal Ireland that come into being. He left the army and returned to journalism, mainly writing of the imminent danger that syndicalism presents to Ireland. Though a devoted Catholic, he has called upon all Christians to do their duty to resist the common enemy of syndicalism, just as they did against British influence in Ireland in past times.\nSuch was the level of extremism advocated in his columns, Brennan-Whitmore was previously investigated by the same intelligence networks that he helped create. But now, with the nation under powerful new leadership, he has volunteered himself as someone prepared to do everything he can for the salvation of Ireland, and of Europe in general.§!"
ARMY_JACK_WHITE_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gMay 22nd, 1879, in Broughshane, Co. Antrim, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §gSéamus de Faoite§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gJames Robert White was born into a family of Ulster Protestant aristocrats. He was educated at Winchester, and constantly disciplined for renegade activities, such as urinating openly while fielding on the cricket pitch. His father's status as war hero and Field Marshal gained him admittance to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and he completed his training in time to take part in the Second Boer War.\nIt was in South Africa that White first started coming to terms with his disagreements with the worldview of the British aristocracy, having threatened to shoot a superior officer when they ordered the summary execution of a young unarmed Boer prisoner. Nevertheless, he ended the war a decorated officer, with a Distinguished Service Order.\nServing a few more years as the peacetime soldier, he realised it was not the life for him, and went onto teach English in Bohemia, live in a Tolstoyan commune in England, and work as a lumberjack in Canada. Upon returning to Ireland, he saw the Home Rule debate in full swing, and anticipated supporting the unionist cause. This changed when he encountered the Ulster loyalism of the day, with what he considered their \"bigotry and stagnation\" causing him to veer towards Home Rule. After a chance meeting with Roger Casement, and eventually James Connolly, White went from Home Ruler, to republican, to devout advocate for socialism.\nWhite went on to co-found the Irish Citizen Army, and played an instrumental role in their training and organisation, using his extensive experience from the heart of the British military establishment. Ultimately, when the ICA began negotiating with the Irish Volunteers, he disagreed over the level of cooperation and integration the two groups would undergo, and left the militia. His beliefs never left him however, and he later became a founder member of both the Irish Worker's League and the Irish Syndicalist Party. Since the treaty, he has coordinated the renewed ICA from the underground, leading all that volunteer in the cause of a true socialist republic.\nWhite considers himself a Christian socialist, as he abhors the overt influence of clericalism, or any singular religion in Ireland, preferring instead to aim for Tone's dream of uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.§!"

After making a name for himself as a passionate advocate for Gaelic games in the area and joining the Gaelic League, he joined the Irish Volunteers in the wake of the Easter Rising.\nHis most daring initiative during the war occurred early in the conflict, and was the capture of a local RIC barracks, obtaining arms and explosives, and inspiring other nearby brigades to successfully apply the same manoeuvres. After commendation from his superiors and subsequent promotion, he was involved in protecting Catholics in the pogroms that were occurring in nationalist-majority parts of Belfast at the time. This, and the seizure of arms from many loyalist houses in rural Ulster, gave him the name of being less tolerant of those in Ireland that did not share his goal of an independent Irish republic.\nAfter the war, he was appointed the commissioner of An Garda Síochána, the national police force. A strong ally of Michael Collins, O'Duffy would eventually rise as Fine Gael's Taoiseach - a mainly ceremonial post. While still a major figure in Collins' government, O'Duffy is often at odds with senior FG leadership, who vehemently disagree with many of O'Duffy's right-wing stances.\nO'Duffy's last involvement with the military was the War of Independence, and the years since have not been kind to him. Nevertheless, he remains as reckless and impassioned as ever.§!"

Waterford, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §gRisteárd Ó Maolchatha§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gRichard Mulcahy is considered the consummate politician-soldier, and an extant example of the relationship between the army and the state from the time of the War of Independence.\nBorn to a lower-middle-class family in Waterford, he took up a position with the Post Office at the age of 16, where he was later promoted to the engineering branch. As a young man, Mulcahy first became interested in Irish nationalism through the newspaper \"The United Irishman\", created by Sinn Féin founder Arthur Griffith. What he found in its pages inspired him to join the Gaelic League cultural organisation, and he was a fluent Irish speaker by the time he was assigned a job in Dublin, as well as a committed republican.\nAfter joining the Irish Volunteers and refusing to side with the contingent who had enlisted in the British Army during the Weltkrieg, Mulcahy's position in the Post Office engineering department was invaluable for the inside knowledge that allowed the volunteers to cut off communications for the British during the Easter Rising. Mulcahy himself spent the Rising in Ashbourne, County Meath, one of the few areas outside Dublin that saw action, and successfully applied the guerrilla warfare tactics that would be developed further in the War of Independence.\nElected as a TD, he held the position of Assistant Minister for Defence during the War of Independence, often acting as a mediator between the frequent clashes of personality of Michael Collins and Cathal Brugha. He managed to work closely with and respect both, but ultimately sided with Collins when Brugha left Sinn Féin to form his own party, and remains on professional terms with Brugha while being Collins' right hand man.\nMulcahy is a cautious, calculating and measured leader and statesmen, somehow managing to balance his political and military positions and responsibilities.

He wishes to further advance the army, away from what he sees as many disparate remnants of structures from the War of Independence, to a more modern composition.\nBeing from a political dynasty, many were surprised that MacNeill didn't enter politics himself, but if you were to ask him, he would say he would prefer to leave it to others.

Kerry, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §gTomás de Barra§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gIf there were one commander in Ireland who is preceded by their reputation, it would be Thomas Bernadine Barry. Raised in County Cork, he was the second of eleven children born to a Royal Irish Constabulary officer, and unlike most of his revolutionary peers, did not join the Gaelic League, or come from a republican or strong nationalist background.\nAt 17 years old, he did what many young men were doing in Europe during the Weltkrieg, which was enlist. This was not to fight for Ireland, or even Britain; he joined the Royal Field Artillery to see what war was like, get a gun, and to travel.\nThis saw him to Mesopotamia and Egypt, to promotion and commendation. Despite being mentioned in despatches, when word reached about the Easter Rising, Barry began to question his position in the British Army, and turned down an offer of a commission in the Munster Fusiliers, opting to pursue employment elsewhere.\nBarry remained uninvolved early in the War of Independence, until a fellow ex-serviceman was bayoneted to death in Cork city by British soldiers, who did so while calling him and his companion \"Irish pigs\". After serving in the guard of honour at the funeral, Barry could see little appeal with the status quo, and joined the IRA, to fight for an independent Irish republic.\nFrom the onset, he was highly valued for his military background and ability to train and inspire new volunteers, while adapting his previous experiences successfully to a wholly new form of warfare. This could be seen in the legendary Kilmichael Ambush, as well as the Battle of Crossbarry, where he lead 104 volunteers of the West Cork Brigade to escape an encirclement of British forces thirteen times their number, to minimal casualties.\nBarry personally came to be known as a ruthless and feared adversary to enemy forces, to the degree that his temporary imprisonment was an initial demand by the British in securing the war's ceasefire — a request that Collins naturally denied.\nThe accolades that he and his men received for their bravery, discipline and efficiency have been many. Not wanting to rest on his laurels however, Barry is keen to remain \"in the field\", and to go beyond his wartime reputation for ambushes and flying columns. He continues to develop his methods, should the need to maintain Ireland's independence arise again, \"in the next war\".§!"

After his studies he travelled to the United States, serving two years in the US Army as part of the 69th (New York) Regiment. Following this, he returned to Ireland in 1915 and joined the Irish Volunteers as Chief of Inspection, delivering lectures on military tactics as well as on famous Irish battles. Taking no part in the Rising itself, he spent the preceding days in Cork, having being sent there as part of the infamous countermand issued by Eoin MacNeill, which almost stopped the Rising taking place entirely.\nDespite O'Connell's non-involvement, he was nonetheless reprimanded by British forces and imprisoned. Since this time, when the Irish Volunteers transitioned into the Irish Republican Army, he held onto his previous position, eventually becoming the Director of Training for the IRA, a role that he holds to this day. He serves as the principal lecturer for all officers' training, though his students are surprised to find his manner more practical and personable than his more theory-focused credentials may suggest. As a military historian, he has published numerous articles on both Irish and foreign military history and tactics.\nO'Connell was instrumental in the disbanding of the old Irish Republican Brotherhood after the War of Independence, frequently stating that soldiers should not be part of secret societies.

The son of an Ulster farmer, he joined the Irish Volunteers in 1915, was active during the War of Independence, and eventually became the Deputy OC of the 2nd Northern Division by the end of the war.\nHe is recognised by his peers, and occasionally by the government, for his energy and initiative as a commander and coordinator of Ireland's defence. Since independence, he has in particular examined many of the military aspects of the Easter Rising in Dublin, and of the limited urban skirmishes that occurred as part of the War of Independence. This has led to him having a particular interest in defensive combat that occurs in more built-up areas.\nMcKenna holds the belief that an attack on the island may come from any side, geographically or politically. He maintains that Ireland must be prepared to use everything at its disposal in its defence, against whoever this may be, and that it is the government's and not the army's concern to determine the politics in question. As far as he is concerned, no enemy or ally can be taken for granted when it comes to planning for future engagements, especially given Ireland's peripheral position in Europe.\nDespite the Germanophilic tendencies of much of the Army, McKenna's views are given their due hearing, and he is dedicated in his preparation for any possible situation that Ireland may be thrust into.§!"

Tipperary, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §gDomhnall Ó hÓgáin§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gDaniel Hogan was born in County Tipperary to a prominent farming family of comfortable means. After finishing school, he moved to County Monaghan to work as a clerk for the Great Northern Railway Company, and it was here that he would later make a name for himself during the War of Independence. His initial time in Monaghan was marked by his joining of the GAA and the Irish Volunteers — both of which closely coinciding with his introduction to none other than Eoin O'Duffy.\nHogan developed a reputation as a ruthless and confident leader in the Monaghan IRA, carrying out numerous ambushes and assaults, while acting as O'Duffy's right-hand-man. His wartime experiences involved personal loss, as his brother Michael was the captain of Tipperary team that played in Croke Park during the fateful events of Bloody Sunday, and indeed was the only player shot dead by British forces, with the rest of the victims being spectators. Hogan did not take this well, and his grief only lead him more fully engage in the revolutionary activities in Ulster, in particular targeting wealthy loyalists with kidnappings and the burning down of several of the \"big houses\". At the end of the war, he was given the honour of being the first to raise the Tricolour over Dublin Castle, as part of the handover ceremony where British forces formally relinquished their control of much of the apparatus of state.\nHis friendship with O'Duffy was sidelined when the latter began to lose favour with the government, with Hogan not wishing his own personal relationship with his former superior to be a risk to his own current position in the army — though there is no doubt that he harbours some sympathy for O'Duffy's cause, likely in part due to his devout religious beliefs. Hogan's past connections and prickly character makes him an unpopular figure with several politicians, but he maintains the respect of the soldiers, who remain in full confidence of his abilities as a commander and leader.§!"
ARMY_SEAN_MAC_EOIN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gSeptember 30th, 1893, in Granard, Co. Longford, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §gJohn McKeon§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gSeán Mac Eoin was born the son of a Longford blacksmith, and a mother whose own republican ancestors had fought locally in the 1798 Rebellion. The young Seán took an interest in national matters at an early stage, adopting the Irish language form of his name at 11 years of age. He finished his primary education and began work at the family forge, where he was apprenticed to his father. As the eldest son, Mac Eoin had responsibility thrust upon him in 1913, as he then had to take over full maintenance of the forge and his family's wellbeing, after his father passed away unexpectedly. However, this did not stop him from joining the Irish Volunteers and Irish Republican Brotherhood the following year.\nMac Eoin was notable during the War of Independence for leading the only effective flying column in the midlands, as he served the Commandant of the first battalion of the Longford brigade. The first of two major incidents that he was involved in during the conflict was the Battle of Ballinalee, where Mac Eoin was based, where he held his village from British forces despite overwhelming numbers. The other was the Clonfin Ambush, where he performed a well-executed attack on several lorries of British troops, and was recognised for his chivalrous actions in treating the wounded enemies afterwards, at the expense of the opportunity to capture more much-needed weaponry and equipment. These two events became legendary locally, earning him the soubriquet \"The Blacksmith of Ballinalee\".\nHis time in the war was ended with his capture, during which he was shot in the chest. He recovered from his injuries and was sentenced to death for his involvement in the war — but was released before the sentence was carried out, as part of the treaty negotiations. Testimony from British forces over his conduct towards them also helped to delay his sentencing.\nWhile imprisoned, Mac Eoin was elected TD for Longford-Westmeath, but did not contest the seat again after serving two terms in the Dáil, opting instead to focus on the military, after Ireland's independence seemed threatened in the immediate aftermath of the British Revolution. \"The Blacksmith of Ballinalee\", as he is still known, is also noted for his strong religious views, and close association with both Richard Mulcahy and Michael Collins, though his loyalty lies first and foremost to the army itself.§!"

Dublin, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §gRuaidhrí Ó Conchubhair§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gRoderick Ignatius Patrick O'Connor is the third son born into a wealthy Dublin family. During his youth he received a privileged education, eventually qualifying as an engineer and spending some years in Canada, where he was responsible for the construction of over 1500 miles of railroad.\nReturning to Ireland in early 1915, he contemplating joining the British war effort, but soon fell back into the social spheres of Irish middle-class that he had left upon emigrating. By now, many of his peers had become heavily involved with advanced nationalism, and through them, O'Connor became radicalised towards republicanism.\nHis background as an engineer was considered an asset, and he was also involved in a venture to establish a chemical manufacturing business, whereas in place of producing the medication aspirin, the factory would instead be making explosives, later to be used in the Easter Rising. O'Connor himself took part in the Rising, and was wounded when a sniper's round ricocheted and grazed his skull, as well as receiving an ankle injury from another stray bullet. He avoided arrest after the Rising by using a false name while recuperating from his injuries in convalescence.\nFollowing the Rising, he was appointed as Director of Engineering to the IRA, and became synonymous with the organisation of sabotage operations, the training of volunteers in the use of explosives in combat, as well as being involved in several high-profile prison escapes and attempted escapes. Since independence, he has continued in this role within the Army.\nThe erudite and cultured O'Connor is credited for his courage and quiet integrity. He is uninterested in parliamentary politics, instead being devoted to the idea of the Republic, as well as his passions of classical music, bridge and chess.§!"
ARMY_JAMES_STEELE_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§! §gOctober 26th, 1894, in Ballycarry, Co. Antrim, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §gSéamus Mac Cruach§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gJames Stuart Steele can be considered one of the most incongruous presences among the commissioned officers in the army.\nComing from an Ulster Protestant background, he joined the Officer Training Corps while studying at Queen's University, Belfast, and like any loyal son of Ulster, eagerly joined the war effort at the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Irish Rifles, and was posted to the Western Front, serving in the battles of Messines, Somme and Passchendaele, during which time he was awarded the Military Cross, before being promoted late in the war.\nBritain may have lost the Weltkrieg, but Steele looked to have a bright future ahead of him in the British Army. He was sorely disappointed at the result of the Irish War of Independence, as he considered his Irish identity to be closely entwined with his British one, and was reluctant to see the parting of many of his old comrades in the Royal Irish Rifles.\nThe British Revolution, unsurprisingly, had a significant effect on his worldview. Deeply disillusioned by the exiled government in Canada's decision to seemingly abandon Northern Ireland at a time when its invasion by the newly established Union of Britain seemed imminent, he was among the military representatives present at the tense negotiations with the southern government, which eventually led to Irish reunification.\nWhile he certainly has not voiced any dislike for the institution of the republic, careful listeners would notice that he will always refer to the \"Irish Army\", rather than its full title, as well as using \"Ulster\" to refer to \"Northern Ireland\".\nSteele is loyal to Ireland second, and to Ulster first. His decision to continue his military career as he did, was not an easy choice to make, but he feels it his responsibility to act as a spokesman for the loyalist military tradition in what is now an all-island army, lest their perspective be otherwise under-represented.\nDespite his differences with many of his fellow officers, they hold each other in mutually high regard, and living up to his name, he readies himself for any new conflict between Ireland and the syndicalists with a steely resolve."

This was not to be his final calling however, as during his time in the organisation, he became increasingly interested in the other approaches which may augment his own interest in explosives.\nOne of the minority of officers in the IRA to oppose the Anglo-Irish Treaty, he has stayed firm in his belief that such a compromise was a mistake, for which he as been somewhat ostracised among the Officer Corps. He is a convinced but unpractised believer in the idea of combining infantry with explosives, aircraft and land vehicles, certainly an ambitious doctrinal approach, given Ireland's industrial capabilities. Even among the hardline officer clique of those still within the army, he is more than willing to go to go to even more extreme means to demonstrate this conviction.§!"

Dublin, Ireland§!\n§YAlso known as:§! §gSeán Ruiséil§!\n§YMilitary Career:§! §gJohn Angelo Russell is the youngest of seven children born in inner-city Dublin to a family of modest means. Following his secondary education, he worked as a draper's assistant before joining the Irish Volunteers in 1913. He took part in the Easter Rising as a section commander, and after the ceasefire was interned in Great Britain until the end of the year.\nUpon returning to Ireland, he continued this involvement in what became the Dublin IRA, into the War of Independence. Over the course of the conflict, he was eventually made OC of 2nd Battalion, Dublin Brigade and finally the Quartermaster for all Dublin IRA. Familiar with the membership and organisation of the IRA in Dublin, he was key in aiding Michael Collins in the selection of men to carry out the simultaneous assassinations of British intelligence agents, on what later became known as \"Bloody Sunday\". Through an informant, Russell also became aware of the planned British reprisals on civilians that took place in Croke Park later that day, but he was unsuccessful in his efforts to prevent them.\nAfter the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Russell left the armed forces and re-joined civilian life. This is partially due to frustration with the later events of Bloody Sunday, but also with the sentiment of the \"job being done\".\nWith the slow escalation of tensions on the continent, this has changed. Finding the monotony of life outside the military getting the better of him, Russell has recently ended his retirement. While not the most practised as a field commander in recent times, his service during the War of Independence has led to him being tasked with investigating the procurement and production of arms and equipment. He has taken up this task with enthusiasm, though with little regard for the politics in question, he has surprised many with the diversity of those he has considered gaining assistance from.§!"

These are the militaristic discipline of the Prussians, and the patriotic revolutionary fervour of the IRA. Despite regional autonomy in France going from strength to strength under the auspices of the Communards, and in immeasurably better straits than with the old Republic, Hénaff has chafed under what is seen by most proponents of Breton nationalism as a great step forward. For him, it is not enough, and it never could be, sharing a country, however constructed, with those who did their best to destroy his heritage.\nTrained as a chemical engineer, Hénaff was responsible for the demolition of a historic statue which had commemorated the union of Brittany and France in the fifteenth century, in a symbolic act which only encouraged him further. He has come to Ireland to gain first-hand experience of not only with working the IRA, but also the powerful new regime which has taken control of the country, one which shares his hatred of syndicalism.\nHis Breton mother tongue bears little similarity to Irish, but he seems eager to improve his fluency in the language of his adopted home, and is seen as welcome assistance at a time when numbers of loyal officers are dwindling.§!"

His career lead him to serve on numerous vessels, most notably the H.M.S. Vincent, where he took part in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, during which his brother Charles was killed.\nAny familial association with the Royal Navy came to an end during the War of Independence however, when Ó Muiris heard of the burning of his family's hometown of Clifden, by British forces. Serving as second-in-command on the H.M.S. Castor, and having also been ordered to ferry Irish political prisoners to England for internment, this proved too much to tolerate. He took early retirement from the Royal Navy, and returned home.\nSince independence, and the final takeover of the last of the old British naval bases in 1925, he has adopted the Irish language form of his name, and has been given the unenviable task by the government to develop Ireland's fledgling marine service.§!"

Mac An Stocaire§!\n§YNaval Career:§! §gBorn to a noteworthy Protestant family in Dublin, Henry Hugh Gordon Stoker joined the Royal Navy in 1900, and from an early stage took a great interest in the developing field of submarines. As part of a transfer to the Royal Australian Navy, he undertook a journey via submarine from Plymouth to Sydney, becoming the first submariner to travel such a distance. His reputation grew further, when during the Weltkrieg a submarine under his command was the first to clear the Dardanelles, after evading Turkish minefields, shore batteries and patrolling warships. In the Sea of Marmara, he began to disrupt Turkish supplies and reinforcements, but was later attacked by an Ottoman gunboat and spent the rest of the war in a POW camp.\nDespite being awarded the DSO for his actions, he left the Royal Navy before the British Revolution and returned home to Ireland. Stoker has since returned to naval matters, citing the developing volatile political situation. As the nephew of acclaimed author Bram Stoker, he did not inherit his uncles' \"Home Ruler\" beliefs, and it is for Ireland now that he promotes the furthering of submarine-based naval warfare, being certain that their primacy is key in defending the island's coasts."

IRE_Unraveling_Political_Scene_desc: "Fine Gael has enjoyed an almost unopposed hold on Ireland's democratic political system ever since the foundation of the free republic, but that has begun to change in recent years. Collins' old adversary Éamon de Valera has been steadily gaining more power within Ireland as the economic situation worsens under Collins' rule; and as Fine Gael's power wanes, violent clashes between supporters of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have become more common. This swell in political violence has led to a significant increase in Sinn Féin's popularity as Cathal Brugha's ideas gain more traction with the masses, branding themselves as a peaceful third way between de Valera and Collins. Additionally, Socialists of various ilks have been steadily clawing their way into political relevance, largely thanks to support from the Union of Britain and the American SPA. With all this in mind, the election of 1937 is set to be the most contentious one in recent memory, and if Fine Gael is to remain in their position of unchecked dominance,they will need to prove to the people of Ireland of their commitment to overhauling Ireland's stagnant economic and political scenes in order to end the Troubles once and for all.

Under the IMS and Raymond O’Brien’s leadership, a new organic monarchy rules over a purely Catholic Ireland, mixing Maurrassian and Lusitanian Integralist philosophies with American conceptions of Christian Nationalism and Irish designs of a Gaelic revival to create a decentralized and absolutist system unlike anything Ireland’s ever seen. Supported by a revived Clan system, Corporatist economics and a burgeoning guilds system, Irish Nationalism, anti-Socialism, anti-Capitalism, and the extremist teachings of the Catholic Church’s most radical adherents, our new monarchy shall bring pious prosperity to all of Ireland’s true sons and daughters under the Crown."

IRE_RTN:0 "Revitalise the North"
IRE_RTN_desc:0 "After the 1925 ceasefire, the northern most region of Ulster has been in an industrial slump relative to the rest of the nation. Belfast once used to be a thriving industrial city and other towns and cities such as Derry and Coleraine were looking likely to follow. Revisiting this issue and energising the north with industrial investments will help to lift the region."
ire.67.t:0 "The Harland & Wolff Shipyard"
ire.67.d:0 "During the early 1900s, the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast had the prestigious honour of being the world's largest shipyard. After the capitulation of the British Empire during the Weltkrieg and their second capitulation not long after to the Trade Unionists, it has fallen into disrepair and has been overtaken by other yards throughout the world. With refurbishment, it could once again be a great asset, but this time for Ireland, not the British Imperialists."
ire.67.a:0 "With some repairs and a recruiting effort, the shipyard will create a good few jobs."
ire.67.b:0 "Harland & Wolff will shine once again."
ire.67.c:0 "We will make this shipyard the envy of the world once more."

IRE_HnW:0 "Harland & Wolff Shipyard"
IRE_HnW_desc:0 "At the turn of the century, the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast was the largest in the world. Newly restored and expanded by the Irish government, it can once again make a claim for this prestigious title."

ire.68.t:0 "The Short Brothers Company"
ire.68.d:0 "Founded in England in 1908, the Short Brothers PLC is a private aerospace company with some existing operations in Ulster. Having seen their business suffer significant losses thanks to the fate of the British Empire, they are now looking for new opportunities and see expansion in Ulster as their highest priority. We can subsidise their venture at some cost to our nation, but the benefits of having a prominent aerospace industry are obvious in peace and wartime."
ire.68.a:0 "Help them settle."
ire.68.b:0 "Make a significant investment."
ire.68.c:0 "Belfast shall become their worldwide headquarters. Throw money at them."
ire.68.e:0 "Forget it, the budget is tight enough as it is. Who needs planes anyway?"
IRE_SHORTBROS:0 "Short Brothers Aerospace PLC"
IRE_SHORTBROS_desc:0 "Founded in 1908, the Short Brothers private limited company was the world's first private aircraft manufacturer. They expanded their operations into Ulster soon after and Belfast became their headquarters. The Irish governments economic expansion of Ulster has heavily benefited the company."

Recent economic developments in the nation have been seen as an encouraging sign that the Dáil is committed to completing Ireland's economic rebirth. The creation of the NIIF will allow for the development of specialised construction companies and facilitate the purchase of building materials to keep the wheels of industrialisation turning."

IRE_ESIC:0 "Éireann Scientific Innovation Council"
IRE_ESIC_desc:0 "Our nation is greatly lacking in scientific progress compared to many other industrialised nations. Presently Ireland has very little in the way of funding for scientific research. Beginning to develop a proper scientific programme will be essential if we are to significantly develop our nation."
IRE_ESIC1:0 "Éireann Scientific Innovation Council"
IRE_ESIC1_desc:0 "The ESIC was created to help Ireland's scientific progress. A team of well-paid scientists, experts in different fields, shall work night and day to facilitate Ireland catching up with the rest of the world."

IRE_ESIC3:0 "Renowned ESIC"
IRE_ESIC3_desc:0 "The ESIC have become a major force of scientific progress and are significantly contributing to Ireland's scientific progress."
ire.92.t:0 "A Small Step for Ireland..."
ire.92.d:0 "The Éireann Scientific Innovation Council (ESIC) is a newly created sub-department of the government, with one simple purpose in mind: a devotion to academia and scientific progress. Ireland has long been seen as a rural backwater by other world powers, a place that progress seemed to leave behind. Whilst a cruel opinion, it is not without truth. Centuries of British rule left Ireland largely neglected whilst the rest of the world raced on. It's time to catch up. The ESIC will be composed of expert scientists recruited from both the Irish population and from friendly foreign allies. ESIC research teams will increase our overall research efficiency and may even occasionally produce major breakthroughs in certain fields. The government must now decide how important the ESIC is to the nation: how much funds should they receive?"
ire.92.a:0 "Science is important, but it's not the only priority. A low amount of funding."
ire.92.b:0 "We will give them a prudent amount for such a key issue."
ire.92.c:0 "Ireland must leap from the past so that she can walk in the future. Massively fund the project."
ire.93.t:0 "Advances in Research Efficiency"
ire.93.d:0 "Thanks to steady funding by the Irish government, the ESIC has gradually been expanding over time and has grown in experience and efficiency, allowing them to tackle multiple research projects simultaneously. Ireland's scientific development is rapidly improving alongside the ESIC's own progress, and the investment is obviously paying off."
ire.93.a:0 "The news we've all been waiting for."
ire.94.t:0 "Impressive Advances Made"
ire.94.d:0 "Given time and plenty of funding, the ESIC has developed into a modern force in scientific research, to the point where Ireland is starting to be seen as a respected nation in terms of it's research and development capabilities. No longer shall the Irish people be mocked as peasant farmers and louts!"
ire.94.a:0 "Back of the net."
ire.95.t:0 "Major Research Breakthrough"

ire.95.a:0 "They're starting to earn their heavy wages."
ire.esic.brkthru:0 "Gain a §Yrandom research§! speed bonus."

IRE_IRF:0 "Industrial Research Priorities"
IRE_IRF_desc:0 "Our national has a vital need for industry, and that need is coupled with an equal requirement for research and development. Many of our factories are decrepit and out of date. To build a modern industry, Ireland needs modern factories. Investing into industrial research will allow us to move further towards progress."
IRE_ISP_OIL:0 "Irish Synthetics Project"
IRE_ISP_OIL_desc:0 "Although our people are industrious and our island ripe for industrialisation, there is no accounting for the unfortunate lack of natural resources available to us relative to the major powers of the world. Oil and rubber are particularly problematic, so if we would like to make use of these resources in our industries, Ireland must develop a functional synthetics programme."
IRE_XPESIC:0 "Expand the ESIC"
IRE_XPESIC_desc:0 "The ESIC have been doing a fantastic job to date, but they still have room to grow. Further investment will facilitate their involvement in a greater number of research projects, enabling our teams to cover more ground and deal with more fields. This will improve our overall flexibility in the field of science."
IRE_GGLF:0 "The Great Green Leap Forward"
IRE_GGLF_desc:0 "Ireland has come a long way in a short time. The passage of the IEAA will no doubt mark a monumental victory in the history of our nation. It's time to step out of the shadows of British imperialism. Ireland is a plantation no longer. She is a nation reborn."

IRE_EIE:0 "Immigration Reform"
IRE_EIE_desc:0 "The Irish population are eager and willing to work, but our nation is a small one. The state of our economy to date has been rather unimpressive and uninviting, but with the recent developments spurred on by the IEAA, perhaps we can begin improving this situation. Irish business would grow more quickly if we encouraged immigration from other less developed nations."
ire.eie.tt:0 "Begin a reform programme to encourage §Yincreased immigration§! to our nation.\n\n"
ire.96.t:0 "The Dáil Decides: Immigration"
ire.96.d:0 "As part of their new IEAA initiative, the Dáil have argued for the expansion of Ireland's immigration policies. Under British rule, immigration to Ireland was almost non-existent and actively discouraged. Now that Ireland is free and her economy is growing at a rapid rate, there is an opportunity to start actively encouraging immigration. This process could prove extremely costly however, as significant funds will have to be invested in housing developments and administrative processes. There may also be social unrest with a large influx of immigrants arriving on Irish shores. Our choice of policy going forward will be very important for our nation, and it's important to consider the potential consequences."
ire.96.a:0 "Relax our policies. A few more people can't hurt."

Syndicalism, Revolutionary Leftism, and other Radical Socialisms shall all be outlawed by the state, though certain acceptable forms of Left-leaning progressive ideas and economic theories shall of course stay, for the Ceannaire has incorporated many of these non-infectious ideas into the party line of the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe.

Calling for a resurgence of the Irish language and of traditional Celtic culture and clan identities, the eventual prohibition of English once the populace fully adapts to this new idea of a wholly Irish Ireland, pro-natalist policies to expand the Celtic population, and a ban on Irish emigration, the Ceannaire Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin will make Ireland truly and only Celtic again. By working with the Pan-Celtic woman's group Cumann na Saoirse along with nationalist and Pan-Celtic movements in Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Mann, and Brittany, the Ceannaire will ensure that the Pan-Celtic dream and this Gàidhlig Athbhreith, or Gaeilic Renaissance, shall flourish and spread prosperity and honor for all true children of Celtica."

We must cleanse Ireland of this failed group and their vile taint so that our Emerald Isle can finally be free and truly, wholly Celtic once again. We shall move to slowly limit the usage of the English language until it has been entirely eradicated from the local vernacular, and laws shall be passed to limit the rights and privileges of any Anglos foolish enough to stay on our Island.

While serving as one of the most successful rebel leaders of the IRA, Collins stood as a guiding beacon that helped lit our way through The Troubles and towards true but cautious freedom before his untimely and violent demise. We shall honor Collins and all he endured and sacrificed during his time as a freedom fighter and great negotiator, granting him the respect he deserves while also solidifying his legacy as a proud and honorable, but permanently retired relic of the past that ultimately failed where our Blueshirts have now triumphed. Carving off our rough edges and dusting them under the rug of Collins' tremendous reputation, we will ensure that our interpretation of the republican Irish dream can truly come to fruition while using the image of the fallen Big Fellow to uphold our new regime and our standing in the eyes of the masses."

By removing any lasting influence of both Capitalism and Socialism from the economy, we shall construct a more equal yet authoritarian Corporatist state built around class cooperation, trade protectionism, and nation-wide economic parity so that all loyal sons and daughters of Éire can truly prosper, all without falling to dangerous and predatory radicalism."

A proponent of more modern and efficient tillage farming as opposed to traditionalist pasture farming, which drove a wedge between himself and his former Sinn Féin allies, O'Duffy has begun to orchestrate Ireland's own agricultural revolution. With modernized and mechanized Agrarianism supporting the new Corporatist economic structure, paired with protectionist trade policies and new legislation and reserve funds for our farmers, Ireland's fields and fens shall be turned into the most lush and fertile farm plots we can muster, reawakening our agrarian traditions while creating a modern agriculturally-based economy that both feeds and enrichens the masses as we make the Emerald Isle truly green."

By the hand of the Mharascail Eoin O'Duffy, the old wretched Liberal and Crypto-Syndicalist regime has been torn down, replaced with a new Catholic Corporatist state apparatus that supports Ireland's one true faith and her loyal patriots.

IRE_Decentralization_desc: "Reversing course from the centralisation pursued by Fine Gael, the Valera's Irish Government has opted to further empower local councils across the nation. It is hope that by allowing these councils to make local decisions for local people, it will be their needs met rather than just the needs of those in Dublin and other urban centres"
IRE_Christian_Democracy: "True Christian Democracy"
IRE_Christian_Democracy_desc: "Fianna Fáil has always prided itself on the pursuit of a good and holy, Christian and pious Irish democracy. With de Valera and his clique of Catholic democrats finally at the helm, Ireland shall once again march along under the light of the Lord, promoting Catholic morals and sensibilities as a fair and untampered conservative democratic system is established in order to give power to the voices to the masses."
IRE_Cultural_Conservatism: "Cultural Conservatism"
IRE_Cultural_Conservatism_desc: "Ireland is a Conservative nation at heart, wary to drastic change and deeply tied to centuries-old traditions and ideas. This legacy of cultural conservatism tied to the Catholic faith and to Celtic traditions shall not only be safeguarded and upheld, but also expanded and promoted throughout the state, ensuring that Irish Conservatism remains the dominant thoughtform among the people for generations to come."
IRE_Irish_Soverignty: "Cement Irish Sovereignty"
IRE_Irish_Soverignty_desc: "One of the main pillars of the Fianna Fáil platform is the establishment of a wholly independent and sovereign Irish state supported by modern and non-radical notions of Irish Nationalism and Catholic pride along with Gaelic language revivalism and anti-Anglo reform. With these unified positions in mind, we shall slowly march to build a fully Irish Emerald Isle, detached from the dark shadow of the Troubles and from English identities, and with the best intentions in mind for the Irish people and the Irish people alone."
IRE_Special_Status_Church: "A Special Status for the Church"
IRE_Special_Status_Church_desc: "The Catholic Church has always held a special and lofty position within Irish society, sometimes reigning as the most influential organization within the state over the government or the English imperialists themselves. Ever the staunch ally and the foundational body that supports our faith and our Conservative Traditionalism, we shall grant the Catholic Church and its subsidies a special status within the state, eroding the idea of secularism without fully breaking it, and ensuring that our beloved Church remains closely tied to the functions and developments of the state for ages to come."
IRE_Fiscal_Conservatism: "Classical Fiscal Liberalism"
IRE_Fiscal_Conservatism_desc: "Though the Americans have muddied the term 'Liberalism' and conflated it with progressive, semi-Socialist and welfare based practices, we here in Europe know the true meaning. We shall pursue a policy of Fiscal Classical Liberalism, advocating for tax-cuts, reduced government spending, free markets, financial deregulation, privatization, free and open trade, and an attempt at limiting government debt over all other economic goals. We will build a strong and self-standing economy linked with the wider Capitalist world, bringing about the end of Irish economic stagnace as we rise to the global financial stage."
IRE_Smear_Collins: "Tarnish Collins' Legacy"
IRE_Smear_Collins_desc: "Though a renowned freedom fighter with the IRA and a well-respected orator, negotiator, and politician, Collins was always a wolf in sheep's clothing. A potential tyrant and unabashed strongman lying in wait, he has ever plotted to wrap Ireland within the palm of his hands despite his otherwise noble notions of creating an independent Ireland. We must reveal the varied truth of Collins' grey reality, showing the masses the true man behind the mask as we further uphold the real hero of Irish independence, our own de Valera."
IRE_A_Conservative_Ireland: "A Conservative Ireland Under God"
IRE_A_Conservative_Ireland_desc: "By the will of the Father of Irish Conservatism and his allies in Fianna Fáil, the Emerald Isles have once again been wrapped in the safe and prosperous arms of Catholic morality and modernized traditionalism. By the will of Éamon de Valera, non-Liberal and anti-Socialist Catholic populism has risen to support the masses as measured Capitalism and Catholic morals breathe life into our once-stagnating socio-economic reality. Under God and under de Valera's Fianna Fáil, the reborn Irish nation shall stand proud, pious, and strong against corruptive and sinful outside forces, blazing a path towards prosperity for all true children of Éire guided by the glorious light of the Lord."

IRE_Collins_Democracy: "Fine Gael Re-Elected"
IRE_Collins_Democracy_desc: "Fine Gael, or the 'Family of the Irish', has secured yet another win for themselves, once again rising to the top of Irish democracy as the champions of a United Ireland. Practicing Liberal Conservatism and espousing Christian Democracy, Fine Gael has always preached a pragmatic, non-ideologically constrained approach to serving the masses, stating that their way is the right way for Ireland, regardless of dogma or ideology. Headed by former-freedom fighter turned national father Michael Collins, Fine Gael shall guide Irish democracy towards a mediated and pragmatic center partyline while supporting the masses and paying respect to our history and traditions."
IRE_Use_Collins_Popularity: "Collins' Useful Heroism"
IRE_Use_Collins_Popularity_desc: "No single modern man or figure stands higher than Michael Collins, for millions across Ireland hold this freedom fighter and father of Irish independence in the highest regard. Though this pseudo-cult of personality has its dangers, the potential usefulness far outweighs the minor risks it holds as we inflate the Big Fellow's power and ego. Fine Gael shall utilize Collins' popularity and unmatched position in Irish culture and politics in order to ensure that our party and our platform is as widely beloved and followed as Collins is."
IRE_Old_Dog_New_Tricks: "Old Dog, New Tricks"
IRE_Old_Dog_New_Tricks_desc: "Collins has been in power for quite a long time, ruling the free and independent Irish Republic for roughly a decade since our rise to freedom in the wake of the British Revolution and defeated Unionist Uprising in Ulster. Though he has done much to create a prosperous and free Ireland, the state has stagnated in recent years as the German economy began to slump, and many fear that Collins now merely stands as a fallen hero living on the good graces of his past achievements, but that shall not become a reality! Collins has endeavored to not just coast on his old popularity as a war hero and founder of the Irish Republic and Fine Gael itself, instead beginning a new series of reforms and legislations aimed at breathing life into the economy and wider society once more. This old dog shall learn new tricks in order to solidify his legacy as the greatest Irish statesman of the modern age as the Emerald Isle is guided towards prosperous modernity under Fine Gael."
IRE_Hands_Across_The_Isle: "Hands Across the Isle"
IRE_Hands_Across_The_Isle_desc: "If Ireland is to survive the coming tumult, the government of our Emerald Isle must be united like never before. Fools like de Valera have only sought to sow division as they push for their uncompromising Christian Conservative vision, but this shall not be allowed! Using non-radical notions of Irish Nationalism with non-partisan populism and other universally liked positions, Fine Gael shall unite the disparate political masses of our island against the coming maelstrom. We must work with our fellow anti-de Valera rivals across the aisle and all true Irish statesmen across the Isle if we are to create a strong, pious, and prosperous Irish Republic for all, for we cannot unite the masses if our own government is in factionalist shambles."
IRE_The_Threat_To_The_East: "The Eastern Villain Looms"
IRE_The_Threat_To_The_East_desc: "To the East, the one true enemy of the Irish people waits, ever-plotting for our downfall and subjugation just as they have for hundreds upon hundreds of years. The Anglo-Saxon menace of England can never be trusted, for even despite Collins' expert skills as a negotiator and diplomat, the foul English denied our demand for home rule and the creation of the Irish Free State all those years ago. Luckily for us, their own hubris led to their downfall, for the British Revolution turned their empire to ash and gave freedom to the Irish people at long last, but that does not mean we are safe. Under new banners and now puppets of the Red Star of Syndicalism, the English wolves may wear new coats, but these rabid dogs still are up to their same old tricks. We must never lower our guard against the Angloid menace, for we shall never allow another Time of Troubles ever again!"
IRE_Pragmatic_Liberalism: "Pragmatic Liberalism"
IRE_Pragmatic_Liberalism_desc: "The Liberalism of Fine Gael is far from the decadent and perverse idea of 'Liberalism' as spawned by the faltering Continentals and Americans or their ideological allies, for Collins and our united Ireland stand strong by the ideas of true Liberalism and the Enlightenment. Conservative by the standards of some, we walk the truth path to a Liberal and Republican society, free from the vices and dangers of stagnant Traditionalism and overly-cautious Conservatism, or from predatory Socialism and naive Progressivism, and ever pragmatic as to deduce the most correct path forward for our society at any one moment. This true incarnation of Liberal Capitalism shall form the foundation of the state, ensuring that Ireland always walks the path best suited for it, now and forever."
IRE_Irish_Unity: "United by Irish Nationalism"
IRE_Irish_Unity_desc: "Though often tainted by radicalism and ideology, Nationalism itself is not an inherently dangerous or harmful idea; in fact, it is these notions of non-radical Irish Nationalism that is the basis of Fine Gael's foundations. By spreading these ideas of nonviolent patriotism and national loyalty to the masses while revitalizing our local Gaelic culture and language, we shall work to unite the Irish people like never before. Though we shall face difficult resistance in parts of the nation, particularly around Ulster due to the Unionists, Fine Gael shall persevere in order to promote nationwide Irish Unity, for this union shall form the bulwark against the corrosive foreign elements that seek to subjugate and weaken the Irish people."
IRE_Defend_Democracy: "Defenders of the Emerald Isle"
IRE_Defend_Democracy_desc: "Ireland for the Irish! That is the dream we uphold and maintain, for Fine Gael is the sword and shield of the Emerald Isle that Collins and his loyalists wield against anti-Irish forces and the Anglo-Saxon plague. Using controlled militarism, a renewed industrial and urban-focused economy, and the devotion of the masses, we shall defend Ireland and our liberal democratic republic against all those who would seek to undermine our platform. No Syndicalist swine or Reactionary wretch shall lay a finger on the gingered hair of our beloved masses, for Ireland stands strong and free, forever."
IRE_Democracy_Under_The_Big_Fellow: "Democracy Under the 'Big Fellow'"
IRE_Democracy_Under_The_Big_Fellow_desc: "Under the Big Fellow Michael Collins, Ireland has run the gauntlet of independence, prevented Syndicalism from spreading from English shores, stopped the Unionist threat, united the Emerald Isles, and ushered in true democratic republicanism for the masses, supported by Christian Conservative Liberalism, Irish Nationalism, and regulated Capitalism. Once just a warrior and diplomat, the Big Fellow now stands as the uncontested master statesman of Ireland, and in the eyes of some he stands as the greatest Irishman of the modern age. Our beautiful and verdant island breathes strong and free, prosperous and pious as it is guided by the brilliance of Fine Gael, and we owe it all to the Big Fellow."

IRE_National_Center: "National Centre Victory"
IRE_National_Center_desc: "In a shocking turn of events, the relatively small National Centre Party has seized control of Irish democracy by mandate of the masses. Formerly known as the National Farmers and Ratepayers League, at first glance the NCP seems to hold many similarities to their hated rivals in Fianna Fáil. However, where they differ truly matters, with the NCP pushing for Agrarianism and pro-farmer agricultural reform, Christian Conservatism, moderated Irish nationalism and patriotism, and most differentiating of all, a detente with our former Anglo enemies, all while reforming the economy along agricultural and rural lines with support from the agrestic masses which make up the bulk of the NCP's base. Battling against the urban-focused Fianna Fáil, party leaders Frank MacDermot and James Dillon shall guide Ireland back towards its traditional Christian roots as a nation of farmers, shepherds, and bucolic paradise, ensuring an end to rural neglect."
IRE_End_Anglo_Irish_Hostilities: "End Anglo-Irish Hostilities"
IRE_End_Anglo_Irish_Hostilities_desc: "Hibernia and Britannia are truly brothers till the end, and while our history with the Anglos has been checkered at best, we can not deny our shared ties, history, and future. The National Centre Party has always aimed to end the Anglo-Irish Trade War, and now that these rural agrarians run the show, this goal of rapprochement can finally begin. The vendetta against our Eastern brethren will slowly come to an end as we move closer to our former foes economically and diplomatically, ensuring prosperity, peace, and pastoral paradise reigns free across our shared Isles."
IRE_Language_Equality: "One Ireland, Two Tongues"
IRE_Language_Equality_desc: "While our fair Irish mothertongue has survived into this modern day and age, it has done so under fire, constantly being erased and driven back into the annals of history by the far more dominant and widespread Anglo lexicon. In accordance with our goals of detente with the English, while still keeping true to our ideas of Gaelic revivalism and Irish cultural protectionism that we share with most Irishmen here on the Emerald Isle, we shall pursue a policy of bilingualism. Irish-Gaelic and English shall be able to be used in both official and private capacities, standing side-by-side as the two official languages of Ireland. Though we shall still pursue a revival of Goidelic language, culture, and identity, English too shall always have a place here as well."
IRE_Protectionism: "Hibernian Protectionism"
IRE_Protectionism_desc: "Ireland stands in a unique position in Europe, cast off the northern seas at the edge of this chaotic continent, stuck between economic zones and trade areas as we flutter in the seabreeze and try to find our own footing. In order to safeguard our own economic prosperity and progress, the NCP has moved to pursue their beloved policy of economic protectionism. In order to continue to ease relations with England, these tariffs, import quotas, and other protections shall be mediated for English markets - for the most part - while we direct our attention to the Continentals and the Americas. We will build a strong and stable economy built by Irishmen, for Irishmen, all upon the backs of our proud and supported farmers and our growing rural population."
IRE_Middle_of_The_Road_Politics: "Stick to the Middle Road"
IRE_Middle_of_The_Road_Politics_desc: "The radicals of the ANH or of O'Duffy's Blueshirts are no different from the rotten Syndicalists of the Irish Workers League and their Socialist allies in groups like Sinn Féin. Both factions seek to dismantle the independent and democratic republic we have toiled so hard to build; we can not allow this! The policy of the National Center Party is one of opposing radicalism at every step, safeguarding the democratic system that every true Irishman knows and loves. We shall safeguard the middle way; a blazing and righteous path between Leftist naivety and Rightist shortsightedness, between the authoritarian liberalism of Fine Gael and the urban-focused greed of our main rivals Fianna Fáil, for the good of all on the Emerald Isle."
IRE_Agrarianism: "Farmers at the Foundation"
IRE_Agrarianism_desc: "The National Center party was founded by and for farmers, originally being called the National Farmers and Ratepayers League for a reason. Despite the urbanist focus of our main rivals across the democratic spectrum, it is we who have seized the mandate of the masses to lead the republic into a new bucolic age. The rates system of property taxes that exists as a holdover from the British system shall be removed from all agricultural land, allowing our farmers to reinvest that money into their fields and pastures while new modernization and mechanization measures are taken to drag our agricultural processes out of the stone age. Pastoralist practices traditional to the Emerald Isle shall also be revived, further distancing ourselves from the antiquated and foreign farming methods of our old oppressors. With farmers as the foundation and with ruralism and pastoralism in our hearts, Ireland shall come to embody the arcadian idyll as we make the Emerald Isle even more verdant and green."
IRE_Central_Bank: "Reform the Central Bank"
IRE_Central_Bank_desc: "A central goal of the NCP platform has always been to reform the banking system of Ireland. Despite being an independent nation, our monetary system is still heavily tied to the British pound sterling area, and though Collins attempted to create an independent Irish bank during his time in office, he largely failed in this pursuit, leaving our finances in limbo. A new central bank shall be created for Ireland, independent of other currencies and centered around the Irish Punt. Furthermore, this move shall be paired with deflation measures through nation-wide pay cuts and other protectionist policies, finally freeing our economy from the vices and virtues of foreigners for the benefit of all in Éire."
IRE_Oppose_Valera: "Oppose Valera's Conservatism"
IRE_Oppose_Valera_desc: "Éamon de Valera and his lackeys in Fianna Fáil have long been our largest rivals, with our parties sharing much of the same Conservative positions and policies. However, de Valera's idea of Conservatism and Nationalism hinges far too much on faux populism, urbanist decadence, rural neglect, and a sinful interpretation of Irish Christianity as he wields these positions as tools to win over the masses instead of bringing true prosperity to our people. We shall work to weaken Fianna Fáil, taking their members and supporters under our wing so that we may grow to become the face of Irish Conservatism and Center-Right republicanism, revealing the truth to all those that will see it."
IRE_Centrist_Ireland: "A Rural Ireland of the Centre"
IRE_Centrist_Ireland_desc: "Under the guidance of the National Centre Party, Ireland has begun to embrace its pastoralist past, ushering in a new age of rural prosperity across the Emerald Isle. Our farmers and laborers are supported by conservative populism and our strong financial reform, our fields blow in the wind more verdant and fertile than ever before, our economy hums along strong and independent, and our people rejoice under God and united by a non-radical yet devout sense of patriotism and Gaelic nationalism. The English no longer bite at our heels, and the British Isles have seen peace and cooperation for the first time in centuries. Let us rejoice and sally forth as the NCP continues to breathe life into our free Irish agrarian democracy."

IRE_Brugha: "Sinn Féin Victory"
IRE_Brugha_desc: "In a shocking win for the Irish working-class that deals a tremendous blow to the traditionally Conservative atmosphere of our democracy, Sinn Féin has risen as victors in the recent elections. Founded by Arthur Griffith in 1905, the original members of Sinn Féin went on to found the revolutionary Irish Republic and its first domestic parliament, the Revolutionary, or First, Dáil before splitting up and fracturing during our civil war and fight for freedom. Translating to 'We, Ourselves', Sinn Féin is expected to pursue the dream of a Democratic Socialist Republic for Ireland, supported by Left-wing Irish Nationalism, socioeconomic progressivism, and secularism, though many within the party still support and push Christian ethics and morality, driving a wedge in the party's unified front. Regardless of this debate, Sinn Féin shall endure in order to transform Ireland into the pink pearl of our archipelago."
IRE_Solidify_Irish_Republicanism: "Solidify Irish Republicanism"
IRE_Solidify_Irish_Republicanism_desc: "Ireland stands free and alone, for We, Ourselves have guided our people to independence. We must enshrine this freedom to be a paramount aspect of our state and identity, for never again shall Ireland be subjected to the whims of foreign powers or subjugated to the desires of far-off tyrants. Social Democracy and incorruptible Republicanism shall ring far and true across the Emerald Isle, cemented by Sinn Féin's ideas of Leftist nationalism and social patriotism as we rise to be the shepherds of this new air of liberty and national pride."
IRE_Promote_Gaelic: "Revitalize and Adapt Gaelic Tradition"
IRE_Promote_Gaelic_desc: "One of the only near-universally accepted policies among Irish political parties is the revival of the Gaelic language and wider Irish-Celtic culture, and our party is no different. Where our righteous platform differs however is in that we do not wish to merely revive the old and deeply conservative traditions of our past, for we also seek to reform them to better fit our modern sensibilities while distancing it from ideas of religion and traditionalism. We must revive this past legacy and drag it into the light of modernity, creating a reborn and reformed Gaelic identity, language, and culture to support this free and independent Irish republic."
IRE_Call_For_Peace: "A Renewed Call for National Peace"
IRE_Call_For_Peace_desc: "Ireland has been torn asunder by civil debate and conflict, with the people each pining for their own idealized version of an Irish state. We must work to usher in a new age of peace and unity across the Emerald Isle so that all may be united in purpose and direction. Though we do not expect all to join our party, the goal is to create a peaceful and open nation where cooperation and debate can happen naturally and peacefully regardless of party lines or ideology, allowing us to create a truly fair and free democracy upheld by our Leftist vision but open to the opinions and desires of all."
IRE_Populist_Socialism: "Populist Socialism Without Syndicalism"
IRE_Populist_Socialism_desc: "Syndicalism has scared the populace; of that we are certain. However, we cannot allow these dangerous radicals to sully the good name of our progressive mission. We must make it clear to the masses that while we pursue a Socialist democracy and seek to evolve the predatory Capitalist system, we in no way support the violent radicalism of the Syndicalist menace and their authoritarian allies, or their English benefactors. We will blaze a reform-oriented path towards true and open Leftist, supported by Irish nationalism, Socialist populism, welfare economics, and a desire to ever remain free and independent, all for the good of the Irish masses."
IRE_Threats_to_the_East_and_West: "Barbarians at Both Gates"
IRE_Threats_to_the_East_and_West_desc: "We fought hard for independence from the British, but despite their 'noble' intentions, the Union of Britain has seemed to be no better than the tyrants of old. Of course, the Royalists in Canada are no better, desiring Irish subjugation just the same. We will not hitch our wagon to either side, for we know that they only desire the domination of the Irish people and state. We shall remain steadfastly independent, resisting the machnications of both London and Ottawa as we build up a glorious social city upon the hill to protect ourselves from these rabid barbarians."
IRE_Patriotic_Leftism: "Leftist Patriotism Free From Radicalism"
IRE_Patriotic_Leftism_desc: "Irish nationalism has formed the basis of our party's platform, for despite our Leftist inclinations, we are Irishmen first and foremost. However, nationalism is often tied to ideas of violent radicalism and destructive extremism, souring these notions in the minds of the masses. We must work to foster an idea of Leftist Patriotism, for having pride in one's own nation should be as natural as breathing, as we work to create a Socialist democracy and welfare economy that supports the citizens and culture of the Emerald Isle above all other pursuits."
IRE_The_True_Hero: "Ireland's True Hero"
IRE_The_True_Hero_desc: "Despite being a divisie hero in his own right, Michael Collins stole Cathal Brugha's credit when it comes to who was the true hero of Irish Independence. Collins sought to bend to the British, and would have been happy selling our sovereignty to the Angloids in exchange for power and dominance over our Emerald Isle. We must reveal the truth to the masses, sullying the so-called 'good' name of Collins as we raise Brugha to be the one and true Father of our free and sovereign Ireland."
IRE_We_Ourselves: "We, Ourselves"
IRE_We_Ourselves_desc: "Sinn Féin Amháin, or We, Ourselves Alone, is the motto of not only Sinn Féin, but of our free Ireland at large. Coined by Irish nationalists at the beginning of the century, this motto has binded us together in our struggle for true freedom and independent prosperity. Under the ingenious and unifying vision of Brugha and his Sinn Féin, Ireland has prospered and flourished like never before, opening every door to the people as we create a Social Democratic paradise. Though our party still argues over matters of religion and economics, we shall sally forth and continue this prosperous new era for the good of all in Éire."

# Later Democratic

IRE_second_election: "1942 Elections"
IRE_second_election_desc: "Ireland's democracy has overcome the challenges to its existence, but the never-ending rattle of the ballot box only awaits the government that helped it do so. It is the people who must choose who will continue to lead them into the next term of the Dáil, and nothing is guaranteed on election day."

IRE_later_plp: "Revolution From the Ballot Box"
IRE_later_plp_desc: "Few thought it possible for true socialism to ever succeed in electoral politics, often citing government oppression and how easily reactionaries can manipulate the average voter. With the Reconstituted Labour Party emerging as victors of the most recent elections, the doubters have been proved wrong. It is now time for Ireland to return to the socialist future it was always destined to have."
IRE_coop_farming: "Cooperative Farming"
IRE_coop_farming_desc: "Even to this day farms in the nation are run in an archaic and almost feudal fashion, to the detriment of Ireland and its people. To address these outdated practices the farmers of Ireland should be encouraged to collectivise together and begin operating their farms together, hopefully improving their efficiency and cutting out any capitalist middlemen who seek to profit from their labour."
IRE_nationalise_church_institutions: "Nationalisation of Church-run Institutions"
IRE_nationalise_church_institutions_desc: "It is a disgrace that the clergy who have sat idly by while the nation's destitute suffer have such a stranglehold on many of the country's institutions. It is vital that we nationalise these institutions and hand them back to the Irish people, to whom they truly belong."
IRE_decay_of_landlordism: "Decay of Landlordism"
IRE_decay_of_landlordism_desc: "Despite the growth of socialism in Ireland there are still many who defend the practice of landlordism, arguing that \"one person's rent is another person's income.\" While the radical step of outlawing the practice completely and seizing landlord owned properties is often tempting, a more soft handed approach of a gradual increase in regulations will be received a lot better by the voting public."
IRE_widow_pensions: "Protecting Those Society Forgot"
IRE_widow_pensions_desc: "Irish society is filled with those that have been forgotten by it, in many cases intentionally so. The grieving widow, the lonely orphan, the suffering veteran, all thus far abandoned by successive Irish governments. The laws that we will now introduce to protect these vulnerable members of society, providing them access to their family pensions and additional care benefits, will hopefully one day be one of our most fondly remembered achievements."
IRE_red_future: "The Red Future"
IRE_red_future_desc: "For years the green flag has flown over Dublin castle, with the foreign invaders already driven back across the sea, and yet only now has Ireland begun to truly free itself from the inequalities that persisted. While Ireland has not yet fully blossomed into the socialist republic Connolly envisioned, it seems clear to many that it has been set firmly on the course of socialism and the moderately red future it will bring."

IRE_later_labour: "The Continued March of Labour"
IRE_later_labour_desc: "Having received a mandate from the people once more, it is now time for Labour to focus on implementing the many policies that had to be deprioritised in favour of resolving the Black Monday Crisis. Through a wide berth of social and economic reforms the lives of Ireland's people shall hopefully be greatly improved, and the gradual march towards a socialist future can be continued."
IRE_collaborate_with_ITUC: "Collaborating with the ITUC"
IRE_collaborate_with_ITUC_desc: "Despite sections of the ITUC abandoning the Labour Party in favour of more radical members of the socialist opposition, the ties between it and Labour are impossible to truly break. Through cooperation with the less radical members of the ITUC and supporting their plans to aid the Irish worker we can boost the nation's industrial capacity, something from which the entire country can prosper."
IRE_state_education: "State Education"
IRE_state_education_desc: "For centuries the task of educating Ireland's children has normally fallen to their parents or the local priests and nuns, often to less than stellar results. To ensure the youth are educated to a modern standard the duty to do so must be taken out of the hands of the clergy, to instead be handled by the state, with the goal of providing free education from secular teachers to the children of the nation."
IRE_industrial_development: "Promote Industrial Development"
IRE_industrial_development_desc: "New industrial developments are always a reliable way to ensure continued work for the people of Ireland, and with government involvement in the projects we can make sure that said work is also fair. By prioritising new and growing industries for this development, the jobs created should hopefully also be long lasting and be in much better positions to weather the storms of time."
IRE_modern_roads_modern_nation: "Modern Roads, Modern Nation"
IRE_modern_roads_modern_nation_desc: "These days there are two places the average Irish worker spends most of their life, the first is their bed and the second is the road on their commute to and from work. Yet still, despite their fundamental role in Irish society, many of our roads are still untarred macadam while the rest of the world has moved on to tarmacadam and asphalt. It is economically vital that this issue is addressed and our outdated roads are quickly modernised."

IRE_later_sf: "Sinn Féin's Page in the History Books"
IRE_later_sf_desc: "The story of Sinn Féin in the modern day is quite the remarkable one. From their status as the titans of the Irish independence movement, to their near-collapse during the 20's, to their shocking rebound after the collapse of the Labour Party, nobody can say that SF's history is an uninteresting one. In the modern day, Sinn Féin is a frankenstein movement of sorts; comprising loyalists to the defunct Labour Party, left-wing Sinn Féiners, to other right-wing Sinn Féiners who have stuck with the party despite all the changes. Having secured a mandate from the Irish people once more, Sinn Féin is free to implement their agenda of left-wing Irish Nationalist policies."
IRE_christian_socialist_compromise: "A Christian Socialist Compromise"
IRE_christian_socialist_compromise_desc: "Sinn Féin's relationship with the church is a complicated one. While the bulk of Labour expats favor a strongly secular Irish nation, most of Sinn Féin's original loyalists still have a soft spot towards the Catholic Church in Ireland. Cathal Bruga in particular is a figure who would not be open to any such measure that would threaten the faith of God-fearing Irishmen. With that in mind, the SF government has moved forward with a compromise agenda which emphasizes the teachings of Jesus Christ while also pushing for a strong and secular Irish nation."

IRE_later_cnat: "The Cause of the Countryside"
IRE_later_cnat_desc: "The impression left on the voting public from [GetIreAgrarianParty]'s role in the coalition has propelled them to being now the largest party in government. Now leading a coalition of its own, it is time for CnT to fulfil the promises of their election campaign and bring forth a much more agrarian focused political vision for the nation."
IRE_drain_boglands: "Draining the Boglands"
IRE_drain_boglands_desc: "The creation of new farmland should always be a priority for any government, and in Ireland the many widespread tracts of bogland are perfect places to establish these new farms. By working hard to drain these boglands and reclaim the land they sit on, we can create a great deal of land perfect for crop farming and animal grazing."
IRE_sustainable_forestry: "Sustainable Forestry"
IRE_sustainable_forestry_desc: "Ireland is one of the few places in Europe still home to the beautiful temperate rainforests that once dotted much of the landscape. Centuries of deforestation has however depleted much of the nation's tree coverage, and if action is not taken they may be destroyed for good. To help prevent this grants should be issued to logging companies who practice sustainable forestry and afforestation, protecting existing forests and growing new ones as well."
IRE_minerals_development_act: "Minerals Development Act of [GetYear]"
IRE_minerals_development_act_desc: "Our great land has many untapped bounties buried beneath its surface, and it is important for our economic growth that we make use of them in a well thought out way. To aid with this an act should be passed establishing the exact legal framework on how mines should operate, how government leases should be given out, and all other details that must be addressed regarding mineral extraction and subsequent processing operations."
IRE_paving_boreens: "Paving the Boreens"
IRE_paving_boreens_desc: "Despite humble country roads being the arteries that connect the many villages and farms scattered across the country, most of these roads are little more than well trodden dirt paths. With the introduction of a rural focused infrastructure bill we can help ensure that within time these roads will be properly paved, and truly fit for their constant usage."
IRE_progressive_land_rates: "Progressive Land Rates"
IRE_progressive_land_rates_desc: "If one were to ask the many farmers across the nation what is the hardest thing to deal with in their line of work, the answer of harsh land rates would almost certainly be one of the most common responses. Through a progressive reformation of the land rate system we can ensure that the burden placed upon the common farmer is lessened, helping us win support and weaken the strength of alternative proposals by the nation's radical elements."
IRE_golden_moderation: "Golden Moderation"
IRE_golden_moderation_desc: "With most things in life reserved moderation is often the best approach, and nowhere has this proved more true than Irish politics. Rejecting the extremes that have been advocated by people like Larkin and O'Duffy we have carved out a stable future for the nation free of the many troubles that plague the world's extremist regimes. While work is never truly done, the achievements of our moderate leadership will almost certainly leave a permanent mark upon Ireland."

IRE_later_fg: "The Straight Road is Shortest"
IRE_later_fg_desc: "Few parties can maintain their rule after already having eight years in office, but it seems that Fine Gael's great resurgence over the past few years has not only allowed them to win once more at the polls, they have done so with an even larger share of the vote. While this new term is very much expected to be little more than business as usual, the Irish public have decided that is exactly what is needed in today's chaotic world."
IRE_father_of_republic: "Father of the Republic"
IRE_father_of_republic_desc: "While people may credit Wolfe Tone as originator of Irish republicanism, and Pádraig Pearse for its revitalisation, without the great Arthur Griffith it is hard to imagine how the modern Irish state could exist. The impact this Irish hero has had on the nation has often been discounted, but to ensure his recognition it is time for the government to lead the charge on commemorating his accomplishments."
IRE_international_port_belfast: "International Port of Belfast"
IRE_international_port_belfast_desc: "When Britain's empire collapsed and reunification was achieved, Belfast and its great shipbuilders suffered greatly. In this time companies like Harland & Wolff survived by shifting almost entirely towards commerical work, earning Belfast a global reputation for commerce. Even with times becoming less desperate for shipbuilders, Belfast has cemented itself as one of the most important commercial ports, and with government support it could soon outshine all others."
IRE_sidestep_church: "Sidestep the Church"
IRE_sidestep_church_desc: "The vital role the Church plays in Irish society is of course something that few wish to directly challenge. At the same time, there are many duties to which the Church taking a less direct role would clearly be to the benefit of both the Church itself and the government. Through the delicate shifting of responsibilities we can help ensure that those roles best left to the government are actually left to it, rather than left in the busy hands of the clergy."
IRE_adopt_bismarck_model: "Adopt the Bismarck Model"
IRE_adopt_bismarck_model_desc: "One of Otto von Bismarck's finest accomplishments was the introduction of his health insurance model that has since helped provide care to millions of Germans who would have otherwise been without, cutting off a vital avenue for the most radical socialists to gather support. With such a strong example set by the Germans in this field, it would be imperative for us to introduce a similar healthcare system for Ireland and its people."
IRE_eternal_vigilance_of_big_mick: "Eternal Vigilance of the Big Fellow"
IRE_eternal_vigilance_of_big_mick_desc: "For as long as Ireland has been free, there has been one man who has ever presently guided it through thick and thin, in official positions of power and even from the sidelines. Whether people choose to refer to him as Ireland's Architect, the Tinpot Tyrant, or simply just the Big Fellow, it is clear to all that the future of the Irish state will always be irrevocably tied to the legacy of Michael Collins."
IRE_representative_national_government: "Representative National Government"
IRE_representative_national_government_desc: "In 1916 Ireland's martyrs laid out their grand promises of a permanent national government, \"representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women.\", to guarantee liberty and freedom for all of the nation's peoples. While these freedoms may have slowly begun to lapse in the recent years, it is time for the new leadership of Fine Gael to once and for all guarantee these immutable rights first proclaimed so many years ago."
IRE_international_port: "International Port of Belfast"
IRE_international_port_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the old order in Britain, Belfast has slowly become one of the most important ports in the world when it comes to shipmaking. Having provided ship construction and repairs for countless nations and groups already, the shipyards of Belfast have significantly grown as a result of support from the government and many have begun to regard Belfast as one of the most important ports in the world."

IRE_later_lemass: "A Fair Deal For All"
IRE_later_lemass_desc: "The results of the election are clear, Seán Lemass and his more 'Liberal' branch of Fianna Fáil have emerged as the largest party in the Dáil. With much of the Irish public attributing most of the past few year's worth of economic developments to FF, and a campaign based around improving the lives of all Irish men and women through financial growth, FF seem set to deliver on a strong capitalist message for the Irish nation."
IRE_international_investment_hub: "International Investment Hub"
IRE_international_investment_hub_desc: "With many investors still shaken by the aftermath of Black Monday and the conflict in America, an ample opportunity has been presented to us to fill the void this has left. Through negotiations with foreign businesses and a diplomatic outreach campaign advertising Dublin as a stable home for international business, we may one day see our quaint little city become a true capital of global finance."
IRE_villages_to_towns: "From Villages to Towns"
IRE_villages_to_towns_desc: "While Ireland's great cities serve a vital role in the economy, economic growth cannot come from just a few major urban centres lest we wish to accept the consequences of their eventual stagnation. Instead government policy should be based around supporting the growth of promising rural areas in the nation, growing many of these small settlements into well developed and respectable towns capable of proper commerce."
IRE_nation_two_peoples: "Nation of Two Peoples"
IRE_nation_two_peoples_desc: "Like all nations Ireland is not a perfect nation, and suffers from many unfortunate flaws. The gravest of these flaws is how much of the nation views many of their Anglo-Irish and Ulster-Scots countrymen as little more than foreign invaders, when many of them have never known any land but our great isle as their home. It is time for the government to truly recognise these men and women as our brothers and sisters, and help finally shatter this flawed perception of them."
IRE_educated_workforce: "An Educated Workforce"
IRE_educated_workforce_desc: "Investing in a nation's education is one of the strongest avenues for economic growth, and one often overlooked by those blinded with a short sighted approach to finance. By providing free secondary level education to every child in the nation we can help ensure that tomorrow's workforce will be ready for anything that faces them."
IRE_noble_middle_class: "A Noble Middle Class"
IRE_noble_middle_class_desc: "Gone are the days of the feudal elite and the peasants stuck beneath them, in our modern nation any man or woman who truly puts in enough work will be fairly rewarded with a comfortable life for themselves and their family. Many of the nation's hardest workers have already risen up to become part of our strong middle class, and the example they have set should be one promoted to all of Ireland's citizens."
IRE_global_centre_finance: "A New Global Centre of Finance"
IRE_global_centre_finance_desc: "Compared to the economic giants of the world, the Germanys, the Austrias, and even the Japans, Ireland has always been the underdog that few could have expected much from. Yet with a strong economic vision and an expertly curated government approach, Ireland under the guidance of FF has slowly been transformed into a nation ready to compete against any of these behemoths on the financial stage."
IRE_anglo_irish_heritage: "Anglo-Irish Heritage"
IRE_anglo_irish_heritage_desc: "Ireland, especially Ulster in particular, has for centuries been a place that both those of Irish and British descent have called home. While to many across the nation Ireland is foremost the home of the Irish people, the Irish Government has embarked on a campaign to change this view. With a focus on promoting the shared history and heritage of both of these major groups that call the nation home, the government hopes that in time many will begin to see these men and women as nothing more than their fellow countrymen."

IRE_later_ff_valera: "Ensuring the Life That God Desires"
IRE_later_ff_valera_desc: "Campaigning on a message of continued social reform for the nation, Valera's Fianna Fáil has received a majority of seats in the Dáil. With most of the nation's economic troubles solved, it seems now is the perfect time for the party to switch its focus primarily towards implementing their promised Christian and conservative social policies."
IRE_social_welfare_schemes: "Social Welfare Schemes"
IRE_social_welfare_schemes_desc: "Many too caught up in modern politics often forget that providing care for the downtrodden is not a socialist idea, it is at its heart a pure Christian policy through and through. It should therefore be government policy to extend unemployment insurance and child care allowances, so that we can provide care for our fellow countrymen to get through their hardships."
IRE_arrows_adversity: "Ward Off the Arrows of Adversity"
IRE_arrows_adversity_desc: "With Fianna Fáil's position secure it is time for the government to lay out the plans for fighting back against the threats to the nation. Ireland must be safe from undemocratic dictatorships, from the dictated constitutions of socialist states, and from corrupt politicians who wish to profit while their people suffer. Only an Ireland free from these scourges can truly prosper."
IRE_people_tradition_faith: "People of Tradition and Faith"
IRE_people_tradition_faith_desc: "The Catholic faith is one of the strongest pillars of Irish identity, and the Church itself has occupied a role in our society that has been fundamentally irreplaceable since its first establishment on our isle. Yet there is still more the Church can do for the nation, and the duties that come with their privileged position must be further expanded for the good of the nation."
IRE_rights_family: "Legislate the Rights of Family"
IRE_rights_family_desc: "Many in the world have a warped idea of what success means, viewing it through an exclusively worldly lens focused on mundane riches or status in society. The truest form of success in life is the one most overlooked, the establishment and development of a large and devout family. Aiding our people in achieving this joy should be a government priority, and codifying the sacred right of these families will be a vital step towards doing so."
IRE_nation_small_farmers: "Nation of Small Farmers"
IRE_nation_small_farmers_desc: "The roots of Irish identity is found in its farms, those owned by the common Gael to provide for himself and his community. Mass urbanisation and industrialisation has caused many of these farmers to be left behind economically, and efforts must be made to aid these common people. Full government support should be provided to them so that they can continue the practice of their wonderful and traditional lifestyle."
IRE_ireland_we_dream_of: "The Ireland That We Dreamed Of"
IRE_ireland_we_dream_of_desc: "As so many previous generations have done, Fianna Fáil has fought to create an Ireland where its people live a life that God desires that men should live. The party has truly committed itself to strengthening the Christian heart and soul of the nation, freeing its peoples from hardship, and protecting that which we hold dear. Work like this is however never done, but it is clear that Ireland is now back onto the right path for a noble future."

IRE_later_an: "Voice of the True Gaels"
IRE_later_an_desc: "Championing a message few other parties dared to speak, the parliamentarian wing of the Army Comrades Association, better known as the Cumann Corpruiteac Náisiúnta or National Corporate Party has managed to climb up from being a junior coalition member to now being the largest party in government. While most expect this new government to be less radical compared to the more extreme abstentionists of CCN, it seems apparent that the nation is now set on a path towards intense traditionalism and the gradual teardown of the democratic system."
IRE_gaelic_state: "Stát na nGaedheal"
IRE_gaelic_state_desc: "The Gaelic identity is the heart of the Irish nation, and despite the best efforts of foreign rulers there are those who have maintained our wonderful culture up to the modern day. Aiding the people in the Gaeltacht and upping funding for Irish-language initiatives will be vital for keeping our ethno-cultural identity alive and spreading it back to the rest of the nation, thus it should be one of the new government's greatest priorities."
IRE_pious_republic: "The Pious Republic"
IRE_pious_republic_desc: "The Catholic faith is the only true faith of the nation, and attempts to recognise foreign religions by previous governments have left a great stain on the country's legacy. With full control over government apparatus we now have the opportunity to officially decree the immutable position of Catholicism as the singular faith of our people, and help ensure its spread once more throughout all of Irish society."
IRE_managed_democracy: "Managed Democracy"
IRE_managed_democracy_desc: "While a healthy democracy can be good for a nation, allowing those who wish to destroy our nation to run in elections will lead to nothing but ruin and national decay. Just as a tree will grow sick if not properly pruned, so too will the electoral system. To ensure this does not happen, these radical destructive elements must be barred from taking part in future elections on both the national and local level."
IRE_republic_free_from_chaos: "A Republic Free From Chaos"
IRE_republic_free_from_chaos_desc: "While there are many elements that make up the policy of Cumann Corpruiteac Náisiúnta there is one simple message at the heart of their rule, order. If there is one message that now reverberates across the nation, it is this message of order. An order free from divisive democracy, an order free from destructive heresy, and an orderly republic free from the chaos that the government has said that these vices bring."

IRE_Socialism: "An Chomhdháil Siondacáiteach"
IRE_Socialism_desc: "Despite the expectations of our political rivals, we have triumphed, and Ireland now stands bathed in a new glow of red and crimson. Socialism has made its way to the Emerald Isle, and now our island stands at the mercy of these radical ideologues. An Chomhdháil Siondacáiteach, or the Syndicate Conference, shall now commence in order to determine the direction of this new Leftist-dominated democratic republic we have forged. To the Revolutionary Dáil!"
IRE_Arms_From_Internationale: "Aid from the Internationale"
IRE_Arms_From_Internationale_desc: "Do we hate subjugation at the hands of foreign powers? Yes, we do; however we can not deny the strength and prowess of the Third Internationale. If we are to survive as a socialist state, we need the backing of the world's foremost group of socialists, even if that means groveling to London. While the Union of Britain is our nextdoor neighbor, many within the government favor working with the French Commune, likening their support to the support France granted in the Irish Rebellion of 1798 under Jean Humbert. This prospect is more palatable to many mainline Socialists, and as such, this policy of begrudging cooperation more closely tied to Paris over London shall become Irish policy."
IRE_Deal_With_Collins: "Dethrone the 'Big Fellow'"
IRE_Deal_With_Collins_desc: "Despite losing his seat of power, Collins has continued to decry the new Syndicalist government; claiming Larkin to be no more than a puppet of London's machinations. He and his supporters have declared that the IWL and its allies have sold out to the Union of Britain, and that Ireland will soon fall under Britannia's grasp just as in the days of old; this time with a new coat of red paint. While there is no truth to these absurdities, Collins still remains a dangerous force; and one that must be reckoned with soon. We will take out the 'Big Fellow' once and for all, and lay waste to his mindless mob of pro-German supporters."
IRE_Replace_Provisional_Govt: "Moving On Under the Starry Plow"
IRE_Replace_Provisional_Govt_desc: "Now that James Connolly's dream has been put into action, we are set to replace the provisional government with a reborn unicameral Revolutionary Dáil. Though there exists quite a large variety of various Socialist and Laborist organizations that have worked together to make this dream a reality, the looming elections are dominated by three main factions, being the radical Social Nationalists of Saor Éire led by Peadar O'Donnell, the Syndicalist Irish Worker League led by Jim Larkin, the new Labour party led by William O'Brien, and the Revolutionary Workers Group led by Totalist James Gralton. As our first elections of this infantiles socialist democracy are now organized, our Emerald Isle prepares itself for its crimson transformation as we decide as a free people who shall push the Starry Plow."

IRE_Labour_Victory: "Labour Victory"
IRE_Labour_Victory_desc: "Príomh Aire, or President of the Dáil, William X. O'Brien and his faction of Irish Labourists and Social Democrats have won out in the first elections of the Revolutionary Dáil. The Labour party's return from the dead has surprised even the most ardent socialists, as moderates flock to the reborn party as the former conservative Irish system is dismantled.  Larkin may have split the Labour movement in twain, almost dooming them, but he is the true heir of Connolly's vision, and while Larkin was the man to bring the revolution to Ireland, O'Brien has had the last laugh, for Labour is once again on top of the Irish socialist scene. Now, promising to pave an Irish pathway to socialism while keeping the nation's democratic system intact, we shall bring true egalitarian prosperity to the Emerald Isle!"
IRE_Moderate_Revolution: "A Moderate Irish Revolution"
IRE_Moderate_Revolution_desc: "While our nation's revolution by ballot might tempt certain groups who want to revolutionize the system beyond all recognition, we will not allow them to turn Ireland into a dictatorship or some Communist or Syndicalist hellhole. The Red Revolution that Labour pledges to bring to Ireland will be an outstandingly moderate one; turning Ireland into a pink-red socialist state that will bring prosperity and liberty to all of its citizens without destroying what makes Ireland Ireland."
IRE_Weaken_Executive: "Weaken the Executive Position"
IRE_Weaken_Executive_desc: "Rivals like Larkin might want to centralize the power of the state within the hands of one man, but O'Brien and the Labour party knows that the solution is not more executive power, but rather less. By weakening the Príomh Aire's position, we will ensure that no man will come to bring tyranny to Ireland once more. Many radicals may have been tempted by Ireland's red dawn, but we will not let them strip away from us the rights we have toiled so hard to guarantee, and the advent of a strong Legislative Dáil and Cúirt Uachtarach na hÉireann, the three branches of government shall work together equally with checks and balances to ensure authoritarianism never crops up. The Emerald Isle will remain a haven of democracy and liberty; now and forevermore."
IRE_Workers_Army: "The Irish Citizen's Army"
IRE_Workers_Army_desc: "While paramilitaries are typically the mark of radicals who wish to bully the citizenry into submission,the ICA, or Irish Citizen Army will work for the safety of the people of Ireland; not against. Formed from Trade Union members to defend the workers against police brutality, the ICA fell apart due to ideological infighting along with the Labour party, but with the Labour party firmly in power and united in purpose, the ICA has been revived and expanded without fear of another collapse. With the ICA by our side, the workers of our fair Éire will be free and safe from all those who wish to see them in chains."
IRE_True_Democratic_Socialism: "True Democratic Socialism"
IRE_True_Democratic_Socialism_desc: "Ireland's path to socialism was paved at the ballot box; the people used their collective voice to cast down the corrupt, ending our old system of reactionary opression without a drop of blood shed. And while many have tried to strip away our inalienable democratic rights, we shall not allow radicals to destroy what our forefathers worked so hard to achieve. We will not yield to autocrats, not the reactionaries who are now nothing but underground rebels, or radical leftists who wish to completely replace the Irish system as it stands."

IRE_Trade_Union_Commitment: "Unionize Ireland"
IRE_Trade_Union_Commitment_desc: "Through the ballot box, we have won the first great battle for the soul of Ireland; however our work is not done yet. The time has come to unionize Ireland, keeping the oppressive ruling class from undermining the liberty of the workers, forming a new collective that will keep our Labour force safe from the politicking of unjust capitalists. James Connolly was not the first to try and bring the safety of unionization to the Emerald Isle, and by God he won't be the last. Under the leadership of O'Briens ICTU, unionism shall spread to all of Ireland's disciplines without fear of radicalism or reactionary thought."

IRE_IWL_Victory: "Triumph of the IWL"
IRE_IWL_Victory_desc: "Cathaoirleach, or Chairman of the Dáil, Jim Larkin and his faction of Irish Syndicalists and Unionists have won out in the first elections of the Revolutionary Dáil. Under the watch of the IW, Ireland shall bathe itself in the crimson glow of Syndicalism as the new dominant form of Leftist thought entrenches itself here in Ireland. Trade Unionism, Syndicalist economics, Labourism, and international cooperation with the wider Syndicalist powers shall ensure as the gears of the Revolution begin to mesh and spin together in unison for the good of all cogs."
IRE_Irish_Trade_Union_Unity: "Unite Under the ICTU"
IRE_Irish_Trade_Union_Unity_desc: "Unionism in Ireland is an uneasy topic, to say the least. The Irish Trades Union Congress was formed in 1894, and serves as the main labor federation and national trade union centre on the island, uniting disparate industries and trades under a shared banner. However, many fear that this organization has been tainted by the Anglos and their selfish ideas, while the radicals within our ranks feel as though this dated organization is not nearly Syndicalist enough. To remedy this split while also centralizing power and economic control into the hands of the government and the people, a new trade union congress shall be created, called the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, or the ICTU. This new Labourist and Trade Unionist body shall unite the varied craft unions with the unions of our larger industries, creating a uniform and nationalized economy to benefit our rise to Syndicalism."
IRE_Christian_Syndicalism: "Syndicalism Under God"
IRE_Christian_Syndicalism_desc: "There is no antagonism between the Cross and Socialism! A man can pray to Jesus the Carpenter, and be a better Socialist for it, for some of our most important craft unions are unions of carpenters who labor away for God and Nation. Rightly understood, there is no conflict between our Syndicalist vision and the holy and righteous vision of Christ. We stand by the Cross just as we stand by Proudhoun and Bakunin. Both 'What is Property' and the Bible are to me Holy Books, now and forever!"

IRE_Gallant_Allies_Abroad_desc: "Cathaoirleach Jim Larkin has allies across the Syndicalist world, particularly within the American IWW led by his dear friend and fellow labor leader Big Bill Haywood, and within the French CGT. By utilizing these ties and connections, Larkin hopes to begin a new age for Ireland, supported by International Syndicalism for the betterment of the global Proletariat, and for all Irishmen. Through new trade deals, diplomatic agreements, alliances, and more, we and our allies, both old and new, shall prosper like never before as we walk side-by-side into this new crimson dawn."

IRE_Anti_Capitalist_Crusade: "Commitment Against Capitalism"
IRE_Anti_Capitalist_Crusade_desc: "Predatory Capitalism has proven again and again to be behind the many evils that have terrorized our fair Emerald Isle. British greed caused the Potato Famine, British greed proposed that the people of Ireland sell their own children, and British greed has led to centuries of unjust exploitation of our people, and Irish Capitalism has been an ally to British interests the whole time!. The bloodlust for money that the British upper class holds, and the aided at every step by domestic capitalist parasites; has devastated our people for long enough, the system that profigates the suffering of our people must end here and now."

IRE_Saor_Eire_Victory_desc: "Uachtarán, or President of the Dáil, Peadar O'Donnell and his zealous faction of radicals have won out in the first elections of the Revolutionary Dáil. Deeply tied to Agrarian Socialism, Ruralism, Gaelic Revivalism, and radical democratic Irish Nationalism, the party of 'Free Ireland' is expected to bring about a societal overhaul of our island as they shift away from the urban focus that has stagnated and bastardized Ireland, instead bathing the nation in the deep red of Republican Socialism."
IRE_Irish_Social_Revolution: "Towards an Irish Social Revolution"
IRE_Irish_Social_Revolution_desc: "Inspired by his work running a commune out on Arranmore Island during his time as a teacher before our independence, O'Donnell has advocated heavily for a complete social revolution in Ireland. Changing the political and economic face of Ireland is not nearly enough, for our culture, technology, philosophy, culture, and very identity all must become free and crimson if we are to achieve true Socialism. However, such a sudden upheaval is likely to cause growing pains, so we must be careful as to not bring about more harm and violence than good as we endeavor to transform the very meaning of being Irish itself."
IRE_Paint_IRA_Red: "Shift the IRA Towards the Left"
IRE_Paint_IRA_Red_desc: "O'Donnell believed that the IRA should have adopted the people's cause and supported land redistribution and workers' rights, but instead the IRA largely has fallen to Catholic Nationalism and Conservative stagnace as a group of petit bourgeoisie, and has largely left the South fall into destitution as they rampaged across Ulster. To remedy this, the IRA must be reclaimed as the workers organization it was always meant to be, fused with the noble Socialist heroes in the Irish Citizen Army and the Irishwomen's Council (Cumann na mBan) to become the Social Nationalist militant arm of our social revolution and the defenders of our new Red dogma. Only then can Connolly's dream be made a reality."

IRE_Connollys_Dream_Made_Real_desc: "James Connoly is the one true hero of Irish independence and Socialism. Always opposing British dominance over our island, Connolly led the Irish Citizen Army against our foes before being tragically murdered at the hands of the British. Though this hero has passed on, his vision and dream is carried on by Saor Éire, and under Cathaoirleach O'Donnell, this Socialist dream is finally being realized across the Ruby Isle. We shall endeavor to always honor Connolly as the Father of Free Ireland, and shall continue his ideas of Leftist Nationalism and Agrarian social progress as we continue to free Ireland's proletariat from the chains that bind them."

IRE_Socialist_Irish_Nationalism: "Irish Social Nationalism"
IRE_Socialist_Irish_Nationalism_desc: "Nationalism is a concept that has long been tainted by deluded dreamers and radical ultranationalists, and while many weaker socialists have been led astray by internationalist ideals, we in Ireland know that nationalism and socialism are not contradictory concepts. We shall embrace Irish nationalism fused with our Gaelic language and traditions, supporting the will of the people to be a seperate, independent, and undoubtedly superior state from our neighbors to the East. To that end, we shall aid in the preservation and expansion of Galic culture, restoring and fostering the Irish language, culture, and games."

IRE_RWG_Victory: "Victory of the RWP"
IRE_RWG_Victory_desc: "Ceannasaí, or Boss of the Dáil, James Gralton and his radical group of Communist extremists have won the first elections of the Revolutionary Dáil. The success of the various Revolutionary Workers Groups that once acted independently to achieve a revolution is now apparent, and now united as one, a true Revolutionary Workers' Party can now rise to bring industrialized and urban-focused Marxism to Ireland."
IRE_Renovate_Irish_Culture: "Renovate Irish Culture"
IRE_Renovate_Irish_Culture_desc: "One of Gralton's key beliefs is that Irish culture is inherently Conservative, Traditionalist, and all-around backwards, which has caused Leftism and revolutionary thought to have trouble gaining traction in the past. In order to rectify this reality, Ceannasaí Gralton has pushed for a complete overhaul of Irish culture modeled on modern American 'liberal' Leftist culture and ideas as spouted by the likes of Earl Browder, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr., Meyer London, Gus Hall, and other contemporaries. With a new Irish identity and culture linked to Socialism from the start, there is no way that the Revolution can fail!"

IRE_Campaign_Against_the_Church_desc: "Unlike most parties in Ireland, our RWP is vehemently against the Catholic Church. Though we are not an atheistic party outright despite the beliefs of some of our members, we do preach Secularism, and we woefully despise the power the Church and the Pope in Rome has over our island. No longer shall we let a foreign body meddle in the affairs of this red republic, and no longer shall we let them infect the minds and souls of the masses with Conservative nonsense. If Christianity is to survive in Ireland, it must adapt and modernize along with us, lest it fall before the sword of the Revolution."
IRE_New_Red_IRA: "A New, Red IRA"
IRE_New_Red_IRA_desc: "The IRA, though once a proud group of freedom fighters, has fallen to Catholic Nationalism, Capitalist decadence, and stagnating Conservatism, creating a cesspit of reactionary thought and petit bourgeois. Unlike our allies on the Left however, we know the truth is that the IRA is truly too far gone to be saved. Instead of trying to salvage a failed system, we shall create a new form of the IRA, dubbed the Irish Citizens Army after the various Leftist militias that helped fight for our independence. This newly reforged ICA shall defend our island and the Revolution as Ceannasaí Gralton continues to bring about a true Marxist paradise."
IRE_Secret_Police: "Create the CPAI"
IRE_Secret_Police_desc: "While Comrádaí Gralton has worked hard to transform Ireland into a proletarian paradise, many within Ireland still cling to the past, and are determined to resist Gralton's new order at any cost. To alleviate the pressure caused by these traitors, the Ceannasaí has authorized the creation of the Coimisiún an Phobail um Ghnóthaí Inmheánacha, an agency with powers exceeding the power of the regular legal system."

Mainly created to serve as a unifying force above the democratic system, this new monarchy shall be a far-cry from the Absolutists on the Continent, but our eventual ruler shall be a king all the same - the uniting figurehead our disparate and divided nation sorely needs.

Crowned at the Hill of Tara under the Stone of Destiny, or Lia Fáil, these champions and heroes of old Ireland defended the nation and united the tribes, clans, and people until they were savagely dethroned by the raiding Norsemen during the reign of the last king Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair. Our new Ard-Rí must embody their legacy and learn their history if he is to become a truly noble and wise monarch, and if he is to truly unite the divided Irish people."
IRE_Truly_Irish_Monarchy: "Irish Nationalism Under the Crown"
IRE_Truly_Irish_Monarchy_desc: "Under our truly Irish monarchy, Irish Nationalism shall flourish and spread, for all Irishmen and Irishwomen must have pride in their reborn kingdom. Co-opting the nationalist movements alive and well in the democratic arena, our monarchy shall unite the masses with a shared and prideful identity and culture, ensuring that no foreign ideas or forces come to subjugate the hearts and minds of our people ever again."
IRE_Constitutionalism: "Fate of the Constitution"
IRE_Constitutionalism_desc: "Though de Valera initially envisioned this new monarchist system to merely serve as a unifying force above the democratic process, many radicals within our coalition have pushed to take this one step further, creating a truly monarchist system headed by a powerful king along the lines of Integralist thought. Despised by many, this idea would do away with the old constitution in order to make way for a new one designed entirely around the crown from the start. We must decide on the fate of the Constitution, and in turn, the fate of our political system and government in whole."
IRE_Modernized_Monarchy: "A Modernized Kingdom"
IRE_Modernized_Monarchy_desc: "Under our Irish Ard-Rí, Ireland has managed to keep one foot in our storied past as the other rockets towards modernity and ever-inching progress. Supported by mediated Capitalist economics, modernized but still traditionally-sensitive cultural sensibilities, Valeraian Conservatism, and local democracy, our Kingdom is a shining example of what monarchism can achieve in this modern age. We shine out like a prosperous beacon to the world under the Crown of the Ard-Rí, so let us rejoice, for we have built a paradise like none other here on the Emerald Isle."

IRE_German_Monarch: "A German King"
IRE_German_Monarch_desc: "It is clear that without outside support, Ireland shall fall to invaders, be they from the West across the Atlantic or from the East across the Irish sea. If we wish to remain truly independent, we must align ourselves with the Hegemon of Europe, and to that end we will crown one of their royal sons as our king, earning the favour of the Kaiser and the protection of his mighty fleet, for the good of all Ireland."
IRE_Draw_Closer_to_Germany: "Draw to Germany's Side"
IRE_Draw_Closer_to_Germany_desc: "Now that we have invited the Germans to occupy the Irish throne, it is only natural for us to draw closer to our new ally. The Germans are more than willing to accept our membership into their sphere, granting them greater influence in the Irish Sea and placing the English in a stranglehold, though this might draw us into an inevitable war with the British."
IRE_Prussian_Constitutionalism: "Adapting to Prussian Constitutionalism"
IRE_Prussian_Constitutionalism_desc: "Prussian Constitutionalism is the German federal monarchy system. Under this system, the President of the Federation is automatically the Emperor, who in-turn personally appoints the Chancellor while the legislative Reichstag had its positions filled through popular representative election. Though this system as it is would not work for Ireland, it can be adjusted to more accurately fit what we wanted from our Monarchy. As such, the High King will rule effectively as 'president' of Ireland, overseeing free and fair elections for the legislature and the Taoiseach, who will be doing most of the actual work ruling the country."
IRE_Go_Native: "Going Native"
IRE_Go_Native_desc: "The King had not expected to find Ireland such a comfortable seat to rule over, and now that he has held the crown for some time he has come to see Ireland as his true home. More so, the King has announced his disinterest in returning home to visit Germany, and has come to embrace Ireland as his own native land. He has begun to show an interest in Irish tradition, and has even voiced his interest in learning Gaelic, allowing him to feel more at one with the people he rules over. Furthermore the King has expressed an interest in receiving a true 'Irish' name, to better represent his people and his newfound nation."
IRE_German_Monarch_Irish_Spirit: "German King, Irish Spirit"
IRE_German_Monarch_Irish_Spirit_desc: "German blood may run through his veins, but our High King is as true an Irishman as any laborer in Dublin or farmer in Cork. His spirit is that of a true Irishman, and he has not been shy to show this love of his new homeland and his new kin to all. May all rejoice and prosper, for our kingdom finally has a High King who shall care for the people and protect them as needed, all while truly immersing himself in everything that is good and righteous on our Emerald Isle under the Iron Cross."

IRE_Re_Structure_The_Laws: "Governmental Restructuring"
IRE_Re_Structure_The_Laws_desc: "The creation of a new monarchist system is no easy task, and our administration is just now beginning to realize how daunting of a task this shall be. The entirety of the government must be restructured to account for the Ard-Rí now serving as the Head of State over the Dail and the county offices. From top to bottom, the nation shall be revamped and reorganized, for we are a kingdom once again!"
IRE_Legacy_of_Pearse: "Legacy of Pearse"
IRE_Legacy_of_Pearse_desc: "Patrick Henry Pearse was a beloved poet, political theorist, and revolutionary who helped create our free and independent Ireland before being wrongfully executed by the English dogs. However, Pearse was also known to many as one of the few open monarchists among our Founding Fathers along with Joseph Plunkett, Thomas MacDonagh, and de Valera himself, once predicting that by the year 2006, Ireland would be an Irish-speaking Kingdom under a new Ard-Rí as the head of state. We shall work to honor their legacy and to ensure Pearse's prediction comes true as we work to build the noble kingdom he never got to live to see."

IRE_Schizo_King_Coup: "The 'Earl of Thomond' on the Irish Throne"
IRE_Schizo_King_Coup_desc: "Rising past their enabling former allies in Fianna Fáil and subverting the democratic process entirely, the Irish Monarchist Society under Raymond Moulton Seághan O'Brien of the extinct Earldom of Thomond and Barony of Ibracken, and supposedly the closest living blood heir of the great Brian Boru, has seized control of the state and the throne from the illegitimate [IREGetFormerKing]. Claiming all other candidates to be invalid pretenders, O’Brien believes there is only man fit enough to be Ardrí na hÉireann and ruler of all Ireland - himself. Working with disillusioned and fiercely radical members of the ANH and the Blue Shirts, along with some former fringe members of FF and other de Valera-associated groups, O’Brien’s IMS shall bring a new breed of Integralist monarchism to the Emerald Isle."
IRE_Black_Legion: "Empower the Léigiún Dubh"
IRE_Black_Legion_desc: "The Black Legion, or Léigiún Dubh, of O’Brien’s IMS is the paramilitary arm of the Party, serving as O’Brien’s unmitigated and shadowy hand through which he controls all of Ireland through fear and blood. By expanding their operations, granting them greater funding and wider privileges, and by making them an official and legal part of the government apparatus, the Black Legion will ensure that the organic monarchy under the High King is protected at all costs, and that the will of O’Brien is obeyed and carried out no matter the price, free from any domestic threat."
IRE_Links_to_ANH: "An Alliance with the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe"
IRE_Links_to_ANH_desc: "With O’Brien’s own links to the organization already well established, the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe, or ANH, of John Gerald Cunningham would make ideal allies. Though we disagree on notions of nobility and elitism, a compromise using the clan system and traditional leaders of old tribal bloodlines can be made in order to stand united with our fellow Irish Nationalists, Gaelic revivalists, and Catholic Corporatists among Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin’s Celtic clique. The only hurdle shall be convincing them of our monarchist ways, but that should be easy by appealing to the group’s authoritarian and traditionalist ways."
IRE_Discredit_Previos_King: "Discredit the False Ard-Rí!"
IRE_Discredit_Previos_King_desc: "The former Ardrí na hÉireann, or High King of Ireland, was the real pretender here, for O’Brien is the true king of Ireland without doubt as the truest living heir of the legendary former high king Brian Boru. The Irish Monarchist Society must spread the real and honest truth, discrediting and blackmarking the traitorous [IREGetFormerKing] as a traitorous charlatan and pretender without any claim in order to improve our claim to power while reducing the amount of public vitriol our beloved Earl of Thomond has managed to garner since our rise."
IRE_Christian_Nationalist_Crusade: "An Irish 'Christian Nationalist Crusade'"
IRE_Christian_Nationalist_Crusade_desc: "Modeled on an American organization made by O’Brien’s friend and idol Gerald L. K. Smith, we have moved to create an Irish-born version of the Christian Nationalist Crusade that shall rout out the so-called 'Judeo-Bolshevik' menace that O'Brien says keeps Ireland and her people from achieving true greatness and pious purity. Serving as a new arm of the government, the CNC is aimed at preserving Ireland as a Christian nation being conscious of a highly organized campaign to substitute Jewish tradition for Christian tradition, and it will fight 'mongrelization' and all attempts to force the intermixture of the Black and White races in Ireland while ensuring Smith's own declared 'one world shadow government of Zion' and its elders, immigrants and Syndicalists, do not claim our beloved emerald shores."
IRE_Build_Legitimacy: "Building O'Brien’s Legitimacy"
IRE_Build_Legitimacy_desc: "High King Murrough O’Brien, Earl of Thurmond may love to style himself as a true noble of purple blood, but this ‘reality’ is ignored or lambasted through the realm. If this new kingdom under the pretender king is to survive, then the organic government beneath him must work diligently to improve O’Brien’s claim to the throne and his wider legitimacy in the eyes of the masses, doing whatever it takes to achieve such a necessary and noble goal. By utilizing his loose claim former high king Brian Boru and to the extinct Earldom of Thomond and its noble yet ancient members like Murrough I, alongside enforcement and persuasionary help from the Léigiún Dubh, O’Brien, not the now discredited [IREGetFormerKing], will be seen as the true Ardrí na hÉireann if it's the last thing our government achieves."
IRE_Thormond_Redeemed: "A New Dawn for Integralist Ireland"
IRE_Thormond_Redeemed_desc: "Despite our deeply Catholic nature, Integralist philosophy never took off in Ireland like it did in Iberia and France, at least until now. Under the IMS and Raymond O’Brien’s leadership, a new organic monarchy rules over a purely Catholic Ireland, mixing Maurrassian and Lusitanian Integralist philosophies with American conceptions of Christian Nationalism and Irish designs of a Gaelic revival to create a decentralized and absolutist system unlike anything Ireland’s ever seen. Supported by a revived Clan system, Corporatist economics and a burgeoning guilds system, Irish Nationalism, anti-Socialism, anti-Capitalism, and the extremist teachings of the Catholic Church’s most radical adherents, our new monarchy shall bring pious prosperity to all of Ireland’s true sons and daughters under the Crown."

ire.2271.d:0 "It has come as a shock to the populace of Ireland that the openly Syndicalist Irish Workers League managed to triumph in our most recent election. With the IWL's victory in a fair election (or so Larkin claims), the stage is now set to completely replace the Irish system as it stands. The abolition of Irish Capitalism and the formation of the Revolutionary Dáil are the first steps in Ireland's long path towards socialism, however as the broad coalition inches closer towards a complete grasp on power, the further the coalition splinters. On the radical camp are the radical communist James Gralton and Irish Social Nationalist Peadar O'Donnell, who both stand to completely abolish Irish Democracy as we know it. In the more moderate camp are William X. O'Brien and James Larkin, who is the current head of the IWL. Larkin has risen to prominence as the paramount leader of the Irish Left ever since the Labour Party collapsed due to internal disagreements about their stance on the Union of Britain, however with the Red Tide washing over Ireland, the Labour Party has made a stunning comeback, filling the vacuum left by Sinn Féin after its dissolution. Ironically, Sinn Féin was the party that took in many of the Labour Party's supporters when it fell apart, fueling the once defunct party's surge in power. While many more radical elements have denounced the Labour Party's opposition to more 'radical' policies as paramount to treason, it is clear that Larkin may have to begrudgingly work with his old adversary if he wants to keep Ireland from falling to the grips of radicals."

IRE_HEAVYINDUSTRY:0 "Heavy Industrial Focus"
IRE_HEAVYINDUSTRY_desc:0 "Ireland is a small nation and can only spare so much space for a military arms complex.

IRE_OFFICERSCHOOL:0 "Establish the ATÓÉ"
IRE_OFFICERSCHOOL_desc:0 "Currently, many officers in our army lack proper training as a result of our armed forces being descended from a guerrilla rather than a professional army.

IRE_WOLFHOUNDS2_desc:0 "In 1881 Irish inventor John Phillip Holland created a submarine known as the Holland Boat No. II, nicknamed the Fenian Ram, for the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Now we must follow in their footsteps and build a submarine fleet of our own to defend ourselves against the British Navy."
IRE_SCREENS:0 "Screen Research Project"

IRE_CAPITALFLEET:0 "A Grand Fleet for Ireland"
IRE_CAPITALFLEET_desc:0 "If we are to stand up to the British, we must be able to build a fleet similar to their own. While this will take a long time it will pay off in the end, just as it did for Germany which once also had a far inferior fleet to the British."
IRE_CAPITALFLEET2:0 "Better Battleships"
IRE_CAPITALFLEET2_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to build a grand fleet to match the British, we should look into the building of a Super-Heavy Battleship. While it will take a long time to build and will be expensive, the results should be worth it."
IRE_RUTHLESS:0 "Ruthless Interdiction Doctrine"

# Introduction Events
ire.2.t:0 "The State of the Republic, 1936"
ire.2.d:0 "Many years have passed since the Irish people won their independence from their former overlords, ones now exiled into the frozen Dominion beyond the Atlantic. Yet with the Revolution that rocked the British heartland, the newly independent Republic of Ireland found itself once again at the precipice of a struggle for their very existence. What's more, the political climate inside Éire has reached a boiling point. While Michael Collins and his Fine Gael had achieved numerous electoral victories thus far, the upcoming election of 1937 galvanized the opposition to his rule. Both the conservative Fianna Fáil and the social democratic Sinn Féin have mounted major campaigns aimed at unseating the 'Big Fellow', not to mention the radicals, many of which are not as cordial with Collins as O'Duffy's Comrades are, on the right and the numerous socialist groups possibly funded by London. Whatever happens in the coming years the combination of the gathering clouds over Europe and the instability in the Republic may throw the Emerald Isle into a maelstrom it can hardly recover from."
ire.2.a:0 "These are turbulent times."

ire.53.t:0 "Problems Up North"
ire.53.d:0 "Edward Carson, the former leader of the Unionist Party, died last year aged 81. He was an extremely divisive figure whilst alive and fled to England when Ireland gained her independence and took back Ulster. He was particularly reviled outside of Ulster for his persecution of beloved Irish poet and author Oscar Wilde. His memory was venerated today by loyalists in the north of Ireland, who held a memorial service in Belfast with several leading members of the UUP speaking in his name. The memorial attracted quite a crowd, showing that Carson still has power even in death. His spectre is looming over Ulster, just as the tensions and threat of rebellion loom over it as well."
ire.53.a:0 "He's a problem even from the grave."

ire.530.t:0 "Shadow of James Connolly"
ire.530.d:0 "Of the many groups which took part in the Easter Rising and the struggle for Irish Independence, few were more involved than the Irish Citizen Army and the Irish Labour Party. A hugely influential movement in their own right, the Labour party was torn apart by infighting shortly after Ireland gained independence. In a great irony, the British Revolution which ultimately freed Ireland from its chains proved to be an almost fatal blow to Socialism on the Emerald Isle, as the red ideals so fluidly exposed by the Labour party came to be unacceptable to the wider population once it became clear that the Union of Britain was no different than its royalist predecessor. Britain’s lingering influence has made the greater Irish public view Socialism as nothing more than another tool of British oppression, ultimately leading to a rapid decline in the popularity of the Labour Party. As a result, the role of Connolly and the ICA in the Easter Rising and Irish Independence has been downplayed by the Collins government, who shares the opinion that a Socialist Ireland would no doubt degenerate into a British Puppet State.\n\n The two titans of the party which rose following Connolly's execution, James Larkin and William X. O'Brien faced a bitter rivalry, especially in regards to the newly found Union of Britain. Larkin, ever the revolutionary favoured sticking by the Union of Britain, who supported Larkin’s efforts at every turn. Whether Larkin’s alliance with the British Reds was out of pragmatism or true loyalty to London is a topic for debate, as despite their contacts with London, the Irish Socialists continue to espouse Irish Nationalism and resistance against Britain; however with the focus turned to the Royalists in Canada. O'Brien, who stood in firm opposition to the British refused any aid or comfort from London’s government, viewing the new Syndicalist government as nothing more than a continuation of the United Kingdom that preceded it, just with a new coat of paint.\n\n The flip flopping of the party on the issue of the Union of Britain ultimately led to its death, with James Larkin splitting from the Labour Party to form the Irish Workers League, taking a large portion of the party with him. With the Labour Party losing a large share of its voter and support base to Larkin, the party ultimately withered. As the party collapsed, the core of the party, including some of their most influential members such as Thomas Johnson and William Norton jumped ship to Sinn Féin, which ultimately drifted to the left as a result. The collapse of the Labour Party, one of the few Irish Political parties that did not exist as an internal faction of Sinn Féin, was ironically the saving grace of the party, which was at death’s door following humiliating defeats in the previous election. With the Labour Party confined to irrelevance, the Irish left has been split between a reinvigorated Sinn Féin, and Larkin’s semi-legal Irish Workers League, who’s support from the Union of Britain has been anything but subtle.

ire.14.d:0 "The time for elections in Ireland has come at last, and with that the people head to the polls to elect Ireland's new government. Unlike every other election in recent memory, Collins is not the overwhelming favourite to win, as Fianna Fáil wages a brutal campaign against Collins; denouncing him as a jaded old war hero only kept in power by the weight of his name. Collins has shot back; both refuting these claims, and steadily working to prove to Ireland that he still has policies to bring to the table.\n Meanwhile, Sinn Fein continues positioning themselves as a non-violent and non-radical option compared to Fine Gael and Socialists; receiving a surge in power not seen since the fall of the now-defunct Irish Labour Party.\n Another dark-horse party that has been steadily gaining power is the National Center Party; which has been steadily growing since the economic slump began. While most of the major parties in contention for the seek to preserve Ireland's democratic system as-is, the Socialist Irish Worker League has been steadily gaining power with funding and support from the Union of Britain. The IWL promises to tear down Ireland's current system and usher in a Syndicalist Revolution in the Emerald Isle, and while their chances of winning the elections are very slim, if they manage to pull off a win then it would surely shake the world of Irish Politics to the core; possibly even leading to its end.\n As the votes come in, who has won?"

In the wake of Collins' death, Eoin O'Duffy, Collin's Taoiseach and leader of the Army Comrade Association, better known as the Blueshirts has taken 'temporary' control of Ireland. However with the situation in Ireland deteriorating rapidly, O'Duffy has considered simply handing control of the state to a group eager to restore order to the Emerald Isle. Stepping up with an offer to lead is the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe or Architects of Resurrection; lead by a curious man named Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin. This movement promises O'Duffy a place in the cabinet if he authorizes them to take charge, an ideal situation for O'Duffy, who desires not leadership but rather a place as a militia leader. Will O'Duffy take the ANH up on their offer?"

Collins has served as a civilian president for more than 10 years, and many see it fit to continue with Collins' now lifelong presidency; albeit enforced with an iron fist instead of leaving it to the hands of the people in corrupt and fraudulent elections. However, many in Collins' cabinet, namely one Taoiseach Eoin O'Duffy, have suggested dissolving Ireland's civilian government entirely, and formalizing Ireland as a Military Dictatorship under the Irish Republican Army watchful eye. With all powers held within Collins' hands, he is fit to shape Ireland in his vision, no longer abided by the gullible masses, what will our Ceannaire make of the government? "

Taking the hint that the populace of Ireland has grown tired of him, Collins has sworn off politics forever and seeks to maintain a quiet life as a mere officer in the Irish Army. Replacing him as the leader of Fine Gael is Richard Mulcahy, a long-time member of Fine Gael and fellow general and freedom fighter in the Irish Republican Army. This marks the end of an era for Ireland, as Fine Gael begins moving away from being just the 'Party of Collins', and instead as a party dedicated to pragmatic liberalism, Irish unity and defense against English influence.

Collins still stands to lead Ireland, but to get any meaningful governing done he must secure the support of another party to sponsor Fine Gael's legislation. While forming a coalition with Fianna Fáil is out of the question, the agrarian National Center Party and the social-democratic Sinn Féin both are open to working with Collins, at the price of concessions to their groups in the form of policies favourable to their ideals.

And while Sinn Féin has not seized the reins of power in Ireland's 1937 elections, they did manage to save Collins' presidency and forge a coalition with Fine Gael. With Sinn Féin and Fine Gael united in a new spirit of cooperation, some have proposed that Fine Gael and Sinn Féin unify into a single party. Collins was at a time one of Sinn Féin's most powerful members, who would have surely risen to lead if not for Valera casting Ireland's hero of independence out. This reckless movie born out of petty squabbles and jealousy almost doomed Sinn Féin, and once the gravity of Valera's mistake became clear, he left the party to rot. Now, with Valera gone and Sinn Féin and Fine Gael united in a spirit of cooperation, many have proposed re-unifying the two parties with Collins at its head. While Sinn Féin's leader, Cathal Brugha has not always gotten along with Collins, a united coalition of Ireland's moderate left under Collins would prove to be nearly unstoppable, guaranteeing Ireland's safety against the likes of the IWL and Fianna Fáil."

The NCP stands as Fine Gael's main sponsor, and with the alliance forged between the two parties, some have proposed unifying Fine Gael and the NCP into a single party. While the proposed absorption of the NCP into Fine Gael is not universally agreed upon, nobody can deny that a unification between the parties would provide benefit to both. Nobody can deny that the NCP is a minor party, perhaps the best chance of getting their agrarian policies put forward is to hitch their wagon to Fine Gael. "

ire.43.t:0 "Unionist Workers Clash in Belfast"
ire.43.d:0 "Following the shift in power that occurred when the British were chased out of Ireland, many Catholic business owners rose to prominence in Ulster. However, their rise in socio-economic status came often at cost to the Protestant residents of the region, who had previously enjoyed such unbridled dominance over the Catholic minority. A group of Ulster Unionist factory workers went on strike today citing unfair pay and unwarranted treatment by their Catholic employer. Their strike soon turned violent when they were attacked by what some believe to be hired thugs. Nobody was killed, although Belfast City Hospital had plenty of patients in the immediate aftermath. This will not do the tense situation in Ulster any favours."
ire.43.a:0 "This is worrying."

ire.44.t:0 "Murder in Derry"
ire.44.d:0 "The body of a young man was found this morning in a cold and desolate alleyway near the centre of Derry. According to a follow-up police report, he had been stabbed several times and left for dead. The man was previously known to the local police force as a prominent member of a Unionist volunteers group with local ties in the Waterside. There have already been cries that the murder was committed by a Catholic and that the police will turn a blind eye. However warranted or unwarranted these claims may be, the situation in Ulster is, as ever, volatile."
ire.44.a:0 "Frightening times for Derry."

ire.45.t:0 "Ulster Unionist Party Holds Rally"
ire.45.d:0 "There was a massive turn out this afternoon for a UUP rally held in the city centre of Belfast. Thousands of Ulstermen and women came out in the sunshine to listen to prominent Unionist speakers. There was plenty of time for song and dance, but just as much time for increasingly violent rhetoric regarding the status of Ulster in relation to the rest of Ireland. Whilst the words 'revolt' or 'uprising' might not have been spoken out loud, they were certainly thought. Of great concern to the Irish government will be the sheer number of people attending the rally. Clearly, the Unionist movement enjoys widespread popular support."
ire.45.a:0 "This movement is becoming increasingly popular."

ire.46.t:0 "Concert Hall Attacked in Antrim"
ire.46.d:0 "In the latest shocking incident from Ulster, a concert hall in County Antrim was subjected to a violent attack. Believed to have been carried out by the Protestant dissident group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, the attack saw several members of a Dublin band shot dead, as well as several concert goers. The motivation for the attack is believed to be another act of terrorism against the Irish state, acts that will continue as long as Ulster remains a part of Ireland, according to the movements occasional cryptic communications with the police and the public."
ire.46.a:0 "Awful."

ire.47.t:0 "Reprisal Shootings"
ire.47.d:0 "Seemingly in response to the recent violence carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force, five men with known ties to the group were found dead in a field near a farm twenty miles outside of Belfast. The victims appear to have been executed. It is believed that the men were rounded up during the night and taken together to be killed, although it is unknown at this time who might have orchestrated such an action. The tensions in Ulster are growing as the situation grows more violent, and the Irish government are facing increasing outcry at their apparent inability to address the instability of their nation."
ire.47.a:0 "The cycle of violence continues."

ire.48.t:0 "Craig Speaks Out"
ire.48.d:0 "After several years of inactivity and silence, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party has spoken out regarding the status of Ulster in the Republic of Ireland. James Craig, reported by some to have grown senile in his elder years, appeared lively and in a good mood as he viciously attacked the Irish government in his first major address of such a kind since the ceasefire of 1925. He particularly chastised the current regime and the economic neglect paid towards Ulster during the past decade, and demanded that every son and daughter of Ulster be prepared to fight for the prosperity and, if needs be, freedom of the region."
ire.48.a:0 "He should have kept his mouth shut."

ire.49.t:0 "Belfast City Hall Bombing"
ire.49.d:0 "Terror awaited Belfast as the Belfast City Hall was subjected to a massive bombing that left over fifty people dead and many more injured. The shocking attack appears to be the latest in a long line of escalating UVF attacks, and was carried out during a meeting of local political representatives. Among those killed was Thomas Carlin, local party chief for the National Centre Party. This attack has frightened the nation, and the tension in Ulster has once again reared it's ugly head but this time with devastating consequences."
ire.49.a:0 "The times we live in."

ire.50.t:0 "Grand Opera House Fire"
ire.50.d:0 "Horror at the Grand Opera House in Belfast. Several hundred people had to be evacuated in the midst of the evening's entertainment when a massive fire broke out, consuming much of the historic hall. Thirty-five people are believed to have died in the disaster and the toll could soon rise, with many still reported missing as search efforts comb through the debris hoping to find any signs of life. It is unknown what caused the fire to break out but the government is already being criticised yet again by Ulster Unionists, who claim the incident could have been avoided had the Opera House been refurbished, as a previous request to the government had suggested."
ire.50.a:0 "What a disaster."

ire.51.t:0 "Bank of Ireland Robbery"
ire.51.d:0 "Today in Belfast, the Bank of Ireland was robbed by masked gunmen, believed to be unionist dissidents. The Gardaí are searching for them as we speak, but they are most likely taking refuge and being shielded within the Unionist community."
ire.51.a:0 "Let no man rest until these men are found!"

ire.52.t:0 "Dublin Bombing"
ire.52.d:0 "At 10:30am this morning, a massive explosion went off near the Four Courts in Dublin. Five hundred people are believed dead and many more could follow when an official death count is taken. Two men believed to have been responsible for the bombing were shot dead by the Gardaí as they attempted to flee the scene and put up resistance when asked to stand down. At least one of the men has been identified as a Belfast native with known Unionist ties. This terrifying escalation of the on-going conflict in Ulster is tantamount to a declaration of war upon Ireland and her people, and the public outcry has been enormous. The Irish people are baying for blood, and it is Ulster that may have to pay the price."
ire.52.a:0 "This can't go on."

ire.58.t:0 "Unionists Planning An Uprising?"
ire.58.d:0 "Now that we find ourselves in an unfortunate state of war, there has been an unusual amount of dissent pouring in from the north of Ireland. Ulster Unionists are said to be considering their options whilst the Irish Republican Army is preoccupied with the on-going conflict, and they very well may use this opportunity to try and break free from the Republic. The consequences of such an action could be grave for the nation, as they might very well attempt to align themselves with our enemies and would provide a perfect base for an invasion of Ireland."

However, now that hostile volunteer forces have joined the Republican forces, it would be fair to say that the civil war in Ireland is not necessarily developing to our advantage. If we were to invest any more of our own military even as 'volunteers' then it could be seen as a direct act of war by our hostile neighbours in Europe and across the Atlantic.

ire.55.d:0 "Today, the 24th of April 1936, marked the 20th anniversary of the start of the 1916 Easter Rising. Many were unsure whether or not the festivities would go ahead as planned, but all fears were allayed by any instructions from the Office of the President.\n\nIt began with an elaborate military parade through the streets of Dublin, culminating in a solemn procession down O'Connell Street, in front of the General Post Office, where the Proclamation of the Irish Republic was first read out on Easter Monday. Marching bands, both brass bands and pipers, accompanied the troops, playing old Gaelic airs in a martial style. The streets were bursting with the crowds present, to the extent that some people watched from the decks of boats floating high on the Liffey.\n\nThe atmosphere was jubilant, and no onlooker would believe this was happening in a country whose economy was falling to pieces at that very moment.\n\nAs the parades stopped and the soldiers assembled, facing the GPO, a single military officer marched forward to the front of the building to read out the Proclamation, as Pádraig Pearse had done twenty years previous. But, to the surprise of both the crowds and the officials that had gathered, this was not just any officer.\n\nPresident Collins, wearing his Generals' uniform from the War of Independence, stood facing the country. The man who had perhaps done more than anyone else, to win Ireland its freedom. He began, in the only words that he could have..."

When this abated, he began a resolute address to the nation. Speaking with conviction, he acknowledged the challenges that the country was facing, and urged all to face them, together. He went on, saying that militarily, the Easter Rising itself was never going to be a success, but it was built on hope in the face of utmost desperation — much like how Ireland was now, with its current predicaments.\n\nClosing the speech, he announced that the 24th of April was to become the formally recognised Independence Day for Ireland, to be celebrated annually. This was to mark a new beginning, with Ireland's relationship with itself (he said, directing his attention towards the few token loyalists in attendance), and with the world at large.\n\nHis words were met with, at worst, quiet admiration, from across the entire political spectrum. Regardless of their position currently, all political movements in Ireland, except the loyalists, could be traced to the Easter Rising, and as such it was one of the few things that united the country. Whether or not this new beginning he spoke of meant the future for Ireland being reaffirmation of the status quo, or more radical change, was not relevant to this.\n\nFor that day alone, everyone realised that despite the ongoing rampant upheaval, they still had their so long-sought-after freedom and independence.

Throughout his working life, he had promoted Irish culture and mythology, and stressed an Irish identity that was completely separate from a British one. His greatest personal achievement was winning a Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923 for his poetry; coming at a heady time for Yeats, who had just witnessed the birth of an independent Ireland, something he had long supported. In 1922 he was appointed a member of the Senate, and spent the next several years experiencing first-hand the politics of the new state. Although during his time as senator Yeats was not affiliated with any party, not even Sinn Féin, he was not afraid to make his political views known, and was firm in the Senate in voicing his opinion on cultural and educational matters. Yeats offered a unique perspective, as he not only spoke as an artist, but also as someone who was both a Protestant and a nationalist.\n\nIn the final years of his life, Yeats became an informal supporter of the Blueshirts, drawn both to the firm paternalistic stances of Eoin O'Duffy and the mystic nationalism of Gearoid Ó Cuinneagáin. Yeats had always grated against individualism and liberalism, and the increasing influence of both upon Sinn Féin greatly displeased him. While AN were greatly pleased to learn of a supporter of Yeats' calibre, they were disappointed that they were never able to truly utilise his presence outside of Yeats creating three marching songs for the organisation.\n\nAlthough Yeats is now gone, his legacy will be long-lasting and regardless of his political views, most can acknowledge his sizable contributions to Irish cultural life."

The crisis has had a severe effect on the Irish economy as Germany and our other European trading partners have been hit by the crisis. Many scramble to find solutions, most parties proposing either Irish economic development or maintaining stability while the German economy recovers.

Collins has declared that must be dealt with; and with an iron grip on the state, Collins is in a position to deal with this traitor once and for all. Thus, Ceannaire Collins' has ordered Valera's political party, Fianna Fáil to be dissolved and banned, and for de Valera himself to be placed under arrest.\n Unfortunately, Valera seems to have been a step ahead of Collins, as he had fled to America mere days before the police were set to haul him off to prison. While having Valera lost to a land beyond the waves is not ideal, the chaotic situation in America is nowhere close to comfortable for the disgraced rebel Valera. Despite losing Valera, he has been dealt with in a fitting matter, and now the most major democratic opposition to Collins' has been thoroughly removed.

We shall destroy all royal titles and the peerage system, removing all aristocratic and Anglo taint from our class system as we seek to create a free and equal but entirely and only Irish society, equal only for Irishmen and Irishwomen. However, we could choose to pick up the scraps of the peerage system in order to truly pay homage to our ancestors by recreating the old Clan system, dividing our society up in Clans that administer their designated areas, cooperate with each other through trade and services, and that pay tribute and send military aid to Ceannaire Ó Cuinneagáin should he need it as he runs the national government and his own highest Great Clan. Alternatively, we could also harken back to our early medieval roots by reinstituting a modernized version of Brehon Law, which served as our legal system before the arrival of the Normans, the Norse, or the English, and which resulted in much of Ireland’s power being accumulated in the hands of a league of judges - first being the Druidic judges of the 5th century BCE and eventually being replaced by Insular Christian and secular judges later on before falling out of favor to English law and more modern governance styles starting in the 5th century CE - who dictated Irish culture, law, and society at large. If Brehon Law were to be revived and modernized, Ceannaire Ó Cuinneagáin would still destroy the peerage system while rising to serve as the High Druid of Ireland - our chief judiciary position - while leadings a decentralized system of judiciary jurisdictions whose own judges shall dictate the lay of the land for the rest of the counties and clans in a system mirroring how we did things before the arrival of the English and Norman invasions.

Though SF has largely shattered over ideas of secularism and economics, a new core of IRA veterans and radical nationalists have risen to lead the party. Led by the 'Three Macs' - Tony Magan, Paddy McLogan, and Tomás Óg Mac Curtain - the new SF has taken a right-ward shift, embracing a fusion of ANH-inspired Corporatism pulling from the Papal Encyclicals of Pope Pius XI, as well as from the Integralist ideas of Portugal's Estado Novo movement, with radical Christian nationalism and their own decentralized Left-wing socioeconomic positions. Far from the first time the ANH has taken inspiration from the Left, with ANH founder Ó Cuinneagáin already pulling ideas from American progressives such as Fiorello La Guardia and the Roosevelts, many have pushed for our party to ally with these newly reformed 'Right-wing Leftists', while others still spit in their direction with disdain over their so-called 'crypto-Syndicalist' ideas.

Hugo O'Neill remains as a prominent figure in Integralist circles, and while he resides in Portugal, supporters of a doomed attempt at Restoration still wish to place him on the throne of a theoretical restored Irish Monarchy. Ó Cuinneagáin has fired back at the delusions of these groups with full fury, decrying the ideals of monarchism as insane and outdated, and declaring his intention to dismantle all remaining systems of aristocracy in Ireland. While these monarchists draw parallels with the ANH's focus on Irish revivalism and the restoration of Ireland's ancient Clan-Kings, Ó Cuinneagáin has quickly shut down any link between these Restorationists and the ANH proper, solidifying their position as a Republican movement. O'Neill's clique of Luso-Integralists are not the first people to attempt to sway the ANH towards the anacronistic ideals of Monarchism, as Raymond Moulton O'Brien has also made feeble attempts to claim the Irish throne for himself with ANH backing... attempts that were met with nothing but ridicule and mockery from both the Irish Public and the Ceannaire himself.

These brigades, while for the most part unofficial, are mostly made up of angry citizens with a few Irish professors thrown in, and have been given approval from the Ceannaire to dispense justice as they please. These squads roam the street, quizzing random citizens on their proficiency of the Irish Language. Those who pass receive a pat on the back and and occasionally a drink, while those who fail are presented with two options: renounce their English-ness and attend mandatory Irish classes, or face the wrath of the brigades. Punishments are typically a large fine or small amounts of jail time, however the most egregious defenders of English Barbarism face life-long prison sentences, or in extreme cases, death."

His models for an independent Brittany include the revolutionary zeal of the Irish and the discipline of Prussian militarism, and so he regards Ó Cuinneagáin's integralist administration highly for managing to combine both in his eyes.\n\nAlthough a few are somewhat hesitant to accept this offer given the potential implications for relations with the French government-in-exile and the long history of positive Franco-Irish bonds, even if the two nations found themselves on opposite sides of the Weltkrieg, the majority are more than happy to welcome the assistance of a fellow Celtic patriot."

The hall was also used as a makeshift Dáil Court, which was often used around Ireland to counter the British legal system, often to settle matters such as land disputes. Tragically, the hall was burnt down in 1932, and as Gralton was deported not a year later, he never had a chance to rebuild. However, with Gralton's exile ending once Ireland embraced the red glow of socialism, he was given a golden opportunity to rebuild his beloved hall. And while he had previously been too wrapped up in executive matters to attend to its re-construction, today the Ceannasaí has ordered a building crew into Effrinagh, where they will rebuild the hall just as it stood. While the hall's reconstruction was met with jubilation from Republicans, farmers, and trade unionists, several priests within the area decried the hall as a 'den of prostitution and syndicalism', and rallied several local citizens in a protest against it; quickly leading to violent indicents. Following these protests, Gralton ordered the local red guard to capture all who were part of these incidents, and to find the local priests responsible for the agitation and swiftly imprison them."

Gralton's first stay in the United States saw him working as a taxi driver and bartender, it was in America where he first became immersed in American culture, eventually coming to the belief that the only way Ireland would ever accept socialism would be if Ireland's inherently conservative culture was completely replaced with an American model. Now that Gralton is in power, he has the power to put his radical plan into action; and while there has been significant resistance to Gralton's 'Irish Social Revolution, even within the traditionally revolutionary IRA, there is no doubt that with the Ceannasaí in charge, Ireland will never be the same again"

The newest one of these factions is greatly inspired by the theory of 'Popular Communism' which has been pioneered by the Socialist Party of America's Earl Browder. While remaining mostly loyal to orthodox Marxist teaching, Popular Communism seeks to unite the entire Left in a single front, both to increase the Party's own popularity but also to end any infighting within the Left, and to hype focus the entirety of the Proletariat against its oppressors. Due to this, and due to our own ties with the SPA, the faction has reached quite the popularity.

However, many within her ranks have pushed for Sinclair to not only be made a major cabinet member of the government, but further push to have her made executive of the nation.

By far most popular candidate is James Larkin Jnr, the son of Ireland’s most prominent revolutionary: James Larkin, as well as a notable member of the RWG, something which has caused significant tension between him and his father. If the younger Larkin gains the executive seat it is safe to say that little would change, as Larkin Jnr. continues down the path which Gralton set Ireland down.\n\n Another candidate that has been floated is Frank Ryan, a noted Irish Nationalist and supporter of the Maximist cause.

Gralton's loss was a bitter one, and one he refused to let go; as the famed revolutionary went on a campaign of protesting the new government, calling [IRE.GetLeader] and his party nothing but a bunch of 'crypto-capitalist imperialist puppets'.\n The conflict between Gralton and the central government reached a climax when Gralton's Pearse–Connolly memorial hall, was burned down for a second time after being rebuilt. The central government blamed a gang of renegade priests, however Gralton himself blames a chapter of the local IRA, who see Gralton as 'to radical'. Gralton's baseless slander against the local IRA has led to a clash between a band of soldiers and a few armed Vanguardist militants, leading to 5 people dead and more soldiers injured.\n This incident proved to be the final straw for the central government, who declared him an alien and ordered him to be deported once more.

He was educated in the prestigious military academy at Sandhurst, describing it as the place where he learned most of \"fortification and fornication\". The Second Boer War was his crucible, where he took part in many battles, was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order, but it is also where he developed his loathing of the British establishment.\n\nAfter the war, he served as aide-de-camp to his father who was Governor of Gibraltar, during which time he met both the King and Kaiser. But in the end, it would be Ireland that he served, as his eventual return home resulted in him abandoning the usual beliefs of his background, going from unionist, to Home Ruler, to republican and finally to socialist.\n\nWhite left the ICA just before the Rising due to disagreements in its organisation, and spent the War of Independence in the political wilderness. However, the revolutions occurring since the Weltkrieg have inspired him to once more take up arms in the name of Ireland. With his aristocratic background, dapper appearance, and flamboyant air, combined with anti-authoritarian, anti-clerical semi-anarchistic Christian socialist ideals, this misfit is crucial to the consolidation and continuation of the socialist republic."

Thankfully the infamous general has not returned from the grave, but Irish politicians at home have raised the hypocrisy of Britain pledging its support to Ireland on the world stage yet glorifying a butcher of the Irish people at home. Since their revolution in 1925, the new British republic has drawn many a connection between its own polity and the Commonwealth of old with Cromwell entering a revered place that was once occupied by Kings and Queens of old. Naturally, this has caused notable resentment in Ireland and considerable embarrassment to John Maffey, the long-running British ambassador to Ireland.\n\nAs the issue has grown in notoriety, particular ire has been levelled at the so-called \"Five Great Statues\" of Cromwell, spread around the country, which have long since become places of display for admiration Cromwell. Popular demands have called on the British to tear them down at last, and end their veneration of a glorified military dictator who massacred innocents in the name of conquest. With the issue becoming increasingly to large to ignore, Maffey has assured the government that he will raise the issue back in London, but has warned that there will likely be considerable resistance from the British government that will have a tough time spinning the issue but may, hopefully, appreciate the international propaganda victory here."

Wythenshawe of Manchester; Warrington of Cheshire; Bradford city Hall; St. Ives of Cambridge and Westminster Palace are all home to a statue of the former Lord Protector, a figure of considerable veneration in modern British lore and propaganda. Seen as a spiritual predecessor to the modern republic, and long an object of praise by the Labour Party for the Regicide and his \"clearing\" of the Lords, Cromwell is admired and often invoked by many British politicians while holding a special place as a sort of pseudo-folk hero among the populace. But while in Britain it is a national habit to focus on the glorious Commonwealth founded upon his labours, the British discourse often glosses over his actions in Ireland which can not be seen as anything other than murderous.\n\nSuch veneration, and the supposed hypocrisy of venerating Cromwell at home while pledging our support and solidarity to Ireland abroad, has finally become too much to bear for the Irish government, and they have made a formal request that we remove the statues of Cromwell and look to idolise someone else. While there's certainly no shortage of radical British heroes to sit on Cromwell's plinth outside Congressional Hall, the proposal has nevertheless sparked consternation among the political class with some ministers balking at such a proposal, and pledging they will not feel \"guilty\" for Britain's past. But in the end, cooler heads will take the lead and it has been proposed that rather than topple all the statues, we simply remove some. The Westminster statue has been deemed totally off limits due to its architectural and political importance, but the others are of less concern. Still, while this will certainly appease the Irish and boost our image in their eyes, native Britons will hardly be happy at seeing their Lord Protector toppled."

Ireland's most major parties, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin all faced defeat at the hands of the mostly small and irrelevant National Farmers and Ratepayers League, or as it came to be known, the National Centre Party. With their shocking defeat, the party has now risen to the forefront of moderate Irish politics, absorbing many members of Fine Gael, Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil, whom they share much in common with; even despite their ardent anti-Valera stances. As the presidential term of Frank MacDermot continues on, the National Centre Party has steadily risen to the forefront of Irish politics, and while without 1937's stunning victory the party would have surely withered and died, or be absorbed by some other party, the successful future of the party is no longer up in the air, and the NCP will continue to influence the politics of the nation for years to come.

ire.3220.t:0 "Larkin denounces Election Results, Dies"
ire.3220.d:0 "With the crushing defeat of the IWL in the 1937 general elections, their leader, James 'Big Jim' Larkin has gone on a campaign of denouncing the election results as illegitimate, denouncing Collins as a dictator, and refusing to recognize Collins' 'German puppet' regime. In Larkin's speeches, he claimed that Collins made liberal use of measures such as ballot stuffing and voter intimidation; accusations which have not a sliver of truth to them and only serve as slander to legitimize the IWL's losses in the election. Collins has shot back at these claims, saying that Larkin was simply bitter at his loss and that even if he was some sort of 'Dictator' as Larkin claims, that he wouldn't even have to rig any elections, for he could win them on his own merit.\n Larkin further went on to hold a rally in Limerick to call for a general lock out until the true results of the elections were uncovered. Tragically, Larkin's rally was cut short, as the stage Larkin was delivering his speech on collapsed due to shoddy construction, killing Larkin along with 10 others. The death of Larkin along with several other high ranking members of the IWL has killed most of the movement's momentum, as various factions tear the party apart as they jockey for leadership. Upon hearing the news, Collins remarked that even though him and Larkin faced disagreements, he was still a great leader and comrade in Ireland's struggle for independence, and has promised to attend Larkin's funeral."

While Collins has tolerated the Blueshirts to a degree, a recent large clash at a Fine Gael rally in Tralee between the IRA and the Army Comrades Association has proven to be the last straw for the party. Collins has moved to officially dismiss Eoin O'Duffy as Taoiseach, appointing Richard Mulcahy in his stead, as well as ordering the Army Comrades Association to be officially disbanded.\n O'Duffy's radical policies have often alienated many more liberal members of Fine Gael, with some accusing O'Duffy of having ties to radical movements such as the Iron Guard, and while he has denied inspiration from these movements, even going out of his way to denounce their Anti-Semitism, there is no question that O'Duffy is far more radical than the main base of Fine Gael, with loyalty to Collins seemingly being the only thing tying him to the party.\n\n While O'Duffy's status within Fine Gael and friendship with Collins has stopped him from being officially kicked out of the party or placed under arrest, O'Duffy is only permitted to "deliver only carefully prepared and concise speeches from manuscripts" and interviews "only after consultation and in writing", effectively placing a gag order on the former military leader.\n\n While this is far from the worst fate O'Duffy could have met, this action has proven to be the last straw for O'Duffy, who officially resigned from Fine Gael, proclaiming that he resigned because "because he was not prepared to lead the League of Youth with the Reichsflagge tied to his neck", before moving to start his own party; the 'National Corporate Party'. While this party has taken some of the more radical members of Fine Gael with it, the party has little to no chance of actually winning anything, as O'Duffy is fairly uncharismatic and not used to the world of politics, with his experience mainly in being a soldier."

President Collins was overjoyed by the discovery of his long-lost bicycle, having the custom made Rudge-Whitworth bicycle restored to pristine condition, even using it as transport around the city. The President's use of a bicycle instead of a motorcade has attracted a large amount of attention from the people of Dublin, with certain pro-Collins newspapers declaring the president's use of a bicycle instead of armoured motorcade or limousine shows that he is a truly fearless man of the people.\n The uncovering of the presidential bicycle has once again sparked a lively debate within the IRA, with some re-submitting an old proposal to create dedicated bicycle units within the army. While those in support of it say they would increase the IRA's speed and agility at a relatively low cost, those in opposition point out that bicycles can be difficult to maintain and properly hide in guerilla warfare situations, as well as pointing out difficulty in transporting the bicycles in mountainous areas."

Larkin has had an arrest warrant on his head ever since the true results of the 1937 elections were uncovered, with his organization being proclaimed illegal shortly after Collins dissolved the Oireachtas, and while some within the IWL and the IRA have attempted to resist, going up against the ‘Big Fellow' and his supporters is paramount to suicide. Larkin himself has been in hiding, going to and from various small towns in the interior accompanied by a small cadre of bodyguards and fervent supporters, attempting to convert people to their cause and brainwash them into rising up against Collins. However, as the anti-socialist campaign heats up, Larkin can no longer rely on his fellow citizen, and has begun gathering his assets to make an ill-advised escape to America.\n\n This attempt at fleeing would come to be his downfall, as a brave informant near Galway tipped off the authorities that Larkin and his men would be passing through the port.\n\n The Stiúrthóireacht na Faisnéise came in the night, catching Larkin off guard as he waited for a ship to the New World; his men put up a fierce fight, but were ultimately felled by the government's superior forces. Larkin fled to a warehouse, hiding in the upper floors as soldiers sweeped the building; ultimately finding no trace of Ireland's most wanted man. However, just as Larkin thought that he had escaped the long arm of the law, the floor immediately underneath his hiding spot gave way, leading to the rebel plummeting almost 30 feet straight down, to the red rebel's ultimate death.\n\n While the soldiers in the building concluded that Larkin perished in the fall, they emptied a few rounds into his body just to make sure that the bastard was dead.

Coming to Ireland as a child to live with his uncle after the death of his father when de Valera was only 3 or 4 years old, de Valera would be immersed in Irish life as he aged up through school, finding a lifelong passion for learning, the native Irish language, politics, and rugby along the way - all of which would stick with him throughout his life. Getting involved with the Gaelic revival as a young man and later using it as his entry-point into politics, de Valera as since served as an independence hero and freedom fighter, narrowly avoiding execution at the hands of the British and since rising to lead the largest Conservative Republican party in Ireland in Fianna Fáil, and now leading the nation itself. Throughout it all however, de Valera has remained close to his two other homelands of America and Spain, and has kept close contacts with surviving family and friends, as well as new allies, in both locales, even remaining in contact with the St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Jersey City, New Jersey in which his parents were married and the church he himself was baptized at. These connections have even influenced de Valera politically, with the politician taking ideas from Irish groups like Tammany Hall and the New York Democrats, and even pushed him to support the Spanish-Irish line of the O'Donnells as possible Irish kings.

However, the Pan Gaelic voices in the government are pressing for an answer as to how the Local Pictish traditions shall be treated. The Picts were a group who occupied Scotland and northern England before the spread of Gaelicism from Ireland. In the Early 11th Century, however, the local Picts merged with Irish Immigrants and invaders and formed a true Gaelic identity. Our occupation has given us the opportunity to embrace the long extinct Picts as Celtic brothers, perhaps gathering some sympathy from the more remote Scots, some of whom still feel a strange relation to their Pictish ancestors. Alternatively, we could reject the Picts as weak, unable to prevent being replaced by superior Gaelic tradition and focus solely on the achievement of Gaelic Scots."

Within moments, a small canister appeared from nowhere and flung up from the mud to about hip-level before exploding, sending shrapnel and the pointman's flesh scattering in all directions as it burst near the waist of the lead man, turning most of his body into a pink mist while the surviving chunks dropped like waste meat at a processing plant. Panic spread among the ranks of the squad, and soon two other soldiers ran off in different directions, being similarly explosive and meaty fates. It would seem that the ruling regime were employing fragmentation 'bouncing betty' mines against their foes, mining off critical areas with bombs designed to bounce up to waist level before detonation for maximum maiming effect. There have been rumors of traitors to the regime being executed by being tied to landmines before detonation, but to mine your own homeland to such an extent was previously unthinkable, and yet, here these traitors were, being blasted to fleshy bits. If any rebel or ill force is to make a step against the ruling regime, they better do so with one eye glued to the ground, for no footfall is safe for any enemy of the state in [root.getleader]'s Ireland."

Part of the reason for this is one of Ireland's most famous exports, whiskey. Be it the smoothness of Jameson, the sweetness of Bushmills or any other of the most famous Irish distilleries, Americans have been buying whiskey faster than it can be produced. In an effort to avoid our various distillers from taking shortcuts and ruining what has the chance to turn into a truly unique national industry, factions within the government have proposed that we offer the distillers a small lump sum. Hoping that the money could be used to expand their operations without compromising their processes, these factions believe that while in the short term little return could be expected, in the long term the boon could far out way the cost. A smaller portion of these same factions wish for us to also subsidize farmers whom grow Rye, Wheat and other various grains used to make whiskey, to ensure that the expanded distilleries aren't left without stalk to make their mashes with. Either way, Irish whiskey is now surely on it's way to become a stable for Americans, just as it is for us in the old country."

The most common proposal is to simply allow the British to form their own government, albeit under our supervision, we are better than them are we not? Others however, push for us to adopt a policy of the perfidious Anglo but turn it around, and create an 'English Free State'. Modeled after our own Free State, this plan calls for the creation of a State that is for technically part of Ireland proper, just with an unprecedented level of autonomy. Finally, the most radical solution calls for us to give the Anglo a taste of his own medicine. His language, religion, food, and entire way of life shall be destroyed, replaced by the superior Irish culture. While such a program would take generations to bare fruit, in time English culture would be nothing but a memory, and London would be as Irish as Dublin.

People have begun to attend the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass daily, feast days that once were a mainly secular affairs have once again taken on a religious atmosphere, among many other things. Along with this, Catholicism's influence on the political realm has also greatly expanded, as fringe Catholic groups once relegated to obscurity have seen a massive uptick in popularity. Once such grouping is Maria Duce or With Mary as our Leader, led by Father Denis Fahey. While the group itself is small, even an uptick in popularity, their leader is far from it. Father Fahey has become something of a local legend when it comes to his writings on Christ the King, specifically the Social Kingship of Christ. While a complex topic, in essence the Social Kingship of Christ calls for the Kingship of Christ to be recognized on the temporal level. Demanding that all governments conform themselves to Christ's teachings, the teaching calls for the Catholic Church and her teachings to be the supreme law of the land, regardless if that land is Catholic or not. On a personal level, Father Fahey is known to be an avid anti-Semite, oft declaring 'we must combat Jewish efforts to permeate the world with naturalism. In that sense, as there is only one divine plan for order in the world, every sane thinker must be an anti-Semite.'\n\nDespite this, there have been some calls from within the government to embrace Fahey's teachings, which indeed are preeminent in terms of Christ's Kingship. With us being a Catholic nation by decree, surely we must take this to it's logically conclusion. Others, oft of a more leftist or secular bent, believe that Fahey, for both his radical interpretation of Catholicism and anti-semitism, should be censured and Maria Duce itself banned. Others simply want us to leave this recluse of a Priest alone, and simply ignore the more radical trends within Catholicism. In any case, Father Denis Fahey is possibly Christ the King's strongest solider and he shall continue to be, regardless of our actions."

Now that we are free from their grasp, and not that we have drifted further and further away from the English language as we revive our own ancestral Gaelic tongue, many in Ireland have pushed for us to officially rename our Emerald Isle, changing our identity both at home and abroad, for all to see our renewed Celtic splendor.

We could mount a counter-invasion to save the English, but doing so would be incredibly costly, and we still have other, far larger and more dangerous foes to face.

Despite having been a nominally failure, it was the rising that gave birth to Free Ireland, and all but Ulster view the day with great reverence. This year, being the 20th anniversary of the Rising, was home to much more grand festiveness than usual. This being the case, very few took note of the posting, all around Ireland, of a proclamation by a group claiming to be the 'Executive Council of the Second Dáil.' Chaired by Seán Ó Ceallaigh, himself an elected member of Ireland's second Dáil, the group transferred their 'legitimate authority' to what they call the 'Army Council of the Irish Republican Army' as was their right as per a resolution based by the First Dáil. Of course, when the day was done, people did finally start to take note of such a strange proclamation. Nothing was expected to come of such an odd occurrence. However, with just a few weeks past it's posting, the 'Army Council' has issued an ultimatum to our government, which they consider to still be the Free State.\nActing less as an ultimatum and more like a manifesto, the document, sent in an unmarked letter, details in brief the 'legitimacy' of the Army Council, explains their aims and finally concludes with demands. The Army Council explains their legitimacy by stating that they represent the final remnants of the Irish Republic proclaimed in 1916. They claim that they can trace their legacy to the IRA's splitting upon the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. With those against the Treaty carrying on the fight, even when Collins declared an end to the Free State upon the British Revolution. As for the so-called 'Executive Council,' they are made up of members of the Second Dáil, and with the Second Dáil never formally dissolving itself, they claim to carry on it's mission. The Army Council's goals are simple, the complete abolishing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and everything associated with it, and the reestablishment of the 'true' Republic of '16.\nDespite these quite grandiose claims, the IRA even with the support of the 'Executive Council' are quite fringe. Although this position did once share some popularity, mostly among Sinn Féin. With a 32 county Ireland finally free however, almost all popular support dried up. Even Sinn Féin dropped their support in it's most recent Ardfheis, although this did cause a split in the Party, wherein Seán Ó Ceallaig, Party President, along with few others left in defiance.\n\nDue to it's almost nonexistent popular support, a majority of those within the government believe that such an ultimatum will lead nowhere, and suggest that our current measures are more than enough. However, a few believe that we should ramp up anti-terrorism measures, before more civilians get hurt or worse. A very small minority actually believe we should sit down and work out some kind of deal. After all, if we can become the 'true' Republic, there will be nothing left to fight for. Either way, Collins is expected to make a decision soon, lest the already tense situation get even worse."

The agreement, officially called the Belfast Agreement due to the meetings taking place in Ulster's capital, in essence answers every objection that the Army Council had against the Republican government. First and foremost, the Republic of Ireland, declared by President Collins using the machinery of the Free State and considered by the IRA to in nature still be the Free State, shall be completely dissolved. In it's place, the Irish Republic, declared in 1916 and continue on by the IRA, shall be given control of Ireland. Secondly, the Anglo-Irish Treaty, itself already discarded in all but name by the Republic, shall be declared null and void. Thirdly, a caretaker government, headed by Collins as a show of goodwill but made up of members of the Army Council along with a quorum of the Dáil shall rule over the Republic until the 1937 elections. Fourthly, the Seanad Éireann shall be temporarily dissolved, however the body shall reform following the up-and-coming 1937 elections. Fifthly, every law passed by the various Dáils of the 'Free State' shall be adopted by the Irish Republic, although following the 1937 elections, the Dáil shall be the Third, to coincide with the Second finally closing. Finally, the IRA and our own Defense Forces shall be merged, and the leadership of both shall combine.\n\nWhile in effect, very little will truly change, in the minds of these 'legitimists,' Ireland shall be under it's rightful government. Even despite this, the agreement has yet to be ratified by the Dáil, as many view it as a needless and worthless change to win over such a small amount of the population. As the debate within the Irish parliament comes to a close, it appears that..."

While the process was mainly painless, the exact details of the reunification are a bit puzzling. Both parts of the Party, in their statements of reunion, welcomed the other half back into the fold. The reason for this strange wording is due to the fact that both claimed to be the true Sinn Féin party. Regardless of this strange wording, with the two halves reunited, Sinn Féin is bigger and stronger then ever."

In the agreement, the Republic of Ireland was to be formally dissolved, replaced by the original Irish Republic declared in 1916 during the Easter Rising, which the IRA claimed to be the legitimate heirs of. The newly reestablished Irish Republic has been given a caretaker government, made up of members of the IRA Army Council who decided to allow Collins to remain President, at least until the 1937 Irish elections.

Everything from The Rosetta Stone to sections of the Greek Parthenon and even a tablet inscribed with parts of the Epic of Gilgamesh have been taken from local cultures encountered by the Brits. While the collection was not left unharmed by the British Revolution, some of the most valuable artifacts fled to Canada with the Exiles, it still remains one of the world's largest collection of historical items. With the museum now falling into Irish hands however, the fate of this house of history has come into debate. Quite a large faction within the government believe that we should return these artifacts to their rightful owners and convert the museum into one that tells the story of British Imperialism. While such an undertaking would be no doubt greatly expensive, the nations of the world could rejoice, not only for their lost items, but for the destruction of one of the final remnants of the old Empire. Others believe, much to the shock of the Irish Left, that we should not only keep the Museum, but bring the treasures home to Dublin. After all, no matter their old owners, they are ours by right of conquest, not to mention the prestige we could gain by being home to these items. Other still think we should simply leave the Museum alone. Why should we bother ourselves with matters of a dead nation? Besides, if the true owners want them, they can simply ask for them back.

While American tourism has had a wonderful effect on the economy, almost completely reviving certain local economies, it is not without its downsides. Often the Garda has been deployed to deal with rowdy tourists, and many older, conservative, sections of the political sense view the increase in tourism as a first step towards the destruction of the Irish people. Despite this, American tourism, despite the protest of a few, seems to be a new normal for Ireland.

Once the IRA's Quartermasters General, Russell was considered by many to be one of the most radical leaders within the IRA. Indeed, the plan proposed by Russell seems to confirm this. Calling it the 'Sabotage Campaign' or S-Plan for short, the plan calls for the smuggling of Irish agents and various explosive devices into the Union of Britain to be used against economic, military and civilian targets. The brainchild of Seamus O'Donovan and Russell, the plan, if approved, would aim to create chaos within Britain, both to dissuade them from invading Ireland, to soften them up for a counter invasion. Irish agents, with the tacit support of the government, would integrate themselves into British society, scout out the best targets for bombings, and execute those attacks. Without question, this plan is radical and would no doubt ruin any chance we would have for reconciling with the Union, if such was a wish of the government. Beyond that, the amount of potential deaths, be them civilian or otherwise, could be quite significant. Yet, there is indeed an amount of logic behind the campaign. By having chaos at home, Britain would have a harder time maintaining a operations against us, as resources would need to be spent to maintain order. Either way, with the Dáil dissolved until the '37 elections, the choice is President Collins' alone to make."

Calling for the bombing of key sectors of England the document is allegedly signed off by long-time Irish President Michael Collins. While Ireland has condemned both the attacks and Britain's claim that Ireland is responsible for the attacks, they have refused British demands to cease all shipments from Ireland, for a limit period. With no true culprit in sight, it is expected the bombings with continue for some time."

Among the right, the two growing groups of influence under our dominant party are Lia Fail and the Irish Monetary Reform Association. Translating to the ‘Stone of Destiny’ and founded by Catholic priest Father John Fay, Lia Fail is a small Far-Right populist agrarian party espousing radical populism and radical agrarianism of course, along with xenophobia, Irish Irredentism and jingoism, Anti-Semitism, Irish Nationalism and ethnic exceptionalism, Anti-Syndicalism, and class-collaborationism. Along with them stands the IMRA of Seamus Lennon and Oliver Flanagan, spouting similar ideas of Irish Nationalism, Anti-Semitism, and Anti-Syndicalism along with Anti-Capitalism, Christian Corporatism, and the theory of Social Credit. Together, these parties represent the growing fringe sphere of Irish Rightist ideology, and as such, we must decide what to do with these radicals here and now. We can ally with these groups, incorporating some of their ideas into our government while sparring ourselves of an annoying enemy, or we can simply tell these misbegotten failsons to stop their game of pretending while the real masters of the Irish Right lead this nation to greatness."

Additionally, they have both agreed to lend their revolutionary expertise to our own armed forces and police officers, for both of them have experience as anti-Anglo guerillas and as revolutionary leaders. Hopefully, with these true Irish heroes and masters of the pen at our side, we shall win the hearts and minds of the populace without bloodshed or growing pains."

ire.374.d:0 "Before Ireland’s transformation into a massive network of farmlands and pastures as English and Continental conceptions of civilization spread to take over our Gaelic paradise, our isle was home to some of the largest wild wolf populations left in Europe. However, these wild yet majestic and noble beasts were largely hunted to extinction in our region by farmers defending their fields and herds, and thanks to British colonization and laws, the last wild Irish wolf was shot dead in Carlow in 1786, bringing their concept of ‘civilized’ society to our land, but at a deep price that cost us the liveliness of our ancient wilderness. Without forethought of the ecological ramifications of such an act, we Irish have gone about our business as a new crisis built under the surface in the wolves’ absence - the deer menace! Though our issue is not as bad as it currently is in our neighbor Scotland, we still face a deer overpopulation crisis that has threatened to tip the balance of our verdant ecosystem and send it hurdling into collapse. To rectify this issue, many ecologists and leading natural scientists - along with their influential sponsors within the IRA and other nationalist groups like Saor Éire, Sinn Féin, and the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe - have pushed for the reintroduction of a wild wolf population on the isle to control the deer population naturally, with the wolf reintroduction planned to be paired with supplementary feeding stations, artificial burrows for uses as dens, the usage of patrolling guard dogs at the borders of farmlands along with livestock protective systems like fladry and electrified fences, and much more in an ecologically-sound plan based on similar American efforts to revitalize and renaturalize the ecosystem of their Yellowstone National Park. \n\nIf successful the plan should limit predation on livestock to lower levels than before while allowing our ecosystem to bounce back and re-equalize following the decline in the over-bloated deer population. Although the population of these wolves would be closely monitored and although the wider plan is likely to succeed, this proposition has enraged Ireland’s farmer class who wish to handle the issue themselves with rifles in hand, still vengeful of the many herds lost of wolf attacks in the distant past, and now further enraged by the meddling of conservative agrarian groups like the National Centre Party, Fianna Fáil, and the Blueshirts jumping on the train to defend them in order to secure more public support, turning this simple ecological issue into a Left versus Right political debate overnight.

ire.375.d:0 "Now that the economic woes of Black Monday are safely behind us, the subject of one of Ireland’s most controversial monuments has once more come up for debate. Nelson's Pillar, a titanic 134 foot tall column adorned at the top by a statue of one Horatio Nelson, is both a popular tourist destination and a storied historical site. As contentious as it is massive, the monument has been criticized on both political and aesthetic grounds, with some describing the pillar as "ponderous", the pedestal as 'unsightly' and the column itself as 'clumsy'. The structure, often considered a vestige of British Imperialism has drawn no shortage of ire from both the Irish populace and those in the Government, who support either replacing the monument, or simply tearing it down. While the monument on Sackville Street is in some way a beloved part of Dubliner daily life, the effigy adorning the statue’s zenith is a nonstop point of contention for Irish citizens. To remedy this, some have suggested replacing Horatio Nelson’s statue with that of another figure, be it Robert Emmet, Patrick Pearse, or even a more contemporary figure of Irish History. The prospect of replacing Horatio Nelson would be an amicable solution to some, even if others are still in favour of taking down the "blunder", pointing to the statue’s 'hindrance to modern traffic'. Popular voices supporting the Pillar are figures such as William Butler Yeats and Oliver St. John Gogarty, who both value the monuments’ historical and cultural significance. As arguments continue, popular voices from the Irish right, including the Blueshirts have remarked that this inactivity has shown a failure in the national spirit: 'The conqueror is gone, but the scars which he left remain, and the victim will not even try to remove them'. While we have previously shelved this issue due to insufficient funds, the pillar’s fate has now made its way back into the limelight once more due to Ireland’s surer economic footing. Pressure is mounting on [ROOT.GetLeader] to take final action on the matter, lest any unsavory groups try and demolish the monument themselves."

The bomb was planted in the upper portion of the monument, destroying the monument’s mid-section and bringing Nelson's statue crashing to the ground amid hundreds of tons of rubble.\n\n While the response to this incident has generally been lighthearted, many have expressed sadness over the loss of one of Dublin’s most iconic monuments. The Irish, ever a humorous people, have already embedded the monument’s destruction in Ireland’s popular culture, with poems, souvenirs and songs referencing the monument quickly embedding themselves in the nation’s cultural zeitgeist.\n\n After an unsafe building notice was approved, the remaining stump of the collumb was slated for demolition, much to the protest of certain nostalgics. Mere days after the explosion the Army destroyed the remains of the stump with a controlled explosion, watched at a safe distance by a crowd who, the press reported, ‘raised a resounding cheer’.

ire.380.d:0 "A rather unusual request has come to the War Office from serving General, Eric Dorman-Smith, better known as \"Chink\" to his comrades, indicating his desire for a secondment abroad. With the dust settling in Ireland, and a friendly socialist government in Dublin, Dorman-Smith has taken the opportunity to propose that he serve with the Irish army as a commanding officer and \"advisor\" on military strategy, bringing them up to scratch with the modern methods of warfare employed by our own army. But it has been quickly speculated that Dorman-Smith's intentions are hardly out of international solidarity, but rather a desire to return his ancestral home of County Cavan in Ulster, Ireland. Likewise, Dorman-Smith has allegedly ruffled feathers within the army owing to his \"sin\" of simply being too clever, and being intolerant of those not on his intellectual calibre, a fact he is prone to show. Such antagonism has not made Dorman-Smith many friends, and he perhaps sees a fresh start abroad as a \"sink or swim\" moment.\n\nThe proposal has garnered a mixed reaction in the military, with some officers being suspiciously supportive of the move, though dissent has emerged. Edmund Ironside, commander of the RTC, and leading military theorist, Basil Liddell-Hart, have both commented that it would be a \"waste\" to send Dorman-Smith to serve in an army with significantly less resources, and a likely inability to make full use of Dorman-Smith's expertise. Still, the proposal has gained a political edge, with it being put forward that agreeing to the secondment would be both a show of trust to Ireland, and a welcome acknowlegement of them as partners rather than subordinants. We could of course block the proposal if we feel Dorman-Smith would be more useful at his post in the British Army. The prospect of promotion will likely tide him over."

Given that this would not have been possible without the assistance from [ENG.GetNameDef], it is no surprise that correspondence has been frequent. Today's message brings good news — the British Army has decided to send one of their eminient generals on secondment to its Irish namesake, a man none other than County Cavan native, Eric Dorman Smith.\n\nDorman-Smith, who has stated his intention to adopt the Irish form of his name, is seen as a rising star in the British Army. His Anglo-Irish background meant that his chosen career comes as no surprise, in contrast to his extremely modern and unorthodox views on the future of direction of warfare. Prior to the British revolution, his outspoken critique of the tactics associated with the old establishment rubbed up much of the top brass the wrong way, but the past few years has seen his theories gain more traction and renown.\n\nWith Britain and Ireland now in firm alliance, he can combine his support of Irish republicanism with his position in the British Army, and personally requested this temporary secondment to his native country. He is well aware that his theorems on the greater use of technology and mobilisation in warfare may be easier put into practice with a larger armed force, but for Dorman O'Gowan, the newly re-energised revolutionary atmosphere in Ireland was just too much to say no to."

ire.398.d:0 "The National Centre Party, Ireland's foremost Agrarian movement, has fallen on hard times ever since their defeat in the 1937 elections. Born from and formerly bolstered by other agrarian movements such as the Farmers' Party of Denis Gorey, Patrick Baxter, and Michael Heffernan - all of whom feared for their political future if they did not coordinate in a common organization - the NCP has since started to crack apart as many of these former allies move on in order to save themselves and their own interests. With such an unimpressive turnout in 1937, the NCP as a separate party appears to be running on borrowed time. Despite MacDermot's refusal to unite with the rest of Fine Gael, it has become clear to many within the party that their best chance at influencing the future of Ireland is to join with a larger political entity.\n\n As the NCP withers away, a new movement representing the farmers and peasants of Rural Ireland arises in the form of Clann na Talmhan - aka the Children of the Land, formerly known as the National Agricultural Party - under the direction of controversial Michael Donnellan, himself a farmer from Galway and former FF and later SF member turned Left-ish populist and anti-establishment activist with a focus on small farmer issues and known for frequently using antisemtic and anti-elitist rhetoric as a scapegoat for the problems that plague Irish farmers - and his associate Joseph Blowick, a successful and influential holder farmer from County Mayo in his own right with familial connections through three of his brothers to the Church. This new, vaguely social democratic party, formed out of the remaining NCP TD's who refused to join with Fine Gael along with former members of the Farmers' Party and many small farmers who split over the issue of derating as it would lead to more indirect taxation on their already weakened plots, has risen from under the ashes of the National Centre Party while syncretically shifting the Agrarian cause from the Center and Center-Right where it was suffocated by the NCP to the Center-Left where it can hopefully prosper under Donnellan's strange mix of social democratic, populist, and traditional Agrarian ideas, and is now seen by many desperate famers as the final chance to revitalize Agrarian politics in Ireland. Intially focusing on issues and ideas such as derenting, aforestation, and partial land redistrituption in order to make better use of large, inefficient farms, whether or not this attempt to restore the prowess of Irish Agrarianism will be met with success is yet to be determined, so let us keep an eye on Donnellan and his ilk for now."

Instead, it is safe to say that Eamon de Valera squandered this opportunity. Focusing on divisive personal attacks on Collins, who still maintained his popularity after so many years, Valera's efforts to define himself as the leader Ireland needs have borne little fruit. From the expulsion of Collins when he was leader of Sinn Fein, to the ongoing feud between the two titans of Ireland's political scene, it seems that Valera's ongoing vendetta against the 'Big Fellow' is an active detriment to the electability of Fianna Fáil. With this in mind, many have considered ditching Valera as the party's frontman, and replacing him with Sean Lemass, a more 'Liberal' candidate whose primary concern is the viability of the Irish economy. Dev himself has pushed back against any such attempts to replace him, stating that '1942 would be the year of Fianna Fáil'.

The fall of Labour reinvigorated the dying movement that at one point held the title of Ireland's most influential Political Party. After the defection of both Collins and Valera, the few loyalists to Sinn Féin were desperate to absorb the voters hemorrhaging from the dying Labour Party, drawing the party significantly towards the Left-Wing in the process. While the majority of Modern Sinn Féin consists of Labour loyalists, there still are a great many within the party who have been loyal to the party from its inception. These original Sinn Féiners have grown to inhabit the upper echelons of SF leadership, something which has caused a great deal of discontent within the Labourite wings of the party. This divide has manifested in the Labour Party's 'Rebirth' under the leadership of one Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, a famed university lecturer and senator. Sheehy-Skeffington's 'Reconstituted Labour Party' is a movement born out of discontent with Sinn Féin's rather open alliance with the Catholic Church. This mutiny of Left-Labourites, while failing to cripple Sinn Féin once more, has given Ireland's socialists a more moderate front to rally behind. Split between Larkin's rather open Syndicalists and the Sinn Féin of new is the RLP, a movement dedicated to civil liberty, democracy, separation of church and state, freedom of speech, women's rights, minority rights and many other liberal values.

And yet now, under the leadership of [IRE.GetLeader], a leftist coalition has not only achieved power through the ballot box, but has managed to cement itself in the hearts of the Irish people.  The Irish nation now marches towards a red future, yet it marches not with a rifle, but with an olive branch.\n\nTo even the more open minded, many of the events of the last few years would have still been equally hard to imagine. When the rift between O'Brien and Sheehy-Skeffington first led to Labour splitting in two, few could picture a future where these two men would be willing to put aside their differences and work together on anything, let alone being the ones leading Ireland towards such a future. Yet now after so many eventful years of this red coalition being in power, there are scarcely any who can still hold doubt towards the success of the reformist approach of both branches of Labour.\n\nOf course there are still the detractors, both those on the right who still believe that the \"radical regime\" will collapse at the next real hurdle, and many of those on the left who reject any notion that one can simply reform towards a socialist system without the backing of a revolution. However, regardless of their naysaying the voice of the Irish people is clear, it is not violent revolution or conservative stagnation that they desire but a gradual and peaceful transition forward. Ireland's future is not one stuck trying to harken back to a idealised past, it is a future filled with liberty and progress. And if Ireland's future shall truly be a red one, it will be achieved by a people armed not with a sword, but with a ploughshare and a dream."

Yet, as far as [IRE.GetLeader] and much of the government are concerned, the heart of Ireland is found nested within the land itself, and to not sit back and reflect upon it is to overlook the fundamentals of Irish life.\n\nFor it is this great land that so many have proudly called their home across countless generations, from the most humble of villages in Leitrim all the way to the busy and bustling heart of Dublin itself. Regardless whether it is the farmer reaping his yearly harvest, an accountant enjoying nature on their commute to work, or even a young couple watching the sun set over Galway Bay, each of their lives are shaped by the bounties that Ireland provides to its people. And it is ultimately these bounties, and the moments of joy or satisfaction they provide, that truly make the moments that make life worth living.\n\nIt is to this end, the pursuit of ensuring these worldly fundamentals, that the government's vision has ultimately been derived. No longer does the Irish worker have to worry about working from the break of dawn to the darkest reaches of the night, with even now the ability to take substantial amounts of time off work to enjoy life with their families as all should have the right to do. Nor does the farmer have to fear waking up to a nation where the rustic way of life is no longer possible to live, instead he may be confident in the government's support for the rural Irish countryside. And even the most vulnerable in society, who may have once collapsed into a pit of destitution, may rest easy knowing that there is a welfare system ready to help pull them back up out of it.\n\nAnd above all, when everyone, no matter their status, can live a life without these everyday worries getting in the way, what is better to do than to take in the beauties of this island that truly makes us whole?"

For Michael Collins, one of these moments came in the form of a question posed by one of the nation's many journalists; \"Mr. President, countless across the nation look to you and the legacy you have thus far left as a source of inspiration, both for good and ill. When making the many vital decisions that you have for the nation, does the impact it will leave on future generations factor into your decision making?\"\n\nFor a man who has spent most of his life living in the moment, the idea of being remembered as the President instead of a heroic soldier or revolutionary martyr is one that has only recently begun to dawn on Collins. Before he even reached his twenties he had already begun the fight for the Irish cause, and so too would he continue even after both independence and reunification. Where he once bounced from house to house to fight the Tans, he would instead bounce between them on the campaign trail to beat his political rivals. Barely hanging on during Black Monday, and soldiering through the Northern Crisis, he was still energised by the same fighting spirit the entire time.\n\nAnd yet, for the first time in Collins' adult life, his survival through everything that has been thrown at him has left him with nothing more to fight. With the opposition struggling to even threaten his position, poll numbers sitting constantly at comfortable levels, and the extremist elements of Irish society thoroughly rooted out, the realisation that this chapter has ended has begun to finally hit home for Collins. But with the fight of today ended, the new battle is for the world of tomorrow. Where Collins had to be a fighter, it is his hope that the same will not have to be true for the next generation of Ireland's leaders. If they do truly look up to Collins, he hopes that they look up to his role as a man of politics rather than a soldier of war.\n\nSo, after a moment of thought and reflection, Collins simply smiled and answered \"Indeed, it does.\""

While many leaders may wish for huge crowds to greet them, Mulcahy could wish for nothing better than a small crowd of his \"comrades in arms\" at the same barracks he had once oversaw.\n\n\"To many in the nation the army has often seemed to be as a thing apart and different from the people. Yet for all of our nation's free history, our army has been the people, it is the people and will be the people. Our green uniform does not make us less the people. It is a cloak of service, a curtailer of our weakness, and amplifier of our strength. When the tricolour first flew proudly high over Dublin Town, the free people of Ireland were not simply either soldiers or citizens, we were one and the same. It is on the foundation our great republic was built, and upon it that our nation has continued to prosper.\n\nWhen our national independence was first declared by Pádraig Pearse, the Proclamation not only set forth the rights of the Irish people but also made clear the vital role their military organisations serve in guaranteeing those rights. When I myself fought on that fateful day I was neither a soldier nor a citizen, as an Irishman I was both. And so to uphold the lasting legacy set forth by the forefathers of many of you in the room, and the contemporaries of those getting on in years like myself, it is my honour to declare that from this day forwards this fateful building will be known as Pearse Barracks, Dún an Phiarsaigh.\"\n\nAnd with that the speech ended, to a somewhat muted but respectful applause, the type of humble response that is all a man like Mulcahy truly wishes for in life."

It has been this word that has acted as an unofficial slogan for the party, and now by extension the government itself, ever since it saw the party rise to its first successes and achieve its original place in the coalition.\n\nFor such a simple word, the exact meaning of \"Opportunity\" varies greatly depending on who you ask and when you actually ask it. At times it has meant the opportunity for every man and woman in Ireland to achieve their dreams, simply provided they put in enough hard work to see them to fruition. At other times, especially when levied against the restrictions of the old Fine Gael government, it has meant the opportunity for anyone in the country to make their mark upon the nation, regardless of their background or heritage. Even more recently however, with Ireland's increased prominence on the financial world stage, some have gone so far to even declare that it is the opportunity to leave your mark upon the world as a whole.\n\nIf you were to ask [IRE.GetLeader]  however, he would gladly tell you that the meaning of the term encompasses all of the above and more. For him, \"Opportunity\" is at the heart of Irish culture and history. Whether it has been as grand as the opportunity the Irish people carved out for themselves to decide their own fate and destiny, or even down to the simple individual level of good education providing a student the opportunity to get into Trinity, it arises in all facets of Irish life. In the eyes of the President, social and economic progress in a nation go hand in hand with each other, with the opportunities provided in one allow the opening of more in the other, and it has always been the Fianna Fáil's goal to facilitate the growth of both.\n\nAnd ultimately as far as [IRE.GetLeader] is concerned, every aspect that makes up this concept of \"Opportunity\" are those that truly describe what it means to be Irish."

Whether it can be chalked up to Fianna Fáil's cemented political dominance, de Valera's delivery, or simply just the speech's quality, few feel like they will ever forget these immortal words:\n\n\"The ideal Ireland that we would have, the Ireland that we dreamed of, would be the home of a people who valued material wealth only as a basis for right living, of a people who, satisfied with frugal comfort, devoted their leisure to the things of the spirit — a land whose countryside would be bright with cosy homesteads, whose fields and villages would be joyous with the sounds of industry, with the romping of sturdy children, the contest of athletic youths and the laughter of happy maidens, whose firesides would be forums for the wisdom of serene old age. The home, in short, of a people living the life that God desires that men should live.\n\nWith the tidings that make such an Ireland possible, St. Patrick came to our ancestors fifteen hundred years ago promising happiness here no less than happiness hereafter. It was the pursuit of such an Ireland that later made our country worthy to be called the island of saints and scholars. It was the idea of such an Ireland — happy, vigorous, spiritual — that fired the imagination of our poets; that made successive generations of patriotic men give their lives to win religious and political liberty; and that will urge men in our own and future generations to die, if need be, so that these liberties may be preserved.\n\nOne hundred years ago, the Young Irelanders, by holding up the vision of such an Ireland before the people, inspired and moved them spiritually as our people had hardly been moved since the Golden Age of Irish civilisation. Fifty years later, the founders of the Gaelic League similarly inspired and moved the people of their day. So, later, did the leaders of the Irish Volunteers, and those who continued their good fight until all of our nation had been freed. We of this time, if we have the will and active enthusiasm, have the opportunity to inspire and move our generation in like manner. We can do so by keeping this thought of a noble future for our country constantly before our eyes, ever seeking in action to bring that future into being, and ever remembering that it is for our nation as a whole that future must be sought.\""

Almost no one however, [IRE.GetLeader] included, could have predicted that now with CCN having at last consolidated their rule over the nation, Irish democracy has not only yet to breathe its last but has begun to stabilise once more under new leadership\n\nDespite great fearmongering by those in the opposition in regards to so called \"democratic backsliding\", when [IRE.GetLeader] directs the nation's policies he is not some supreme Ceannaire overseeing a National Council of loyal underlings, he is the nation's President addressing a Dáil still very much filled with many actual opposition members offering forth lively debate. Laws are not simply passed through diktat from on high, when the government puts forward a bill it is still subject to the same proper procedures and vetting that they always have under Ireland's democratic systems. While some within Cumann Corpruiteac Náisiúnta are said to still privately hold disdain for being forced to deal with said systems, much of the party have slowly begun to grow rather comfortable with this new status quo.\n\nYet regardless one should not mistake the Dáli of today as being the same one it may have once been in yesteryear. Socialists, the most seditious democrats, and even some of the government's most radical former allies have rightfully been excised from government. No longer do the Irish people have to suffer a nation where their politics are decided by foreigners and Freemasons, rather than the native people of the land. No longer do they have to worry about the subversive threats of Internationalism and Syndicalism attempting to divide or break up the family. And no longer does the great Irish republic have to fear the chaos that these destructive elements may bring."

Also much like Parnell, Griffith suffered from being sidelined in life, a life cut tragically all too short. While Parnell faded from relevance due to his impropriety, Griffith simply found himself a place in the sidelines as the Irish cause developed beyond him. His advocacy for the reversal of the Act of Union and the formation of a Dual Monarchy, inspired by Austria-Hungary, fell out of favour after the events of 1916, but seeing republicanism's rising tide and popular support, Griffith, the eternal pragamatist, had no problem in his party being used as a vehicle for independence.

When I grew old enough to begin serving our people, Griffith would become both an important mentor and friend, a man whose party I am proud to still lead to this day.

As the country begins to put itself back together, the people have agreed that if peace and prosperity is to be maintained, change is necessary. Politicians and the populace from across the political spectrum have agreed that a brand new constitution, created through cooperation and careful consideration, is what the country needs to secure its political future.\n\nThis new Constitution, or Bunreacht, will be co-drafted in Irish and English with assistance from the writer and teacher Micheál Ó Gríobhtha, and Risteárd Ó Foghludha, renowned writer, editor, and founder of Craobh an Chéitinnigh, a branch of the Gaelic League. Many articles of the current Constitution will be carried over as they work well and are not contentious, but there are many sections that are the subject of debate.\n\nEach party is vying for influence over what is included, and they have all made their positions on these issues very clear.

ire.2601.d:0 "The first question facing the drafters is of how the Republic is composed and how its governance shall function.\n\nThe first option, supported by Fine Gael, maintains a system similar to the current \"Ulster Privileges\", whereby the north-eastern county councils maintain greater autonomy, the President's Council of State has guaranteed loyalist representation, and loyalists have a permanent presence in cabinet in the form of the new official role of \"Minister for Ulster Affairs\". There is some apprehension with nationalists who wish to see change in the new Constitution rather than a status quo.\n\nThe Ulster Unionists and FF, however, are pushing even further, asking for full devolution for the north-eastern six counties codified into the Constitution.\n          - \"The north-eastern six counties of Ulster shall have the right to hold a devolved parliament with areas of competence as defined by law.\"\nThis would effectively turn those counties into an autonomous region, dominated by loyalists. There is fierce push-back from nationalists as they see this as akin to a return to partition, despite written assurances against open discrimination.\n\nOn the other side, ACA, and interestingly Sinn Fein, are pushing for a unitary Republic ruled directly from Dublin.\n          - \"The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.\"\nThis, along with sections emphasising the primacy of Dáil Éireann in Dublin, would certainly go far to unifying the country, removing the autonomy exception for the councils in the north. Fine Gael wishes to give more concessions to loyalists, but as a compromise, both parties have agreed to maintaining Brooke's position and a limited guarantee of representation in the Dáil.\n\nA novel approach, favoured by FF, is to have each Province hold its own regional assembly.\n          - \"Each of the four Provinces shall have the right to hold a federal assembly with areas of competence as prescribed by law.\"\nThis American-inspired approach is one that has not been considered before, but it could allow each Province to tackle regional problems more effectively, particularly tensions regarding local populations of nationalists and loyalists."

The place and power of the President must be clearly defined lest the position edge closer towards authoritarianism.\n\nThe first option supported by Fine Gael and the ACA, is a presidential system similar to what informally exists already:\n          - \"The executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the President.\"\nThis system, modelled after the United States of America, would give the President clear executive powers defined by this Constitution. The President would select and head the government and be the main leader of the country.\n\nThe opposing option, supported by FF, the Ulster Unionists, and Sinn Fein, is a parliamentary system whereby the executive powers of the State are exercised the government selected by the Dáil.\n          - \"The President shall, on the nomination of Dáil Éireann, appoint the Taoiseach and the government.\"\nThis system is quite similar to the old British system of government whereby the Prime Minister selects their government from the members of parliament and the Head of State, if one exists, has very limited, mostly ceremonial powers, only operable on the advice of the government. Additionally, following the adoption of this Constitution, a new President will be elected to be the ceremonial Head of State, and the current role of Príomh Aire will be renamed to Taoiseach, literally meaning \"Chieftain\", to better demonstrate its new executive powers.\n\nAn uncommon system, proposed by members of Sinn Fein and FF, is a mixed system whereby the President has some executive power, but selects their government from Dáil Éireann and shares executive power with the Dáil-selected Príomh Aire. This system has been tried before in Russia could work as a compromise between a parliamentary and presidential system."

More importantly, it sends a strong message that Ireland is and always will be Irish, and that the Irish language will not be left to extinction.\n\nThe second option, pushed for by SF and the Ulster Unionists, adds a third section to this Article:\n          - \"3. Recognising the special position and history of the north-eastern six counties of Ulster, provision may be made for the exclusive use of English as the official language within those counties.\"\nThis would give the counties in the north an opt-out to using Irish for official business if they so choose.

The practical effects are that both the Irish and English text of a law are on equal footing, and issues of interpretation will be done on a multilingual basis.

irelandflavour.362.t: "The Death of French Liberty"
irelandflavour.362.d: "This morning in Ireland we have awoken to grave news coming from Algiers, the capital of the remnants of what many here consider the legitimate government of France, that has left many in our young republic shaken. Charles Maurras, who been granted control state after a brief civil conflict, officially addressed the French parliament yesterday to announce his intentions to restore the House of Orléans to the French throne and abolish the Third Republic once and for all. Prince Jean, the Orléanist pretender to the crown, quickly accepted de the invitation and although he is yet to be coronated it is clear to all that French republicanism is finally dead.\n\nIt is no secret that most republican movements in Europe were greatly inspired by France, and in Ireland this rings especially true. Wolfe Tone, the father of Irish republicanism, was both heavily inspired and directly supported by French republicans in his uprisings against the British crown. Even the most fundamental symbol of our state, the Irish tricolour, was created by French republican women celebrating the ousting of Louis Philippe I, great-grandfather of the new king, as a symbol of our common struggle for liberty and freedom.\n\nThis news has greatly emboldened the extremists on both the left and right in Ireland, who have already begun with their doomsaying predictions as to the future of Irish democracy. Some on the extreme right have declared this to be definitive proof that liberalism and democracy are too flawed to combat the threat posed by syndicalist forces, advocating for the creation of a modern Irish monarchy to protect our nation. Likewise those on the extreme left have interpreted this news as a sign that bourgeois democracy cannot stop the rise of reactionary authoritarianism, and see socialism as the only way to guarantee Irish liberty. We can only hope that both are equally deluded."

irelandflavour.371.t: "Mary Lavelle"
irelandflavour.371.d: "The Irish novelist and playwright Kate O'Brien was already an author of some note in the public's mind in years past, but her latest work \"Mary Lavelle\" must surely be now her most notorious.\n\nO'Brien has found her niche in typically writing romances about British and Anglo-Irish bourgeoisie characters trying to find their place in the world, following the British and Irish revolutions. Despite her fascination with the upper class, the committed anglophile O'Brien has spent much of the last decade in the Union of Britain where she relished the revolutionary atmosphere. Her lifestyle over there is much remarked upon in Ireland, as it's reported she crops her hair short, is known to wear men's clothing, and there are even rumours that she is intimate with other women.\n\nHer new book does little to dispel that innuendo, as \"Mary Lavelle\" features an older Irish lesbian professing her love for the female protagonist. This salaciousness is on top of the main thread of the story featuring the protagonist falling in love with a married man."

irelandflavour.372.t: "The Tailteann Games"
irelandflavour.372.d: "\"Do again for the Gaels what you have done for the Greeks\" — such were the slogans that littered the pamphlets that have been distributed around Leinster House for the past number of weeks. The relatively successful hosting of the modern Olympic Games in Dublin last year has led a small but influential group of Irish sports enthusiasts to put pressure on the government to re-host the Tailteann Games.\n\nThe Tailteann Games, in their original form, were played in the centuries preceding the Norman invasions of 1169-1171, and as far back as over a millennium before the birth of Christ, if legends are true. Tradition holds that they were first held to mark the funeral of the harvest deity Tailtiu, who died of exhaustion after clearing the dense, expansive forests of Co. Meath, to form the rich farmland for which it is now known. These games were declared a time of truce, with great tests of wits, skill and strength on display, and a time for celebration and the arranging of marriages.\n\nShortly before the onset of the British Revolution in 1924, the Sinn Féin administration of the day hosted a modern day equivalent, to great success. Held a few weeks after and largely modelled on the Olympic Games in Berlin, the games brought together hundreds of people of Irish descent from all over the world, as well as some guest competitors invited to come and add to the spectacle.\n\nTo the chagrin of those petitioning the government, however, these games did not become a regular fixture. Security concerns and spending issues became too much for successive governments of the day to justify, particularly when the insular nature of the games would mean there would be little international interest to invest in increasing the security involved. Even the hosting of the Olympics themselves had been a tough call to make, and had only been accepted on the back of the international recognition it would bring, assumed to outweigh the initial costs.\n\nBut with the world engulfed in further conflict, particularly in America where so much of the diaspora lies, let alone an even larger sporting event being held locally only in recent memory, there was little appetite in the government to pay heed to these petitions."
irelandflavour.372.a: "It can wait a few more years."
 
irelandflavour.373.t: "Old Friends in New England"
irelandflavour.373.d: "When the republic was in its infancy, looking for allies and international recognition, it found stalwart support in the people of New England, one of the largest homes of the Irish diaspora. When Cathal Brugha visited Boston and gave his great speech in Fenway Park, thousands of people attended and cried out for Irish independence. With the recent crisis in America devolving into all out civil war, a provisional government has been established in New England following intervention by the Canadians to shelter it from the war.\n\nWhile some in the government refuse to openly support anything backed by the British exiles, many have called for Ireland to recognise the New England government and invite the New Englander President to give his own speech symbolising Irish-American friendship and cooperation."
irelandflavour.373.a: "We never forget a friend, send the invitation."
irelandflavour.373.b: "We can't support British imperialism, no matter who leads their state."
 
irelandflavour.381.t: "Down with Jazz"
irelandflavour.381.d: "Low ranking clergy from Ireland's least populated county are not usually a matter of interest to either the nation's media or politicians, but Father Peter Conefrey from Leitrim is an exception. An arch-traditional nationalist, Conefrey advocates for the population to support the Irish language and traditional Irish music over foreign influences.\n\nViews such as those are ten-a-penny and indeed, such well trodden ground that the liberals of Ireland are well used to riposting them. However, Conefrey has found a somewhat bold new line of attack, denouncing Jazz as \"borrowed from Central Africa by a gang of wealthy syndicalists in the USA to strike at Christian civilisation throughout the world\" and branding listeners as outright \"traitors\" to Ireland, with particular venom spit towards Anglo-Irish and German residents for their indulgence of the genre.\n\nConefrey's angst-ridden views that strike at all things foreign and metropolitan saw him able to amass reportedly \"several thousand\" supporters at a recent anti-Jazz protest in south Leitrim. Letters of support from Éamon de Valera and Archbishop Joseph MacRory were read from a platform, and verbal attacks were made on politicians espousing cultural pluralist views. It would be difficult to imagine such galvanisation a decade ago but its clear that recent economic and political events have added fuel to this fire."

irelandflavour.381.c: "When economic answers are not forthcoming, the masses will be distracted by this chicanery."
 
irelandflavour.382.t: "Redmond Remembered"
irelandflavour.382.d: "Another anniversary has come and gone, with a recent commemoration taking place marking the 20th year since the passing of John Redmond.\n\nIt was a muted affair. For many, he is remembered as a man on the wrong side of history, whose actions led to the death of thousands of young Irishmen. For others, a man whose one main mistake came to define his entire political career. Redmond, during his own lifetime however, was much more than that.\n\nAs the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, he was de facto leader of Irish nationalism at the beginning of the 1910s. His goal of Home Rule was on the brink of being made a reality by Westminster, making a civil war in Ireland between the Ulster Volunteer Force and Irish Volunteers of the day seem inevitable. The outbreak of the Weltkrieg put an end to both these certainties, with Redmond making the fateful decision to urge all able-bodied Volunteers to enlist in the British war effort, in an attempt to ensure the enactment of Home Rule after what was sure to be another brief war...\n\nHe was a man for whom Home Rule was the end goal, and would have been content with an autonomous Ireland at the heart of the British Empire. This is when most others, even within his party, saw it as just a step towards greater independence. His legacy is one that is looked upon more favourably by those who would have had more personal ties with Britain, and the few more moderate republicans with Entente sympathies.\n\nIn his native Wexford where he had been interred, a modest and respectful ceremony took place at his family mausoleum, with attendees including several Fianna Fáil politicians and party officials, as well as some Irish veterans of the Weltkrieg. Those present were urged to reconsider his legacy, and remember him for the times he lived in, before the Republic could have become a reality. This message was of course meant for those not in attendance, and by-and-large fell on deaf ears."
irelandflavour.382.a: "He was a man of his time."
 
irelandflavour.385.t: "The Burning of the Big Houses"
irelandflavour.385.d1: "One of the lingering vestiges of British colonialism in Ireland are the so-called \"Big Houses\", country manors dotted all along rural Ireland. Although primarily homes, these houses have the dual purpose of acting as the nexus of agricultural complexes. Typically, dozens and dozens of farm hands will work out of a courtyard adjacent to the house, with the owner acting as their boss. The origin of this system is mediaeval, and in truth has not advanced much in concept since that time.\n\nIn Ireland, these manors were and are controlled by Anglo-Irish families, installed in the 17th and 18th centuries as the preceding Catholic nobility was stripped of power and influence. Owing their wealth and status to the British state that installed them, these families were loyal servants of Imperialism, acting to uphold the status quo not only locally, but also internationally, as the non-inheriting sons of these families frequently acted as colonial bureaucrats across the British Empire. Following the revolution in Britain, the \"big houses\" were often the last refuge for these \"servants of the Empire\".\n\nAs the fire of revolution spreads across the island, it was inevitable the people would rise up and attempt to destroy these fortresses of foreign capital. Broadly, the government is turning a blind eye, as behind closed doors these acts have been deemed a symptom of revolutionary vigour and not something to be repressed. Having spent this long building the fire, now is not the time to try and dampen it." # Syndies / Totalists

irelandflavour.386.t: "The Gaelic Athletic Association"
irelandflavour.386.d1: "The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) was founded in 1884 during the so-called \"Gaelic Revival\" to protect and promote traditional Irish sports. In achieving that goal, the GAA succeeded remarkably. Whereas before the advent of the GAA, the \"Gaelic\" games of football, hurling, handball, and rounders were largely moribund, come Irish independence GAA-affiliated clubs could be found in every Irish parish.

The GAA continues to organise and govern those sports both at home and abroad, and GAA clubs and events often draw massive crowds of spectators.\n\nUnsurpisingly, for an organisation dedicated to cultural revivalism, in the political sphere the GAA was and is strongly associated with Irish nationalism.

It was a massacre perpetrated by Crown Forces on civilian spectators at a Gaelic Football match in the GAA's flagship Croke Park stadium, \"Bloody Sunday\", that became a potent symbol of British tyranny during the War of Independence.\n\nThe GAA was briefly granted authority over Irish athletics generally until the foundation of the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) in mid-1922. At that time, Ireland had recently signed the Anglo-Irish treaty with the United Kingdom and support for the GAA by the newly independent Ireland was understood to potentially undermine unity in sport. That bifurcation remained in place even after the end of British rule in the North and has continued through until the present. Though the Gaelic Games (and thus the GAA) receive substantial patronage from the government in Dublin, in the interests of maintaining social harmony, the present government of the republic seems certain to continue to uphold that state of affairs."

Already, the state has begun to carry out that struggle arm-in-arm with the GAA.

Though the GAA was briefly granted authority over Irish athletics generally, the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) was founded in mid-1922 and maintains authority over many areas of athletics, including those foreign games which ought to be driven from Ireland to begin with.

In effect, an unspoken agreement came into force between the GAA and Dublin whereby each left the other alone to the extent possible. For its part, the Irish Government has continued to lean upon Gaelic sport for legitimacy, eliciting only unofficial grumbling from the organisation's leadership, while the GAA remained independent. However, the GAA seems to have further reconciled itself to the socialist government in recent months, with socialists accepted and elected into various association leadership positions. Ranking GAA members have even appeared alongside government officials at a number of high-profile events, indicating that the GAA is slowly turning a bit pink, if not yet entirely red."

irelandflavour.387.d1: "Of all the figures of Irish mythology, none is as well-known as the famed champion of Ulster, Cú Chulainn. Born with the name Sétanta, he gained his more famous moniker, meaning \"the Hound of Culann\", as a child after killing in self-defence the guard-dog of the smith Culann, offering to take the dog's place out of obligation. Trained in the art of combat in Scotland, he soon became Ulster's strongest warrior, most famously defending the kingdom against the armies of Queen Medb of Connacht in the mythological epic, the \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\".\n\nA well-regarded bronze statue designed by Oliver Sheppard, a sculptor who competed in art competitions during the 1924 and 1928 Olympics, depicts Cú Chulainn's ultimate death in battle, having tied himself to a stone, according to some tellings with his own intestines, to die on his feet, leaving his foes unaware of his demise for three days until a raven perched upon his shoulder. Although a Protestant born in County Tyrone, Sheppard is nonetheless an Irish nationalist who in his own words stated that \"my politics are simple. I have always thought that this country should be a free country\", and has his own connection to the struggle for independence, having been a teacher of Willie Pearse, brother of the renowned Pádraig Pearse.\n\nWith the sculpture remaining unsold in Sheppard's studio despite the admiration for it, the government made the move to purchase it, but is at a divide on where to place it. Some have considered moving the statue to the General Post Office in Dublin, birthplace of the Easter Rising, as a way of symbolising the courage of the Irish and reinvigorating patriotism as tensions mount in Europe. However, loyalists have also tried to claim the mythological hero as their own on account of his defense of Ulster from the other provinces of Ireland, and while many are skeptical of this, it has been suggested that locating it at Belfast City Hall could serve as a means of bridging the local sectarian divide by emphasising the people's common provincial identity as Ulstermen."

Through the fine work of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ireland's access to a vital source of energy had been secured. As this fuel was not found naturally in Ireland, it could only be obtained by importing from countries much closer to the equator, and so important was this resource, that many wondered how so many industrial sectors had managed without it in the past, given how reliant they are now on the rich, dark liquid it produced.\n\nTea. \"The only good thing the British ever left us with\", as has been murmured about the peoples' love of the beverage. Such is its popularity that per capita, Irelands' demand now outstrips its neighbours. Introduced by the old British ruling class well over a hundred years ago, its usage diffused among the rest of the population in time.\n\nTraditionally, the British had gained their supply of the leaf from their colonies on the Indian subcontinent, with the Union now obtaining similarly from their own Indian allies. While access to this source for ourselves seems steady, for now, cautious whispers determined that it would be unwise to solely rely on it, should the trade be disrupted in the future.\n\nAs such, a small group of Irish diplomats had spent the last few months travelling the world, visiting plantations and negotiating importation deals, finally determining that mixing some Indian Assam tea with the darker, stronger tea available in German-held Kenya, would produce an excellent robust brew, suitable for the domestic market. By decreasing the country's reliance on potentially unreliable solely Indian sources, and diversifying the blends used, the results have meant both a better tasting tea, and more secure access to imports for the years to come."

Serialised in \"The Worker's Republic\" newspaper and written almost entirely as a series of gossipy and bitter conversations between the dead in a Connemara graveyard, the book has been hailed by those gifted to understand it as a comic masterpiece, and its surge in popularity has begun to inspire a flood of Irish-language writing.\n\nBorn in the coastal Gaeltacht area of Cois Fharraige in County Galway, Ó Cadhain's outrage at the impoverishment of his community has fuelled his politics towards a fervent belief in syndicalism, and the revival of the Irish tongue. An activist for the rights of Gaeilgeoirí, or Irish-speakers, against the negligence of previous governments, he engaged in cooperation at times with the legionnarist wing of the Blueshirts due to their mutual reverence for Ireland's native language, but remained a committed socialist. Among the Irish Citizen Army, he became recognised for his talent as a recruiting officer, an organisation of which his membership would lead to him being sacked from his teaching job.\n\nNow in a position to promote his dearly-held views after the Second Irish Revolution, he has become the pioneer of a concept known as \"Athghabháil na hÉireann\", or the \"Reconquest of Ireland\", which regards both English and the growing lingua franca of German as tools of capitalism, and advances that only through socialism will the tongue of the Irish people be saved and the nation fully decolonised. Through this theory, he has sought win the support of Irish speakers for the new Republic, including former supporters of Aontas Náísiúnta who he argues were led astray by the forces of reaction, but that their cultural nationalism is at heart well-intentioned and harnessable for positive ends should they learn the error of their ways."

irelandflavour.3811.d: "Samhain. The night of the year when the boundaries between the worlds of the dead and the living are at their weakest. The souls of the dead and the Aos Sí, or fairies, return to our world to be welcomed and appeased. Candles are lit, bonfires soar, prayers are said and every number of primordial rituals come into practise.\n\nThe last night of October has come to be known as Hallowe'en in the English language for many years, but it is in Ireland that many of these traditions originate. The night before the beginning of winter, as the first of November is in the Irish calendar, was the end of the harvest season and the start of the darkening of the days. Officially, All Saints' Day is the 1st of November, and is recognised by the Catholic Church as a Holy Day of Obligation, with all Catholics expected to attend Mass, and with All Souls' Day the day after. But this is only the Church taking advantage of the more ancient, arcane and local pre-Christian beliefs of the population.\n\nGhoulish faces are carved into turnips, with candles fitted and lit inside to give them an otherworldly aura. People roam the countryside between distant homesteads, clad in imitation of the very beings also said to be present that night, themselves expecting to be placated with food and drink in exchange for song or verse. The dead are remembered and toasts held in their honour.\n\nSimilar customs exist elsewhere, but in particular the Gaelic traditions have taken root in the United States, following the mass exodus that has occurred over the last century. There they have taken up many of their own forms, which themselves have travelled back to Ireland via returning immigrants.\n\nCelebrations this year themselves have taken an even more macabre turn, with tensions rising around the world, and with the United States, the new home of many Irish people and the land of opportunity, up in flames. Some new traditions have come back to Ireland with previous returning emigrants and new refugees — but war would not be one that would be welcome."

irelandflavour.3812.d1: "Theatre in Ireland has long served as a proud cultural touchstone for the nation, and especially in recent years, as a form of escapism from the troublesome situation of the world. Political violence has unfortunately also been a major part of the nation's history, and last night at the Abbey Theatre these two worlds collided after riots broke out at the debut of a new overtly political play known as \"The Star Turns Red\".\n\nThe playwright behind the production, Seán O'Casey, has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, and this recent play is no different. One of O'Casey's previous plays \"The Plough and the Stars\" has often been interpreted as criticism of overvaluing Irish nationalism at the expense of the working class, leading initially to calls for it to be censored, and ultimately a riot broke out at a performance over the perceived insult to Irish identity. Likewise, \"The Star Turns Red\" has been interpreted by some as an attack against the fundamentals of Irish identity, the Catholic Church, and modern Irish politics. The protagonist of the play, \"Red Jim\", who is very clearly inspired by Irish socialist leader Jim Larkin, leads his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", interpreted as a parallel for O'Duffy's Blueshirts.\n\nAlthough police are still compiling a full picture of the events of last night, it appears that several members of the Blueshirts were in attendance, resulting in a brawl breaking out which quickly escalated into a riot. Like with O'Casey's last play to cause this level of unrest, there are calls to ban his play to keep the peace, with those aligned with O'Duffy going as far to call for O'Casey's arrest for producing \"a blasphemous piece of syndicalist propaganda\".\n\nWhile there is little reason to escalate matters this far, banning performances of the play may protect us from further incidents and the spread of syndicalist views. This degree of government censorship may however be seen by the public as a move towards further authoritarianism, and it may make sense to approach this situation more carefully by only having a few ministers officially condemn the play instead."
irelandflavour.3812.d2: "Ever since the dust settled on the corpse of the old order in Britain, Ireland has had to deal with jumped-up syndicalist playwrights and poets from across the Sea producing propaganda, in the hopes it will one day lead to a socialist revolution here as well. While it is easy to ignore all of these plays written by British authors, the same cannot be said about a betrayal of a play produced by one of our own.\n\nSeán O'Casey, a noted Irish playwright who has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, recently debuted his new play \"The Star Turns Red\" at the Apollo Theatre in London, after being rightfully blocked from having it performed at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. The central conflict of the play revolves around the protagonist \"Red Jim\", a stand-in for Irish socialist leader Jim Larkin, leading his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", a clear parallel for the Blueshirts. The play concludes with a dedication to the \"brave workers\" of Ireland, who they claim \"will soon be freed from reactionary oppression\".\n\nDespite being shown only in London, news of this blatant attack by a traitorous syndicalist quickly reached the office of a furious [IRE_loc_leader_surname] in Leinster House. Not long afterwards, a statement was officially released denouncing O'Casey's play as \"an indecent and blasphemous piece of syndicalist propaganda\", labelling the man himself as a traitor, and banning all of his works from being performed again in Ireland. Despite it still being unclear if the British government supported O'Casey in any way, an arrest warrant has still been issued against him for conspiring with the British state to overthrow the organs of the Irish Government, effectively exiling him from the country. With [IRE_loc_leader_surname]'s continued anger over the incident, O'Casey should consider himself lucky that he has gotten off so \"lightly\"."

The recent debut of an exciting new play entitled \"The Star Turns Red\" has been the perfect excuse for such a break, with multiple prominent members of the new government attending the performance at the Abbey Theatre.\n\nThe playwright behind the production, Seán O'Casey, has always been unapologetically open about his socialist beliefs, and the recent revolution in Ireland has clearly been an inspiration for his latest work, with many noticing obvious parallels between its plot and the events of recent months. The central conflict of the play revolves around a general strike orchestrated by the protagonist of the play \"Red Jim\", who leads his union into the eventual takeover of his country while battling against the Catholic Church-backed \"Saffron Shirts\", interpreted as a parallel for O'Duffy's Blueshirts. The play concludes with a dedication to the brave workers who took part in the Second Irish Revolution, and many are widely regarding the production as a shining example of syndicalist performance art.\n\nAmong those praising the contents of the new play was one Jim Larkin, who O'Casey has known for decades now and is proud to call a friend. Following the production he was heard expressing his enjoyment of the new play to the other members of government present, especially praising the performance given by the lead actor who he described as \"truly portrayed the socialist spirit of Ireland\". Following such high praise and positive reviews, it can only be hoped that this is just the beginning of a new exciting era of Irish theatre."

irelandflavour.391.d: "Ireland is in mourning today as it learnt of the death of William Butler Yeats, a giant of modern Irish culture over the course of several decades.\n\nYeats had helped spearhead the Irish Literary Revival in literature starting in the 1890s, while founding a bedrock of Irish theatre, the Abbey Theatre, in 1904. Throughout his working life, he had promoted Irish culture and mythology, and stressed an Irish identity that was completely separate from a British one. His greatest personal achievement was winning a Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923 for his poetry; coming at a heady time for Yeats, who had just witnessed the birth of an independent Ireland, something he had long supported. In 1922 he was appointed a member of the Senate, and spent the next several years experiencing first-hand the politics of the new state. Although during his time as senator Yeats was not affiliated with any party, not even Sinn Féin, he was not afraid to make his political views known, and was firm in the Senate in voicing his opinion on cultural and educational matters. Yeats offered a unique perspective, as he not only spoke as an artist, but also as someone who was both a Protestant and a nationalist.\n\nIn the final years of his life, Yeats became an informal supporter of the Blueshirts, drawn both to the firm paternalistic stances of Eoin O'Duffy and the mystic nationalism of Gearoid Ó Cuinneagáin. Yeats had always grated against individualism and liberalism, and the increasing influence of both upon Sinn Féin greatly displeased him. While AN were greatly pleased to learn of a supporter of Yeats' calibre, they were disappointed that they were never able to truly utilise his presence outside of Yeats creating three marching songs for the organisation.\n\nAlthough Yeats is now gone, his legacy will be long-lasting and regardless of his political views, most can acknowledge his sizable contributions to Irish cultural life."

irelandflavour.392.d: "It has been more than fifteen years since \"Amhrán na bhFiann\", or \"A Soldier's Song\" was officially adopted as the national anthem. The song, with words written by Peadar Kearney, and music by him and Patrick Heaney, first emerged in 1910, with the now-widespread lyrics in Irish being published by Liam Ó Rinn in 1923. It follows a long tradition of emotive patriotic songs, speaking of an Ireland from long ago that now calls again to be defended against her enemies and oppressors. Making the composition all the more meaningful however, was its popularity among the Irish Volunteers leading up to 1916, and later in the Frongoch prison camp where many were interned afterwards, to the extent that it was unofficially known as the \"Sinn Féin anthem\".\n\nWhat began life as a jaunty marching song has reconstructed into a stirring national anthem. This has been helped in no small part by the reworking of the song for full orchestra, and also for marching band, as well as chorus, transforming the song and adding an appropriate amount of gravitas, depending on the occasion.\n\nYet, as with all things in a relatively newly independent country such as Ireland, there are questions which overhang it. As a piece of music that is profoundly and unashamedly associated with the nationalist tradition, some have doubted its ability to act as an olive branch to those who may have originally been, or remain, loyalists. Others feel that the official status of the Irish language translation, despite the song being originally written in English, is off-putting to poor speakers of the language, or that the melody is suitable but the lyrics lacklustre. Yet others agree with all of the sentiment of the song, but feel that there are older, potentially more legitimate anthems to be found in the plethora of pieces that make up the Irish musical tradition.\n\nThe obvious answer would be to leave it unchanged, but it is up to the government to decide the final decision."

One area, however, where sectarianism seems to be slipping away is in the area of sport, Association Football (\"soccer\") specifically.\n\nAt the start of the century, soccer lagged considerably behind Gaelic football in popularity, as the Gaelic Athletics Association steered the sport to a meteoric rise, at least with the Catholic population of Ireland. With Gaelic football's ties to Irish nationalism, many Ulster Protestants instead veered towards soccer, and indeed, upon the foundation of the League of Ireland, all the teams were from Ulster and only one team, Belfast Celtic, was associated with Catholics. However, this stark divide has been dissolving over the decades, with the glamour and prestige of the World Cup helping to draw a more diverse base into the game. Not only have new teams emerged from Dublin and Cork but also smaller Irish towns such as Dundalk, Limerick, Waterford and Sligo, with the \"Sligo Rovers\" becoming the first team outside of Leinster or Ulster to win the league this year.\n\nThe popularity of the league was also boosted by a small influx of players arriving from Britain, particularly from Scotland and the Liverpool area, as professional teams in the Union were scrapped and reorganised on a large scale, to reflect a nominally more egalitarian makeup with the rise of \"work teams\" and other amateur clubs. Now featuring a healthy mix of players from around the Isles and a range of teams from across Ireland, the League of Ireland has become an avenue for football supporters from different parts of the country to intermingle. Indeed, some supporters from Dublin are now travelling to Belfast for certain games, and vice versa." # Dems

irelandflavour.393.d4: "One of the most important teachings of Marx is that class is more important than culture or religion — for example, Protestant and Catholic workers share much more in common than a poor Catholic and a rich Catholic do. An area where this phenomenon becomes apparent is in sports.\n\nAlthough our island has been plagued by sectarianism for centuries, in recent decades both Protestants and Catholics of the working class found common ground by playing and watching Association Football, or \"Soccer\", together. Although the inherent good of athleticism and community-building was apparent, the capitalists sought to commodify it. Instead of taking a wholesome amateur approach like in Gaelic Games, the British-aligned bourgeois encouraged \"professionalism\" in Irish soccer. While players were paid a salary (which was acceptable), they were also treated as commodities who could be bought and sold between teams like cattle at marts. Instead of teams of locals, who could be proudly supported by friends and neighbours, the ranks of soccer teams became those of strangers and mercenaries.\n\nNow that we have a socialist leadership in this country, the time has come to follow the example set in Britain and France and to re-organise soccer. Teams will be based around workplaces or professions, not owners. With soccer organised in this way, not only can it be a tool to encourage fitness, but it can help destroy sectarianism as well." # Socialists

The creation of the new Provincial Council was announced earlier today by the President of the GAA, making it very clear that the GAA's plans to foster the rebirth of Irish culture in Britain are only just beginning.\n\nAlthough at present only the London and Lancashire county boards make up the newly established British GAA, there is already discussion on how to properly incorporate the more minor county boards of Warwickshire, Yorkshire, and Gloucestershire into the GAA while also establishing proper county boundaries across Britain. Steps have already been taken in Ireland to help foster the growth of the Games in Britain, with this year's annual congress finally abolishing the archaic Rule 21 which banned all members of British security forces from joining the GAA.\n\nWhile Ireland will almost certainly remain the home and core of the Games, many are hopefully within a few decades the British scene will have fully established itself as a key part of the GAA with tefams from both countries competing against each other."

irelandflavour.399.t: "My Fair Fabian"
irelandflavour.399.d: "The last few decades has seen untold change in the literary world, with romanticism eclipsed by realism and then modernism. This artistic upheaval has replaced the old with the new, and rate of change seems to be unceasing. Different writers have fit into this in various ways, but the distinct nature of the writings of George Bernard Shaw have necessitated the coining of the eponymous neologism \"Shavian\".\n\nBorn in 1856 into a family of Anglo-Irish Protestant Dubliners, a background usually associated with privilege, his father's drinking meant his own family was of fairly modest means. He moved to London at 19, following his mother after his parent's separation, and began his life anew. There he began writing novels, plays, music critique and newspaper columns, but also became involved with what would become the Fabian Society, writing as a political polemicist.\n\nBoth his writings and political views evolved and progressed over the coming decades, with the latter shifting from Marxism to Fabianism to his own idiosyncratic socialist perspectives that have been described as outspoken as they are self-contradictory. He has at different times castigated vaccination, organised religion and anti-semitism, and espoused support for vegetarianism, the Maximists in the Union of Britain, and the actions of Michael Collins in particular.\n\nShaw continues to write prolifically, and is considered a pre-eminent pro-Irish voice in the Union of Britain's intellectual sphere, where he has lived almost all of his professional life. His more gradualist socialist leanings withered away at the advent of the British Revolution, after his moderate Home Ruler views on Ireland shifted after the 1916 Rising. Despite his only occasional visits, he has maintained mutual admiration and close working relationships with the likes of WB Yeats and Seán O'Casey, both closely associated with the Irish nationalist movement.\n\nIn previous years, his unconventional views, let alone place of residence, made him one of Ireland's most notorious emigrés for the media and political establishment. But time, and his Nobel Prize, have softened opinions of him even from his political opposites. He remains a son of Éire, who remained true to his country as he sees it, and one whose eagerly awaited works bring no lack of discussion and intrigue."

irelandflavour.3910.t2: "The Starry Plough"
irelandflavour.3910.d1: "It is known simply as the tricolour, or, \"an trídhathach\", and is the national flag of Ireland, or \"bratach na hÉireann\". First flown in 1848 by Thomas Francis Meagher in Waterford City, Irish republican and later governor of Montana, it was sewn for him by a group of French women sympathetic to the Irish nationalist cause, at a time of revolution in France itself.\n\nMeagher's intended symbolism, and its inspiration from the French Tricolore, has remained unchanged in interpretation. Green for the Gaelic tradition and Roman Catholics, and orange for those Protestant followers of William of Orange, famed victor of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, which lead to the entrenchment of the Protestant Ascendency. And white, representing the everlasting hope of peace and unity between both traditions. The tricoloured pattern of the flag being of course rich in association with the ideals of republicanism, liberty and revolution.\n\nDespite existing for almost eighty years, it held familiarity, but was in the background of the public consciousness for the majority of existence, only growing in stature rapidly after it was flown above the GPO in 1916. Since then it has come to represent, at first, Irish republicanism, and shortly afterwards, Ireland itself.\n\nIts critics are few. Some would point out the futility in representing a group of people, that is loyalist Protestants, on the flag of a Republic that they under normal circumstances would want no part of. More hardline nationalist critics would point out that loyalists make up one-third of the flag, despite their numbers being closer to one-sixth of the population. For the vast majority of people however, the government included, it is a symbol of Ireland, however aspirational it may be, and one of the few political matters that almost everyone can agree on."
irelandflavour.3910.d2: "Just as the harp was once replaced by the tricolour as the symbol of Ireland, so too has that old rag, with its religious connotations, been torn down in favour of one truly capable of uniting the Irish people, the Starry Plough. Designed by the Irish Citizen Army in the months after the great Dublin lockout, the original version depicted a golden plough with a sword for a coulter and seven silver stars forming the Big Dipper, also known as the Plough, several bright stars of the constellation Ursa Major, against a green background.\n\nThe flag would see its first use being flown over the Imperial Hotel in Dublin during the Easter Rising by the ICA, and although it was once thought to have gone up in flames along with the building it flew atop as British crown forces took the city, it was in reality retrieved by T.A. Williams, a British soldier who kept it as a trophy, and after the Second Irish Revolution located and handed over as a token of the rekindled friendship between the two nations. It presently sits proudly on display at the National Museum.\n\nIn the aftermath of the British Revolution, as Irish syndicalists, stabbed in the back by bourgeois nationalists from both the pro-treaty and anti-treaty wings of Sinn Féin, got together to reorganise the Irish Citizen Army so as to someday topple the false inheritors of Irish republicanism and bring to fruition the true ideals of the Irish revolution, a new design was adopted based on the recollections of ICA veterans, in blue and more minimalistic. This goal has now been achieved and though the banner may differ from its origins, the timeless meaning accorded to it by James Connolly himself has remained the same; a free Ireland shall control its destiny from the plough to the stars."

For over a century, the only extant translation was the Bedell-O'Donnell bible, undertaken by the Protestant Church of Ireland, resulting in its denunciation at the pulpit as \"An Bíobla Gallda\", or \"the foreign bible\". Despite this troubled legacy, officially recognising this Bible would serve as a gesture of religious unity, though the Catholic Church would with no doubt disapprove.\n\nAlternatively, lest we provoke the ire of the Church and devoted Catholics, we have the option of releasing the unpublished manuscripts of Peadar Ua Laoghaire, a Catholic priest and Irish language who strove in the later years of his life to translate the Bible into Munster Irish. Or, taking a third course, we could commission Earnán de Siúnta, an executive of Conradh na Gaelige and a translator, to retranslate the Bible into modern Irish, in the hope that via presenting de Siúnta's new translation as a government-approved Bible intended for all Christian denominations, we may minimise the risk of igniting sectarian tensions and alienating sections of the Irish nation who might otherwise support our national revival."

irelandflavour.3913.d: "Today the government received calls to make an official statement regarding the upcoming Pan-Celtic Congress, taking place shortly on the Isle of Man. The Pan-Celtic movement could be described as a fringe position at best, calling for enhanced cooperation, cultural exchange and mutual understanding among the \"Celtic\" peoples, namely those from Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man, Wales, Cornwall and Brittany. The idea of the \"Celts\" as a separate race, as opposed to different groups of people who spoke a related group of languages, took root in the 1800s with advancements in the field of linguistics, but remains a matter of scholarly debate.\n\nWhile de facto apolitical, it is unsurprising that many of the participants in the Congress would advocate for independence, or at least autonomy, for their respective nations. They would hold the view that the Celts are an ancient race, and share solidarity with each other in their belief of their literal marginalisation by the French and English by forcing them to live on the edge of their respective landmasses, pushed up against the wild North Atlantic, and also of the severe discrimination experienced by their languages, driven almost to extinction in some cases. For most attendees of Congress however, the occasion is a light-hearted one, full of songs and stories. The evening is punctuated with the display of each nations' respective musical styles and traditions, with songs often sharing common origins, coming together in varied concurrent arrangements like some form of Celtic symphony\n\nEven the most radical of the Irish nationalists never aimed for a unified Celtic state, let alone an Irish-led one, as regardless of the debate as to where it would begin or end, or the relative lack of a shared identity, the struggle of independence alone was deemed enough. Nonetheless, the idea of some form of Celtic kinship, however tenuous, holds a certain romanticised appeal across the political spectrum, and the state's official delegation was well-received as it said as much to the attendees of the Congress."

His brand has been closely associated with Ireland for many years now, not least because of the similarity of the Guinness logo with Ireland's coat of arms, but the reputation of synonymity over the past decade has reached the extent that many writers have come to describe it as being almost emblematic of Ireland in the modern era.\n\nThe Guinness family, or originally, Mac Aonghusa and then Magennis, were an old Gaelic clan, and one of the very few which converted to Anglicanism at the time of the Reformation. They benefited from this in kind, with the wealth and prestige that came with fully integrating themselves in the Anglo-Irish cohort that ruled Ireland for most the last few hundred years.\n\nFor a time their success was a symbol of Anglo-Irish prosperity and industry, and their dark beer became popular throughout Ireland but also the British Empire in its entirety. Profiting from this relationship, unlike most in Ireland, the Guinnesses became prominent unionists, eager to maintain and expand their commercial success into the future.\n\nThough the British revolution came as a shock to their main clientele, the company somehow seamlessly expanded its market into Mitteleuropa, where Ireland's place away from the old British and closer to the greater German sphere of influence has taken the beer to become somewhat trendy, or even chic on the continent. This change was been taken by many to be a symbol of Ireland's place in the world as an independent nation — one that has replaced the old with the new, but essentially maintained much of itself.\n\nThe beer continues to enjoy great success, at home and abroad. Despite its newfound popularity on the continent, some Anglophile tendencies of its owners remain, even if softened, to the extent that the beer is still in good demand for shipments to what remains of the British Empire, in some ways linking Ireland's past with its present and future."

To censure the company or limit production would cost Ireland in its international reputation, and the display of some amount of tolerance towards them can be shown by the new government as a sign of benevolence and assured continuity.

The Guinness family indeed to originally have Gaelic roots, and even if their conversion to Anglicanism can be tolerated, their former loyalty to Britain and ongoing Anglophilic sympathies are considered a nuisance at best, if not quite so apparent as the name of the brand itself. The act of the antecedents of the company's owners to adopt an anglicised version of their surname is one that has personally bothered Ó Cuinnegáin, who has publicly declared his consideration for forcing the company to rename itself or face nationalisation. For the moment though, they are free to call themselves as they wish, but within a few years it may be a distinct possibility."

Regardless of ownership however, the name of the brand remains, and as it travelled across the British Empire, so shall it travel to workers on all corners of the globe."

irelandflavour.411.d1: "This morning, the office of [IRE.GetLeader] released a brief statement on the passing of the renowned Irish author James Joyce. According to the release, Joyce passed away late last night at his home in Paris. Joyce had only published his final novel, Finnegans Wake, a short time ago.\n\nIn life, Joyce was acclaimed as among the most significant authors of his era, and was considered an Irish cultural ambassador. In death, it seems certain that his star will only rise further. However, the position of the Irish Government towards the author remains ambiguous.\n\nWhile Joyce was initially counted openly alongside Ireland's literary greats, he later courted controversy and consequentially soured official opinion. During the Weltkrieg, Joyce resided in Switzerland, where he worked vigorously on \"Ulysses\", a novel set in Dublin paralleling Homer's epic. Joyce, however, was unable to publish his novel for years after finishing it, and relocated to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Time and again, \"Ulysses\" was rejected for publication the world over.\n\nJoyce was finally able to publish the novel in his native Ireland during a period of liberalisation which followed the British Revolution, and consequently settled in Dublin to much fanfare. However, despite the immediate acclaim for \"Ulysses\", it was eventually withdrawn from publication. Joyce then found himself facing a number of lawsuits over both the book's contents and his personal conduct, and the author fled Ireland for the Commune of France to avoid them.\n\nThough Joyce identified as a socialist, he rarely expressed his political opinions in public, even after taking up residence in syndicalist France. Nonetheless, his mere presence there proved an embarrassment for Dublin, and Paris knew it. More than once, the author was the subject of some not-so-offhand comment by some Communard politician or another."

irelandflavour.1.t: "Independence Day"
irelandflavour.1.d: "On Monday, the 24th of April 1916, members of the Irish Volunteers, Irish Citizen Army and Cumann na mBan seized key locations in Dublin and declared a free Irish republic. Vastly outmanned and outgunned by the British Army, Ireland's sons fought on for six days until nearly all were captured or killed. The execution without trial of most of the remaining leaders had a massive impact on Irish politics, and the level of popular support it brought to Irish independence was profound.\n\nThough free Ireland did not initially commemorate the Rising in a governmental capacity, that changed after the British Revolution and its subsequent repercussions on several aspects of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Now, the Irish Government recognises the Easter Rising as the first battle of the armed struggle for independence that culminated in the end of seven hundred years of British rule.\n\nConcomitant with that, the cities and towns of Ireland now swell with Independence Day festivities on each 24th of April, and the President gives an official address outside of the General Post Office in Dublin where Pádraig Pearse first proclaimed the Irish Republic."

Though a failure that would be dwarfed by more substantial arms shipments during the War of Independence, the fateful events of 1916 still hold a key place in the hearts of the Irish public.\n\nWith German diplomatic and military representatives in attendance, the captain of the Libau on that day, Karl Spindler, along with the surviving members of his crew, were greeted by enthusiastic crowds. The captain stepped onto the podium in Dublin and made speech expressing his pride in his role in the fight for Irish freedom and lauded the growing relations between the [IRE_loc_country_name] and his fatherland. After the ceremony, Spindler was awarded a medal of pure gold, and his crewmates bronze medals for their heroic deed.\n\nWhile some voices continue to grumble about a loss of neutrality, the celebration seems to achived its purpose in bolstering pro-German feelings and uniting the Irish people with our gallant allies in the common struggle against syndicalist tyranny."

As what remains of the British Empire enters a state of mourning, Ireland finds itself in a more complicated situation. Unsurprisingly, Northern Ireland and the Ulster Unionist Party have entered a state of official mourning for their King, but elsewhere feelings are mixed.\n\nKing George has often been cited as something of a Hibernophile, and his interventions in support of Ireland are quietly respected among even republicans; criticising Britain's reaction to the Easter Rising, attempting to stop executions during the War of Independence, and fierce opposition to the notorious British paramilitaries, the Black and Tans. But perhaps his most enduring feat would be convincing his Tory cabinet to approve his famous speech at the opening of the Northern Irish Parliament, promoting peace, forgiveness and reconciliation amongst all Irishmen, which at least somewhat has come to pass...\n\nFor most of Ireland, the memory of its one-time King is still tainted by all that he represented, but on a personal basis, he was widely acknowledged as even-handed. While there is no doubt that even outside of the north, many Irish men and women are noting the occasion respectfully, President Collins has been warned that any overt displays of grief or support could ignite tense political strife that runs amok in these trying days."

Against his own wishes, Casement was buried in an English prison following his execution in 1916 for treason, after he ran guns from Germany to Ireland for the Easter Rising.\n\nAn immediate and rowdy debate ensued amongst the cabinet about whether this is some kind of ploy by the British, or a genuine attempt at soothing relations. The British, for their part, have presented this as an olive branch that will coincide with the 21st anniversary of the Easter Rising.\n\nWhile the opportunity to give Casement a proper burial is extremely appealing, some members of the cabinet have noted this deal would require at least some kind of glad-handing of the Union of Britain, if not an outright public acknowledgement of them as a \"fellow Republic\".\n\nIt would be difficult for the govenment to publically sing the Union of Britain's praises in return for Casement, but on the other hand, refusing the offer might be tantamount to political suicide, as the opposition and public would never claim to understand it."

With the sleepy status quo of previous years broken, the desire to update certain facets of Irish life to mainland standards has begun to be embraced by cosmopolitans and nationalists alike, the former seeking to tie Ireland closer to its European partners, and the latter favouring the abolition of archaic leftovers inherited from the legacy of British rule.\n\nReflecting the growing popularity of such modernising proposals, it has been suggested that Ireland should transition from the old British system of left-hand traffic to the continental system of right-hand traffic, bringing the nation's road rules into line with the other nations of Europe and the Americas.\n\nSupporters have emphasised the long-term benefits such a switch may have on foreign tourism and on importing and exporting vehicles internationally, though opponents have fired back, decrying the proposal as likely to lead to havoc on Irish roads and a frivolous waste of valuable time and resources better spent tackling the remaining effects of Black Monday."

irelandflavour.1008.t: "Setting the Clocks Forward"
irelandflavour.1008.d: "With a continued demand among sections of the public to re-examine practices passed down from Ireland's history of British governance, the previous motion to alter the state's road rules to be in accordance with the bulk of the continent's traffic systems appears not the last suggested reform, as a considerably more radical proposal has taken shape. It has been advocated by this strange reformist coalition of cosmopolitans and anti-syndicalists that the nation's clocks should be moved ahead an hour to match Germany's Central European Time.\n\nSynchronising the Irish Republic's time zone with central Europe would, the reformers argue, lessen syndicalist influence and prove beneficial with regards to commerce with its Mitteleuropan partners, comprising the destination of the majority of Irish exports since the fall of the British Empire, aiding the country in resuming its vital export trade and mending the damage caused by the preceding year's financial crisis.\n\nDetractors, on the other hand, have derided the idea as an act of utter madness, warning of its effects on sunrise and sunset times, and of the detrimental consequences it may have on Ireland's economic sovereignty by tying Irish national fortunes further to those of Germany despite Black Monday having, in their view, dramatically unveiled the flaws of such a strategy."

irelandflavour.1009.t1: "A Hot July"
irelandflavour.1009.t2: "Putting the Foot Down"
irelandflavour.1009.d1: "On the 12th of July in the year 1690, the Catholic King James II of England was defeated by William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne. For Irish Catholics, James' defeat brought about their subjugation under the harsh Penal Laws, but for Ulster Protestants, the victorious William was a saviour who had delivered them from the spectre of Catholic domination, and solidified their legitimacy to settle in Ireland, having arrived from Britain only a few decades prior.\n\nThe date became a key loyalist commemoration, celebrated with marches by the fraternal Orange Order and with bonfires the night before. Although the majority of loyalists had grudgingly accepted joining the hated Irish Republic as an alternative to syndicalism, the burning of Irish, British and German flags atop these bonfires took off during the interwar period, as an avenue to express passive resistance.\n\nThough the month was always a nervous affair due to the ever-present ethno-religious hostilities, the rise of AN, the NLCL and the UPL made the build up to this year's twelfth particularly tense, as June and early July were marked by an increase in reports of sectarian violence perpetrated by Blueshirts and UPL supporters. These mounting tensions exploded on the Twelfth itself, as a confrontation broke out while an Orange Order march passed through a Catholic area, escalating into a riot. Gardaí were ineffective at quelling the rioting, with allegations spreading of local Gardaí siding with rioters from their own communities, and by the end of the day several people were dead and many homes destroyed.\n\n"
irelandflavour.1009.d1.otherdem: "Worse yet, as news spread from Ulster, a series of incidents were reported of angered Blueshirts attacking and intimidating southern Protestants in retaliation, but Gardaí were quickly mobilised to restore order, and those threatened also received aid from the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army, opposing sectarianism and never missing a chance to brawl with their \"legionnaire\" enemies. With all eyes now focused north, the government has found itself in an even more tricky position as public pressure for reform has become all the more intense."
irelandflavour.1009.d2: "On the 12th of July in the year 1690, the Catholic King James II of England was defeated by William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne. For Irish Catholics, James' defeat brought about their subjugation under the harsh Penal Laws, but for Ulster Protestants, the victorious William was a saviour who had delivered them from the spectre of Catholic domination, and solidified their legitimacy to settle in Ireland, having arrived from Britain only a few decades prior.\n\nThe date became a key loyalist commemoration, celebrated with marches by the fraternal Orange Order and with bonfires the night before. While the build up to the Twelfth had always been a tense affair, it was particularly true for this year, as the Blueshirt coup was greeted with much alarm by Ulster loyalists. These tensions erupted in Belfast today as not only did loyalists set off multiple bombs, but several parades devolved into riots as they were blocked by Blueshirts upon attempting to march through Catholic areas. Though the riots were put down with an iron fist, the brutality used only served to alienate Ulster Protestants against the government.\n\nDue to this growing resistance not only from loyalists but also in the south, from the syndicalist Irish Citizen Army and pro-democratic elements, O'Duffy and Ó Cuinneagáin have met with the cabinet to discuss how to approach the situation. From the former general's perspective, the issue is domestic, the result of a lack of discipline among the Irish people and demanding the expansion of the Gardai to maintain order, with Protestants to be kept under close watch given their believed inherent disloyalty.\n\nFor Ó Cuinneagáin, the source of the regime's troubles lies abroad with the sinister force of \"Anglo-Syndicalism\" plotting to subvert the Irish nation, and to combat the Red threat a secret police must be established and granted extensive powers to root out via any means, including torture, those traitors willing to take the Saxon shilling. However, such an organisation would be quickly staffed with Blueshirts seeking a more legitimate form of career than their National Guard membership, expanding the legionnaires' internal influence."

irelandflavour.1010.t: "By Another Metric"
irelandflavour.1010.d: "As the breaking of the post-independence era's lull continues to spur on a desire for change, an additional motion has been proposed with the objective of bringing Ireland more in line with the continent, this time around involving units of measurement. As another consequence of having been formerly under the rule of the British Empire, the Irish Republic currently uses British imperial units for its system of measurement. In contrast, many nations in continental Europe, most notably Germany, use the metric system. Though calls for metrication have existed since Ireland achieved its freedom, support for reform in this area has begun to gather further steam, in keeping with other recent initiatives to follow European trends.\n\nIn the eyes of cosmopolitans, this would serve to further modernise the nation, and from a nationalist viewpoint it would represent a further rejection of British influence. However, opponents of this latest proposition have pointed to the deep roots imperial measurements have within the minds of the Irish people, being extensively used in everyday activities for much of the public such as pubs, horse racing and on roads among other things, and the difficulty of updating the country to the metric system, a process which could take numerous years. In the feelings of the proposal's opposition, the imperial system, although contrasting the mainland, isn't broken and therefore is in no need of fixing."

irelandflavour.1011.t: "Radio Free Scotland"
irelandflavour.1011.d: "One of the largest technological developments of note in recent years has been the growth of radio. Although radio broadcasts have existed in Ireland since the mid-1920s, the initial range of the channels were limited and required relay stations to carry their signal from Dublin to Cork. However, the technology has developed rapidly, and new, more powerful transmitters have emerged that can carry a signal over vast distances.\n\nSpurred on by the success of long-range radio stations in the low countries, a group of exiled Scottish activists in Belfast have been raising funds for their own station: \"Radio Free Scotland\". Planning to purchase a transmitter with a range of roughly over 150 miles, the station would be able to reach both Glasgow and Edinburgh as well as Liverpool in England. The group's stated aim is simple: To provide an alternative source of news and Scottish culture from the tightly controlled media in the Union of Britain.\n\nAlthough British radio already \"leaks\" into Ireland, this new station which is plainly planning to be subversive, may well be seen as a provocation by the British."
irelandflavour.1011.a: "It's free enterprise in a free country."
irelandflavour.1011.b: "An inspired idea. Perhaps some small contribution could be made to this venture..."
irelandflavour.1011.c: "We can't let them pick a fight we'll be\ndragged into."

irelandflavour.1012.t: "Radio Free Scotland"
irelandflavour.1012.d: "It has come to the government's attention that radio receivers in Scotland, the North-west of England and the Isle of Man are picking up a signal from Belfast broadcasting as \"Radio Free Scotland\". While the station's musical content is of little concern, being mostly traditional Scottish songs, its selection of news and political discussion is decidedly biased against the British government.\n\nSeemingly being manned by Scottish nationalists who've departed to Ireland, much of their content is thinly-veiled, anti-socialist propaganda.  Whether the Irish Government has tacitly supported this venture, or simply turned a blind eye, is unknown, but nevertheless, the fact remains this station is operating right under their noses."
irelandflavour.1012.a: "A provocation? Of course, but we won't be baited by it"
irelandflavour.1012.b: "The internal affairs of the Union shall not be interfered with. Issue an official denouncement."

irelandflavour.1013.t: "The British Denounce RFS"
irelandflavour.1013.d: "A spokesperson for the Union of Britain released an official statement today condemning the Irish Government for \"indulging political agitators\", by tolerating the operation of \"Radio Free Scotland\" in Belfast.\n\nDecrying the station as nothing more than a vehicle to rile up Scottish citizens with misinformation about the delivery of socialism, the statement went on to claim a \"responsible government\" would not allow such a station to operate without oversight.\n\nThe statement has already caused most of the press in Ireland to rally around the station, who seem to be relishing their notoriety."
irelandflavour.1013.a: "We won't; there's no need to go tit-for-tat with the British."
irelandflavour.1013.b: "This was a mistake, do what it takes to down the station."
irelandflavour.1013.c: "We won't be bullied on this — respond with a statement of our own!"

irelandflavour.1014.t: "The Irish Shut Down RFS"
irelandflavour.1014.d: "News has come to Britain today from Ireland that \"Radio Free Scotland\" has been quietly dismantled.\n\nNew laws were introduced to regulate radio stations on the island and subsequently, Radio Free Scotland was denied a license to operate. It seems once the displeasure of the British government was made known, they scrambled to defuse the situation."
irelandflavour.1014.a: "The correct response."

irelandflavour.1015.t: "The Irish Support RFS"
irelandflavour.1015.d: "It seems the Irish are not content simply to host agitators, they must defend them too!\n\nToday the Irish \"Minister for Posts and Telegraphs\" fired back at the Union, claiming that British radio services have been \"intruding\" into Ireland for years without complaint, before launching into platitudes about freedom of speech. Such an equivocation between propaganda and serious journalism is shameful and reveals a stunning (or perhaps willful) lack of critical analysis. We can see plainly now what the attitude in Dublin is to the British."

ire_monarch.1.t:0 "On the Fate of the Irish Republic"
ire_monarch.1.d:0 "President de Valera has long stood for Irish independence, conservatism, nationalism, and unity, but has internally struggled over one detail: the debate of republicanism versus monarchism. Usually a proponent of Republican Democracy, de Valera has been known to support the ideas of Parliamentary Monarchism based on a modernized form of the former High Kingship that would serve as a unifying force over a democratic government with most of the power. With de Valera and Fianna Fáil firmly in control of Ireland now by democratic mandate, he must decide if Fianna Fáil is to guide Ireland towards Conservative Republicanism or Conservative Constitutional Monarchism."
ire_monarch.1.a:0 "The Republic has stood for long enough. Prepare for the Monarchist restoration!"
ire_monarch.1.b:0 "An Irish Monarchy? how insane...We stand with Republicanism."

ire_monarch.2.t:0 "A Candidate for the Throne"
ire_monarch.2.d:0 "Now that the debate over monarchism has ended, it has come time to decide where that Monarch will come from. Though a majority of the voices in the government under Fianna Fáil have called for an Irish monarch for an Irish kingdom, some dissenters - inspired by Patrick Pearse's legacy - have offered an alternative, warning that Ireland may not be able to stand against the Syndicalist powers of Britain and France, let alone against the Plotting Monarch in Canada across the sea, without foreign protection. To this end, Fianna Fáil has selected Prince Joachim of Prussia, the sixth son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, as a possible candidate for the throne. Joachim does not speak English, and some hope that his complete lack of ties to the Anglos will allow us to influence his government towards the de-anglicisation of Ireland, and perhaps the entire Isles. This fusion of Irish monarchy with Prussian Constitutionalism would allow for Ireland to seek protection under the Kaiser's watchful eye. Though this would, naturally, require us to reject a Native candidate, which is the most popular alternative. Some have voiced their fears that picking Joachim would be selling Ireland to the Germans, and that German occupation will be no better than the English; of course this is but fear-mongering, and appropriate balances will be placed on the monarchy, assuring that the King is merely a representative of Ireland on the world stage. Should we go with the plan of crowning a German monarch, or is a native High King what Ireland truly needs to maintain its hard-fought freedom?"
ire_monarch.2.a:0 "Pearse was right, we need German protection, choose Prince Joachim."
ire_monarch.2.b:0 "We don't need a Kraut on the throne, choose an Irish Candidate."

ire_monarch.3.t:0 "An Irish King"
ire_monarch.3.d:0 "Now that we have chosen to choose a native Irish High King, we must now pick a specific monarch. Many of the Great Clans still have surviving bloodlines among the non-Anglo nobility, and so we must choose one of these fine souls to lead us as the new High King of Ireland. De Valera himself personally prefers the father of an old friend, Leopoldo O'Donnell y Vargas, who hails from the Clan O'Donnell and was born in Spain and has since fallen in with the Carlist movement. His appointment would likely tie us to the foreign affairs of the Spanish, but would grant us a strong Catholic ally. Opposing him, loudly by his supporters, is Hugo José Jorge O'Neill, of the Clan O'Neil. Born and raised in Portugal, this Irish-Portuguese noble has strong ties to Lisbon's Estado Novo and Catholic Luso-Integralist movements, being the main pusher of Integralist ideology in Ireland and introducing de Valera and the rest of Ireland's monarchists to the concept. \n\nWidely seen as the most legitimate candidate, Donough O'Brien stands between these two bickering foreign nationals, who some profess only carry half-Irish blood. O'Brien of Clan O'Brien is the direct descendant of Brian Boru, greatest of the old High Kings that topped the O'Neill dynasty, ended the Viking invasion of Ireland, and established his dynasty own that would last for over five centuries, cementing himself as one of the greatest Irish leaders in history. As his sire, Donough O'Brien is beloved by Irish Nationalists across the Emerald Isle. The dark horse candidate of the race is William Francis Brinsley Le Poer Trench, 8th Earl of Clancarty, 7th Marquess of Heusdem. A member of the Dutch nobility, and of the Clan MacCarty, he has every right to be king, but he has little interest in ruling. Instead, Trench adores the occult and the strange, having a passion for UFOlogy and other esoteric pseudosciences. \n\nLast among the varied candidates, is the Eighth Earl of Antrim, Randal McDonnell. A native of Ulster, McDonnell is descended of Sorley Boy MacDonnell, who won for his family the right to remain in Ireland, much to the displeasure of the English. During the Jacobite Wars, the McDonnells fought bravely for the Staurts, as did their sire clan in Scotland, Clan Donald, although the loss of the war greatly dimensioned the influence of the McDonnells of Antrim. Along with this storied history, the royal blood of the Stuarts flows through McDonnell's veins. Descended of James VI and I through his daughter Elizabeth Stuart, McDonnell is thus a claimant to the thrones of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, however distant. Ireland has a long tradition of electing its king from among the Great Clans, so let this election begin!"

ire_monarch.4.d:0 "An issue has arisen with Joachim of Prussia that no one had taken into account. As the Ruling king of Georgia, some have warned that it would be far too much of a strain on the Man to name him king of both; considering the extreme distance between Ireland and Georgia, it would be unreasonable to expect him to be able to effectively occupy the crowns of both separate countries at once. To this end the Government has instead suggested offering the crown to Oskar of Prussia, the older brother of Joachim, who would be less burdened by the crown than his younger brother. Of course, we don't have to reject Joachim simply because he is already king; it's not as if he will be actively required for day-to-day ruling regardless. However, there is a third option, forming a personal union between the two kingdoms of Georgia and Ireland; though the two crowns have little in common; this merger would allow Joachim to rule both countries from whichever country he resides in, and would further integrate Ireland into the crowns of Europe."

Here, at this hallowed and ancient site used by generations upon generations of our ancestors, the new High King [root.getleader] has been crowned in a ceremony fusing modern Irish Catholicism with Gaelic and Druidic motifs, creating a syncretic fusion of Ireland's unique culture to be protected and spread by this new Ard-Rí.

With both Ireland and Wales naming the 5th son of Kaiser Wilhelm II as their monarch, though the Irish initially passed over Oskar's brother Joachim for the throne as he already had his own crown; it has come to both the Irish and Welsh legislatures attention that King Oskar of Wales and Ireland has expressed a desire to merge his two kingdoms into one, allowing for more effective rulership. In this situation both Welsh and Irish legislatures would remain separate, but would be unified as one kingdom under Oskar. This would no doubt please some of the few Pan-Celtic voices left within the government of both nations, and would naturally allow for a more prosperous state than if both kingdoms operated independently. Though of course some within both states are concerned that the king will favor one kingdom over the other, and would feel more comfortable if the kingdoms remained firmly separate, though maintaining friendly relations."

Once plotting to overthrow the government of the Republic in order to create a monarchist system that would guarantee Irish independence, the group at one point has suggested numerous different kings, such as Joachim Hohenzollern and Juan O'Donnell, but eventually landed upon the heir of the O'Neill dynasty. However, with the rise of de Valera's monarchist movement, the IMS has largely lost their purpose and way, with the group splintering and dissolving over many different ideas. This large coalition of likely allies could easily bolster our movement, but their links to Far-Right ideology and radicalism may harm our movement's public appearance. How should we handle them?"

Formed in 1905 by Griffith and other Leftist Revolutionaries, Sinn Féin originally sought to create a monarchist-republican fusion inspired by the politics and organization of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Seeking to create an Anglo-Irish dual monarchy that would put Ireland on equal footing with the English, Sinn Féin pursued this idea as the best conceivable path to Irish Home Rule at the time. Naturally this plan later fell apart, with the plan only being accepted by the Irish masses so long as Sinn Féin promised to never crown a Windsor monarch, but even with these promises, the movement would die out, and Sinn Féin itself would be split over the growing Republican faction and the dwindling monarchists in the coming years, further weakening their position as de Valera and Collins made their rises. However, with our democratic victory under this new Crown, we have fulfilled the wishes of Griffith and early Sinn Féin all without bending to the English pigs.

Related to the once powerful Clan MacDonald of Scotland, McDonnell, via his paternal ancestry is descended from Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I and VI, thus placing him within the line of succession to the Stuart line, however remote and distant. With His Highness being within the Jacobite line of succession, it was almost inevitable that people would begin comparing his rule to that of the Stuarts. While preferring to maintain a much lighter hand than his forefathers, his rule is not without similarity. Indeed, McDonnell is outspoken in his support of democracy,   The King has begun actively promoting Catholicism within the state, and has actually begun quietly punishing those families and Clans whom supported the Williamites all those years ago, by quietly sizing wealth or estates, and refusing to recognize their titles in the new Irish Peerage system. Due to these actions, or perhaps due to just the restoration of some kind of Monarchy on the British Isles, various Jacobites from Scotland and around the globe have arrived in Ireland, and have begun championing the King has the rightful heir of James II, the rightful King of England, Scotland and Wales. While these voices have so far remained outside the government, their influence can already be felt on some of the weaker willed members of the King's court, members who are filled with dreams of Restoration and the reclamation of old glories."

Indeed, Randal I is a strict Constitutionalist, viewing the people's right to vote as near scared as his own position. This being the case, the King has brushed these calls aside, calling on his Taoiseach to do all they can do to protect democracy. Despite this, there are still questions regarding the Constitution, although of a much more esoteric nature. Their have been several proposals, both within and without the government, to rebrand the nation as the rightful and legal continuity of the United Kingdom. While such an idea is nigh amount to treason for the average Irishman, there is an element of rationality to the idea. Due to his status as a weak Jacobite claimant, the King does indeed poses a claim to these thrones. With Great Britain falling to Syndicalism and the fleeing of the royal family, from a legal standpoint, the United Kingdom has ceased to exist, despite the claims of the Canadian Exiles. With the Kingdom of Ireland being an integral part of the old United Kingdom, and with the Kingdom of Ireland now restored, it is not that far of stretch to claim legal continuity. To actually claim the mantle of the United Kingdom, Ireland would forever cut itself from the Entente, and would have any enemy for life. While an obviously insane idea, due to the arrival of Jacobite exiles, and the voice of Jacobitism creeping into the government, the King has been presented with a plan to modify the Constitution to declare Ireland as the heir to the United Kingdom, and thus the rightful government of the entire British Isles.   While he is expected to reject it, the siren call of Jacobitism may have just reached the ears of the King."

Dismissing the Exiles in Canada as pretenders, Ireland has claimed to the British Isles, in a widely condemned move.

ire_monarch.16.d:0 "Built in the 13th century, Dunluce Castle served as the seat of the Earls of Antrim, until the impoverishment of the McDonnells as a result of the Battle of the Boyne. For centuries, the castle has laid in ruins, only being visited by curious tourists or being scavenged for resources. Along with this, the Town of Dunluce, once viewed as one of the most modern towns in Europe was razed to the ground, further contributing to the decline of the castle. With a McDonnell on the Irish throne however, the time has come for this to change. Under Royal patronage, various construction companies have been hired to restore Dunluce to it's former glory. While estimates range from a few years to a decade, His Majesty is adamant that the castle must be restored.  Despite it being his by right, His Majesty has also indicated that once finished, the Castle shall serve as something of a museum. Dedicated to the history of Ireland and the Irish struggle for Freedom, the King has begun a drive to collect various historical artifacts to be displayed in the restored castle. Regardless, Dunluce Castle, after almost four hundred years, shall once again stand proud and defiant atop the coasts of Antrim."

While the English and their 'Army of Free England' fight our just rule, they cannot stop us. England is done, and never more shall she threaten the world. With this being the case, and the rightful government of the United Kingdom reclaiming it's land, the time has come to properly crown the rightful King of England. Westminster shall be prepared, and the King crowned as King of Scotland, Wales and England. The English people shall learn what it is like to have a foreign King, as they forced us to have. While the actually crowning is still a few months out, in preparation, the King has pressed Parliament to revoked the Acts of Supremacy, and restore the Catholic Church to prominence in England. Regardless of this, one final question regarding the fate of the British Isles has arisen. While the Irishifcation of England is a done deal, the question of just exactly where our capital shall lie has come up. While most expect the capital of the United Kingdom to remain in Dublin, where it has been, their have been calls for the capital to return to London. While obviously not a popular idea, London has long been the capital of Britain, and what better way to spite in the face of the English than by having an Irish King sit in their once proud capital? Regardless, the King is expected to clarify this issue of capital, especially with the coronation just on the horizon."

ire_monarch.19.d:0 "While President de Valera and his allies in the Oireachtas have begun the process of restoring the Irish monarchy, going as far as to declare a so-called 'Irish Regency,' it seems not all within the nation approve of the plan. Indeed, members of the Dáil who had previously belonged to the Sinn Féin loyal to the Anti-Treaty IRA but whom ran for election following the Belfast Agreement, along with many members of the former Army Council have issued a joint statement condemning the move. In the statement, the protesters called da Valera a tyrant, accused him of inviting the British back, and said they would fight the restoration, to death if need be, to keep Ireland free. Due to these protests, many of de Valera's allies, and allegedly the President himself, are beginning to question the restoration. Due to this, many are wondering if the entire restoration project should simply be abandoned, and the republic maintained. Alternatively, some have pressed for the President to address these men head on. After all, was it not the vision of Pearse for Ireland to be a Gaelic monarchy? Besides, Ireland shall maintain it's democratic system, simply under the eye of the King. Of course, these men could also simply be ignored. They are only a minority in the Oireachtas, and the restoration is supported by the major party. Either way, it is only for de Valera to decide."

ire_monarch.20.d:0 "Following President de Valera blowing of the concerns and protests of Republican sections of the Oireachtas and the old Army Council, it appears that their threats of violence to fight monarchism were not idle. In a similar joint statement as before, the Army Council has reversed it's own dissolution and reformed, along with about a third of the sitting members of the Dáil walking out in protest. Unlike the IRA which formed as the result of a split due to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, this new IRA makes no claim to legitimacy. Indeed, in their founding manifesto the IRA makes it very clear that the Irish Republic has been restored, but the actions of President de Valera in attempting to restore the monarchy has crossed a line. To preserve Irish freedom and democracy, they must take up arms once again, and they shall not lay them down until de Valera and his false King are thrown down.\n\nGiven the perceived popular support of the reformed IRA, many within the government fear that unlike the fringe group that Collins dealt with, de Valera may need to employ unprecedented measures to truly suppress these terrorists. If we don't, the group warns, there is a very likely chance that the IRA could successfully overthrow our government. While the group is quite sure of themselves, the President doesn't seem so sure. After all, they are at most 2000  men, and a majority already serve the army itself. Why risk the unpopularity, and cost, for what amounts to a simple peasant revolt?"

ire_monarch.21.t:0 "Triumph of the Irish Republican Army"
ire_monarch.21.d:0 "In what history will come to know as one of the most miscalculated moments in Irish politics, President de Valera along with much of the Oireachtas have been detained in a bloodless coup by the IRA. Arriving in Dublin in the dead of night just as de Valera was finishing a speech on the glories of Monarchy to a joint session of the Dáil and Seanad, the IRA were able to secure themselves around the entire city. As they began to dig in, a section of the Republican Army surrounded Leinster House and successfully arrested de Valera and many members of both houses. With the true Republic of Ireland now free from being trampled once again, the question has arisen, what now? nWhile in the days prior to the Belfast Agreement, the IRA had the goal of restoring the Republic of 16, that goal has been reached. Now, with de Valera removed from power, the IRA lays at a cross roads as they never have before. In power over the entire nation, the Army Council has the power to change Ireland in their own image, and thus have called an emergency meeting.\n\nIt is quickly becoming clear that among the small Council, that 4 positions hold any real chance of being acted upon. The first option and seen by many as the most logical is to appoint Sinn Féin, under Cathal Brugha, to power. Sinn Féin has long been closely tied to the IRA, and most IRA members belong to the party, so appointing them would in many ways be a logical conclusion. Alternatively, Peadar O'Donnell and Saor Éire, a socialistic nationalist party created by IRA members has also been floated. Well far from the popularity of Sinn Féin, many members of Saor Éire got their start in the IRA, and they have been a useful ally in the fight against the Free State. Also floated on the taple as been to simply rule by ourselves. Ireland has been freed by the IRA countless times, and if de Valera proves anything, it is that the Irish people are not ready for full democracy. Based on the KMT founded by Dr. Sun, this position would have the Army Council lead Ireland, until the people were ready for Republicanism. Along with this, it would have us reforge Sinn Féin into the Cumann na Poblachta, to act as party for the entire people. Finally, and seen by many as the least likely, is to simply reappoint de Valera as President. While indeed radical and de Valera being the reason the IRA was forced to reform, there is a logic to it. De Valera is the first all-Ireland elected President in the history of the Republic, and while yes he did attempt to restore a Monarchy, he is still the rightful President, and thus should be allowed to at least finish his term, if the people do not wish for him to remain. Should he not be appointed, it has been universally decided that de Valera's fate shall be exile, a fate deserving of such a traitor.\n\nWith the debate within the meeting closing up, votes have been cast within the ranks of the Army Council. As the votes are talled, it is clear that the Council has voted to..."

Interestingly enough, the President did not state who would be taking the Irish throne.

To bring clarity to our new found identity, His Majesty, James III, has called an emergency meeting of the cabinet to solve this burgeoning issue. By and large, most simply want us to remain a Celtic state on the British Isles, to bring the superior culture of Celts over the perfidious Saxons. Others, wishing for a more peaceful co-existence, wish for the new Celtic State to act as a Union for the Celts and Saxons that call this land home, united under His Majesty the King. A select few push for us to fully embrace Pan-Celtism, and work towards the total unification of all Celtic peoples alive today. A smaller section of this group wishes for us to push further then simply Pan-Celtism, and to embrace our King's claims to the French throne. Just as James III has a claim to the thrones of Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales, he also has a claim to the thrones of France, as did his ancestors. They justify in their Pan-Celticism views as a reclamation of the lands of Gaul. An even smaller subset, mostly made up of those that embraced the call of Jacobitism in the first place, wish for us to quietly roll back Pan-Celtism, and reembrace our identity as the true government of the United Kingdom. A very small section of this already tiny group wish for us to go a step further, dismissing Pan-Celtism but pushing James' claims to France, reforming the Angevin Empire.

O’Brien’s mad ravings, raucous protests, and ability to charismatically baffle and persuade has begun to work to their benefit as the IMS cries out for ‘God’s truth’ to be served here in Ireland under the Crown over the fickle whims of the masses. O’Brien and his boisterous allies and fellow Integralist firebrands call out for the King himself to overturn the validity of the recent democratic elections in order to ‘safeguard’ the nation from ideologies they deem corrosive and unjust, instead urging the Ard-Rí to fully embrace his absolute divine right as the High King of Ireland with the support of Valera’s reborn Fianna Fáil fueled by O’Brien’s Irish Integralist philosophy.

Seeking to crown their own candidate as the new Ardrí na hÉireann, seeing the current king as an illegitimate and weak traitor to a traditional Éire, this broad coalition of conservative and reactionary fringe groups united under O’Brien’s Integralism and the Crown of Ireland have one shot at achieving their goal, and now the nation waits on baited breath to see which faction comes out on top."

According to the documents, Raymond is related to the noble peerage O’Brien family of Thumond that began with Murrough O’Brien as a splinter house of the original House of O’Brien as made famous by Ireland’s most famous and greatest high king ever, Brian Boru. How exactly he is related to this prestigious line is not exactly clear however, with the known members of the Earldom of Thumond being deceased and with the major members of wider O’Brien clan having no knowledge of Raymond nor any evidence in their extensive records that substantiates his claim, yet with the Mexican judicial system supporting his claim as the real Earl of Thurmond after a brief stay there a few years ago. Nonetheless, O'Brien has declared that most of the crowned heads and republics throughout the world have recognized his claims, despite none of them offering their official support, and despite some of the nations O'Brien having named no longer existing. Regardless of these minor setbacks, Raymond and the government are adamant that he is truly of royal stock. Dodging any questions or doubts about this debate, the High King even ran from reporters recently in order to avoid their questions on his lineage, showing supposedly fake documents that state Raymond is just a poor beggar gone mental and playing pretend. Whatever the truth, there is no changing the reality that this man, whoever he is and regardless of who he is actually related to, is the High King of Ireland now and the herald of our new Integralist reality."

Though both contain aspects of National Syndicalism, decentralized authoritarianism, Christian dominance and Catholic Social Teachings, Nationalism, Traditionalism without Conservatism, class cooperation, Corporatist economics, and more, they differ in certain minutiae that would largely dictate if we would draw closer to Lisbon or Algiers in the coming years.

Many among the IRA’s newblood recruits have more sympathies with these firebrands than they do with the SF old guard that has supported the IRA for decades, opening up a possible avenue towards new allies and a refreshingly revolutionary take on our Socialist junta’s ideology, if we are willing to throw away our old allies and our thin veneer of fair democratic process.

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MICHAEL_COLLINS_DESC:0 "Michael Collins is the saviour and national hero of Ireland, with wide scale popularity keeping him in power. Born in Cork, Collins fought in the 1916 Easter Rising and afterwards became the president of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. During the war he organised the IRA into an effective guerrilla force, seeking to avoid the mistakes of 1916. In 1921 he was sent to negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Although by threatening to continue the war with German backing he was able to acquire all thirty-two counties in the treaty, he was unable to secure a republic, with the British fearing that an independent Irish republic would immediately become a German base. When he was expelled from Sinn Féin by Éamon de Valera he managed to form his own party, Fine Gael, which quickly overtook Sinn Féin in popularity. After the British Revolution he declared an independent Republic of Ireland and defeated a Unionist uprising in Ulster. Now with the Second Weltkrieg approaching Collins advocates revitalising Ireland's economy and military in order to assert Ireland's independence."
POLITICS_CATHAL_BRUGHA_DESC:0 "Born Charles William St. John Burgess of mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage, and later changing his name after joining the Gaelic League, Cathal Brugha is a war hero from the Easter Rising and leader of the rump Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He, already being a staunch rival of Collins during the War of Independence, became leader of the democratic opposition, a coalition of democratic parties opposing Collins, although he has increasingly become a figurehead to rally around in his old age as a new generation rises in the Republican movement. He and his party, bolstered in strength by many ex-Labourites following the 1923 ban after Larkin's failed uprising, advocate a social democratic Ireland as per the Democratic Programme of 1919, and a pro-German alignment to oppose Ireland's enemies in Britain and Canada."
POLITICS_FRANK_MACDERMOT_DESC:0 "Frank MacDermot is the youngest son of Hugh O'Rorke MacDermot, the Prince of Coolavin. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps during the Weltkrieg. Afterwards, he emigrated to America only to return to Ireland after the American economic collapse, and joined the anglophile National Centre Party, eventually becoming its leader due to his great oratory skills. A persistent critic of both the Collins' government and the democratic opposition's sympathies towards isolationism or Germanophilia, he is a strong advocate of a pro-Entente policy and rapprochement with the Unionist community."
POLITICS_JIM_LARKIN_DESC:0 "James Larkin, born in England before moving with his family to Ireland grew up in poverty and became a trade union organiser and formed the Labour Party with James Connolly, most famously participating in the failed Dublin Lockout of 1913. After the failure of the lockout, he moved to America and became a member of the Socialist Party of America. Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists and took control of the Labour Party, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand and the Labour Party was banned, leading Larkin to go into hiding with the help of the Commune of France. The Irish Citizen Army suffered dear for their loyalty, with their role in the Easter Rising being erased from the official history and their founder James Connolly's role downplayed."
POLITICS_GEAROID_O_CUINNEAGAIN_DESC:0 "Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin is a radical Irish language scholar, born in Belfast to a middle-class Catholic family, he joined the Army Comrades Association and managed to work his way up to Minister for Justice of Ireland as a result of his charisma, leadership and radical ideas which attracted the interest of ACA leader Eoin O'Duffy. As Minister for Justice, he passed laws repressing syndicalism as well as anti-traveler settlement laws against the Pavee community, as well as using his influence to encourage the Irish language. He also maintained links with the Romanian Iron Guard, expressing sympathy for establishing a similar regime in Ireland. To this end, he formed his own party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe that would revive the Irish language, ban the English language after a period of five years, and establish strong anti-syndicalist and anti-Semitic policies."
POLITICS_PADRAIC_O_MAILLE_DESC:0 "Pádraic Ó Máille was one of the founding members of Sinn Féin and a member of the Irish volunteers, and leader of the radically Catholic and anti-syndicalist Irish Christian Front, supporting Catholic corporatism and an alliance with the Spanish Carlists. As a result of his anti-syndicalist views, he almost fell victim to an assassination attempt by the ICA in 1932, but managed to survive despite being badly wounded."
POLITICS_SEAN_LEMASS_DESC:0 "Seán Lemass was a volunteer during the Easter Rising and War of Independence and rose to become the head of the CPNH party, another breakaway party following the decline of Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish treaty. Lemass is an advocate for industrialisation and while he is a believer in capitalism, he also believes that normalising relations with the Union of Britain could have a beneficial effect on Irish trade and the economy. He is in favour of a flexible Irish foreign policy depending on the nation's needs, contrasting the CPNH from the other democratic parties who have their own biases in regards to Irish foreign policy."
POLITICS_DE_VALERA_DESC:0 "Eamon de Valera, born in New York to a Spanish father and Irish mother and taken to Ireland at the age of two, was a commander in the Easter Rising and a political leader during the War of Independence, however ending up slipping into political irrelevancy due to some poor political moves and misfortune following the Anglo-Irish treaty, having expelled Michael Collins from the Sinn Féin party despite Collins' incredible popularity, and then left SF himself later due to the influx of ex-Labourites into the party after the 1923 ban of the Labour Party as well as disputes with nationalists preferring a pro-German alignment which were in contrast with de Valera's belief in isolationism and neutrality. His breakaway party, Fianna Fáil, ultimately failed to be a success, becoming a minor party in the democratic opposition..."

ire.59.d:0 "We have left our rural areas in a state of backwards insignificance for far too long. It is time that we do something. Ireland is moving forward, and so too must her rural communities. Much of our industry has traditionally relied upon agriculture, but times have changed. If we want to keep agriculture as a vital part of our economy, then we need to upgrade our farming facilities. Similarly, much of Ireland's road systems are in a state of complete disrepair, and currently the responsibility for repair work of any kind falls to private enterprise. Our transport network in general could be considerably improved, allowing us to move both people and economic goods around the country at a more rapid rate. This situation calls for obvious economic expenditure, but we must keep the national debt in mind. More radical changes will encourage the population that we are serious about dealing with the issue, however."

IRE_RTN:0 "Revitalise the North"
IRE_RTN_desc:0 "After the 1925 ceasefire, the northern most region of Ulster has been in an industrial slump relative to the rest of the nation. Belfast once used to be a thriving industrial city and other towns and cities such as Derry and Coleraine were looking likely to follow. Revisiting this issue and energising the north with industrial investments will help to lift the region."
ire.67.t:0 "The Harland & Wolff Shipyard"
ire.67.d:0 "During the early 1900s, the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast had the prestigious honour of being the world's largest shipyard. After the capitulation of the British Empire during the first Weltkrieg and their second capitulation not long after to the Trade Unionists, it has fallen into disrepair and has been overtaken by other yards throughout the world. With refurbishment, it could once again be a great asset, but this time for Ireland, not the British Imperialists."
ire.67.a:0 "With some repairs and a recruiting effort, the shipyard will create a good few jobs."

ire.68.t:0 "The Short Brothers Company"
ire.68.d:0 "Founded in England in 1908, the Short Brothers PLC is a private aerospace company with some existing operations in Ulster. Having seen their business suffer significant losses thanks to the fate of the British Empire, they are now looking for new opportunities and see expansion in Ulster as their highest priority. We can subsidise their venture at some cost to our nation, but the benefits of having a prominent aerospace industry are obvious in peace and wartime."
ire.68.a:0 "Help them settle."
ire.68.b:0 "Make a significant investment."

IRE_SHORTBROS_desc:0 "Founded in 1908, the Short Brothers private limited company was the world's first private aircraft manufacturer.

ire.92.t:0 "A Small Step for Ireland..."
ire.92.d:0 "The Éireann Scientific Innovation Council (ESIC) is a newly created sub-department of the government, with one simple purpose in mind: a devotion to academia and scientific progress. Ireland has long been seen as a rural backwater by other world powers, a place that progress seemed to leave behind. Whilst a cruel opinion, it is not without truth. Centuries of British rule left Ireland largely neglected whilst the rest of the world raced on. It's time to catch up. The ESIC will be composed of expert scientists recruited from both the Irish population and from friendly foreign allies. ESIC research teams will increase our overall research efficiency and may even occasionally produce major breakthroughs in certain fields. The government must now decide how important the ESIC is to the nation: how much funds should they receive?"
ire.92.a:0 "Science is important, but it's not the only priority. A low amount of funding."
ire.92.b:0 "We will give them a prudent amount for such a key issue."
ire.92.c:0 "Ireland must leap from the past so that she can walk in the future. Massively fund the project."
ire.93.t:0 "Advances in Research Efficiency"
ire.93.d:0 "Thanks to steady funding by the Irish government, the ESIC has gradually been expanding over time and has grown in experience and efficiency, allowing them to tackle multiple research projects simultaneously. Ireland's scientific development is rapidly improving alongside the ESIC's own progress, and the investment is obviously paying off."
ire.93.a:0 "The news we've all been waiting for."

IRE_IRF:0 "Industrial Research Priorities"
IRE_IRF_desc:0 "Our national has a vital need for industry, and that need is coupled with an equal requirement for research and development. Many of our factories are decrepit and out of date. To build a modern industry, Ireland needs modern factories. Investing into industrial research will allow us to move further towards progress."
IRE_ISP:0 "Irish Synthetics Project"
IRE_ISP_desc:0 "Although our people are industrious and our island ripe for industrialisation, there is no accounting for the unfortunate lack of natural resources available to us relative to the major powers of the world. Oil and rubber are particularly problematic, so if we would like to make use of these resources in our industries, Ireland must develop a functional synthetics programme."
IRE_XPESIC:0 "Expand the ESIC"
IRE_XPESIC_desc:0 "The ESIC have been doing a fantastic job to date, but they still have room to grow. Further investment will facilitate their involvement in a greater number of research projects, enabling our teams to cover more ground and deal with more fields. This will improve our overall flexibility in the field of science."

IRE_EIE_desc:0 "The Irish population are eager and willing to work, but our nation is a small one. The state of our economy to date has been rather unimpressive and uninviting, but with the recent developments spurred on by the IEAA, perhaps we can begin improving this situation. Irish business would grow more quickly if we encouraged immigration from other less developed nations."

ire.96.t:0 "The Dáil Decides: Immigration"
ire.96.d:0 "As part of their new IEAA initiative, the Dáil have argued for the expansion of Ireland's immigration policies. Under British rule, immigration to Ireland was almost non-existent and actively discouraged. Now that Ireland is free and her economy is growing at a rapid rate, there is an opportunity to start actively encouraging immigration. This process could prove extremely costly however, as significant funds will have to be invested in housing developments and administrative processes. There may also be social unrest with a large influx of immigrants arriving on Irish shores. Our choice of policy going forward will be very important for our nation, and it's important to consider the potential consequences."
ire.96.a:0 "Relax our policies. A few more people can't hurt."

IRE_FINAL_STRUGGLE_desc:0 "As Ireland openly declares hostility against Britain and prepares for war, the morale of the Irish people has been bolstered, readying themselves for the final battle of Irish freedom with the hope of at last avenging the many centuries of British tyranny over Ireland."
IRE_USA_trade:0 "Irish-American Trade"
IRE_USA_trade_desc:0 "While Irish-American relations were chilly at first as a result of differing alignments and American economic collapse, negotiations and trade between the two governments has begun and Irish-American relations are warming."
IRE_USA_tech:0 "Irish-American Research"
IRE_USA_tech_desc:0 "The support of the USA and many Irish-American intellectuals willing to aid the homeland of their ancestors has improved the technological development of Ireland."
IRE_USA_ATC:0 "Atlantic Trade Commission"
IRE_USA_ATC_desc:0 "In response to growing Irish-American relations, the two governments have agreed to form the Atlantic Trade Commission to oversee their trade, aiding the economies of both nations."
IRE_REFUGEES:0 "Irish-American Refugees"
IRE_REFUGEES_desc:0 "Ireland has accepted many Irish-American refugees fleeing the Second American Civil War. While they are welcomed by many and provide new workers and soldiers for the Irish nation, their influence may have long-running effects on Irish society."
IRE_REFUGEE_WORK:0 "Refugee Work Programs"
IRE_REFUGEE_WORK_desc:0 "In response to unemployment among the Irish-American refugees, the Irish government has decided to create work programs in order to employ the refugees and reduce social tensions."
IRE_REFUGEE_FIGHT:0 "Refugee Brigades"
IRE_REFUGEE_FIGHT_desc:0 "In response to unemployment among the Irish-American refugees, the Irish government has decided to organise military recruitment programs, reducing unemployment and social tensions while increasing the size of the army."
IRE_USA_PACT:0 "Irish-American Treaty"

# Focus Tree - Military

IRE_ARMYTREE:0 "Reforming the Armed Forces"
IRE_ARMYTREE_desc:0 "Since the end of the Northern Campaign, the Irish military has fallen into stagnation, and suffered from downsizing as the Union of Britain and Canada appeared less threatening. As international tensions are growing, the military must be revitalised."

# Military Industry
IRE_MILITARYINDUSTRY:0 "Military Industry"
IRE_MILITARYINDUSTRY_desc:0 "Whilst the people of Ireland would prefer peace to war, there is no doubt that war may very well be on the horizon. With an enemy across the Irish Sea and more still waiting in the wings, Ireland must build her military industry if she hopes to survive the coming storm."
IRE_HEAVYINDUSTRY:0 "Heavy Industrial Focus"
IRE_HEAVYINDUSTRY_desc:0 "Ireland is a small nation and can only spare so much space for a military arms complex. The military factories that we do build need to be built specialised for war, able to run efficient production lines and generate a high degree of output. We cannot waste our time with converting civilian factories into war-machines."
IRE_heavy_industry:0 "Irish Heavy Industry"
IRE_heavy_industry_desc:0 "We have decided to prioritise our military industry with a focus on costlier, but more efficient factories, specialised entirely for the production of armaments."
IRE_NORMALINDUSTRY:0 "Medium Industrial Focus"
IRE_NORMALINDUSTRY_desc:0 "To adapt to the ever-changing environment, it is vital that the Irish arms industry stays flexible. We might expect to be at war eventually, but that war will not last forever. We need to be able to adapt our industrial economy to war and peace in equal measure, and a medium industrial focus will do just that, with cheaper and more flexible military factories."
IRE_medium_industry:0 "Irish Medium Industry"
IRE_medium_industry_desc:0 "We have decided to approach our military industry with an adaptive approach, preferring to build several smaller military factories which can be converted to civilian factories, and vice versa."
IRE_HEAVYPRODUCTIONDRIVE:0 "Production Drive"
IRE_HEAVYPRODUCTIONDRIVE_desc:0 "Now that we've geared up our industry and specialised it for war, we can start capitalising on those gains by giving our workers a more specific training with regards to armaments production, allowing new lines to be produced more efficiently."
IRE_production_drive:0 "Heavy Production Drive"
IRE_production_drive_desc:0 "Faster, harder, and stronger: that's quickly becoming the ethos of the Irish military industry. We may not outnumber our enemies, but we will do our best to outproduce them."
IRE_DEFENSEPRODUCTION:0 "Industrial Defence Plan"
IRE_DEFENSEPRODUCTION_desc:0 "It's vital that our military industry not be crippled by enemy bombers during war-time. By constructing elaborate defence systems to protect our military factories, we will be able to minimise the damage done through enemy bombers."
IRE_defense_production:0 "Industrial Defence Plan"
IRE_defense_production_desc:0 "All of our military factories will be built partially underground and with reinforced roofing and exhausts in an effort to defend against enemy bombers."
IRE_HEAVYPRIORITIES:0 "Define the Industrial Strategy"
IRE_HEAVYPRIORITIES_desc:0 "Strategic decisions are made beyond the battlefield, too. Just as our generals must decide our army's priorities, so too must we decide upon our industrial strategy. A bi-annual committee will be set up to review our priorities and allow us to focus our production efforts on one major production line, increasing its output significantly."
ire.hp.tt:0 "Define a §Yproduction area§! to focus on at an §Oincreased cost§! in exchange for §Ghigher output.§!\n\n"
ire.128.t:0 "Industrial Strategy"
ire.128.d:0 "As part of our heavy military industry plans, we are able to prioritise a certain area of armaments production in order to meet and facilitate our overall strategic goals. We can greatly increase our output in any given area for a period of time, however this will cost a considerable amount of our income so it should be done wisely, if at all."
ire.128.a:0 "Focus on producing tanks."
ire.128.b:0 "Our lads need more guns."
ire.128.c:0 "We need more planes in the sky."
ire.128.e:0 "There's no need for a priority right now."
ire_armor_prio:0 "Armour Focus"
ire_armor_prio_desc:0 "We are producing a much greater number of tanks at an extensive consumer goods cost."
ire_infantry_prio:0 "Infantry Equipment Focus"
ire_infantry_prio_desc:0 "We are producing a much greater number of infantry equipment at an extensive consumer goods cost."
ire_airforce_prio:0 "Air Force Focus"
ire_airforce_prio_desc:0 "We are producing a much greater number of planes at an extensive consumer goods cost."

IRE_FLEXIBILITYBOOST:0 "Maintain Flexibility"
IRE_FLEXIBILITYBOOST_desc:0 "Our military factories are designed to be cheap, quick to build, and easily torn down and converted when needs be. The same ethos should apply to what we build on them. New lines need to get up and running immediately and being able to swap and start on the fly will be of great asset for this 'mobile' industrial strategy."
IRE_flexibility_boost:0 "Industrial Flexibility"
IRE_flexibility_boost_desc:0 "In the ever changing environment of war it's vital that we're able to quickly adapt and change our production lines when possible."
IRE_NAVALINDUSTRY:0 "Naval Industry Focus"
IRE_NAVALINDUSTRY_desc:0 "If Ireland is construct a fleet of any particular relevance then she will quickly need to start constructing new naval facilities. Investment into the naval industry of our nation will be a step in the right direction towards protecting the Irish Sea, and our nation itself, against foreign aggression."
IRE_SUBDOCKYARD:0 "Cork Submarine Foundry"
IRE_SUBDOCKYARD_desc:0 "Some of our naval theorists believe that submarines might very well be the naval weapons of the future. If we want to heed their advice, then we'd better start producing more of them. By developing a specialised submarine foundry and testing facility in Cork, we can focus our naval production on the development of these predator undersea ships."
ire_cork_foundry:0 "Cork Submarine Foundry"
ire_cork_foundry_desc:0 "The development of a submarine testing facility and production yard in Cork has allowed us to more efficiently produce submarines."
IRE_DESTROYERDOCKYARD:0 "Dublin Destroyer Shipyard"
IRE_DESTROYERDOCKYARD_desc:0 "Screens play a key role in any naval strategy. Ireland might not have much of a fleet to speak of at present, but our admirals know the basics. Whatever type of fleet we are likely to produce, screens will be important. A shipyard in Dublin could be adapted to focus upon the development of destroyers and light cruisers."
ire_dublin_shipyard:0 "Dublin Destroyer Shipyard"
ire_dublin_shipyard_desc:0 "We are now able to produce light screen ships at a more rapid rate courtesy of a specialised shipyard opened in Dublin."
IRE_CAPITALSHIPDOCKYARD:0 "Belfast Capital Shipwright"
IRE_CAPITALSHIPDOCKYARD_desc:0 "Small ships and submarines are children's toys in comparison to the mighty visage of a battleship. If we're going to be taken seriously as any sort of naval power, we need to produce big, powerful ships. Belfast is the perfect place to start."
ire_belfast_shipwright:0 "Belfast Capital Shipwright"
ire_belfast_shipwright_desc:0 "Belfast is one of the finest shipbuilding cities in the world and it's got even better thanks to a shipyard designed entirely to build battleships for our nation."

# Air force
IRE_AIRFORCE:0 "An tAerchór"
IRE_AIRFORCE_desc:0 "One glaring error of the Irish military so far has been the lack of any air force, seen as too unimportant and expensive. With the British building one of the largest air forces in the world, it is vital that we correct this if we are to stand a chance."
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE:0 "Defend the Irish Sea"
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE_desc:0 "Britain's historical strength has been its navy, with which it could defend its island from invasion. The best way to cripple Britain's power and protect Ireland from a British landing would be to research and build a series of bombers capable of destroying ships."
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE2:0 "Advanced Bombing Campaign"
IRE_CHANNELDEFENSE2_desc:0 "Now that we have researched naval bombers, we should use our newfound knowledge to research other kinds of bombers that can help us take the fight to Great Britain."
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS:0 "Protect Éire from Above"
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS_desc:0 "In the event of a war, the British air force would be able to invade Ireland's skies with impunity. We must research aircraft that can prevent this and shoot any tresspassing British planes out of the sky."
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS2:0 "Heavy Fighter Programme"
IRE_FIGHTERFOCUS2_desc:0 "With our fighter research having been a success, we should now look into building heavy fighters, effective at a longer range than regular fighters and adept at destroying enemy bombers."
IRE_AIRBASEEXPANSION:0 "Expand our Airfields"
IRE_AIRBASEEXPANSION_desc:0 "Currently our airfields in Dublin and Derry are subpar compared to those of many other nations, we must bring those airfields up to standard."
IRE_WOMENPILOTS:0 "Women In The IRAF"
IRE_WOMENPILOTS_desc:0 "While many have been opposed to the inclusion of women in the Irish army or navy despite the service of the Cumann na mBan during the Easter Rising, attitudes are more open to allowing them to enlist in the air force, perhaps following famous American pilot Amelia Earhart's example."
IRE_AIRCOMMAND:0 "Radar Technology"
IRE_AIRCOMMAND_desc:0 "Now that we have built an air force for ourselves, we should investigate radar technology. This would allow us to detect enemy aircraft, making it easier for our planes to destroy them, as well as giving us intelligence on enemy troops and ships."
IRE_ANYTHINGFORIRELAND:0 "Anything for Ireland"
IRE_ANYTHINGFORIRELAND_desc:0 "Our enemies are winning! After 700 years of fighting for freedom, we cannot let Ireland be overrun once again! In this desperate time, we have come up with a radical idea of suicidal attacks by planes laden with explosives on enemy warships. May God forgive us."

# Army
IRE_INFANTRY:0 "An tArm"
IRE_INFANTRY_desc:0 "Military tactics and doctrines have changed since the end of the Northern Campaign in 1926. The Irish army on the other hand has not. It is essential that we stay up to date when the outbreak of war in Europe is looking more and more likely by the day."
IRE_DIRECTIONOFTHEARMY:0 "Direction of the Army"
IRE_DIRECTIONOFTHEARMY_desc:0 "Currently our military is divided on how to proceed. Should we imitate the standard armies of other nations as we did in the Northern Campaign, or adapt the tactics and structure we pioneered during our War of Independence to conventional warfare?"
IRE_MOBILE1:0 "Mobile Warfare"
IRE_MOBILE1_desc:0 "Military strategy is changing, with mobility and tank warfare becoming popular. We too must keep up with the times, and begin studying mobility doctrines."
IRE_MOBILE2:0 "Motorising the Saighdiúirí"
IRE_MOBILE2_desc:0 "If mobility warfare is to work our regular infantry must be motorised so as to outrun the enemy otherwise our spearheads will be left stranded and vulnerable to encirclement themselves."
IRE_MOBILE3:0 "Armour Advances"
IRE_MOBILE3_desc:0 "Tanks are key to mobile warfare, forming the spearhead of an encirclement of the enemy. We must research tanks if our mobility tactics are to be successful."
IRE_FIREPOWER1:0 "Superior Firepower"
IRE_FIREPOWER1_desc:0 "The new mobility doctrine is primarily for nations that intend to invade others, which Ireland has no need of. Our doctrine should be focused on the use of artillery and preserving the lives of our men."
IRE_FIREPOWER2:0 "Small Arms Focus"
IRE_FIREPOWER2_desc:0 "An army cannot fight without supplies or ammunition. While German supplies and American donations proved helpful during the War of Independence, we must learn to research and produce our own supplies."
IRE_FIREPOWER3:0 "The Dublin Arsenal"
IRE_FIREPOWER3_desc:0 "Our doctrine depends on producing artillery so as to preserve the lives of our men. As we cannot just depend on just buying from international munitions companies we must study how to produce artillery ourselves."
IRE_ANHONOURABLEARMY:0 "An Honourable Army"
IRE_ANHONOURABLEARMY_desc:0 "Our army must be focused on order, discipline, and defence. While these tactics may have failed during the Easter Rising, they worked well during the Northern Campaign and are a better fit for conventional warfare."
IRE_APEOPLESARMY:0 "A People's Army"
IRE_APEOPLESARMY_desc:0 "Our army must be focused on speed and quick planning, adapting some of the tactics that allowed us to defeat the British during the Irish War of Independence to conventional warfare."
IRE_PATRIOTICMOVEMENT:0 "Patriotic Movement"
IRE_PATRIOTICMOVEMENT_desc:0 "Now that we have decided to adapt our War of Independence tactics to the modern day, we should promote a campaign comparing the modern army to the Flying Columns and that we pioneered these tactics to invigorate a sense of national pride in our people."
IRE_FIGHTINGSPIRIT:0 "The Fighting Irish"
IRE_FIGHTINGSPIRIT_desc:0 "While some of our forces are having trouble adapting to our decision, many Irishmen, some in Ireland and some outside, have fought for armies such as the American or British armies. We could hire their help to assist in training our troops."
IRE_PROFESSIONALARMY:0 "A Professional Army"
IRE_PROFESSIONALARMY_desc:0 "Now that we have decided to move to a more professional army, we must train our soldiers and officers, many of whom are still accustomed to the strategies of yesteryear."
IRE_OFFICERSCHOOL:0 "Establish the ATÓÉ"
IRE_OFFICERSCHOOL_desc:0 "Currently, many officers in our army lack proper training as a result of our armed forces being descended from a guerrilla rather than a professional army. If we were to establish an officer training school which would train civilians and enlisted personnel in order for them to gain a commission as Irish officers, it would improve the quality of our military."
IRE_BLUEBLOUSES:0 "Women's Auxiliary"
IRE_BLUEBLOUSES_desc:0 "Women have much to contribute to our nation and its defence. We must open positions to those brave daughters of Ireland who would serve their country."
IRE_FLYINGCOLUMNS:0 "The New Flying Column"
IRE_FLYINGCOLUMNS_desc:0 "While the reforming of the Army has been a long process, it is now finally complete and the nation is stronger and prouder for it, knowing that in the event of an invasion the defence of Ireland will be in strong and able hands."

# Navy
IRE_NAVY:0 "An tSeirbhís Chabhlaigh"
IRE_NAVY_desc:0 "Despite being an island nation and neighbouring to Britain, our navy only consists of a few destroyers mainly used for search and rescue of drowning fishermen. If we are to stand a chance against Britain's famous navy, we will need to expand."
IRE_WOLFHOUNDS:0 "Wolfhounds of the Irish Sea"
IRE_WOLFHOUNDS_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg despite being outclassed by the British Navy, the Germans used U-Boats to great effect. Our first step should be to research submarine tactics so that we can also replicate this success."
IRE_WOLFHOUNDS2:0 "The Second Fenian Ram"
IRE_WOLFHOUNDS2_desc:0 "In 1881 Irish inventor John Phillip Holland created a submarine known as the Holland Boat No. II, nicknamed the Fenian Ram, for the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Now we must follow in their footsteps and build a submarine fleet of our own to defend ourselves against the British Navy."
IRE_SCREENS:0 "Screen Research Project"
IRE_SCREENS_desc:0 "The purpose of a screen is to scout for a fleet and protect it from submarines and aircraft, something that would be useful in detecting British submarines and especially Britain's infamous RAF."
IRE_CARRIERS:0 "Carrier Technology"
IRE_CARRIERS_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to reform our navy, we should research aircraft carriers, a ship capable of basing bombers while at sea, which could be very useful in tandem with a reforming of our air force."
IRE_CAPITALFLEET:0 "A Grand Fleet for Ireland"
IRE_CAPITALFLEET_desc:0 "If we are to stand up to the British, we must be able to build a fleet similar to their own. While this will take a long time it will pay off in the end, just as it did for Germany which once also had a far inferior fleet to the British."
IRE_CAPITALFLEET2:0 "Better Battleships"
IRE_CAPITALFLEET2_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to build a grand fleet to match the British, we should look into the building of a Super-Heavy Battleship. While it will take a long time to build and will be expensive, the results should be worth it."
IRE_RUTHLESS:0 "Ruthless Interdiction Doctrine"
IRE_RUTHLESS_desc:0 "Guerre de course, or Handelskrieg, is an old tactic involving disrupting an enemy nation's trade by attacking its merchant shipping. With this, we could damage Britain without having to face their fleet."
IRE_DIRECTCONFRONTATION:0 "Direct Confrontation Doctrine"
IRE_DIRECTCONFRONTATION_desc:0 "If Ireland is to be safe from a naval blockade or invasion, we must directly confront the British Navy and force them to turn back to their ports in Britain."
IRE_MARINES:0 "Muirshaighdiúirí"
IRE_MARINES_desc:0 "Now that we have expanded our navy, we should consider the training of an elite unit of marines to spearhead a land invasion. If this was to be successful we could finally take the 700 years fight for Irish freedom to British land."

# Defence
IRE_HOMEDEFENSE:0 "Fortify the Shannon"
IRE_HOMEDEFENSE_desc:0 "One of Ireland's key natural landmarks is the River Shannon, dividing the east and west of Ireland. Our military has proposed fortifying both sides of the river, so that we can hold the line along the Shannon in the event of an enemy invasion."
IRE_COASTALDEFENSE:0 "An Balla Éireannach"
IRE_COASTALDEFENSE_desc:0 "Our next proposal for the defence of Ireland is to build a wall of coastal defences along Ireland's eastern shore, where a naval invasion is most likely to take place."
IRE_ANTIAIR:0 "Anti-Air Batteries"
IRE_ANTIAIR_desc:0 "Despite the grave threat that the British air force poses to Ireland, we have been slow to build any defences against them in the event of a declaration of war. This must change, and quickly."
IRE_CITADELPROJECT:0 "Tearmann - The Citadel Project"
IRE_CITADELPROJECT_desc:0 "While we have focused on fortifying the coasts and the rivers, the cities themselves have remained somewhat unprotected. We have come up with a plan known as the Citadel Project, the first stage of the project would be to erect land forts in our major cities protecting them from assault."
IRE_CITADELDUBLIN:0 "Citadel Dublin"
IRE_CITADELDUBLIN_desc:0 "The second stage of the plan is to completely fortify Dublin with forts, anti-aircraft equipment, coastal forts and radar. We must either choose to secure Dublin or Belfast as we don't have the resources to fortify both."
IRE_CITADELBELFAST:0 "Citadel Belfast"
IRE_CITADELBELFAST_desc:0 "The second stage of the plan is to completely fortify Belfast with forts, anti-aircraft equipment, coastal forts and radar. We must either choose to secure Belfast or Dublin as we don't have the resources to fortify both."
IRE_ORGANISEPARTISANS:0 "Mobilise the Irish Defence Corps"
IRE_ORGANISEPARTISANS_desc:0 "Now that we are at war, we must mobilise our reserve units in order to increase our ability to resist a naval invasion."

IRE_HONOURABLE_ARMY:0 "An Honourable Army"
IRE_HONOURABLE_ARMY_desc:0 "The Irish army has chosen to adapt to the tactics and discipline of a professional army."
IRE_PEOPLES_ARMY:0 "A People's Army"
IRE_PEOPLES_ARMY_desc:0 "The Irish army has chosen to adapt the tactics of the War of Independence."
IRE_FIGHTING_IRISH:0 "The Fighting Irish"
IRE_FIGHTING_IRISH_desc:0 "The aid of foreign Irish soldiers has improved the training of the Irish military."
IRE_OFFICER_SCHOOL:0 "Officer School"
IRE_OFFICER_SCHOOL_desc:0 "The establishment of an officer school has aided the training of both old officers from the War of Independence and new candidates."
IRE_BLUESHIRTS:0 "The Army Comrades Association"
IRE_BLUESHIRTS_desc:0 "The Army Comrades Association, also known by their nickname, the Blueshirts, is a paramilitary organisation under the control of the Taoiseach Eoin O'Duffy, recruiting among only the native Irish who profess the Christian faith. The Irish government has integrated the ACA into their security forces, for the defence of Ireland and hunting down syndicalists and other internal threats."
IRE_LAST_STAND:0 "Come Woe or Weal"
IRE_LAST_STAND_desc:0 "Ireland is once again alone at war against the British, and the survival of Irish independence looks unlikely. With nothing to lose the Irish people are willing to fight until the end."

# Military Events
ire.213.t:0 "Our Desperate Struggle"
ire.213.d:0 "Ireland is once again fighting alone against the British, our independence after 1921 seeming only a brief reprieve. While the situation looks hopeless, we shall fight until the very end. None shall say that Ireland went quietly into the night!"
ire.213.a:0 "In Éireann's cause, come woe or weal!"
ire.214.t:0 "Our newfound allies!"
ire.214.d:0 "Now that we finally have allies in our struggle, the situation no longer seems as hopeless as before, although the fight is not over yet."
ire.214.a:0 "Mid cannon's roar and rifle's peal, we'll chant a soldier's song!"
ire.215.t:0 "The war ends!"
ire.215.d:0 "Despite how bleak our situation was, we have managed to survive against all odds with our independence intact!"
ire.215.a:0 "We owe it to the resolute courage of the Irish people!"

#Other Events

# Mobilise Event
ire.1.t:0 "Mobilising the Defence Reserves"
ire.1.d:0 "Éire finds herself once again in a grave crisis. Our strategic planners foresaw that this day would come, and now that we are at war, it is time to make good use of their foresight. Brave sons of Ireland await the command across the nation to take up arms and defend their country from foreign aggressors."
ire.1.a:0 "We need them all."
ire.1.b:0 "A half company will do."
ire.1.c:0 "Call up only the infantry reserves."

# Introduction Events
ire.2.t:0 "The State of the Republic, 1936"
ire.2.d:0 "After countless years of arduous rebellion and weathering oppressive British rule, the Irish people have won their freedom, and their country back. But as one enemy was vanquished, another rose in her place, perhaps yet more dangerous still. Michael Collins sits as President, eager to defend the independence of his nation at any cost, yet his political enemies are many as the 1937 election approaches. Violence between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is rife, while Sinn Féin; while as not popular as the other two, presents itself as a moderate alternative. Ireland is a powder keg, and it's only a matter of time until it explodes. "
ire.2.a:0 "These are turbulent times."

ire.53.t:0 "Problems Up North"
ire.53.d:0 "Edward Carson, the former leader of the Unionist Party, died last year aged 81. He was an extremely divisive figure whilst alive and fled to England when Ireland gained her independence and took back Ulster. He was particularly reviled outside of Ulster for his persecution of beloved Irish poet and author Oscar Wilde. His memory was venerated today by loyalists in the north of Ireland, who held a memorial service in Belfast with several leading members of the UUP speaking in his name. The memorial attracted quite a crowd, showing that Carson still has power even in death. His spectre is looming over Ulster, just as the tensions and threat of rebellion loom over it as well."
ire.53.a:0 "He's a problem even from the grave."

# Unionist Tensions (and debug)
ire.3.t:0 "Unionist Tensions Debug"
ire.3.d:0 "This event will allow you to test whether the Unionist tensions system is working properly."
ire.3.a:0 "Increase Unionist Tensions."
ire.3.b:0 "Reduce Unionist Tensions."
ire.3.c:0 "Report Unionist Tensions."
ire.4.t:0 "Ulster at Peace"
ire.4.d:0 "After the recent unrest, the people of Ulster seem to once again be at peace. There's no telling for how long this peace will last, but there's no doubt that Ireland is better off for it. The Dáil has one less issue to deal with."
ire.4.a:0 "What a relief."
ire.5.t:0 "Disgruntled Populace in Ulster"
ire.5.d:0 "For some time now, there has been a slow but surely growing unrest in the northern region of Ireland, Ulster. Stirred up by predominantly Protestant Unionists, who advocate for closer ties with England, Ulster has become something of a problem region for the Dáil. If this situation is not handled carefully, the issues that divide the region are sure to grow more incendiary."
ire.5.a:0 "This is a delicate matter."
ire.6.t:0 "Radical Movements Mobilising"
ire.6.d:0 "In response to what they see as oppressive policies towards the people of Ulster, Unionist organisations are growing more radical and attracting the most disenfranchised and angry Northerners to their cause. They are presently meeting in secret in pubs and Orange Order halls around the country, safe from the prying eyes of the Gardaí."
ire.6.a:0 "Bloody radicals."
ire.7.t:0 "Riots in Belfast"
ire.7.d:0 "The streets of Belfast are in an uproar after the Unionists have begun to make their play for a general uprising. Disgruntled Ulstermen, the vast majority of which are Protestants, have taken to the streets in a violent stand against what they believe to be hostile intentions from Dublin. The Dáil has called an emergency meeting to address their grievances, but that may not be enough to stop them."
ire.7.a:0 "Madness."
ire.8.t:0 "Civil War Imminent"
ire.8.d:0 "All measures, peaceful or otherwise, to try and pacify Ulster has failed. The Ulster Unionists, backed by the Ulster Volunteer Force, have announced their independence from Ireland and have declared that they will defend the province of Ulster to the death from Dublin, and Catholic, rule. A civil war is inevitable."
ire.8.a:0 "God help us."

ire.131.t:0 "Radical Movements Diminishing"
ire.131.d:0 "The more radical elements of the Ulster region are slowly but surely diminishing. While the core members will remain as extreme as ever, they are finding it harder to recruit new members thanks to our latest policy changes. If things turn for the worse though, they'll most likely find followers soon enough, and we have to be wary. There's no peace in Ulster yet, only silence."
ire.131.a:0 "We'd best stay on our guard."

ire.132.t:0 "Riots Dispersed"
ire.132.d:0 "The streets of Belfast have been silenced and there are no riots anymore. Bricks, newspapers and trash litter the sideways as people return to work. However, the people who participated believe they have only lost a battle, not the war. In their work-place, at the pub and at home they whisper of when to strike next, not if."
ire.132.a:0 "At least they aren't in the streets."

# Election Events
ire.14.t:0 "The 1937 Elections"
ire.14.d:0 "Like every election since 1921 this one has been marred by corruption, voter intimidatation and political violence. However, disatisfaction with Collins rule has grown due to the Black Monday crisis with many ballot counters opting to take their jobs a bit more seriously. With the opposition taking part in a campaign of tactical voting, Collins faces the greatest challenge to his leadership."
ire.14.a:0 "Fine Gael party wins once more."
ire.14.b:0 "The opposition wins!"

ire.15.t:0 "The Opposition Win!"
ire.15.d:0 "It seems that the Black Monday crisis was too much of a storm for Collins to whether and the opposition have managed to win despite the odds against them. Senior Fine Gael member, Richard Mulcahy has advised Collins to maintain some dignity and step down though Prime Minister O'Duffy has told him to take 'extreme measures' to remain in charge."
ire.15.a:0 "Collins disbands the Oireachtas!"
ire.15.c:0 "Collins invalidates the election results for the time being!"
ire.15.b:0 "Collins resigns in disgrace and vanishes into obscurity."

ire.16.t:0 "Collins Assassinated?"
ire.16.d:0 "With Collins' dissolving the Oireachtas, in the immediate aftermath there have been angry riots from the socialist opposition. In the chaos a disgruntled FF supporter has attempted to assassinate our president! Should he fall, the socialists will no doubt attempt to overthrow the government!"
ire.16.a:0 "Collins is dead and the ICA storm Leinster House!"
ire.16.b:0 "The would-be assassin is killed and Collins lives!"

ire.250.t:0 "Elections at Last!"

MacNeill believes that, contrary to the claims by Liam Lynch and his soldiers, it was not the Unionist protesters who instigated the fatal clashes with the army. Instead, he believes that Lynch and his men were looking for a fight all along and later planted weapons on dead protesters to give themselves an alibi.

Since Ireland gained her independence, the people of Ulster have become increasingly marginalised and attempts to 'green' up the region and purge the British legacy there have thus far failed. The idea of letting this march go undeterred does not sit well with the majority of the Irish people, or the government. But stopping it may only make the situation worse..."

The demands have not fallen on deaf ears and there is a growing call for the Irish Republican Army to be deployed along the planned march route to protect the Catholic community and make sure things don't get out of hand."

Whilst there were concerns that the Unionists may turn their frustration into violence, these fears in the end turned out to go unrealised. Whilst this march has proven to be a contentious affair for the nation, at least it didn't result in any bloodshed today. Nonetheless, the Unionists growing demand for independence can no longer be ignored. There must be decisive action to address the question of Ulster, lest the situation grow out of control."

ire.43.d:0 "Following the shift in power that occurred when the British were chased out of Ireland, many Catholic business owners rose to prominence in Ulster. However, their rise in socio-economic status came often at cost to the Protestant residents of the region, who had previously enjoyed such unbridled dominance over the Catholic minority. A group of Ulster Unionist factory workers went on strike today citing unfair pay and unwarranted treatment by their Catholic employer. Their strike soon turned violent when they were attacked by what some believe to be hired thugs. Nobody was killed, although Belfast City Hospital had plenty of patients in the immediate aftermath. This will not do the tense situation in Ulster any favours."
ire.43.a:0 "This is worrying."

According to a follow-up police report, he had been stabbed several times and left for dead. The man was previously known to the local police force as a prominent member of a Unionist volunteers group with local ties in the Waterside. There have already been cries that the murder was committed by a Catholic and that the police will turn a blind eye. However warranted or unwarranted these claims may be, the situation in Ulster is, as ever, volatile."

Thousands of Ulstermen and women came out in the sunshine to listen to prominent Unionist speakers. There was plenty of time for song and dance, but just as much time for increasingly violent rhetoric regarding the status of Ulster in relation to the rest of Ireland. Whilst the words 'revolt' or 'uprising' might not have been spoken out loud, they were certainly thought. Of great concern to the Irish government will be the sheer number of people attending the rally. Clearly, the Unionist movement enjoys widespread popular support."
ire.45.a:0 "This movement is becoming increasingly popular."

ire.46.t:0 "Concert Hall Attacked in Antrim"
ire.46.d:0 "In the latest shocking incident from Ulster, a concert hall in County Antrim was subjected to a violent attack. Believed to have been carried out by the Protestant dissident group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, the attack saw several members of a Dublin band shot dead, as well as several concert goers. The motivation for the attack is believed to be another act of terrorism against the Irish state, acts that will continue as long as Ulster remains a part of Ireland, according to the movements occasional cryptic communications with the police and the public."
ire.46.a:0 "Awful."

ire.47.t:0 "Reprisal Shootings"
ire.47.d:0 "Seemingly in response to the recent violence carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force, five men with known ties to the group were found dead in a field near a farm twenty miles outside of Belfast. The victims appear to have been executed. It is believed that the men were rounded up during the night and taken together to be killed, although it is unknown at this time who might have orchestrated such an action. The tensions in Ulster are growing as the situation grows more violent, and the Irish government are facing increasing outcry at their apparent inability to address the instability of their nation."

James Craig, reported by some to have grown senile in his elder years, appeared lively and in a good mood as he viciously attacked the Irish government in his first major address of such a kind since the ceasefire of 1925. He particularly chastised the current regime and the economic neglect paid towards Ulster during the past decade, and demanded that every son and daughter of Ulster be prepared to fight for the prosperity and, if needs be, freedom of the region."

The shocking attack appears to be the latest in a long line of escalating UVF attacks, and was carried out during a meeting of local political representatives. Among those killed was Thomas Carlin, local party chief for the National Centre Party. This attack has frightened the nation, and the tension in Ulster has once again reared it's ugly head but this time with devastating consequences."

Several hundred people had to be evacuated in the midst of the evening's entertainment when a massive fire broke out, consuming much of the historic hall. Thirty-five people are believed to have died in the disaster and the toll could soon rise, with many still reported missing as search efforts comb through the debris hoping to find any signs of life. It is unknown what caused the fire to break out but the government is already being criticised yet again by Ulster Unionists, who claim the incident could have been avoided had the Opera House been refurbished, as a previous request to the government had suggested."
ire.50.a:0 "What a disaster."

ire.51.t:0 "Bank of Ireland Robbery"

ire.52.t:0 "Dublin Bombing"
ire.52.d:0 "At 10:30am this morning, a massive explosion went off near the Four Courts in Dublin. Five hundred people are believed dead and many more could follow when an official death count is taken. Two men believed to have been responsible for the bombing were shot dead by the Gardaí as they attempted to flee the scene and put up resistance when asked to stand down. At least one of the men has been identified as a Belfast native with known Unionist ties. This terrifying escalation of the on-going conflict in Ulster is tantamount to a declaration of war upon Ireland and her people, and the public outcry has been enormous. The Irish people are baying for blood, and it is Ulster that may have to pay the price."
ire.52.a:0 "This can't go on."

ire.58.t:0 "Unionists Planning An Uprising?"
ire.58.d:0 "Now that we find ourselves in an unfortunate state of war, there has been an unusual amount of dissent pouring in from the north of Ireland. Ulster Unionists are said to be considering their options whilst the Irish Republican Army is preoccupied with the on-going conflict, and they very well may use this opportunity to try and break free from the Republic. The consequences of such an action could be grave for the nation, as they might very well attempt to align themselves with our enemies and would provide a perfect base for an invasion of Ireland."

No doubt the tyrannical government down south will waste very little time in turning those German guns against the good people of Ulster."

The British Empire, or what is left of it, to whom we swore our loyalty for so many years.. has decided to back the Republic of Ireland in their war to reclaim our precious Ulster.

It seems that our efforts to support the Ulster cause have not gone unnoticed in the international community, making the fight for Ulster all the more difficult."

Although the civil war was a bloody one and the victory was won through hard work and sacrifice, the government has pledged that the Ulster question will nevermore trouble the people of Ireland, and that the Unionist cause has been rooted out and the earth salted in it's wake. One of the most divisive issues in modern Irish history has, it would seem, finally been put to rest."

The Irish Republican Army, backed by German arms and tanks, were able to decisively crush the Ulster uprising despite the attempts by the Union of Britain to interfere in the civil war. This is sure to bring stability to a troubled region and has seen our decision to send volunteers vindicated."

ire.148.t:0 "The Irish Victorious"
ire.148.d:0 "The commander-in-chief of our military delegation to Ireland reported in this morning that the Irish Republican Army has retaken Ulster and completely crushed the rebel uprising. Despite the treacherous interference of the Syndicalist menace inhabiting the former centrepiece of the British Empire, the Irish military prevailed with our assistance. The Ulster question seems to have been thoroughly resolved for the time being, and Ireland stands united once more."

We received reports this morning that the Irish Republican Army had fully occupied the key cities of Derry and Belfast. We do not know what happened to the leaders of the Unionist cause, but no doubt the tyrannical Irish government had them executed. Our attempts to meddle in Irish affairs has resulted in an embarrassment for our nation, and some within our government feel as if we should have left the Ulstermen to fight their own battles."

ire.151.d:0 "It has been a long and bloody struggle, but Ulster has held strong against the aggression from the Republic of Ireland for a year, and many men, both Catholic and Protestant have died. We could push for a peace with the Republic if they were to acknowledge our right to independence. This would surely be the best course of action if we wish to avoid an even more prolonged conflict."

# Ireland receives peace terms

ire.152.d:0 "The leader of the rebellious Ulstermen, James Craig, has sent his peace terms to Dublin. In exchange for an end to hostilities, he demands that the Republic recognise the freedom and independence of Ulster. Whilst it is true that the civil war with the rebellious northerners hasn't ended quite as quickly as many thought it would, to accept a free Ulster would be tantamount to political suicide for the Irish government. Nonetheless, some might advocate it as the only solution for a peaceful end to this conflict."

# Ireland says yes
ire.154.t:0 "Peace At Last"
ire.154.d:0 "Our offer of peace was surprisingly well received by the Irish government and they have agreed to an end to hostilities, recognising the independence of Ulster. This is a glorious day for the people of Northern Ireland, who can now truly consider themselves free from the tyrannical rule of the Irish and their disregard for Protestant traditions and culture. There will be no more fighting, and the island of Ireland can return to peace once more. Fledgling free Ulster now has a future to look forward to, guaranteed by the brave men and women who gave their lives to the Unionist cause!"

ire.155.d:0 "Our involvement in the Irish Civil War appears to have angered the capitalist hive, invoking nations friendly to the Irish nation to send volunteers to aid them against the Unionist's attempt at rebellion. Our volunteers have been a great asset to the Unionist cause and a step towards securing Ireland, albeit through indirect means. However, now that hostile volunteer forces have joined the Republican forces, it would be fair to say that the civil war in Ireland is not necessarily developing to our advantage. If we were to invest any more of our own military even as 'volunteers' then it could be seen as a direct act of war by our hostile neighbours in Europe and across the Atlantic. However, if we were to ask the French if they might aid the Ulster cause we might be able to swing the conflict back in our interest..."

# France receives request
ire.156.t:0 "The Union of Britain Requests Aid"
ire.156.d:0 "The Union of Britain has sent an official request to the foreign office of the French Commune. They have drawn our attention to the ongoing civil war in Ireland, and have requested we send our own volunteers to help the Ulster separatists, although many might question whether or not this cause really deserves French support, given the radically anti-socialist and Protestant fundamentalist nature of the Ulster rebels. Agreeing to the request would see Commune forces depart for Belfast and, unofficially of course, aid the Ulstermen in their fight for independence."
ire.156.a:0 "A true cause célèbre. We shall send aid if it means that the fires of revolution grow stronger."
ire.156.b:0 "Who cares about their pet reactionaries?"

# France says yes
ire.157.t:0 "The French Agree"
ire.157.d:0 "It would appear that the French Commune is acquiescent to our request for assistance in Ulster. A detachment of French 'volunteers' is on their way to Belfast and will very soon arrive on the front lines to help resist the Republican forces. Surely, this will be a turning point in the Irish-Ulster Civil War!"
ire.157.a:0 "Excellent."

# France says no
ire.159.t:0 "The French Decline"
ire.159.d:0 "Unfortunately, the French Commune does not consider the ongoing conflict in Ireland to be of any great significance or importance to the Internationale, and have expressed unease about the reactionary nature of the Ulstermen. It appears that, apart from our own volunteer forces, the Ulstermen are truly on their own against the superior numbers of the Irish army. Barring a full-on declaration of war, we have done as much as we can at this time."
ire.159.a:0 "That's the bloody French for you."

# Ulster receives troops

ire.158.t:0 "The French Commune sends aid!"

ire.158.a:0 "No surrender!"

# Irish warning about French troops

ire.160.d:0 "A report from military intelligence in Belfast has delivered the startling news that troops from the French Commune, volunteers in name only, have been seen disembarking from transport ships in the Belfast City harbour. They were greeted by a delegation of British and Unionist military officials, making it quite clear that the French have sent troops to aid the Ulster cause. This is another clear attempt by the Union of Britain to steal Ireland back through a Unionist puppet. The conflict has escalated yet again, but the Irish people will not give up until the matter is put to rest, no matter how much French, English, or Unionist blood needs to be spilled."
ire.160.a:0 "This is our land. We will not let them take it from us."

# Ulster Victory
ire.161.t:0 "Freedom for Ulster!"
ire.161.d:0 "The brave men and women of Ulster heard the call of freedom, and they were ready to answer it with blood and power of arms. Through a hard fought struggle, we have beaten the Irish Republican Army and won the civil war. Our independence has been secured and the Republic of Ireland is soundly beaten. We can now set up our own provisional government and rule over Ulster in a fair and just manner, where Protestants will be put first always, and the cause of Unionism can be advanced in peace."

Surrounded by the vastly superior numbers and artillery of the British Army, they fought on for six days before eventually surrendering. Most of the leaders of the Rising were executed. Although a loss at the time, it would subsequently lead to Ireland's war of independence and freedom after seven hundred years under British rule.

Ireland has relied on trade with Germany and its sphere of influence since the British Revolution when we declared ourselves a republic and cut ties with the British Empire. The crisis has had a severe effect on the Irish economy as Germany and our other European trading partners have been hit by the crisis. Many scramble to find solutions, most parties proposing either Irish economic development or maintaining stability while the German economy recovers. More radically the anglophile National Centre Party advocate abandoning trade with continental Europe and opening ties with the Entente, often making speeches tinged with anti-German rhetoric.

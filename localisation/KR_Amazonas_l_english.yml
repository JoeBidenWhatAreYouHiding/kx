### Leaders ###
POLITICS_BARATA_AMA_DESC:0 "Joaquim de Magalhães Cardoso Barata was born in 1888 in Belem, and has served with distinction in the Brazilian army for decades. He is however more well known for his multiple tenures as an administrator in the state, as he is the leader of the local military faction in that state that supported São Paulo in the interstate war. His tenures were usually stable, even during election year he often found himself at odds with other major political factions and actions, such as his main rivals in the Sodré family, who accused Barata of voter fraud on multiple occasions, but the political union with Amazonas and other northern states should give him some more room to maneuver. As president of Pará, Barata is also commander-in-chief, and his influence with the newly formed military should not be underestimated, for he has taken a close attention to the formation of this military force. Having for so long struggled to maintain political control of the region, Barata now finally has Pará marching under the beat of his drum."
POLITICS_LAURO_SODRE_HOS_AMA_DESC:0 "Lauro Nina Sodré e Silva had left political behind him after the interstate war, but the current situation of Pará as an independent nation brought him back to the forefront, this time as its head of state, not merely as its governor. Born in Belém in 1858, the old man is more than just a powerful and veteran politician, but also perhaps the oldest active politician in Pará. Also a military man, like many of the leaderships in Brazil during the times of the old republic, he took part in the Vaccine Revolt in Rio, being arrested in the process, and after that, continued his career as a multiple time representative for his state in that city. While his years may be running out, he is preparing the new republic's political system to stay aligned with his family and allies, while also balancing foreign demands and repairing wartime damage to the vital portuary infrastructure across the states he now rules over."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_FACIOLA_AMA_DESC:0 "A true captain of the old guard, Antônio de Almeida Facióla's political career all the way back in the 1880s, and has not left the game since, even at his advanced age. While some opposition members claim that having a president with ''one foot in the grave'' is dangerous for Parense democracy, the multiple times state president of Pará political power cannot be denied, even if his body fails him more and more frequently in the past few years, as with any man in his eighties. While he wields significant clout at his former political arena, the ''old man president'' doesn't really have a strong degree of influence in Amazonas or the smaller territories, and may find himself having issues actually ruling the nation's disparate political factions; as his position as it's first president is to a great degree based on foreign appointment rather than his own efforts."
POLITICS_ALVARO_BOTELHO_MAIA_AMA_DESC:0 "Born on the edge of Rio Madeira in the outskirts of the city of Humaitá, Álvaro Botelho Maia moved while still young the provincial capital of Manaus to finish his studies, and quickly found himself involved in local newspapers and later followed on into politics, but he is also a poet and a writer in his free time. While his career so far has been a string of relative unimportant appointed positions in smaller territories of the defunct Brazilian government, his growing frustration of his lack of power to properly reform the northern reaches of the country was immense even before the war, and now he sees himself in a prime position to modernize Amazonas' still young economy, education and political infrastructure. However, being both a reformer and not of a traditional political family puts him in a collision course with powerful landowners and rubber barons, and he will have to spend significant effort to see these changes through even with foreign backing."
POLITICS_EFIGENIO_SALE_AMAS_DESC:0 "Hailing from the town of Serro in Minas Gerais, Efigênio Ferreira de Salles was at the helm of the state of Amazonas at the start of the interstate war, and when the news of the war reached the north, he opted for a 'wait and see' stance, which resulted in him being ousted from office after the rebels successfully ousted president Bernardes on that occasion; since then, he occupied relatively minor positions as a representative and worked as a teacher, his primary job for much of his life. However, the result of the war Brazil found itself in has made his political destiny take another unexpected turn, as he is now the president and head of state of the newly founded republic of Amazonas, a position both powerful and precarious, as his influence in Belém and outside of Amazonas in general is severely limited, especially after so many years out of the upper echelon of the great game. However, his experience, allies in Manaos and foreign backing almost ensure that in any contentious matters, his voice will be the last one heard and the one truly heeded in the young republic."
POLITICS_LANDRY_SALES_AMA_DESC:0 "A native of Acaraú and born in 1904, Landry Sales Gonçalves started his career as a military officer, and both took part on rebellions back in the Old Republic and interacted with several key figures of the tenentist uprisings that would follow. While did flirt with the AIB during the rise of that party, he since has adopted more classical liberal stances in detriment of militarism political thought, and has been elected president with great support from fellow officers in campaigning. His outlook towards politics also changed over the years, and he is more in favour of de-escalating tensions and a generally less active role of active officers in political affairs. While he is not a native to the lands of the north, he spent most of the past decade occupying administratie posts in Pará, and thus has chosen it as his hope for the time being, while also fostering good relations with the republic of his birthplace to the west. He has a big task ahead of him, as the already diminutive amount of infrastructure of these riverlands may take decades to repair, but Landry is used to both the harsh life of the barracks and the ever shifting loyalties of politics."
POLITICS_AMA_POMAR_DESC:0 "Pedro Ventura Felipe de Araújo Pomar lived certainly an unorthodox childhood, having moved to New York from his home state of Pará while aged 5, living there for two years before returning to his small birth time of Obidos, and then moving to the state capital of Belem. He started to act politically at age thirteen, supporting the rebel cause in the interstate war quite publically, but later on he moved further and further left as he reached adulthood, becoming a full blown socialist by age 20; he spent these youth years studying for medical school, and as a part time footballer for Clube do Remo. A calm and collected man, Pedro often remains quiet in political gatherings, only occasionally inferring in rare points, and has a usually positive and likeable demeanour, which resulted in his relative popularity among trade union members, despite his somewhat young age; now, he is faced with the immense challenge of leading a nation that is just as young as him, and faces immense hurdles of infrastructure and budget. While these concerns are certainly worrisome, he believes that with the support of the people, socialism can flourish even here, in the banks of the Amazon basin."
POLITICS_CLAUDIO_SANTORO_AMA_DESC:0 "Claudio Franco de Sá Santoro was born in Manaus in 1919, and is an extremely renowned musician and composer. His career in music began while still young, but his involvement with the Internationale is just as old, as he often found his colleagues involved with syndicalist and leftist organizations even from very early. His appointment to the position of first head of state of his new country is a recognition of his career in both of those fields, but also an immense responsibility, as the riverine republic has to repair the immense wartime damage, both administrative and in infrastructure, while also dealing with the powerful and avaricious landowners who see Claudio as a foreign collaborator, and will stop at nothing to keep the people ignorant and to ransack of the world's greatest forest of its riches. Dealing with these opponents may well be a complicated matter for the young socialist, who is still seen as excessively hopeful and naive, and perhaps may require foreign intervention."
POLITICS_AMA_JOAO_AMAZONAS_DESC:0 "Born in Belém in 1919, João Amazonas de Souza Pedroso's involvement with politics and the socialist movement began relatively recently, in 1932, during one of the first actions of the newly founded Democratic Left in his hometown. While initially a social democrat, as the years went by he drifted further left, frustrated with the power the landowners had over democratic institutions and growing more and more cynical of the capacity of democracy to bring real change to his home. Now, he is in a position to do much more after the liberation of Brazil, as the head of state and chairman of his homeland, and bring the modern age to Pará as a whole; and this time, it's the landowners who are at the mercy of the proletariat, and not the other way around. In due time, he hopes, the lands around the river he was named for will become known as a shining example of socialist success and prosperity."

AMA_the_great_riverland_desc:0 "The Amazon is the largest river in the world and the focal point of our new nation - indeed, Belém, our greatest city lies next to its great mouth. Upstream, however, there has always been a lack of political control. We must succeed where Brazil had failed and properly govern the riverland."
AMA_political_restructurong_desc:0 "Our government has inherited severe inefficiency from Brazil. While changing this reality will take time, we must begin the process."
AMA_tracking_and_exploration_desc:0 "The Amazon is dense and foreboding, with much of its verdant catacombs unexplored. We should recruit men with experiencing navagating the jungle and pass their knowledge to our armed forces and civilian administration."
AMA_seize_brazilian_assets_desc:0 "Many industries, owned by companies and individuals from the south, continue to pillage our nation for their own gain. This must end - these enterprises must serve our nation."
AMA_state_protection_desc:0 "While in the cities, our new nation has consolidated its control rapidly, the influence of the state dissipates quickly in rural areas. To combat this, we should fund the creation and population of new communities center around heavily subsidized light industry. These beacons of civilization shall naturally become small nexusues of governance."
AMA_land_reorganization_desc:0 "Our new system of land management is insufficient to handle significant expansion. However, the virgin lands which our explorers have mapped cannot sit idle. We must do whatever necessary to administer and distribute these lands."
AMA_development_program_desc:0 "The initiative to develop new light industrial settlements has found some success but our industry lags behind the rest of the world in its sophistication. Let us focus on achieving parity with even the great powers of the world."
AMA_native_protection_desc:0 "The indigenous people of the Amazon live in horrid conditions with little economic opportunity, often exploited by illegal enterprises operating in the jungle. This must end; all native tribes much be given a government attaché to protect against abuses."
AMA_prime_directive_desc:0 "While contact with civilisation may bring some benefit to the most isolated native groups, it also would surely bring a myriad of problems, especially disease and culture destruction. We must institutionalize a pro-active yet socially conscious contact policy."
AMA_govermental_reform_desc:0 "The shock of our nation's quick separation from Brazil left little time to develop sufficient political institutions. With the shock now past, we should seek to remedy the shortcomings of our governmental structure."
AMA_reach_into_the_jungle_desc:0 "The most remote areas of the Amazon lack many basic governmental services. A letter from the border with Peru may take weeks to reach its intended destination! Let us bring these facets of modernity to every patch of rainforest."
AMA_para_identity_desc:0 "Our people view themselves not as Paránese, but as Brazilian, we must work to change this."
AMA_higher_learning_desc:0 "Education and the cultivation of human capital drives long-run economic growth. Woefully lacking in universities, we should found a massive central campus to serve as the focal point of any future educational programs."
AMA_amapa_belem_railway_desc:0 "Macapá is currently unreachable by rail. By building a railway from the capital, Macapá will surely prosper."
AMA_belem_manaus_railway_desc:0 "Situated in the center of the Amazon, despite its considerable population, Manaos is reachable only by river boat or aircraft, isolating its population. If only our government could lay the foundations for a modern railway network, the city would certainly enter a new golden age."
AMA_manaus_roraima_railway_desc:0 "Situated at the very edge of the country, Roraima is shockingly isolated for a modern city. With the need for development of the rail system in the Amazon already establish, let Roraima be enjoined with the network at last."
AMA_manaus_rio_branco_railway_desc:0 "Accessible by rail only from territories not under our control, the Rio Branco, and the Acre region with it, is at risk of slipping from our grasp. We cannot allow this fine city to become a hive of scum and villany, let us connect it to our growing rail network."
AMA_manaus_fonte_boa_railway_desc:0 "Nearly to the Colombian border, any army advancing from the north would surely sweep through Fonte Boa. We must connect this strategically important city to the rail network."
AMA_port_of_belem_desc:0 "Belem is the largest port for many hundreds of miles and the undisputed gateway to the Amazon. Unfortunately, the city lack sufficient facilities for our warships. We must not allow our nation to so easily be brought to its knees. A great base must be built."
AMA_new_future_desc:0 "While consolidating our lands and their bounty is important, we must look to the future as well. New economic opportunities await."
AMA_arm_our_forces_desc:0 "Our armed forces cannot produce the armaments necessary to supply their swelling ranks. New factories explicitly for military production should be built."
AMA_mining_processing_construction_desc:0 "Facilities for processing minerals are as important as the mines themselves. We should invest in the development of facilities sufficient to meet our growing production."
AMA_estaleiro_manaus_desc:0 "The Amazon is so great at Manaos that the massive river boats which connect the Amazon can be built there. We need not import such vessels anylonger. Let us fund the construction of specialized shipyards in Manaos."
AMA_estaleiro_belem_desc:0 "Belem is our greatest port and the place where merchant and military ships may be most easily built. We should work with producers to see a new boom in ship production there."
AMA_arming_industry_desc:0 "We must end our constantly military supply problems once and for all. Funding must be earmarked for a new grand expansion of our domestic arms industry."
AMA_defense_of_amazon_delta_desc:0 "The long coast of the delta presents a perfect target for a potential invading force. While it may be difficult to man, the entire thing must be fortified."
AMA_industrial_incentives_desc:0 "With its shipbuilding industry booming, Manaos mut also have industries to support such activity. We must offer financial incentives for local industries involved in such."
AMA_zona_franca_desc:0 "To encourage the development of the Amazon further, tax exemptions should be granted to those in key industries in the region."
AMA_extract_wealth_desc:0 "Vast deposits of gold and other natural resources remain unexploited. We must assess these deposits and begin to export our nation's bounty."
AMA_garimpo_desc:0 "Our nation's resource deposits have begun to attract the attention of fortune seekers from around the continent and the world. The gold mines, especially, have swelled with workers and Amazonian sediment is increasingly panned for gold."
AMA_leite_do_pau_desc:0 "Just a few decades ago, rubber producers set their sights on the Amazon region. With demand for rubber higher than ever, this 'Amazon Rubber Boom' must be replicated. Let us work closely with these producers to see to it."
AMA_asserting_independence_desc:0 "While we may rely upon foreign powers for protection, we shall not be their simple lapdog. While we seek not to rebel, we must assert our right to forge our own path."
AMA_armed_forces_desc:0 "Brazil's army was forever wracked by corruption and regionalism. Our own must be developed to avoid such trappings."
AMA_equipment1_desc:0 "All aspects of our military procurement process lag behind our enemies. We must invest in the total overhaul of he system and acquisition of a range of new equipment."
AMA_doctrine1_desc:0 "The development of a modern general staff is key to the success of all other reforms. We must begin to establish this infrastructure."
AMA_marines_desc:0 "The environment of our nation has instilled n the population knowledge especially useful to marine units. We should bolster our marines, drawing on this experience."
AMA_army_modernization_desc:0 "An entirely new military research system is needed to oversee the total modernisation of our forces. While it may be expensive it is necessary."
AMA_equipment2_desc:0 "Without his rifle, a soldier is nothing. The men must be equiped with the best weapons money can buy."
AMA_doctrine2_desc:0 "We should hire the best and the brightest from across the globe to assist in the development of our military doctrine."
AMA_paratroopers_desc:0 "Paratroopers are a recent innovation and one which has taken the world by storm. We must have parachute units of our own."
AMA_jungle_skies_desc:0 "The dense rainforest is nigh impenetrable at times by land. From the air however, the land is laid bare. Let us invest in a national air force."
AMA_rule_skies_desc:0 "Fighter aircraft are the backbone of every air force. Let us begin to catch up with the rest of the world in fighter design."
AMA_bomber_desc:0 "Sometimes the best defence is a good offence. If we are ever to truly deter our enemies, we must have bombers capable of striking their towns and cities with devastating effect."
AMA_CAS_desc:0 "Recent wars have shown the necessity of direct aerial combat support. An air force meant to keep to its own is doomed to failure. We must have close air support of our own."
AMA_FAP_desc:0 "The legacy of the Brazilian air force and its doctrine impedes the development of our own. We must find our own way."
AMA_airlifts_desc:0 "Often, troops operating in remote parts of the Amazon cannot easily be supplied overland. We should construct a new airbase purpose-built for airlifting supplies."
AMA_long_rage_flights_desc:0 "Not one inch of land nor airspace can be conceded to the enemy. We should research aircraft with the range to make that a reality."
AMA_green_skies_desc:0 "The mineral-rich waters of the Amazon delta present an extra challenge to any would-be invader. On the approach to our shores, they are sure to be sitting ducks! We must develop naval bombers to exploit this advantage."

POLITICS_JOHN_WINANT_DESC:0 "Born on the East Side of New York City on February 23, 1889 - John Gilbert Winant came from a prosperous family and attended Princeton University, although his marks were relatively poor. After a brief stint in the army, Winant entered state politics by elected to the New Hampshire Senate. Following a successful career in the Senate, Winant ascended to Governor of New Hampshire under the Republican Party from 1925-1927 and then from 1931-1935. He achieved state-wide fame for his handling of the decades-long economic depression that had beset America. Active in the Square Deal policies that helped end the depression in New England, Winant has easily been chosen among his party to lead New England onwards in its most challenging days. Following his governorship, Winant ascended to the powerful position of being the American ambassador to Canada where he played a hand in the many interactions between the Provisional Government and the Canadian nation. The 33rd President of the United States faces a broken nation but is eager to reunite and take its place once more as the hegemon of the New World.\n\nServing alongside Winant is Frederick Hale, a Maine lawyer and Senator from Harvard University. A long-time Republican and chairman of the Committee of Canadian Relations - Hale has espoused fierce anti-Ku Klux Klan views in public and has not been afraid to denounce them."
POLITICS_HERBERT_LEHMAN_DESC:0 "As of his inauguration, Herbert Lehman is the first Jewish Head of State in American History. Born into the storied Lehman family, and served in the US Army general staff, Lehman got his start supporting Al Smith's presidential campaign. Lehman served the rest of FDR's term after his death in 1921, and subsequent terms as Governor. Lehman opposed the conservative wing of the Democrats and opposed Eastland while addressing Congress. The Crisis of 36 forced Lehman out of NYC and into the provisional capital of Boston, where his shrewd dealings allowed him to secure safe passage of refugees into New England from the CSA."
POLITICS_PERCIVAL_BAXTER_DESC:0 "A sentry for Maine Republicanism, Percival Baxter has stood against radicalism in his state for decades. Baxter's term as Senator saw a massive expansion to national parks in Maine, and successfully kept the lands free during the Depression. In 1936, Baxter banished several Republicans from the party after uncovering their Klan membership. The rise of MacArthur saw Baxter pushed into New Englander politics, where he represented a return to normal non-radical republican politics."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_KENNEDY_DESC:0 "Born into an Irish Catholic family in Boston, which placed the Kennedy's just out of reach of the political elite. Joseph Kennedy was guided into Harvard to achieve as high a prominence as possible from his birth. Family troubles like the lobotomy of his eldest daughter was pushed aside in favour of dynasty building and business growth. Kennedy owned the largest whiskey importation company in America, and reinvested profits into businesses that sadly fell in the Great Depression. The Crisis of 36 and the reorganisation of New England allowed Kennedy to rally the Democratic voters to his side, becoming the first Catholic Head of State in American history."
POLITICS_CHRISTIAN_HERTER_DESC:0 "Born in Paris, and moving to Boston at a young age, Herter came into wealth via marriage to the Pratt family. Sent to the German Embassy, Herter would frequently recommend America intervene in the Weltkreig to no avail. His return saw him becoming Governor of Massachusetts, and the establishment of essential diplomatic ties with Canada that came into play in 37. Herter continues to advocate America's entry into the Entente, the liberation of democratic France, and the final justice of dismantling the German Empire."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Born in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, on November 3, 1884 - Joseph Martin Jr came from an Irish New England family and spent his youth playing ball and working as a newspaper editor. A so-called "compassionate conservative," Martin supports the use of conservative techniques and concepts to significantly improve society's welfare.\n\nAscending from a career of local and then state politics for Massachusetts, Martin secured a position in Congress as a Representative for the Republican Party. As the nation descended into chaos and a new interim President was hastily chosen, Martin was elected on a combined coalition party of Democrats and Republicans.\n\nHis Vice President is the former Democratic governor of Massachusetts and conservative Democrat Joseph B. Ely. Achieving fame among New Englanders due to his handling of the Great Depression, Ely has been chosen by the compromise committee due to his role in combating unemployment and poverty. While the tensions between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party still exist, a house divided against itself cannot stand in America's darkest hour."
POLITICS_NORMAN_WALLACE_LERMOND_DESC:0 "A man equally concerned with nature and politics, Norman Wallace Lermond has had a long history with both. From 1880, he became involved in farmers organizations, the Populist Party, and even founded the Socialist Party of Maine in the 1890's. Though his later attempts to start a utopian socialist colony in Washington state were unsuccessful, Lermond came back to New England and built the socialist movement in the region, though it was never directly tied to syndicalism. Instead, Lermond is influenced by Bellamyist ideals, and hopes to bring these ideals to bear in New England. With such a diverse array of influences, Lermond will surely make for a unique leader, but if he wants to keep New England alive, he will have to choose his allies carefully..."
POLITICS_LEONARD_ABBOTT_DESC:0 "Having mixed ties to Britain and America, Leonard Abbott has had a conflicted life. However, when he moved to the United States to be a newspaper editor, he faced discrimination as an anarchist. Seeing the successful revolution in Britain and believing in the possibility of a similar uprising in the states, Abbott aligned himself with other prominent syndicalist thinkers in the Red Belt and elsewhere. However, due to his ties in New England, Abbott decided to stay in the region to attempt to hold an uprising and bring New England into the fold of the Combined Syndicates. Now that he has succeeded in this goal, it is only a matter of time before New England joins its larger western neighbor. May all traitors and reactionaries tremble at the combined forces of these two regions..."
POLITICS_DENNIS_ROBERTS_DESC:0 "A quiet but integral member to the Democratic establishment, his cooperation with the Canadian Liberal party saw his rise through a Canadian sponsored election campaign. This campaign emphasized his loyalty to Rhode Island, his Naval service, and his voting record in favour of civil rights."
POLITICS_PETER_GERRY_DESC:0 "A protégé' of MP Lyon Mackenzie King, great grandson of VP Elbridge Gerry, and inheritor to a vast fortune, Gerry already had a leg up in politics. Becoming the Democratic Whip in the 1920s while a Senator for Rhode Island, Gerry worked his way up the political and social ladder. Marrying into and gaining the support of the Vanderbilt family helped Garry finance bailouts for Rhode Island businesses. MP King convinced Gerry to join the Liberals in 1940 in order to advance their common interest in social liberalism, which eventually paid off in his presidential campaign."
POLITICS_SHERMAN_ADAMS_DESC:0 "A career that spans Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and ultimately the executive chair. Serving as the Republican Speaker of the House in 1940, Sherman pushed through Old Age Pensions laws and worked towards a balanced budget Fair Deal road-map. This ultimately proved popular with Americans after decades of indecisive economic policy, and was used heavily in Sherman's presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ROBERT_BRADFORD_DESC:0 "A Republican in a strongly Democratic Massachusetts, Bradford's combination of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism helped make the case for his term as Governor in 1938. There Bradford successfully prevented strikes from going violent and used public funds to build homes to solve the housing issue. Bradford chaired a Silent Guest program during the turmoil of 36, asking Americans to donate the cost of a meal to the public relief for refugees from Macarthur. This charitable attitude continues into his term in the executive office."
POLITICS_MAURICE_TOBIN_DESC:0 "Born in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 22, 1901 - Maurice Joseph Tobin's Catholic and Irish heritage has led him to become deeply popular among Boston's Irish population. He briefly worked at Conway Leather and New England Telephone after graduating from Boston University until he entered politics as a protege of the esteemed Democrat James Curley. At just the young age of 25, Tobin was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, which he served from 1925-1929. A fiscally conservative man, Tobin then became mayor of Boston serving the city without authorising large public scale projects. His career as mayor was rocked by the Coconut Grove fire, but the scandal did not stop the ambitious Tobin from running for President. An energetic and vigorous member of the Democratic Party, Tobin became elected as the 34th President, securing for the Democrats four more years in the White House. The nation waits to see what the new President will do, especially those involved in labour as Tobin has been a constant supporter of labour unions and socially liberal policies.\n\nServing alongside Tobin is James Farley, an Irish-Catholic New Yorker and member of the Knights of Malta. A fierce fighter for civil rights, especially for African-Americans, Farley has announced he will supervise the rebuilding of the nation's postal service and significantly improve its airmail capabilities. The two men have vowed to reunite and rebuild America once and for all under the leadership of the Democratic Party."
POLITICS_PAUL_DEVER_DESC:0 "As a lawyer, Dever made a career in Boston defending business practices of corporations. This all changed when Dever enlisted in the US Army, and served alongside mixed race divisions. As he found out that most of these soldiers were in the Liberal party, Dever entered into politics under the Liberals. An uphill battle against Democrats in Massachusetts commenced that saw Dever promise veteran benefits and welfare extension."
POLITICS_GEORGE_AIKEN_DESC:0 "Born in Dummerston, Vermont, on August 20th, 1892 - George David Aiken developed a strong interest in agriculture early, a passion that he would carry on in his career as governor of Vermont. A Republican, he ran unsuccessfully for the Vermont House of Representatives in 1922, but he ran successfully in 1930 and 1932. He ascended to the position of Lieutenant Governor in 1934 and became governor in 1936, just as the nation descended into chaos. As governor of Vermont during the civil war, Aiken helped organise work projects to alleviate the economic stress caused by years of the great depression. A proponent of spending projects for rural America, Aiken holds great affection for the natural beauty of his home state, although these views put him at odds with old-guard Republicans. With his background in agriculture, he portrayed himself as the defender of farmers and the common folk - with this stance and popularity, he accepted the Republican nomination for the campaign of 1948.\n\nNow the 35th President of the United States, Aiken faces a nation finally shaking off the dust after years of economic woe and instability. Serving alongside Aiken is Robert Bradford, the Republican Lt. Governor of Boston, and a man from a long-time traditional New England family. During his time as governor, Bradford emphasised fiscal conservatism but social liberal values as seen in his project such as housing and care for civil war veterans."
POLITICS_THOMAS_HART_DESC:0 "An admiral during the inter-war period, Hart had built a reputation of personal bravery and the ability to manoeuvre among politicians stateside. Manoeuvring helped by his marriage of his daughter into the Wilson political family. Ultimately Hart decided to run in national elections as a Democrat, appealing to the impoverished voting base of his native Connecticut."
POLITICS_CHARLES_POLETTI_DESC:0 "Unlike some of his more privileged Republican counterparts at Harvard, Democrat Charles Poletti was not born into one of the leading WASP families of the Northeast. The son of Italian immigrants, Poletti attended college on a scholarship, waiting tables to pay for textbooks. Quickly moving up the ranks of the Democratic party, Polletti's rustic charm enamored him with working-class voters across the country. Now President, Poletti has an ambitious reform agenda of racial integration, expanding welfare, and an aggressive anti-syndicalist international stance. Whether his domestic reforms will earn the support of his more conservative counterparts remains to be seen, however."
POLITICS_NELSON_ROCKEFELLER_DESC:0 "While some pundits are saying the name 'Rockefeller' alone catapulted Nelson to the presidency, Rockefeller's ascendancy to the highest office in the land was no given. Ivy League-educated, and initially working mainly in the business world, the radicalism among other Republican candidates encouraged Nelson to run for the presidency as a check on his more extreme counterparts. Using his family network to seize control of the nomination, Rockefeller's progressive approaches to health-care, welfare, and the economy may be the key to helping unite a divided country."
POLITICS_HENRY_LODGE_JR_DESC:0 "Born into a prominent political dynasty with roots in both New Jersey and Massachusetts, it was no surprise that Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. decided to enter national politics. With a strong family network to rely on, he quickly built a strong power base among the powerful WASP families of the Northeast, catapulting him to the Republican nomination, and now the presidency. More moderate and diplomatic than other Republican candidates, it remains to be seen which direction he will take America in internationally..."
POLITICS_OWEN_BREWSTER_DESC:0 "Hailing from the quiet forests of Maine, Owen Brewster has emerged as a national leader in the anti-syndicalist movement. While initially supporting Huey Long and the AFP in the early 1930's, Long's rejection of the Klan, close allies of Brewster, led to him rejoin the Republican party. Brewster is infamous in Maine, and across the country, for his open courting of the Klan, who were influential in his early gubernatorial and Senate victories. Now President of a divided America, it remains to be seen whether he can reconcile his divisive past with a new view for the future..."
POLITICS_STYLES_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Formerly a teacher, Styles Bridges became the youngest governor in America when he emerged victorious in the 1932 New Hampshire gubernatorial election. Bridges then entered the Senate, earning a name as a ruthless anti-Syndicalist, not above using blackmail, treachery, and deceit to achieve his goals. In one of the most infamous incidents of the early 1930s, launched a major slander campaign in an attempt to label a leading SPA Senator as a 'rampant and notorious homosexual' and a 'traitor to the moral values of our nation'. This sensationalist attack earned him the enmity of Haywood and the SPA, but enamored him with those opposed to Syndicalism. Now President, Bridges can turn his attention to stopping Syndicalism around the globe."
POLITICS_HIRAM_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "Born in the mid-century in Sacremento, California, Hiram Johnson came from a political family. Hiram's father, Grove Johnson, was a disgraced state representative, his mother was heavily involved in the Daughters of the American Revolution. Hiram's early political career was boosted by this legacy, and he became a competent DA for San Francisco in 1902. Hiram's gubernatorial race in 1910 was funded by the liberal Republican group 'the Lincoln-Roosevelt League' Johnson's campaign ran in opposition to the Southern Pacific Railroad corporation, who sought to lobby within the Republicans against Hiram. As Governor, Hiram supported anti immigration bills, and paved the way for a later Congressional career. The Republican estabilshment in California was rocked in 1932, when Hiram threw in his support for Herbert Hoover. Hiram's personal distaste for the Eastern Establishment meant he stayed away from the political chaos of 1936."
POLITICS_GEORGE_NORRIS_DESC:0 "George W. Norris was the 11th son of poor Ohioan farmers, yet grew up to accomplish many great deeds, and eventually gain America’s Highest Office. After graduating university, Norris went into practicing law in Nebraska. While in Nebraska Norris became active in the local Republican Party and eventually ran for a seat in the U.S House of Representatives. While a representative, Norris stood with Roosevelt and championed many progressive causes. Eventually becoming a Senator, Norris held little faith to the Party over his ideals, and regularly attacked causes that his own party favoured if it went against his ideals. With America collapsing around him, Norris knew that Hoover could not fix the mess in America, and if America was to be saved, he had to do it without the Republicans. With that, Norris broke from the Republicans and joined with the Progressives, and despite all odds won the Presidency. Now, Norris will have the tremendous responsibility of holding America together and guiding her to a brighter future. "
POLITICS_IRENEE_DU_PONT:0 "Irénée du Pont, descended from the influential du Pont Family was primed for being an influential figure in the region of New England, yet the type of influence he would exert never became clear until America fell apart at the seems. From 1919 to 1925 he was the president of the Du Pont chemical company, he resigned his position after eight workers were poisoned, something to which he responded with "Only slight difficulties have been encountered". Du Pont eventually joined with the “Sentinels of the Republic”, a group that started as a lobbying form against government intervention and socialism yet transformed into a militant group influenced by Alfred Sloan’s ideas of unrestrained capitalism. When the Federalists gained control of New England, the Sentinels and the Remnants acted against the government, eventually storming congress and forming a new government, one headed by Du Pont. Now, Du Pont and his far-right allies’ rule New England superficially and with the help of their aligned militias, while the rest of the nation truly breathes free without a government to breathe down their necks."
POLITICS_LOTHROP_STODDARD_DESC:0 "Lothrop Stoddard began his life in Massachusetts, and from an early age, he displayed an exceptional intellect. When he was old enough, Stoddad attented Harvard University, earning the 'magna cum laude' distinction and working towards a Ph.D. in History. After he achieved this, he joined several historical and political organizations and began his work as an author, espousing eugenicist and racialist views to explain what he sees as the current decline of civilization. Despite his background in history and political science, Stoddard is a great admirer of biology. He believes it is the key to explaining the relationship between the different human races as well as being the causal factor in the United States's current woes. As such, his writings are characterized by both political and scientific views, mostly on the topics of race and genetic superiority. Stoddard's popularity as an author greatly aided his efforts in joining the political arena, and though he is seen as occupying the political fringe, his work is familiar in almost every home in New England. Now that he is in charge of the country, Stoddard has power he never expected to possess, and he plans to use it to save human civilization itself."
POLITICS_JAMES_CURLEY_DESC:0 "A disaster mitigated by moments of farce or a Northern Huey Long, depending on who you ask. James Michael Curley, Governor of Massachusetts is corrupt as the day is long. Curley served four terms as the Mayor of Boston (one of them while in prison) and was under constant investigation by the Boston Finance Commission. It didn't keep him from being elected governor in 1935. Probably because while he was lining his own pockets, he was also building schools, libraries, parks, roads, and enlarging Boston City Hospital. An Irishman, a Democrat, and a popular Governor, Curley wields significant influence in New England."
POLITICS_LOVECRAFT_DESC:0 "H.P. Lovecraft, born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, is perhaps one of the most mysterious and controversial figures of the 20th century. His father dying when he was 8, his mother dying of the Spanish Flu in late 1918, and Lovecraft suffering from a plethora of health issues his entire life have led Lovecraft into a search for truth and deep meaning, which he channeled into his writings. Tales of darkness and horror within resonated strongly with an America reeling from the 1925 market crash. Lovecraft's science fiction gained him a serious audience for his thoughts on politics and philosophy. He rapidly gained an almost cult-like status in his home state of Rhode Island and drew many followers, preaching a dark and otherworldly message about supernatural powers and eldritch beings that are incomprehensible to the human mind. As president of the New England Literary Society, Lovecraft standardized the use of the English language in print, removing what he called 'Americanisms'. When he traveled to England in 1924 to study the English language and attempt to purify it as much as possible, he witnessed the 1925 uprising and grew an acute hatred of Syndicalism. He returned to America in 1930, founded his own newspaper and ran unsuccessfully for governor of Rhode Island. He remained a prominent thought leader and a powerful influence on the minds of New Englanders, although his opponents accuse Lovecraft of being a dangerous man with authoritarian and occultist inclinations."
POLITICS_BAXTER_DESC:0 "Baxter was born into a wealthy family in Portland, Maine where his father James Phinney Baxter served six terms as mayor and had made his fortune in the canning industry. He earned a law degree from Harvard University in 1901. He was a freind to the Canadian government, and a popular governer of Maine, when King Edward VIII decided to put him in charge of the newly created New England Protectorate. He is to protect its people and ensure their loyalty to the crown."
POLITICS_CLARENCE_PICKETT_DESC:0 "In an era of worldwide strife, one may rely on their faith to find peace. No one exemplifies this more than Clarence Pickett. A born Quaker, and a charitable worker known for his support of the lower-classes, Pickett had been invited to the White House during the Hoover presidency to advise on dealing with the misfortunes of America's coal-mining communities. However, his influential steps did not end there; Pickett became known as an advocate for Christian pacifism, as he counseled his fellow faithful on their purpose in life during the First Weltkrieg. While his drive for an end to all war through peaceful resolve may be seen as wishful zealotry, it is certain Pickett is the saint the Quakers need to lead them, in these dark times."
POLITICS_CHARLES_CURTIS_DESC:0 "The Vice President of the Hoover administration, Curtis is the voice of compromise and reform in the American government. The first President of Native American ancestry, he serves as an effective rallying point for racial justice and brings an affable face and new commitment to American values of liberty and freedom for all men, although many wonder if he can settle the coming conflict."
POLITICS_JAMES_CURLEY_DESC:0 "A disaster mitigated by moments of farce or a Northern Huey Long, depending on who you ask. James Michael Curley, Governor of Massachusetts is corrupt as the day is long. Curley served four terms as the Mayor of Boston (one of them while in prison) and was under constant investigation by the Boston Finance Commission. It didn't keep him from being elected governor in 1935. Probably because while he was lining his own pockets, he was also building schools, libraries, parks, roads, and enlarging Boston City Hospital. An Irishman, a Democrat, and a popular Governor, Curley wields significant influence in New England."
POLITICS_PRINCE_ALBERT_DESC: "Prince Henry of Windsor, has been appointed Governor-General of New England. Though regarded as an extremely nervous child, Henry grew into an active and modest man. While New Englanders appreciate Henry's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that the post of Governor-General would be temporary, and that governance would restored to the discretion of the American people. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Henry is well liked. With the country still reeling from the outbreak of war in America, Henry toils diligently to ensure that New England is properly governed."
POLITICS_PRINCE_HENRY_DESC: "Prince Albert of Windsor, has been appointed Governor-General of New England. Though regarded as an extremely nervous child, Albert grew into an active and modest man. While New Englanders appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that the post of Governor-General would be temporary, and that governance would restored to the discretion of the American people. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With the country still reeling from the outbreak of war in America, Albert toils diligently to ensure that New England is properly governed."
POLITICS_KING_ALBERT_DESC:0 "Born in December of 1895, the young Prince Albert was not expected to be a king. Growing up in Britain, he was always in the shadow of his brother, Prince Edward. Albert I was always known as a timid and reserved man, until near the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, when he attended an academy in 1909 and became a sailor in 1913. Despite constant seasickness, he served in the Battle of Jutland aboard the HMS Collingwood, and later served as a squadron leader until being injured in November of 1918, remaining in Britain for the rest of the war.\n\nAfter the war, Albert continued to live in Britain until the revolution, fleeing to Canada. The Prince was relatively irrelevant up until Canada's occupation of New England, when he was appointed as the nation's new Governor General, and eventual King upon the creation of the Kingdom of New England. Although the king suffers from constant sickness, he is seen as a beacon of hope, as King Albert ensures that New England is governed fairly, even if some within the occupation authority support much harsher means to deal with the Yankee threat. For better or for worse, Albert I will help New England lead the charge into the Home Isles, and god willing, the rest of the King's most precious Dominion which has been tragically and unjustly lost: America."
POLITICS_WILBUR_CROSS_DESC:0 "Born in Mansfield, Connecticut in 1862 - Cross is renowned across the American literary scene for his talented work in analysing English literature. From academia, Cross competed for the position of governorship for the state of Connecticut of which he won successfully. With the outbreak of the civil war, Cross finds himself in a precarious position following the Canadian occupation of New England. One of the many Americans who petitioned the Canadian government to intervene, Cross's openness to embrace the Entente's arrival into America has led some to suspect that he is no more than a mere puppet of the former British Empire. While he is on paper the leader of a provisional government led by Ottawa, he is also the temporary interim leader of New England until a suitable President is chosen."
POLITICS_CHARLES_HURLEY_DESC:0 "Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on November 24th, 1893 - Charles Francis Hurley's early life was marked with tragedy as he lost both his parents at a young age. He was then raised by the family housekeeper, a former US District Attorney, before attending Boston College and becoming a salesman in athletic goods. Hurley then embarked on a career in local politics before ascending to the position of Massachusetts State Treasurer for three consecutive terms as a Democrat. The success of his political run convinced him of greater political aspirations, and he ran successfully for governor in the 1936 election. As the nation descended into chaos, the Irish-American governor sought to resolve tensions between Yankee Protestants and Irish-American Catholics. In the wake of the destructive 1938 New England Hurricane, Hurley oversaw the relief and rebuilding efforts for the city of Boston.\n\nNow the newly elected 33rd President of the United States finds himself in a much greater position, the defender of American democracy in the wake of radicals and reactionaries. Serving alongside Hurley is fellow Democrat Peter Gerry, a wealthy senator from the state of Rhode Island. Gerry was tutored and mentored by none other than Canadian politician William Lyon Mackenzie King in his youth."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC:0 "Born in New York City on November 15, 1891 - Averell Harriman, born as \"William\" Harriman, was raised in a life of wealth as his father was the railroad baron E.H. Harriman. During his academic career at Groton School and Yale University, Harriman made contacts that led to the large firm \"Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.\" During the 1930s, Harriman's properties grew to include the Union Pacific Railroad, the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, and the Polaroid Corporation. His immense wealth painted Harriman as an enemy in the eyes of the Syndicalists during the years leading up to the civil war. During the ensuing chaos, Harriman fled north for the Provisional Government of New England, where he joined the Committee of Canadian-American Relations and helped coordinate the joint war effort between New England and Canada. Through this position, Harriman gained the experience necessary to become the American ambassador to Canada - helping aid in the close relations between the two nations.\n\nReceiving the nomination of the Democratic Party and following his victory in the 1948 election, Harriman has become the 35th President of the United States of America. The new President has a lot of work cut out for him as the full signs of recovery are beginning to show, and the years of reconstruction are finally coming to an end. Serving alongside Harriman will be the former governor of New York state, Herbert H. Lehman. A supporter of the Second Square Deal during the provisional government era, Lehman has publicly stated his support for the guaranteed rights and wages of the working class."
POLITICS_CHESTER_BOWLES_DESC:0 "Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on April 5th, 1901 - Chester Bliss Bowles came from a Republican family who hated and feared big government. However, Bowles' political views were shaped by his aunt Ruth Standish Baldwin, a socialist and friend of Norman Thomas. After graduating from Yale University, Bowles became an advertising executive, although he was forced to flee from New York City due to the arrival of the civil war. Initially opposed to Canada's involvement in American politics, Bowles joined the America First Committee, although he voiced his support for New England after the provisional government entered the fray. After the civil war, Bowles led the Office of Economic Stabilisation, using his years in economics to help rebuild the nation's war-torn economy. In 1948, he became governor of Connecticut, defeating James C. Shannon signed the end of segregated national guard units and acts to improve mental health and housing.\n\nNow the 36th President of the United States, after securing the election of 1952, Bowles plans to lead a new America, one willing to help develop the world's weaker nations. Realising America's restored industrial and military might be better used to serve the world, Bowles will push for greater American world involvement to keep the peace. Paul Dever, the governor of Massachusetts and a former Lt. Commander in the Civil War, will be serving alongside Bowles. The youngest ever Attorney General of Massachusetts, Dever's governorship saw mental health reforms and efforts to resist domestic syndicalism."
POLITICS_BARROWS_DESC:0 "Born in Newport, Maine on June 7th, 1893 - Lewis Orin Barrows studied in local schools around Newport before attending the University of Maine with a degree in pharmacy. His political career began to take off after holding local positions in Newport such as serving as the treasurer and as an eventual state committeeman under the Republican Party. As the nation descended into chaos in 1936, Maine remained unscathed from much of the violence and Barrows made sure that Maine would remain free from radicalism under his leadership as Maine Secretary of State.\n\nWith the arrival of the second civil war among the states of the former United States of America, Barrows along with prominent New England politicians and governors were among those who appealed to Canada for protection. Representing what is left of the Republican Party, Barrows has been nominated to serve as an interim president in the hopes of securing the eventual restoration of American democracy. Serving alongside President Barrows is Vice President Henry Styles Bridges, the former governor of New Hampshire. A teacher and businessman, Styles Bridges was the youngest state governor of the time and now is eager to join Barrows' administration."
POLITICS_RAYMOND_BALDWIN_DESC:0 "Born in Rye, New York on August 31, 1893 - Raymond Earl Baldwin's home state became Connecticut after moving there at a young age and spending his college years at Yale. Baldwin participated in the Stratford Town Court as a prosecutor, eventually advancing to judge of the town court in 1931. As the country fell apart, the governor of Connecticut, Baldwin, was among those who petitioned the Canadian government to intervene due to the civil war. To ensure the safety of the people of New England, Baldwin supervised a complex array of civil defences and statewide services on the homefront which grew his popularity within the Republican Party. He certainly has his work cut out for him as the nation reels from the horror of the great war - only time will tell whether or not Baldwin's hand will lead to prosperity and peace in the future.\n\nServing alongside Baldwin, New Yorker Irving Ives, a man whose family dates back to the first settlers who settled in New England. Re-elected many times in the New York State Assembly, Ives publicly expressed his desire to end workplace discrimination based on race, creed, and colour. Together, both men have vowed to reunite and rebuild America once and for all under the leadership of the Republican Party."

As the war languished on, immigrants flooded New England, quickly and unexpectedly changing the face of the northeast. With these diverse, new interests came new problems: particularly, nativist resentment. These problems were only compounded by the economic recession that set in after the Kaiserreich began to isolate the United States of America. This discontent was championed by one of New England’s most famous personalities: the celebrity author, Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s meteoric rise to fame in recent years is based on his tales of weird and diabolical fiction, seen by both fans and critics as giving voice to the xenophobia, economic insecurity, and reactionary instincts of New Englanders. Initially the darling of Boston Brahmins and New England’s Anglo-Saxon majority, Lovecraft’s work spread like wildfire across the country, turning him into an overnight sensation. The Shadow Over Innsmouth, one of Lovecraft's most famous novellas, deals obliquely with the threats of state conspiracy and invasion, as well as miscegenation and its monstrous consequences. Some of his most ardent followers swear that prophetic, astrological portents can be understood through comprehensive study of his work. To many, Lovecraft may just be another insane writer with less than moderate views, to others he is a prophet that can guide New England to safety. But whatever Lovecraft may be, he is still a shy, reclusive writer, unlikely to take any drastic action. The only ones in New England that wish to see him in power are the extreme Anglophiles. They view Lovecraft as a tool to ensure complete loyalty to Canada. For now, Lovecraft and his small circle of writers stick to Providence and continue on with their lives, only accompanied by small groups of fans and loyalists.§! "

POLITICS_FRANK_BELKNAP_LONG_DESC:0 "A young veteran of the fiction scene and a dominant face in the pulp literary movement alongside his old friend Lovecraft, Frank Belknap Long has risen as the new herald of Lovecraftism. Born in 1901, Long was born in Harlem and became deeply interested in fictional literature while in grade school. Drawing inspiration from not only Lovecraft, but Jules Verne, Bierce, H.G Wells, and Poe as well, Long began writing before reaching high school. Long’s friendship with Lovecraft is longer than most relationships Lovecraft held, for after Long released his story ‘The Eye Above the Mantel’ in 1921, his writings caught the eye of Lovecraft, sparking a decades-old friendship that would see hundreds of correspondence letters exchanged the two as well as frequent trips to visit one another between their respective hubs in Providence and Manhattan. It was around this time that Long was also receiving higher education at NYU and then at Columbia University, until a severe bout of appendicitis nearly killed him, granting him a new view on life. He dropped out of school and began his own freelance sci-fi and pulp fiction writing career which would serve him well over the next few decades, and with Lovecraft supporting him along the way, Long rose to become one of New England’s most prominent fiction authors while also growing closer to our national father and his new political movement - a closeness that secured his position as Lovecraft’s successor. \n\nRefusing to take any of our beloved national father’s epithets or monikers - whether it be ‘Providence’ or the ‘King in Yellow’ or any other title - for such a brazen act of self-righteousness would only spit on the memory of the beloved Howard Philips Lovecraft, Long has instead taken the simple title of ‘Master.’ A move that both represents his authority and his reverence for our late founder while also providing a legitimized facade to our strange nation for all the world to witness, and hopefully acknowledge, Master Long has now set himself up as the logical and most orthodox successor to Lovecraft’s initial vision."
POLITICS_AUGUST_DERLETH_DESC:0 "Once just a small boy from Wisconsin, August William Derleth has risen to become one of the most powerful men in America. Born in 1909, Derleth grew up in Sauk City, writing his first fictional literature at age 13 after being inspired by our beloved Lovecraft, as well as the likes of Poe, Whitman, Dumas, Thoreau, and many others. Initially, his works were unpopular and rejected, but after ‘40 stories and three years’ of practice, Derleth found his niche writing for Weird Tales magazine. Later entering university to get a literary degree, Derleth graduated in 1930, and amid the backdrop of rising factionalism tensions across his home state, Derleth and his lifelong friend Mark Schorer left for New England to study at the Ivy League schools to further their literary careers. The pair rented out an old rustic cabin in rural Rhode Island while studying at Brown, and it is there that he first met Providence. Becoming fast friends, Derleth was brought in to aid Lovecraft in his literary journey and ideological metamorphosis, founding Arkham House publishing together to spread Lovecraft’s message to the world - a dream cut short with Lovecraft’s passing. \n\nNow, succeeding Providence - our Howard Philips Lovecraft - as the new King in Yellow, August Derleth stands as the most dominant and powerful figure in the nation. Taking on a title that was never meant to be formal or regal in any way, this second King in Yellow postures himself as the ‘true heir’ to Lovecraft's so-called eldritch ‘dynasty’ as he seeks to accentuate Lovecraftism’s more cosmic undertones while profiting off of H.L.P’s image and using said image to serve as the foundation for his new ‘moral’ and expanded interpretation of Lovecraft’s ideology."
POLITICS_WHITEHEAD_DESC:0 "An Episcopal minister, the former Archdeacon of the U.S Virgin Islands, a fantastical horror and sword-and-sorcery writer, and now the ‘Eldritch Apostle’ of the nation, Henry St. Clair Whitehead has lived a varied life, and now stands as Lovecraft’s true disciple and successor. Born in 1882 in New Jersey, Whitehead lived a relatively normal childhood in a Christian household, then attended Harvard, where he began his writing career as an editor for a Democratic newspaper, and graduated in 1904. After working as commissioner for the Amateur Athletic Union, Whitehead attended Berkeley Divinity School in Connecticut, being ordained in 1912 as an Episcopal deacon. He then served as a clergyman and rector at two different Connecticut churches before becoming a children’s pastor in NYC. All along this religious journey, Whitehead honed his skills at writing, and finally wound up in St. Croix - the largest of the U.S Virgin Islands - serving as the Archdeacon of the territory. Taking in island myth and occultist traditions, Whitehead fused these ideas into his writing, creating a terrifying literary fusion that captivated his readers - and more importantly, caught the eye of Providence. They continued their correspondence all during Whitehead's tenure as Archdeacon, with Lovecraft even helping many of Whitehead’s works get published in popular pulp magazines like Weird Tales. Returning to the mainland in 1930, Whitehead traveled to New England to escape rising tensions across the nation, and fell in with Lovecraft’s growing circle of influence. Nearly dying of a long-term gastric issue in 1932, Whitehead was able to survive thanks to support from Lovecraft and the best medical care New England - and Lovecraft’s coffer’s - could offer. This generosity sealed his undying loyalty to Lovecraft, with Whitehead beginning to conflate his piety in God and his reverence for his old friend and savior, lifting Lovecraft up as an almost divine figure. \n\nNow, with Providence passing into Elysia, Whitehead has risen as the Eldritch Apostle, seeking to fuse his Christian faith and his faith in Lovecraft into one syncretic idea. Believing Providence to be a physical manifestation of the Lord’s will, or perhaps a new messiah or god, Whitehead is poised to build a new faith for the nation while keeping his occultist influences and interest in Christian Science to heart - a faith that reveres our late King in Yellow as the God Whitehead truly believes He is."

Always the inventive and industrious people however, the Americans, not wishing to leave behind the ideals of the Revolutionary War and of the Founding Fathers, have fused the ideas of European-style monarchism with the patriotic and God-blessed creed of American-style republicanism and democracy that these lands once held so universally dear. With this syncretic fusion of government styles affirmed, a new elected monarchy has risen here in the birthplace of the United States. From the new nobility of the American people, a new King shall be chosen by his people to become the new champion and herald of the American Dream."

NEE_International_Recognition:0 "Seek International Recognition"
NEE_International_Recognition_desc:0 "Some may see our government as illegitimate, elites more concerned with profits than the welfare of our people and existing only because we have been propped up by the Canadians.

NEE_Public_Opinion_Support_desc:0 "Through films, song, art, and all the traditional means of propaganda, we will establish confidence in the provisional government's ability to both govern and do what's in the best interests of our American citizens."

NEE_Declare_Independence:0 "Demand Home Rule"
NEE_Declare_Independence_desc:0 "The New England provisional government was created by Canada, it's true, but we are established enough now that it's time we stood on our own feet. Unless the Canadian reason for intervention is not what they suggested, and they have more nefarious aims...?"

NEE_Battleline_of_Freedom:0 "Battleline of Freedom"
NEE_Battleline_of_Freedom_desc:0 "We are surrounded by history. From the battlefields of Lexington and Concord, where the first shots of the revolution were fired, to the hallowed halls of Boston. We must treasure and celebrate our past as the birthplace of American democracy.

NEE_friend_north:0 "Friend in the North"

NEE_armed_free_neutrality_desc:0 "Why should we shed our blood fighting other Americans, or fighting for Canada? We are New England: our own region. There is a saying that many of our people have taken as their own in recent times- "Don't Tread On Me"."

NEE_harbour_exiles:0 "Harboring Exiles"
NEE_harbour_exiles_desc:0 "There are people all over America who wish to flee the chaos to the south and west. We will welcome them with open arms. There are also some British exiles in Canada who wish to settle in our region, and we will accept them too. We shall be a land of immigrants, and this new blood will make our independence a certainty."

NEE_boston_line:0 "Boston Line"
NEE_boston_line_desc:0 "The last thing we want is for fighting to spill over into New England.

NEE_joint_coastal_defenses:0 "Joint Coastal Defenses"
NEE_joint_coastal_defenses_desc:0 "Our southern border is not the only area where we are threatened. Our coastline is wide open to any naval invasion or bombardment. Let us work with the Entente to conduct joint naval exercises and create defenses along our coast. Canada will also make an effort to fortify its nearby coasts, so that we cannot be invaded through those areas either. New England shall be a fortress."

NEE_back_french:0 "Back the French"

Combining forms of Socialist, Populist, and Grange ideals, Lermond seeks to rebuild New England into a true Socialist Utopia for all of our citizens, with large emphasis being placed on environmentalism, communalism, and unionism while also heavily drawing from the ideas of populist titans such as Edward Bellamy and William Jennings Bryan.

In this system, all New Englanders will be allowed to revel in the rewards of our economic and industrial development.

Following in his footsteps, Lermond has looked to Bellamy’s teachings in his pursuit of creating the ideal, just society, integrating Bellamy’s stances on wage slavery, property, division of labor, and many other topics, practically treating Bellamy’s ‘Equality’ as gospel.

This trampling of the very souls who nourish our people must end! President Lermond has announced a slew of sweeping subsidies and relief programs all aimed at uplifting our agricultural base up and out of poverty and destitution and into a position of living more fitting for these heroes of New England.

Drawing on ideas from Bertrand Russell, Clifford Hughes, and Edward Bellamy, President Norman Lermond and his fellow utopists have coalesced their ideas and critiques into a coherent plan to allot a monthly stipend to all adult citizens of New England. This minimum income would potentially guarantee that all of our citizens can at least afford the basic necessities of life each month, allowing them to use their profits earned at work for less critical things. This shall give all New Englanders a taste of the ‘good life’ that the capitalist lords of the past used to enjoy so exclusively; now all New Englanders may taste the sweet bliss of prosperity and wealth."

Creating ‘local unions’, or communes, across the nation, these communities will form the basis for our new social organization. Grouping locals together into these cooperatives, all would hold equal ownership and rights to everything within the commune, with cooperation being absolutely necessary and beneficial to all within the group. With Lermond’s personal local union, Utopia Park, serving as the model that the rest of the nation will follow, he has shown that even the President himself can live in such a way, shoulder to shoulder with his fellow New Englanders, further selling the idea to the skeptics of our nation."

Opposing them are the industrial Syndicalists led by Erwin ‘Harry’ Ault, who wish to undo Lermond’s severe agrarian slant, and Paul Goodman, who leads a group of young ‘Green’ Anarchists that seek to accelerate Lermond’s vision even further.

Before these dedicated loyalists can begin however, a leader shall be chosen amongst themselves, for their coalition to save Lermond’s dream from radicals now has no purpose with Ault and Goodman defeated.

NEE_the_new_synthesis_desc:0 "Professing a new, second Enlightenment far greater than the first, Goodman has begun to introduce his own unique views on philosophy, morality, liberty, true freedom, rationality, and more into the public mainstream. With this advocacy, he seeks to trigger a new mental and cultural revolution to sweep New England up in its riptide, bring in a new perception of reality and Socialism to our people. Standing as the herald of this ‘New Left’, Goodman shall revolutionize the very thought-processes of our people as we seek out to understand the unknown and unknowable."
NEE_totalist_humanism:0 "Yeomen Craftsmanship"
NEE_totalist_humanism_desc:0 "Craft unions and cooperatives shall be created across the nation, for we must respect the fine craftsmanship our expert laborers and their apprentices can create. These craft unions shall spread across all industries in New England, forming small cooperatives each aimed at a specific skill, service, product, or set of goods. Together, these modern Yeomen will create an inter-connected and self-sufficient network that will support this new green utopia in perpetuity."
NEE_hellstroms_hive:0 "Frontier Democracy"
NEE_hellstroms_hive_desc:0 "Communalist democracy modeled on the pure, Americanist system practiced on the frontier and by early colonists is the single most just and fair form of democracy possible. We must slowly replace our representative system and move away from Republicanism as we dive into true, pure, and free anarchist democracy. Only then will the voices of all be truly heard and obeyed."

NEE_break_monopolies_desc:0 "The local monopolies in the area, especially in oil and utilities, exerts too much influence over consumers and politics.

NEE_regional_utilites:0 "Regional Utilities"
NEE_regional_utilites_desc:0 "Utilities are a right all in our Republic should be entitled to.

NEE_st_lawrence_seaway:0 "Saint Lawrence Seaway"
NEE_st_lawrence_seaway_desc:0 "A longtime pet project of Vermont, the Saint Lawrence Seaway would make trade and naval movements far simpler by more easily allowing ships to move between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic using a series of Canals on the Canadian border, running through New England's Border.

NEE_crop_insurance:0 "Crop Insurance"
NEE_crop_insurance_desc:0 "Crop insurance ensures that even if a disease, weather event or even war destroy a farmer's crops, he will be compensated for it. Right now, such insurance is quite pricey due to only farmers being invested in it, but government subsidies, regulations and negotiations will drop the price and allow farmers to more easily replace failed crops or invest in other areas."
NEE_food_allotment:0 "Food Allotment"

NEE_mab:0 "Military Appropriations Bill"
NEE_mab_desc:0 "If we are going to strike the treacherous militias and governments occupying much of the United States we are going to need an appropriately large militia. An excise tax on liquor will fund an expansion."
NEE_demand_support:0 "Entente Ultimatum"
NEE_demand_support_desc:0 "While the Entente did provide New England some cover, its designs on indirectly dominating the area, and the US, can't be denied. We must give them an ultimatum, to support our government in our quest to retake the US or to lose a potential ally."
NEE_lincolnian_republic:0 "Lincolnian Republic"
NEE_lincolnian_republic_desc:0 "At long last we must support a state where all are equal! The remnants of the Klan must be cracked down and barriers to racial integration removed via a law banning firing individuals on the basis of their race. Likewise, education policy will officially endorse racial and religious tolerance. While hardliners will scream it will bolster our claims to being the true heirs of America to minorities."
NEE_fea:0 "Federal Education Administration"

NEE_education_spending:0 "Education Spending"
NEE_education_spending_desc:0 "A large part of why the United States failed was a lack of education as citizens embraced demagogues and crackpot ideas. Education funding will not only fight poverty but help stabilize New England and, God-willing, the United States for years to come."
NEE_entente_support:0 "Entente Support"
NEE_entente_support_desc:0 "We require support from the Entente if we are to survive from the forces in the West and South. We should diplomatically request more aid in return for a closer alliance with the only friends we have at the moment."
NEE_cultural_liberalism:0 "Cultural Liberalism"
NEE_cultural_liberalism_desc:0 "Many of the fanatics in the states seek not only political control, but cultural control.

NEE_fight_the_mob_desc:0 "The mafia still has a sadly strong presence in New York, with many having been pushed out of New York City.

NEE_take_on_machines:0 "Investigate the Machines"
NEE_take_on_machines_desc:0 "Sometimes politicians do not need to be paid off by mobsters to be corrupt but do so according to their own accord. The political machines are self-contained forms of political corruption, with James Curley and the Democrats ruling Boston like dictators despite their denial and claims it is not only good, but that we are simply attacking the opposition. They are wrong, for we only target corruption."

NEE_centrist_opinions_for_americans_desc:0 "Sadly, many Americans did not pay attention to American grievances when they were still reasonable and could have been met through political negotiation. Centrist Opinions for Americans will poll Americans opinions on a broad range of subjects and then alert the establishment as what they are so we can be better within their range, so long as their demands are reasonable."

#Machine Democrats
NEE_democratic_machine:0 "The Democratic Machine"

NEE_irish_ties:0 "Irish Ties"
NEE_irish_ties_desc:0 "It is no secret that New England houses a strong Irish heritage since the influx of immigrants, much of whom reliably vote Democratic. We should cultivate our ties to Ireland, a nation that can view us as equals and with ties to our citizens, rather than counting solely on Canada."
NEE_court_catholics:0 "Court Catholics"
NEE_court_catholics_desc:0 "Catholics make up a sizeable chunk of the New England voting population and have a strong presence in our party. Xenophobic outcries leaves many of them feeling ostracized so we will speak at Catholic Churches, appealing to their communities, bringing the Church into closer ties with the Democratic machine and promoting a renewed crackdown on local Klan members with potential ties to the CAR uprising."
NEE_expand_civil_service:0 "Expand the Civil Service"
NEE_expand_civil_service_desc:0 "While our government is fairly efficient compared to the old US government, an expansion of the civil service will nonetheless allow more efficiency, government jobs and an easier time issuing licenses, projects and regulations."
NEE_public_kickbacks:0 "Public Kickbacks"
NEE_public_kickbacks_desc:0 "With the civil service expanded we should try to aid those with the closest loyalties to the current government.

NEE_invest_in_the_wards:0 "Invest in the Wards"
NEE_invest_in_the_wards_desc:0 "The wards are often the most urban areas of our nation and are in constant need of new housing and infrastructure, and often are the most vital voters to win over.

NEE_union_ties:0 "Union Ties"
NEE_union_ties_desc:0 "Our ties to the non-syndicalist unions were essential to our victory but sadly not all such groups endorsed us. Providing contract work to loyal unions while improving our relations with them and other unions who can be flipped into the machines patronage system will provide the working man with wages and us with votes."
NEE_tacit_agreement:0 "A Tacit Agreement"
NEE_tacit_agreement_desc:0 "The mafia should not be celebrated for their actions, obviously, but they will always exist in some form and outright fighting them would hurt more than it helps. A tacit agreement should be made for them to keep bloodshed to a minimum and away from civilians (especially near election day) in return for tolerating 'victimless' crimes would give the common man much security."
NEE_powers_of_the_governor:0 "Powers of the Governor"
NEE_powers_of_the_governor_desc:0 "The problem with the old American constitution is that it bestowed too much power on a bickering Congress and not enough on the executive powers that actually allocate resources. The governors of each state will be empowered at the cost of Congress, alongside Mayors and, of course, the President, to give them more control over the public purse."
NEE_third_national_bank:0 "Third National Bank"
NEE_third_national_bank_desc:0 "America has had two national banks and in the case of the second it was dismantled for being too pro-banker. This was fair but times have changed and a national bank would go far in helping control economic instability and the financial system. As such the New England National Bank will be created at once."
NEE_immigrant_aid:0 "Immigrant Aid"
NEE_immigrant_aid_desc:0 "Sadly not all immigrants are treated well when they arrive in our fine nation. Immigrants however can make for fine voters and should be treated as such, so while immigrant rates can't be too high to appease our other voters those poor that do appear should receive brief welfare aid and an easier time finding a job via machine outreach."
NEE_raise_minimum_wage:0 "A Federal Minimum Wage"
NEE_raise_minimum_wage_desc:0 "A federal minimum wage will kill two birds with one stone by making it both more difficult for low-wage workers to undercut union wages while also providing them with higher wages of their own. As such it will help secure our support among the working class while undercutting syndicalism."
NEE_expand_the_machines:0 "Enlarge the Patronage Machine"
NEE_expand_the_machines_desc:0 "With the Democratic Party dominant on the federal level it is time to expand the patronage machine outside of traditional working-class Democratic strongholds by expanding machine politics to new urban regions and even to more rural farmers who can use the machine to gain needed benefits and subsidies as well as creating more middle-class functionaries in the party."

#Radicals

NEE_radical_victory_desc:0 "The syndicalists and loyalists have been pushed back and it's the Radical Coalition between the Freemen (AKA the Remnant) and the Sentinels of the Republic we have to thank for it! They have seized power but ideological differences between the two must be settled if we are to proceed."
NEE_the_remnant:0 "The Remnant"
NEE_the_remnant_desc:0 "The Remnant, a moniker given to the followers of Albert Jay Nock's interpretation of Jeffersonian values, have come out on top of the Constitutional Congress.

NEE_the_single_tax:0 "A Single Tax"
NEE_the_single_tax_desc:0 "The income tax, the excise tax, the estate tax, is their any end to what governments will take from hard-working citizens? There is only one tax that is just, the land value tax, for land is not created by anyone. Let us boot out the other taxes and enact the Vision of Henry George!"
NEE_nightwatchman_state:0 "Nightwatchman State"
NEE_nightwatchman_state_desc:0 "It is truly disgusting the extent governments attempt to control their citizens for the greater good while encouraging worse vices in the process. It's time to end the long list of arbitrary, moralizing laws against liquor, dancing, prostitution, drugs and other petty regulations for the good of liberty and to focus on fighting theft, fraud and aggression."
NEE_protect_liberty_from_democracy:0 "Defend Liberty from Democracy"
NEE_protect_liberty_from_democracy_desc:0 "We can not allow the populace to be cajoled into voting away their freedoms as so many other states have done! The Bill of Rights must see an expansion that covers economic freedoms related to property owning, trade and greater individual autonomy from government to prevent this, though some will call for us to go a step further."
NEE_decentralized_currency:0 "Decentralized Currency"
NEE_decentralized_currency_desc:0 "The centralization of currency under the federal government after the end of the Articles of Confederation lead to its logical conclusion in the tyrant Wilson created the Federal Reserve. No more! The States now have the right to create their own currency and trade amongst themselves while the Federal Dollar will merely be used to help maintain base necessities related to military and law enforcement, and placed on a stricter gold standard to keep it in check."
NEE_private_initative:0 "The Pursuit of Happiness"
NEE_private_initative_desc:0 "Government intervention in the economy has caused far more damage than good. Private initiative will pick up where government price distortions leave off, thus granting an opportunity for work and wealth to more private citizens. Likewise, the last remaining red tape shall be slashed, especially with regards to tariffs, arbitrary government standards and regulation of 'public' utilities."
NEE_end_public_schooling:0 "Nockian Education"
NEE_end_public_schooling_desc:0 "The public school system has been an abysmal failure, wasting children's time on pointless tasks and instilling them with federalist propaganda. Any schooling should be up each community that can focus on those with their needs or those with the greatest potential while higher education should be held to as high a standard as possible. No longer shall we finance public schooling."
NEE_jeffersonian_confederacy:0 "Jeffersonian Confederacy"
NEE_jeffersonian_confederacy_desc:0 "It is time to enshrine a real Constitution, one based on Jeffersonianism. The President will be a figurehead of the nation for times of war, Congress dealing with military defense and foreign policy and the vast majority of powers resting with the States, with the final federal economic laws overturned in the process and the state legislatures becoming more political empowered."
NEE_declaration_of_independence:0 "A Declaration of Independence"
NEE_declaration_of_independence_desc:0 "We did not fight off the socialists just to live under the Redcoats! We fought off the loyalists and we can the same to the English monarchy just as we did after 1776 if they are foolish enough to have not learned their lesson the first time and not accept the Second Declaration of Independence."

NEE_the_sentinels_of_the_republic_desc:0 "In a shocking turn of events to the nation the Sentinels of the Republic under Irénée du Pont are now at the helm of our nation! With most of them influenced by variants of Benjamin Tucker's Egoism they promise the destruction of what they view as the final obstacle to freedom, the state itself."
NEE_expand_the_organization:0 "Expand the Organization"
NEE_expand_the_organization_desc:0 "The Sentinels are the last defenders of real liberty in our republic, from threats both domestic and foreign! However, many uninformed citizens are still painfully unaware of this. We should spread the word as widely as possible through radio, pamphlets and even private relations for citizens to join the Sentinels and enjoy the benefits of doing so, especially those productive businessmen who should stand with us against statists."
NEE_private_defense_forces:0 "Private Defense Forces"
NEE_private_defense_forces_desc:0 "The state military system is a failure, being notable disloyal by accepting any government that takes power, a threat to liberty and soaking up absurd amounts of resources. Instead private defense contractors should take their place. While this will shrink the military it still leave the most qualified for fighting, and after corresponding tax cuts the Sentinel Organization will keep in the employ as many military men as it can afford, choosing quality over quantity. Those who desire protection can either pay us or go to another."
NEE_beyond_privatization:0 "Beyond Privatization"
NEE_beyond_privatization_desc:0 "We are not merely going to put an end to tariffs and public utilities as the Freemen propose. No, we will go a step further than that. Yes, the roads and current public goods will be privatized, but alongside them virtually all laws related to economic regulation will be struck down. It is time for the Invisible Hand to take precedence."
NEE_dissolving_the_state:0 "Dissolving the State"
NEE_dissolving_the_state_desc:0 "It is time. The court system, the remnants of public defense, the public police, taxes and the last regulations will be done away with, both at the Federal and state level. The largest monopoly in the land will finally be dismantled and instead man will finally be able to act out his will under true liberty."
NEE_might_makes_right:0 "Right of Might"
NEE_might_makes_right_desc:0 "The Sentinels must protect the new status quo at all costs! Of course, man has a right to either lose or take that land which can not be defended so let us defend it well. The Sentinels will take over lands bordering us that refuse to pay the appropriate protection fees and use it to further fund private defenses against foreign enemies."
NEE_crush_statists:0 "Crush Statists"
NEE_crush_statists_desc:0 "The enemies of liberty have not left us simply because the state is gone. No, our enemies amongst in the Democratic wards, 'liberal' Businessmen, Socialistic Unions and English loyalists are still amongst us. A campaign by the largest military force in the territory, the Sentinels, to strike their organizations and seize their assets, will be a boon to liberty."
NEE_right_of_contract:0 "Right of Contract"
NEE_right_of_contract_desc:0 "While the right to take by force is always on the table, it can be quite costly compared to signing a contract. The Right of Contract is an informal right that allows both ourselves and the people of the New England to settle their differences via signed agreement. While we obviously can not put this into law we can set an example by spreading and honoring our business deals as widely as possible."
NEE_a_fee_for_our_aid:0 "A Fee for our Aid"
NEE_a_fee_for_our_aid_desc:0 "The Canadians insist that we act as a bulwark against syndicalism. While the Syndicalists are considered a great evil we should not simply do their bidding for free. If they and others who are opposed to syndicalism want our aid they should pay for the privilege."
NEE_hostile_takeover:0 "Hostile Takeover"
NEE_hostile_takeover_desc:0 "Some wealthy families, notably the Astors, refuse to join the Sentinels or respect us. They believe Canada or their family guards give them the right to ignore us. If they will put forward their resources to defend the new liberty then we will take over their assets and put it to better use. May the better man win."
NEE_expanded_labor_pool:0 "New Labor Pools"
NEE_expanded_labor_pool_desc:0 "Too many citizens behave as if the old standards are still in place with regards to labor agreements. But with labor freed of government standards all who desire to work can, including most importantly the very young whom have a right to our labor contracts as soon as they are old enough to understand them and sign. We will set a fine example by providing work for these little ones."
NEE_lothrop_stoddard:0 "The Nordic League"
NEE_lothrop_stoddard_desc:0 "In a shocking turn of events, Lothrop Stoddard and his eugenicist Nordic Party have come to power in New England. Supporting a platform of racial segregation and eventually purification, they will work to ensure the very survival of civilization!"
NEE_block_foreign_hordes:0 "Block Foreign Hordes"
NEE_block_foreign_hordes_desc:0 "According to Stoddard, our peril is clear: the other races are reproducing at a worrying rate, far faster than that of the Nordics. There is little we can do about this state of affairs, given our own measly power, but we do control our own territory. We must bar these 'inferior' elements, and turn them away. Should we include our own countrymen, however?" 
NEE_racial_catalogues:0 "Racial Catalogues"
NEE_racial_catalogues_desc:0 "It is time for a different type of census. We will endeavor to create new racial classifications, established along the lines of Stoddard's previous works, that will divide our society from now on. This will allow for greater ease in purifying our nation at a later date. We also must decide the place of each of these groups, once we have decided how to categorize them."
NEE_embrace_science:0 "Embrace Science"
NEE_embrace_science_desc:0 "For too long, society has been ruled by passion, prejudice, and unreason. We must eliminate these illogical ideas and work towards the betterment of society through the promotion of science. In particular, we must advance the fields of Medicine, Psychology, and most of all, Biology. Through this effort, we can improve our methods of Eugenics, so that we may better our civilization."
NEE_help_the_kkk:0 "Help the Klan"
NEE_help_the_kkk_desc:0 "The Constitutional American Republic has been the main front for the Ku Klux Klan in the American Civil War. However, Stoddard believes the Klan could use some assistance from his own territory, not to mention their potential benefits for New England, and we should decide how we wish to aid them. They will surely be happy to return the favor..."
NEE_american_birth_control_league:0 "American Birth Control League"
NEE_american_birth_control_league_desc:0 "The A.B.C.L. is an institution that gives women the opportunity to control whether or not they have children, and such an organization is just what Lothrop Stoddard needs. We must make sure that only worthy mothers have children, and one child raised in a prosperous family will always be preferable to three children raised in poverty. Let us embrace this organization on a national level." 
NEE_neo_aristocracy:0 "The Neo-Aristocracy"
NEE_neo_aristocracy_desc:0 "New advances in the field of science have exposed democracy for the sham it is. Now, that institution is even more challenged than it was after the Weltkrieg, and meanwhile, aristocracy has been validated as the logical form of government. However, this does not mean arbitrary inequality-rather, Stoddard has proclaimed we shall have natural rule by a class of superior men and women, and those with the talent to rise will have the ability to do so."
NEE_southern_purity:0 "Southern Purity"
NEE_southern_purity_desc:0 "The South is one of the few regions left in which the old American stock continues to grow. We should emulate the South and promote a pure Anglo-Saxon populace, with some immigration from Northern and Western Europe to help bolster our numbers."
NEE_sterilize_the_masses:0 "Sterilize the Degenerate Masses"
NEE_sterilize_the_masses_desc:0 "Stoddard has proclaimed that the process of purification must be a gradual one, but the first step will be to sterilize the worst 'degenerates' in the population-the unadaptable, the 'inferior', and the 'disabled'. These elements will be segregated, miscegenation of any sort shall be banned, and we will use the advances in birth control technology when necessary, all in the pursuit of purification." 
NEE_positive_eugenics:0 "Positive Eugenics"
NEE_positive_eugenics_desc:0 "Eugenics is not all about limiting populations; in fact, "Positive" eugenics shall entail the multiplication of 'superior classes'. We must encourage reproduction among these groups with the same enthusiasm we take towards the sterilization of the 'inferior classes', for one cannot work without the other, and through our efforts, we will create a new progressive civilization!"
NEE_stomp_the_undermen:0 "Stomp the 'Undermen'"
NEE_stomp_the_undermen_desc:0 "The phenomenon known as "Syndicalism" is not new in any sense of the word. In fact, it is only a continuation of the historical revolt of the Under-Man. The Under-Man is he who denies the advances of science, he who resents natural superiority and acts to overthrow the natural order. These men have taken power in France and Britain, but we shall not allow them to prevail here! We must do everything in our power to crush these elements, for they are the enemy of civilization itself!"
NEE_war_against_chaos:0 "War Against Chaos"
NEE_war_against_chaos_desc:0 "We face a titanic struggle today. It is the struggle between the civilized world and those who would see us return to more primitive times. These Under-Men, unable to accept the loss of the moral or scientific high-ground, have increasingly resorted to force to get their way, and this is intolerable. We must take intelligent action against these degenerates by spreading the truth about the threat they pose."
NEE_hereditary_intellect:0 "Hereditary Intellect"
NEE_hereditary_intellect_desc:0 "Just as many forms of insanity have been proven to be hereditary, so too is intellect. If we allow the environment to take precedence over inherited capacity, we will be fostering a decline in our civilization! No, we must promote the idea of intellect through heredity, an idea first gifted to us by the Greeks and now proven by science. After all, you cannot make greatness out of mediocrity..."
NEE_selective_subsidies:0 "Selective Subsidies"
NEE_selective_subsidies_desc:0 "Birth rates in our Nordic elements have stagnated as of late. Though this may not be such a problem in an ideal society, it is a problem when the 'inferior classes' reproduce so rapidly. By granting subsidies to the groups we want to reproduce and rewarding them for doing so, we can further the cause of Positive eugenics."
NEE_progressive_civilization:0 "Progressive Civilization"
NEE_progressive_civilization_desc:0 "We have taken the first steps towards a truly progressive civilization! It may be decades or even centuries before our true vision is reached, but we have begun the important work of separating the 'inferior' from the 'superior', encouraging the multiplication of superior persons, and vanquishing the rebellious Under-Man, who has afflicted civilization since its very inception. Towards a shining future for our country!"
NEE_natural_inequality:0 "Natural Inequality"
NEE_natural_inequality_desc:0 "The flaws in democracy and aristocracy were their promotion of "natural equality" and "artificial inequality" respectively. Instead, we will promote a society in which merit determines your place, merit that is given to a person before they are ever born, determined by heredity. The superior man shall rise regardless of his place at birth, and the mediocre and degenerate classes will have their place as well until such a time as they are eliminated."

As for these republicans -- how can one regard seriously a frightened, greedy, nostalgic huddle of tradesmen and lucky idlers who shut their eyes to history and science, steel their emotions against decent human sympathy, cling to sordid and provincial ideals exalting sheer acquisitiveness and condoning artificial hardship for the non-materially-shrewd, dwell smugly and sentimentally in a distorted dream-cosmos of outmoded phrases and principles and attitudes based on the bygone agricultural-handicraft world, and revel in, consciously or unconsciously, mendacious assumptions such as the notion that real liberty is synonymous with the single detail of unrestricted economic license or that a rational planning of resource-distribution would contravene some vague and mystical 'American heritage'... utterly contrary to fact and without the slightest foundation in human experience?

Many falsely equate our movement to revive the Anglo spirit of America to the religious fundamentalist or occult mystics that have taken root in the darkest corners of our nation.

Delta Green agents slip through the system, manipulating the federal bureaucracy while pushing the darkness back for another day — but often at a shattering personal cost. What needs to get done? For a start, books need to be burned, artifacts smashed into powder, and men need to be silenced. Most of all, the future must never be allowed to become the present."

The current religious and mystical order in the Americas reveals not life lessons and guidance but miserable platitudes that ultimately leaves the soul unsatisfied. The Judeo-Christian God as we know it offers us no answers. Providence, anointed by the one true God, has seen the dark universe yawning. Where the black planets roll without aim. Where they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge or lustre, or name. By studying his mythos and anthropomorphizing his characters into a form of occult study, we can perhaps clean a small sliver of his endless dark wisdom."

Even though Providence knows that he crafts works of fiction, and that these cults are comprised of insane lunatics; he cannot deny their devotion to him.

Bury’d now are the hatreds of subject and King, And the strife that once sunder’d an Empire hath vanish’d. With the fame of the Saxon the heavens shall ring As the vultures of darkness are baffled and banish’d; And the broad British sea, Of her enemies free, Shall in tribute bow gladly, Columbia to thee: For the friends of the Right, in the field side by side, Form a fabric of Freedom no hand can divide!"

However, as of now Lovecraft is not but a puppet for the Anglophiles that run our nation. The Loyal Coalition was born out of fear and hatred of the unknown, and indeed resonated with Lovecraft and New England’s WASP majority. However, it is time to do away with them.

NEE_nationalize_electric_boat_desc:0"One key part of Lovecraft’s Aristocratic Corporatist economic policy is that of nationalizing major companies for the good of the state. One such major company that is to be nationalized is the Electric Boat ship company, so they can produce powerful vessels for our nation. This is another part of Lovecraft’s broad effort to focus on the Seas and construct a powerful navy for New England. This is a hopeful start to some of the more ambitious projects that the nation is embarking on. "

To that end, Providence looks not to the corrupted lands of foreign hordes that lie beyond our bounds, but instead to the vast and infinite expanses of the cosmos, which hertho lie unexplored by man and mankind. We know where the future is, beyond our land and beyond the stars; we shall conquer this final frontier if its the last thing we as a species do. With this in mind, Providence’s most loyal minds have begun work on project “Shadow over Innsmouth”, furthering Lovecraft’s ‘Miracle Weapon’ program and working towards creating rocketry technology that will propel the human race to heights not yet seen, nor imagined by such dull and foolish minds. To the cosmos, we will conquer!"

New England, in all its endless beauty shall not just be one of the proud races that hold the power to destroy the world in its hands; nay, it shall be the first! Providence in his boundless wisdom and grace has ordered New England’s scientists to begin toiling to create the world’s first ‘Atom Bomb’ and has christened this new and noble endeavor: Project “Dunwich Horror”"

Lovecraft warns against the horrors which lay beyond the deep, and has ordered measures to be taken to defend ourselves against them, whenever they may rise and show their face. As the ships are christened and the walls tower high above the seaboard, our nation sends a message to the ones that lurk beyond the wave: The line between man and monster has been drawn, this far, no further!

Eager to follow Lovecraft's teachings and philosophy of life and thought, he claims to be a political 'Lovecraftist', a term he intends to define to ensure that these principles are followed to the letter by future generations.

NEE_sell_lovecraft_books:0 "Make His Work Known to the World"
NEE_sell_lovecraft_books_desc:0 "Despite the quality of Lovecraft's works, they are unfortunately not very widespread outside America. Derleth wants the whole world to know about the Mythos!

NEE_lovecraft_sucessor:0 "Lovecraft's Successor"
NEE_lovecraft_sucessor_desc:0 "The ascension to power of Derleth would have seen a period of intellectual and societal stagnation and that of the madman Whitehead would have led to a decadence of morals. Frank B. Long is the perfect man to succeed Lovecraft. Intelligent and hard-working, Long intends to put Lovecraft's philosophy in its proper place by creating an intellectual society just as Lovecraft would have wanted."
NEE_sci_fi:0 "Develop Science Fiction"
NEE_sci_fi_desc:0 "Long is a great lover of Lovecraftian science fiction, having written numerous works in the genre. For him, science fiction is inseparable from Lovecraftian work and is its noblest form. Science fiction, beyond a literary genre, is also a way to imagine and represent the future, so Long has decided to invest a lot of money in research and development in order to develop new technology that will perhaps one day make Long's dreams come true."
NEE_lovecraftism:0 "Defining Lovecraftism"
NEE_lovecraftism_desc:0 "Lovecraftism is a complex term that means many things to Long, but many intellectuals and members of our people still don't really know what it means.

NEE_true_ideology:0 "A True Ideology"
NEE_true_ideology_desc:0 "In addition to being a philosophical and literary movement, Lovecraft's thought also constitutes a political ideology being referred to as 'Lovecraftism' by Long. However, even though his definition makes sense to Long, some people are confused about what Lovecraftism really is, which is why Long has written and is about to publish 'The Lovecraftism Manifesto' where Lovecraft's ideology is explained in detail."

NEE_lovecraft_disciple_desc:0 "Whitehead is much more than a new head of state for our nation, he is also a convinced Lovecraftian and above all faithful to the thought of his mentor. Derleth thought only of his own profit while Long only saw Lovecraft's thought from a literary point of view, Whitehead is indeed the one and only legitimate successor worthy of the King in Yellow!"
NEE_reconcile_christian:0 "Reconcile with Loyal Christians"
NEE_reconcile_christian_desc:0 "Christians have been oppressed by Lovecraft for a long time, therefore some find that building a new Christianity is contrary to Lovecraft's thinking, one could say that they are right but they are in fact completely wrong. Lovecraft oppressed the Christian population because they didn't understand that he was a heaven sent! Now that the genius of Whitehead has deciphered this message, we can fearlessly welcome all the faithful who recognize the prophet Lovecraft."
NEE_study_supernatural:0 "Study the Supernatural"
NEE_study_supernatural_desc:0 "Conventional science has certainly been useful in the past, but now that Whitehead is in power, a new form of science, purely Lovecraftian, must be developed to replace the classical one.

NEE_lovecraftian_church_desc:0 "The conventional church, whether Catholic, Protestant or otherwise, may have been for a time the holder of the truth, but while Lovecraft preached among men, the Pharisees regarded him as a fool and a heretic. However, Whitehead saw the truth, he saw the message of God hidden in Lovecraft's sinister words, we cannot rely on false churches, Whitehead proclaimed the creation of a new true church inspired by the words of our master."
NEE_prophet_of_God:0 "The Prophet of God"
NEE_prophet_of_God_desc:0 "Howard Phillips Lovecraft is much more than a writer, much more than a politician, much more than a thinker. He is a true prophet sent by the Lord to enlighten men with his words. Lovecraft's thoughts are not only philosophical, they are addressed to the sons of God and constitute a world of employment to be followed in everyday life. We will make Lovecraft one of the central figures of our church along with Jesus Christ and God."

NEE_honor_providence_desc:0 "Lovecraft is undoubtedly one of the most important and great American men of the 19th century, and when his death was announced a great sadness gripped the nation, both among our people and among Lovecraft's disciples. We will continue to follow his teachings in the future, and one of the first steps in honoring Providence will be the organization of a grand funeral where everyone can pay tribute to him."

NEE_test_fails:0 "The Test Fails, but Lovecraft Lives!"
NEE_test_fails_desc:0 "Lovecraft tested our nation, and we failed! However, we shall never fail Providence ever again, for He himself has come to save us once more. Inspired by his time abroad, current world tensions and political currents in America, past friends, and his own morality and cosmic obsession, Providence will bring what is truly needed to our nation and our people. His Eyes Hath Seen The Red Glory! Praise be Providence, for Lovecraft Lived, Lovecraft Lives, and Lovecraft will Live!"
NEE_no_marx:0 "No Marx, No Syndicalism, No Revolution"
NEE_no_marx_desc:0 "Despite Lovecraft's slide to the Left", dragging along with it this vague and growing idea of Leftist Lovecraftism, He has made it perfectly clear where his stances lie. Denouncing Marxism, defaming Syndicalism, and spitting on any idea of violent Revolution, a new breed of Socialism has been born to save the state. This new wave of Socialist thought is lightly influenced by the works of Edward Bellamy and Henry David Thoreau, as well as by the writings and theories of Providence’s old friends and correspondents Fiorello La Guardia and the late FDR, all tightly wound by Lovecraft’s own brand of cosmic cultural thoughts. Providence is determined to bring this unique brand of syncretic Socialism to these lands in order to truly save the masses."
NEE_fasci:0 "Adapt the Brilliance of the Fasci Siciliani"
NEE_fasci_desc:0 "Though short-sighted Christians and naive Democrats, the Fasci Siciliani of Sicily have proven to have the right idea on many aspects of Socialism, sharing the term 'Social Fascists' with Lovecraft as a self-identifier. By taking some of their best and more forward-thinking ideas, such as their dedication to ecological consciousness, Agrarian communalism, Feminism, uplifting the Poor, the formation of civilian volunteer militias, and the eradication of class exploitation, to name a few, shall all be emulated and adapted to fit our American realities. We shall ignore and leave out their dogmatic devotion to Christ, caustic Nationalism, Democratic principles, and other unfitting aspects of their otherwise brilliant ideology, all under Providence!"
NEE_asthec_rev:0 "The Aesthetic Socialist Reformation"
NEE_asthec_rev_desc:0 "Drawing on his former ideas of creating cultural hierarchies ranked based on how aesthetic each unique culture was along with our new cultural cosmic fusion and Leftist ideas, Lovecraft has endeavored to reform all of society,, and perhaps all societies, under Leftist principles for the good of all and paired with an aesthetically perfect culture formed as an egalitarian synthesis of all constituent members of the People. With a perfect Socialist society introduced without a drop of blood spilled paired with perfect and unified culture sure to equally include all within our realm, we all shall prosper under Providence. Onwards, towards the Reformation!"
NEE_techonocracy_lovecraft:0 "Replace Aristocracy with Technocracy"
NEE_techonocracy_lovecraft_desc:0 "Lovecraft once believed the Aristocracy and Elite of the United States, and better yet the Aristocracy and Elite his regime created, would be enough to safeguard Americanism and prosperity for all within our borders. However, he now knows he was wrong, but like any genius, he has adapted. Inspired by American faces of the Technocracy ideological wave such as Howard Scott, William Henry Smyth, and Harold Loeb, as well as by older faces such as the French philosopher Henri de Saint-Simon, Lovecraft will create a ‘Socialist oligarchy of intellectuals, of the intelligent and the educated.’ This new body shall aid him in the general runnings of the government, planned economy, and other aspects of the national apparatus."
NEE_progres_paradise:0 "Paradise in Progress Under Providence"
NEE_progres_paradise_desc:0 "The Great Depression, as well as Black Monday, the American Civil War, the failures of the former New Englander regime, and Lovecraft’s own internal demons have all played their hand in nearly destroying this glorious nation. Utopian paradise under Providence and His unique brand of Socialism is possible, but we must learn from our mistakes in order to achieve this dream. To begin, let us kickstart the economic reawakening of our paradise-in-progress."
NEE_left_populism:0 "Accelerate Left Reformism to its Max"
NEE_left_populism_desc:0 "There can be no brakes as we propel to the perfect society. Total equality and paradise are hard to truly achieve, and we cannot compromise in our Reformationary action. Others before us have used violence to achieve this, or Revolution, but that is not the way Providence has shown us, while others have tried to go the route of peaceful reform, but that did not go far enough. This mistake won’t be repeated, and Lovecraft will guide the way."
NEE_pure_deal:0 "A 'Pure Deal' Without Limits"
NEE_pure_deal_desc:0 "An adapted ‘New Deal’ purified for peak progress and unburdened by the obstacles of Democratic Republicanism, Providence will bring socioeconomic salvation and egalitarian prosperity to all in the state. Ideas such as Nationalized Distributism of resources and assets, fewer working hours, higher wages, safer working conditions, pensions, unemployment insurance, non-Syndicalist unions, Bellamyite and Thoreauian communalism, La Guardian Progressivism, and more shall come to every man and woman in our paradise as we work towards the utopian ideal."

NEE_lovecraft_uptopia_desc:0 "Though still imperfect, the seeds of a worker’s utopia have been planted by Lovecraft, and they have now begun to sprout and grow under the light of Providence.

All are equal, and all will soon be able to enjoy the perfect fruit of Lovecraft’s labors as they shelter themselves in the shade of the blossoms of the seeds He sowed."

NEE_turn_away_from_anglo_desc:0 "After traveling to distant and multi-cultural hubs of Socialist activity, such as Quebec, Haiti, Harlem, and more, both during his tenure as leader and during his absence, Lovecraft began to reject his form Eurocentric, Anglophilic, and culturally-biased racially-charged paranoia, especially after seeing his beloved Anglos lose their entire empire to a system apparently more prepared to do what is necessary to save humanity from the unknown. Metamorphosing anew like a mutating fish-man or a Deep One gaining new insight, Providence has ordered a halt to all racial violence still possible ongoing in the nation, especially against the local Blacks and Irish, while completely abolishing any and all old racial bills the nation passed. Now, by his will, demand, and authority, the rest of the nation shall follow suit."
NEE_culure_over_race:0 "Culture Over Race"
NEE_culure_over_race_desc:0 "Concepts of race and racial hierarchies are dated, based on debunked pseudoscientific nonsense. Lovecraft knows the true science, and he shall show it to the world. All cultures hail from the same mother culture, born from cosmic and otherworldly divinations revealed to humanity at the dawn of our existence. As such, all cultures must once again synthesize back towards this mother culture, creating one cohesive and inclusive culture for all without the obstacles of race. To enforce this, all citizens of our nation, no matter their background, shall be made completely and totally equal before the law, and their individual cultures shall be maintained, promoted, and uplifted as it is brought within the larger whole. Race shall no longer be a divider, and culture, even when different, shall bind all of mankind together as one equal whole."
NEE_prov_comsicism:0 "Providential Cosmicism"
NEE_prov_comsicism_desc:0 "Loosely inspired by Russian Cosmicist writers and Proletkultists, though he would never admit it now, along with his American contemporaries, Lovecraft has long held cosmic beliefs and ideas, though has strayed away from religion since his childhood. While this has famously fueled his writing career, it has also fueled his own beliefs and ideology. Our new universal culture will include Cosmicist ideas, Lovecraftian influences, an atheist and secular framework supported by patriotism, and the dream of reaching the cosmos or obtaining its power through whatever means Providence can divine."
NEE_universal_lovecraft:0 "The Universal Lovecraftian Identity"
NEE_universal_lovecraft_desc:0 "Pulling his new cultural ideas together, Providence has proclaimed that all of humanity must unite under his universal syncretic identity in order to better all of mankind, to bring egalitarian prosperity to all, and to prepare the People for the dark road ahead as we prepare to face the unknowable horrors of the beyond. Far from cultural assimilation - a practice he has grown to hate - this idea seeks to have all cultural groups and identities emphasized and upheld, with the best aspects of each pulled together to form a greater whole. We must all come together as New Englanders, as Americans, as all of Humanity in order to face the dawn that rises for Providence’s paradise."
NEE_face_obvilion:0 "Face Oblivion and Decide"
NEE_face_obvilion_desc:0 "Face oblivion and despair, or shall we? As he grew older and more ill, and after witnessing the horrors mankind wrought upon itself in the Great War, Lovecraft flirted with the ideas of philosophical pessimism, anti-idealism, and other topics written by Mencken, Sartre, Nietzsche, and more. Though inspiring, it also dragged Providence into a dark hole mentally, and he has oftentimes contemplated ending his endless struggle and burden. However, perhaps there is light at the end of the tunnel. Only Lovecraft himself can achieve his monumental goal, but the choice is up to him."

With the people of New England increasingly shedding their American identities for their new regional ones, all of their misguided hopes for reunification with the rest of America are increasingly consigned to history as well.

NEE_appoint_chaffee:0 "Father Chaffee"
NEE_appoint_chaffee_desc:0 "Adna R. Chaffee has been an avid horseman his whole life. Now, however, he urges us to embrace the future. Chaffee is specifically concerned with tanks.

NEE_mechanical_cavalry:0 "Mechanical Cavalry"
NEE_mechanical_cavalry_desc:0 "Real wars are fought by real men, not solely by tanks. However, we can still use technology to serve these men.

NEE_coordination_principal:0 "The Coordination Principle"
NEE_coordination_principal_desc:0 "As the foremost power in the world, Germany's military should be something to emulate.

This will greatly aid our inter-branch cooperation and experience."
NEE_experimental_organization:0 "Experimental Divisions"
NEE_experimental_organization_desc:0 "Father Chaffee has relentlessly pressed us to not only modernize our vehicles, but to experiment with new ones.

NEE_merit_promotion_desc:0 "An effective military should always issue promotions based on merit, not bloodline.

NEE_mechanical_drawing:0 "Westpoint Engineering"
NEE_mechanical_drawing_desc:0 "Westpoint is one of the greatest military institutions in the world, but officers are not the only graduates.

NEE_firepower_purchase:0 "Heavy Equipment Purchase"
NEE_firepower_purchase_desc:0 "We will purchase tanks, artillery, motorized vehicles, and other equipment such as bullets to make sure our men are never out of ammo.

NEE_consistant_conscription:0 "Consistent Conscription"
NEE_consistant_conscription_desc:0 "Green's bill has passed, and we are now conscripting our young men to build a larger army than ever before. None of our rivals will outnumber us.

NEE_yankee_nationalism_desc:0 "We are Yankees, and we are proud of it. Reactionaries to the south use this term in a derogatory meaning, but to New Englanders, it is part of our identity. Though we now fight with our old rulers, we will never forget we became in the meantime."
NEE_farmer_soldiers:0 "Farmers into Soldiers"
NEE_farmer_soldiers_desc:0 "Farmers should not be exempt from the draft. They are some of our strongest citizens, and could serve us well in the military.

NEE_silver_military_lease:0 "Silver Lease"

Having spent the majority of the latter half of 1936 preparing the ground work for a provisional government, New Englander leaders hold that granting power to their provisional government to be a no brainer. Reminding our ministers that the empowerment of their provisional government was one of the provisions of the Derby Line Protocol, they have confirmed the need for further Entente protection, all but ensuring that New England would remain an Entente protectorate. Some members of the government, however, have suggested it would be better if we push forward this provisional government, but co-opt it. This faction suggests the creation of a new Dominion , under the watchful eye of a Governor-General. This, they claim, will give the New Englanders the autonomy they crave, while allowing us to keep a close eye on the region. Others in the government however are adamant that we simply maintain our occupation and administrated the territory ourselves. Americans, they say, are of suspect loyalty - grateful or not, their goals may not mirror our own. With a preexisting foundation for a new state already existing, we can simply use this machinery to better keep New England under our thumb. In any case, New England's leadership and citizenry are chomping at the bit to learn their fate, and we are not ones to keep people waiting."

Groups of volunteer citizens from both Canada and New England have been hard at work constructing a series of coastal batteries and naval fortifications from Massachusetts' Cape Cod up to Nova Scotia's Cape Breton. While the project is still underway and only the first part of a grander defence scheme laid out its a good step in ensuring that no hostile power shall threaten our nearest waters for the foreseeable future."

newengland.40.d:0 "What was first considered a non-issue, the Yankee Clipper Hurricane arrived on Long Island September 21st and would only a few hours later turn out to be largest Hurricane to set foot in New England since the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.\n\nMoving North from Long Island to Connecticut, Rhode Island and up through Vermont the storm cost the lives of close to 700 people. By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."
newengland.40.a:0 "God save us all."

newengland.41.t:0 "Road integration with Canada?"
newengland.41.d:0 "As we continue building up our economy and expanding the road network, the question arose of which direction we should drive on. While the custom in America has always been to drive on the right Canada has, since the British revolution in 1925, driven on the left.\n\nSome political leaders have suggested that we switch to driving on the Left in an attempt to better integrate our road network into the Canadian one whilst others of course wish to stay driving on the right to further amplify that New England is not a British Dominion."
newengland.41.a:0 "We shall adapt to the British model."
newengland.41.b:0 "American cars drive on the side of Freedom!"


newengland.42.t:0 "Royal visit to New England"
newengland.42.d:0 "King-Emperor Edward the 8th and his wife Isabelle of Orleans have arrived in Boston today to mark improved ties between New England and Canada. This is the first time that a reigning British monarch has visited Boston in its entire history. As to be expected large jubilant crowds of New Englanders have come out to catch a sight of the King and Queen of the British Empire. The visit was more then just seeing the sites of the sites for they also came to discuss politics with the various leaders of note in New England."
newengland.42.a:0 "Welcome to Boston!"

newengland.44.t:0 "The [GetYear] World Series"
newengland.44.d:0 "America's Pastime is alive and well in New England as the Boston Red Sox are set to play the World Series of [GetYear] against their crosstown rival, the Bees, in a seven game series. When baseball was effectively canceled at the outbreak of civil war down south, the Red Sox remained safely in Boston and as such were unaffected. Despite finishing sixth out of eight in the American League last year, the Red Sox trounced the competition in the inaugural season of the New England League, led by superstar Jimmie Foxx and tactical genius Joe Cronin. Rounding out the league were six recently promoted baseball clubs from the former minor leagues from cities such as Buffalo, Rochester, and Albany as well as the aforementioned Bees, whose level of play last season was a similar caliber to that of the Red Sox but were unfortunate enough to be playing in Philadelphia at the outset of the war and as such were unable to return most of their best players to New England. Some say the Red Sox are cursed, however, as they have yet to replicate their success after selling superstar Babe Ruth in 1919 to finance their owner's musical production and have fallen on hard times ever since.  While some say the defunct American and National Leagues retain the rights to the actual World Series title, who are they to judge? They don't exist anymore. As far as everyone is concerned, whoever wins this Series are world champions."
newengland.44.a:0 "Here's hoping for a good series!"

newengland.45.t:0 "Boston Red Sox win the [GetYear] World Series"
newengland.45.d:0 "In what has come as no surprise, the Boston Red Sox have won the [GetYear] World Series. Led by stellar performances by Jimmie Foxx and pitcher Lefty Grove, the Red Sox have swept the Bees in four easy games, including a decisive game four at Fenway Park where they outscored their opponent by sixteen runs and squashing accusations of a nonsense 'curse' in the process."
newengland.45.a:0 "The curse reversed."

newengland.46.t:0 "Boston Bees win the [GetYear] World Series"
newengland.46.d:0 "In an amazing upset, the Boston Bees have somehow managed to defeat the Red Sox in seven games after an unfortunate gaffe by Red Sox first baseman Jimmie Foxx let the final out of the last game roll between his legs, handing the Bees their first championship since they were known as the Braves in 1914. Foxx, the longtime Red Sox star, was seen crying outside Fenway Park after the game while the Bees celebrated through the evening and into the night. He was only consoled after a teammate reminded him it could be much worse. He could be down south."
newengland.46.a:0 "Maybe they are cursed...?"

### Underground Railroad ###
newengland.50.t:0 "The Underground Railroad"
newengland.50.d:0 "Established in the 1700s, the first Underground Railroad served as a network of secret routes with as purpose to clandestinely transport Afro-American slaves from the Thirteen Colonies into Canada where slavery was already abolished.\n\nWith the American Civil War tearing apart households across the Americans and ideological strive leading to the forced expulsion or sometimes even massacre of Americans, our government has reignited the old "Railroad" and has with the aid of locals on both sides of the border re-established the network with the hopes of safely transporting refugees to our little nation."

newengland.51.t:0 "The Lake Erie Migration Crisis"
newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as opposing forces fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."
newengland.51.a:0 "Allow covert operatives to establish a base on Pelee Island."
newengland.51.b:0 "We can not put the lives of innocents in danger with our schemes!"

newengland.52.t:0 "Successful Smuggling Operation on Lake Erie"
newengland.52.d:0 "Tucked away beneath sheets of linen and between the clothes of refugees, our covert operatives on the far side of Lake Erie have been able to successfully smuggle small arms, munition, medical supplies. Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the carcass"

newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers apprehended!"

Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime.

newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop militia agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the agents who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."

Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."

newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organizations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organizations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realizing that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."

newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above enemy territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by an anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to  as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering enemy supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathizers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob traveled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the enemy agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."

newengland.94.t:0 "The Canadian Concern"
newengland.94.d:0 "While the New England government is not a Canadian puppet, it would be false to suggest that it wasn't part of the British Empire - such as it is - and of great concern to the larger Canadian sphere of interest. The Canadian government is willing to allow New England to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], since the reason for Canada's intervention in the region ended with the civil war, but they are asking that [requester.GetNameDef] join the Entente alliance.

Even worse, Norman Wallace Lermond, a native of Maine and a famous naturalist, has called for a moderate socialist revolution within New England, though it seems he has no intentions of joining with the CSA. With the IWW and Socialist Parties still causing problems it is clear we are not out of the woods yet, and governor [NEE.GetLeader] has declared that anyone who attempts to overthrow the government and establish a 'syndicalist tyranny' will face the full force of the law."

newengland.102.t:0 "Radical Coalition formalizes!"
newengland.102.d:0 "The so-called Radical Coalition has cemented its political alliance in reaction to both Canadian and syndicalist influence in New England. This occurred after members of the two leading factions of the movement, "The Remnant" and "The Sentinels of the Republic", met and agreed to pool together their formally fairly weak militias. A loose grouping within New England lead by right-wing intellectuals and organizations, the Coalition is unified in viewing the State as the ultimate threat to man and the syndicalists as merely another group of fanatics attempting to use it for their own agenda of abolishing property laws. With the increase in populist movements in recent years, more middle and upper class citizens have listened to this faction of New England politics as both a counter-revolutionary force and a solution to the problem of politics. Albert Jay Nock is leader of the Remnant and the Freemen magazine, and the more radical wing of the Coalition, the Sentinels of the Republic, started as a right-wing lobbying group fighting virtually all forms of government intervention in the economy before going through a series of internal radicalizations. This involved influence from the Remnant and New England Right before turning to a mixture of Social Darwinist sciences and reinterpretations of Egoism to use their arguments against not only wealth redistribution but any attacks on the wealthy. This is something the original Egoists, whose arguments they borrowed, have mixed or even negative feelings about. \n\n With the formalization of the alliance, their supporters in Congress have officially changed their party affiliation to the Radical Coalition, with the Sentinels providing the funding and the Remnant the militia volunteers. Together they declare man's freedoms will not end so long as they are on watch."

Red Guards are overtaking South Boston and have some of our dockyards are suffering from mass strikes. We will need to act at once! We must either send our own men to try to overtake the militias which will be bloody but likely end in a victory, or we can request Canadian assistance at the cost of likely becoming more reliant on Canada, something that is sure to anger many New Englanders but might end in a more favorable resolution. However some of our advisors believe to give Canada an opening to occupy our soil would open the gates to other extremist movements and believe we should just stomp it out ourselves."

However, though the cause of revolution seemed simple enough as a unifying force for the rebels, the question of governance is much more divisive. There are two main camps among the New Englander leftists. One camp is led by Leonard Abbott and wishes to align itself with the CSA, espousing mainstream syndicalist values and believing their unification with the Combined Syndicates to be necessary for their victory in the war. The other camp, led by the populist-socialist Norman Wallace Lermond, espouses Bellamyist ideals along with an emphasis on nature. Lermond does not share Abbott's enthusiasm for the anarchist cause in the Red Belt, instead believing New England should seek its own destiny and perhaps eventually reunify the United States under its own command. These two groups, unified until now, have come close to exchanging blows recently, and it seems only one group will be able to win out in the end..."

Now they are left with control of Boston and several port cities, giving us control over their industrial economy. The Federalist Party of New England contains our most hardline supporters and as they are providing our officers with support they are requesting we place them in charge to ensure a more stable New England and see that our losses were not for nothing. However, there are those in parliament who argue that more direct control would be more favorable to our cause and allow us to completely subdue the New Englander. By appointing a Governor-General, the leader of New England would report directly to us, and we could send directives for governing New England as we see fit.

It is clear they are not asking however and as we have virtually no means to oppose them as we gifted them much of our military and economic might. With the Vanderbilt and Astor families already competing for power within the Federalist machine to prepare for Canadian appointments, Radicals are already furious at the idea of English royalists seizing the nation and have stated their intent to declare a revolution, but do not have quite enough resources to do so. Perhaps it would be better to endorse the Radical cause and provide it with our remaining military and political aid to pressure Canada to leave, effectively allowing us to play both sides, although many would see this as a dangerous ploy when Canada offers us security."

However the situation is still unstable and they have yet to even unify behind a candidate for President, of which the well-connected and pro-Federalist Astor and Vanderbilt families seemingly spending every dime and bit of political capital competing for top spot. The Astor's closer ties to Canada's political elite give them greater comfort to the Canadian elite and more direct political ties whereas the Vanderbilt's are favored by more of New England for their wealth being based out of the region and heavier philanthropy, with their new money extravagances often being the talk of the town (for better or worse). \nThe candidates include the more traditionally aristocrat and English officer John Jacob Astor whose birth in America would technically make him qualified to run for President but nonetheless makes him more unpopular to locals, the philanthropist Vincent Astor who is more popular within New England (by Astor standards) but less connected to us and too personally reformist for the tastes of many Canadian conservatives, prominent yachtsman and card player Harold Stirling Vanderbilt who seems acceptable to the New England populace despite being less so to Canadian royals and finally motor car racer William Kissam Vanderbilt, whom is quite popular in the area but only somewhat interesting in governing if not for his family allowing him to use him as a candidate."

The whole affair has not gone on without controversy as figures as diverse as Hamilton Fish III and George Aiken denounced the ceremony as a sham being used by Canada to push their own agenda onto New England."

Currently the SPA radicals are already so neutered that these union workers likely pose no threat but Canada is pushing us to either investigate or outlaw unions among ports associated with the syndicalist strikers, and law and order figures are pressuring us to listen to them.

A more reformist section of the SPA, whom while clearly biased towards the CSA towards opposing a revolution within New England and are ambivalent about the CSA's actual methods. Their relatively moderate stance has gained them political seats in local, state and even a handful of national representative positions. Removing them may be more difficult to justify but as they give cover to the Red Guards and would collaborate with the CSA and their allies in a heart beat it would grant us much safety to do so and it is clearly what Canada favors."

Recently our advisors have heard from the Great North that Canadian advisors to the King have heard a rumor we might move the Capital to Concord to have a closer proximity to Canada in a show of goodwill. While it's unknown which Federalists promoted this rumor, we do now that doing so during the King's visit would without a doubt promote positive relations, perhaps gaining us more political support from Canada."

However with the Federalist Party controlling congress, Federalist Party congressmen Samuel Dickstein and William I. Sirovich gave speeches decrying dissenters for opposing a reform that is not only truer to New England's heritage but will ensure safety. Nonetheless the most controversial parts of the new Constitution, including a provision that would see the both the President and Senators elected for life by electors is sure to endanger only more hatred until it can pass, as would its weakening of the states for Federal power. However, with Canada's backing and the military on our side there is little they can do."

The Radical papers have either claimed we are responsible for the attacking for 'attacking American freedom repeatedly' or outright endorsed it while the remaining Radicals in Congress not arrested during the Federalist takeover are warning us to stand down.

Interestingly while the Remnant militias continue to fight us the Sentinels of the Republic have come to us with an offer, claiming they will accept the Federalist Party if the DuPont family and other Sentinel associates are allowed to continue their business in the region. Of course, hardline Egoists and 'Radical Anarchists' in the party are unlikely to go with it, but with the wealthy upper core of the Sentinels on our side we would have their wealth resources at our disposal. However, some in Canada and at home such as Federalist Party whip Samuel Dickstein would prefer to finish the job, believing we could replace the Sentinels with Federalist and Canadian businesses and finish off potential traitors, although it would be an initially costly fight to takeover the DuPonts."

newengland.115.d:0 "A popular but highly potent liquor Absinthe, also called "The Green Fairy", was a popular drink in England before the revolution and remains so in Canada among those who can afford access to either local production or imports from Portugal. Our recent collaboration with the liquor business has caused requests from Entente elites asking for a government approved corporation to purchase and distribute it, which they argue would benefit both sides.

The Radicals appear to have finally been defeated and with it our main opposition is gone. Federalist Party members such as Styles Bridges has moved to have those Congressmen and governors who did not outright side with the Federalists during the Radical attacks to be removed from office just as the Radicals were and replaced with Federalists until they come up for re-election, although our advisors would prefer if we simply removed them and had new snap elections on the spot for the seats."

John Jacob Astor, who is already famous for being a Titanic survivor as a baby, has been using his connections in a bid to 'run' for President, arguing it would be smoother considering the current president has already served longer than what Americans are used to and that it would ease pressure from 'democracy' advocates.

newengland.117.d:0 "The Radicals are furious at the attempts of the Federalist Party to take power after their leaders were alerted to their attempts. With the support of our officially rogue state guard they are securing the roads between Boston and Canada to prevent their forces from being resupplied and the pro-Federalist Styles Bridges has been kept captive in his own home by Sentinel forces before he could aid them. Without a way of maintaining New England without a full war, the Federalist and Canadian forces have agreed to return home."

newengland.118.t:0 "Radicals Take Congress!"
newengland.118.d:0 "With their forces spread throughout New England and continued rallying of citizens to their cause to maintain sovereignty, the Radicals have demanded control of Congress, removing politicians who were found to be too friendly to the Federalist, Canadian or Socialist cause and replacing them with their own, and the Congress moved to continue to support this on a state level. As such, the Radicals have control of our Congress to the enthusiasm of popular writers such as H.L. Mencken and horror to Canadian allies. It appears their American revolutionary uniforms have become less goofy than we once we dismissed them as."

newengland.119.t:0 "Radical Constitutional Congress!"
newengland.119.d:0 "The Radicals have moved to hold a constitutional convention with delegates appointed by each state in New England, modeled on the original constitution. Of course, as the Radicals now control most state legislatures after forcing out "Canadian and Socialist collaborators", this effectively means they will have a large majority of the delegates, with some approved Democrats and Republicans attending, and a small percent of progressives."
newengland.119.a:0 "We are in their hands now"

newengland.120.t:0 "Radical Split!"
newengland.120.d:0 "Since the beginning of the Constitutional Coalition there has been friction between the Radicals, namely the Remnant and the Sentinels of the Republic. The Remnant favor a constitutional republic with a minimalist state, but is split on the question of whether or not democracy should be a component of it or if it's too dangerous to democracy. The Sentinels are far more radical, favoring the solution of the state in favor of a "Natural Capitalism", and are led by the DuPont family, whom are being accused of literally buying delegates with Sentinel funds. In between them are the more traditional anarcho-egoists who are split between a Sentinel force they view as corrupting their message but nonetheless are more serious about dissolving the state and supporting the Remnant. It is likely they will decide the dominant faction. However, if a decision cannot be reached, a maverick is present in the form of Lothrop Stoddard and his Nordic League. Stoddard disagrees with both the Remnant and the Sentinels on many issues, especially the anarchist ideals of the Remnant. However, his pre-established fame would make him an easy compromise, and he has admirers in both factions. Who shall prevail?"

One of the them, seemingly most important yet rather unimportant in the grand scheme of things, is the title of our chief. While Albert Jay Nock has been the effective head of New England ever since our group came to power he was never 'officially' designated to any political role. To rectify that situation delegates from all over our fair land have gathered at Boston's Old State House to solemnly swear in Albert Jay Nock as the President of the United States in Congress Assembled, granting him the title outlined in the old Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union."

newengland.201.t:0 "The Second Hartford Convention"
newengland.201.d:0 "With New England under Canadian protection, the first order of business remains the establishment of a legitimate government in this time of crisis, and the reaffirmation and recognition of the Constitution of the United States as the primary source of law and authority in the nation. Leaders and statesmen are making their way to Connecticut, hoping to make history with their involvement in the preservation of America. Others, however, see the Convention as more than an opportunity to not reaffirm the Constitution, but a place to make crucial changes to the document to prevent yet another Civil War. These political dissidents have flocked to the immigrant-backed and Quaker-led alliance under Clarence Pickett or Lovecraft’s increasingly militant and outspoken Loyal Coalition. Canadian liberation has given us freedom and isolation from the Second American Civil War. Yet, with the Second Hartford Convention about to begin, the future of New England seems even more uncertain."
newengland.201.a:0 "New England sleeps..."

newengland.202.t:0 "Lovecraft and the Providence Society"
newengland.202.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, untold thousands rushed to the relative safety, stability, and opportunity of America. As the war languished on, immigrants flooded New England, quickly and unexpectedly changing the face of the northeast. With these diverse, new interests came new problems: particularly, nativist resentment. These problems were only compounded by the economic recession that set in after the Kaiserreich began to isolate the United States of America. This discontent was championed by one of New England’s most famous personalities: the celebrity author, Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s meteoric rise to fame in recent years is based on his tales of weird and diabolical fiction, seen by both fans and critics as giving voice to the xenophobia, economic insecurity, and reactionary instincts of New Englanders.\n\nInitially the darling of Boston Brahmins and New England’s Anglo-Saxon majority, Lovecraft’s work spread like wildfire across the country, turning him into an overnight sensation. The Shadow Over Innsmouth, one of Lovecraft's most famous novellas, deals obliquely with the threats of state conspiracy and invasion, as well as miscegenation and its monstrous consequences. Some of his most ardent followers swear that prophetic, astrological portents can be understood through comprehensive study of his work. To many, Lovecraft may just be another insane writer with less than moderate views, to others he is a prophet that can guide New England to safety. But whatever Lovecraft may be, he is still a shy, reclusive writer, unlikely to take any drastic action. The only ones in New England that wish to see him in power are the extreme Anglophiles. They view Lovecraft as a tool to ensure complete loyalty to Canada. For now, Lovecraft and his small circle of writers stick to Providence and continue on with their lives, only accompanied by small groups of fans and loyalists. "

newengland.203.d:0 "As America spiralled into war, many turned to Alcohol to escape their troubles. The War, the destruction and all the world can be forgotten about by simply taking a sip of various fermented plants. That is the plan. However, in reality people abuse the Devil’s nectar, and use it to commit horrible acts in their drunken rage. As well the productivity of all people decrease as the worker partakes in suds instead of doing their job. So, as Drunkenness ravages New England and the rest of the United States an unexpected force has risen from the dead. Due to the nationwide failure of prohibition, most sane people assumed that the Prohibition Party was dead in the ground; however, is has made a stunning comeback as New England is ravaged by drunkenness. The party now mainly bases itself in New England and is lead by David Leigh Colvin. Colvin believes that all New Englanders must be moral, compassionate, and caring for every man. The party’s main platform is to illegalize the sale and production of Alcohol, as well as prohibiting Pornography, instilling Christian Values into the nation, and helping the American Refugees fleeing from the Civil War. The party’s sudden re-birth has surprised many within New England, but can the party truly return from the dead?"

newengland.303.d:0 "Originally disregarded and laughed at by established politicians, Clarence Pickett’s Quaker Alliance has managed to gain a concerning amount of sway within New England. Pickett has brought the Religious Society of Friends (AKA ‘Quakers’) to the forefront of New Englander politics by offering unconditional support to immigrants and refugees alike, while working to change the church from a religious institution into an outspoken political party dedicated to international neutrality, pacifism, and Christian charity. Citing the progressive precedent set by the Roosevelt-administration and the teachings of Jesus Christ, Pickett has begun drafting a set of crucial amendments for New England’s Constitution. Deemed the “Appeal to Heaven,” the Quaker platform aims to transform New England into a welfare state that can open its arms to the downtrodden across the shattered American continent."

The Republicans see immigration as a threat to New England’s stability; introducing alien philosophies like Syndicalism and Catholicism. The Democrats, though normally a conservative party, have benefited from the Irish community as a voter base in the Northeast.

The Republicans advocate an elite, limited army with Canadian backing, while the Democrats demand widespread conscription to protect against Syndicalism.

The debate breaking the Democratic-Republican Coalition is whether the new President should be allowed to appoint all new justices, or whether each state should provide a new justice. The Republicans prefer to draft judges from each state. The Democrats favor the old system, likely because they believe their dominance of Massachusetts will allow them to carry the election.

If one of their number wins the election, will the rest surrender power to this First Among Equals?

In the pursuit of a possible everlasting peace between brothers, we must emphasize the shared American traditions that bind us together, and what better a tradition to focus on than Thanksgiving? In an attempt to foster national unity in this fractured Union, President Pickett has had his secretary send out invitations to all leaders of the major belligerent factions of the Second American Civil War for a good, old-fashioned, New England-style Thanksgiving. After all, shouldn't we be able to talk out our issues over turkey and ale instead of killing each other?\n\n However, after weeks of waiting, it seems most of his invitations have fallen on deaf or unsympathetic ears, with nearly all going unanswered."

As dinner neared being ready, a knock came on the door, signalling their most eagerly awaited guest had finally arrived. As Pickett opened the door, he was elated to find none other than William Dudley Pelley of the Silver Legion on his doorstep!\n\n Though the two pious titans of the American politician scene had had little to no interactions beforehand, they had been familiar with each other's work, both politically and parochially. What began as a quiet and awkward dinner soon turned into an exuberant scene as the two thinkers exchanged ideas and notions on all manners of topics, from the common to the esoteric. After hours, long after Pickett’s wife went off to bed, growing tired of the two men’s seemingly unending fascination with each other, Pelley began to reveal some of his far more outlandish theories and talents, including his fabled ability to levitate, which Pickett witnessed with his very own tired and weary eyes! \n\nStaying up straight through night to morning, Pickett and Pelley’s conversations and braindigging never ceased, but with more pressing and important matters calling them back to work, their meeting would have to come to an end. However, the friendship they forged this night shall last an eternity, for Pickett and Pelley are wayward souls of the same source, tied together through common belief and shared intellect."

The Governor General had been seen fraternizing in United Loyalist circles for some time and the British need a strong and more importantly loyal hand to keep a grip on New England. Much of the rest of the New Englander political sphere have links to the old American political system and therefore can never be truly trusted as the Loyalists can. While they have not officially assumed power the Loyalists have already unveiled a new program to begin whipping New England into line as Albion’s most loyal Son. These include a severe rewriting of history text-books, the destruction of the many Patriot monuments and the renaming of anything that even vaguely harkens back to the Patriots from the Revolution. This has been met with grumbles from the more American leaning sections of the populace but by and large their assumption of power seems to harken in a new era of peace and prosperity under the King's eye."

newengland.223.d:0 "In what is somewhat an ironic twist of fate; reports have been speedingly coming in from Boston of an altercation between a Canadian patrol and local civilians. Just a few minutes away from King Street where British Regulars had fired upon American colonists in 1770; a few local drunkards blinded by drink and patriotism engaged in an altercation with a squad of Canadian soldiers. While the sentries disregarded their rowdiness; it was when only when a drunk flung mud at them did the situation begin to escalate. A sentry immediately fell out of rank and shoved the man to the ground with his rifle. The commotion of shouting and a struggle immediately drew a crowd of spectators to the scene, and it wasn't long before the Canadian squad was forced to withdraw from the scene. The commander of the Canadian garrison in that sector of Boston immediately deployed reinforcements in the form of other squads to relieve the besieged patrol and nip any form of a riot should the situation spiral out of control. When Canadian reinforcements arrived - the original patrol had been surrounded by a crowd of angry Bostonians. An attempt was made to break through the crowd to allow for a corridor to be created to extract the original squad, and this is where the sense of cruel fate finally took form. Immediately, once the Canadian soldiers attempted to meet the wave of upset locals, scuffles ensued. No one is quite sure what happened, but it is rumored that during the quarrel, a Bostonian attempted to shove a 'Tommy' away from getting any closer to him; he had accidentally disarmed the soldier in the process. With a rifle in his hand; a confused and dazed Canadian soldier immediately opened fire - the local dropping to the ground. Once the crowd had finally dispersed and the gunfire had stopped - two dozen Bostonians lay dead with several dozens more wounded. Before the Canadians could retreat with the originally besieged squad; dozens of enraged Bostonians - Americans, returned, armed with pistols, revolvers, and anything they could find. The Canadian commander ordered his men to hold fast - just as the human wave began charging toward them and their position; the bloodshed had only just begun."

Today as he walked down a street in Albany Sgt Alban George-Towton, the man who led the unit who committed the massacre, was machine gunned in broad daylight by a masked man who quickly jumped into a waiting car and sped away. After an exhaustive and intense round of marathon interrogations none of the 34 witnesses appear to have seen anything other than the car appeared to have maybe possibly been a shade of yellow. Before the British could even begin to theorize on who committed the murder, they found their answer when a letter was mailed to an official in Rochester. It was from the New Sons of Liberty, an Americanist rebel organization who claimed responsibility for Towton’s murder and, according to their own words, wish nothing more than to see the British driven from America once more. As if to hammer their point home, Rochester’s Military Administration building was bombed two days later with an IED that killed 21. As the people of New England begin to hunker down paranoia has also reared its ugly head. The letter hinted that the Sons had already infiltrated the Administration to its highest levels. Nobody is above suspicion and everybody is suspect. While MI6 chase their tails meticulously combing New England for moles the Sons grow larger by the day. It seems an insurgency has begun."

The first ones on the list are Urban Broughton the Baron Fairhaven and his brother Henry. They are unique as not only is their peerage the first one to be given out, but they come from commoner stock with Urban working as a sewage engineer in the US where he lived for some time. His brother Henry was even born there, in Fairhaven Massachusetts from which the Peerage gets its name. By appointing either of them we could give the administration a more broad popular appeal. We could however go with the Old Money candidate Vincent Astor whose ancestor made a fortune off the fur trade. He would be a more traditional candidate with blood bluer than the sky. However, his plain aristocratic leanings, despite his philanthropy, might make him unpopular. A third choice is Joseph P Kennedy Sr who made his money more recently on the stock market. While he was anything but poor beforehand he has maintained a certain common touch that has helped him keep the love of the commoner. This would compliment his ties to the aristocracy that keep him loyal to us. Lastly we could just knock the ‘Provisional’ prefix off the title of the current Governor General.

Not only would it show that we have returned to the traditional and right governing structure, but the flag itself is steeped in history. The last submission is a unique one, a new flag based on South Africa’s. This one’s appeal lies not just in the flag, but the growing links between our Dominion and South Africa.

The second choice is Henry Windsor, a competent soldier and diplomat whose choice would be about as neutrally received as ever. He is an unknown quantity in New England, so he could turn himself into whatever he so chose. Another choice is also one of the most unorthodox, Alastair Windsor. Coming from a branch of the family that goes back to Edward VII Alastair’s title, Duke of Connaught, means nothing but can be played into something good. By coaching him into speaking with an Irish accent he could be beloved by the sizable Irish American faction of New England which would secure his rule. Alternatively we could go with a native son to further placate the Americans. Baron Fairhaven has enough ties to both Canada and the US to act as an effective bridge between us.

Now would be his chance to leapfrog these socialites and find his way into imperial high society. As a result, his businesses will surely prosper and his prestige will only continue to grow. However, given his business interests in Hollywood, perhaps he is more interested in American business than he is in Entente business, meaning we would need to put some trust in the man if we are to grant him the title of viscount.

However, we should take care with this appointment: appointing people merely for their wealth could set a precedent and cause the elites we do not like to also demand titles.

lovecraftflavor.1.d:0 "With August Derleth rising as the new King in Yellow, he has taken it upon himself to be the voice of the late Lovecraft, seeking to spread the word of Providence across the world, and hopefully earning a healthy profit for the state along the way! To accomplish this task, Derleth has assembled a dedicated team of linguists and together with this group of literary masters, he has begun to translate the entire body of Lovecraft’s literary lexicon into as many foreign languages as possible. From German and French to Mandarin and Hindi to Swahili and even Esperanto, every possible language they can translate these works into will be done, so that all across the globe can witness the prophetic literary genius of the late Howard Philips Lovecraft! \n\nHowever, despite this facade of good will and spreading the arts, those close to Derleth know that he is mainly in this venture for the profit. With Lovecraft already being one of the most popular authors in the Anglo world, him reaching worldwide popularity will bring easy profit to the state, and with Derleth attaching some of his own literary works to the initiative, he stands to make a pretty penny in personal profits himself. Regardless, the funds will go to bettering the state and the notoriety will only serve to boost our international acclaim, legitimacy, and position. And how could we protest the spreading of the word of Providence?"

lovecraftflavor.2.d:0 "In the early 1930’s, August Derleth travelled to the vibrant and culturally rich island of Hispaniola in order to delve into Haitian traditions. While there, he traveled the Haitian countryside and every inch of their villages and cities in search of fascinating facets of their native mythologies and spiritual ideas to incorporate into his own writings. Learning about the Loa of the Vodou faith and on stories of Witch Doctors and Oungans, the stories that truly piqued Derleth’s interest were on local tales of the undead, and that is what has made him return here now. \n\nIn Haitian tradition, there are beings known as the Zombi. Bokor - or Haitian dark priests that are in opposition to the Oungans - supposedly create these undead Zombies by taking the ‘ti bon ange,’ or half of Vodou’s idea of a dual soul that controls free will, and placing it in a bottle, allowing the Bokor to control the victim after death, for the ti bon ange can then manipulate the ‘gros bon ange’ - the second half of the dual-soul that controls the body. The beings created are mindless husks, completely enslaved to the will of their master, being mindless and feeling no pain or general emotion. They are created, then fed a poison created from the local wildlife that makes them appear dead, so that their loved ones bury them and move on. The Bokor then exhumes these ensnared slaves for use as personal servants while the family believes them to be dead, leading to the impression that outsiders of Vodou hold that Zombies are truly the living dead. \n\nThe idea of this practice and the wider Vodou faith have deeply interested Derleth, who now has returned to walk Port-au-Prince and wider Haiti in search of the spark of inspiration once again. Regardless of what he finds, Derleth is sure to enjoy himself among the palm trees and tropical breeze of this cultured island paradise."

Regardless of this pushback, Derleth has pushed ahead with this expansion. And why shouldn’t the new King in Yellow be allowed to expand his predecessor's work after already contributing to it so greatly from the shadows, for it was Derleth who first helped Lovecraft come up with the terms ‘Elder Gods’ and the ‘Lovecraft Mythos’ anyway!

Prepared for some small amount of pushback, the group was met with open mockery by the stuffy elitists of Europe. Despite flowing speeches and rousing defenses given by our representative authors, they were practically laughed out of the room. Instead of taking this defeat to heart, the groups has persevered, and together they have decided to create their own international literary organization to spread the word of Lovecraft and their own unique writings themselves. Called the ‘International Lovecraftian Writers Association,’ this globalist group seeks to promote Horror and Science Fiction writing across the planet.

All schools in the state would be nationalized, taken under control of the central government and given a state-endorsed curriculum to teach. In addition to normal subjects, the arts and literature will be pushed on every child as pillars of the educational system. Non-Euclidean geometry will also be taught, as well as astronomy, archeology, anthropology, and theology - all through a Lovecraftian lens. Occultism and ‘Lovecraftian Science’ will also become new subjects, exposing our children to the genius of Providence at a young age, and Lovecraft’s entire body of literary works will be required reading, as well as the works of his largest influences like Edgar Allen Poe, Jules Verne, H.G Wells, and others. Furthermore, the ‘Lovecraftian’ language - the language seen in Lovecraft’s works like the Call of Cthulhu - is to be taught as a secondary tongue to all students to better unite our people and separate us from the outside world and our American past.

Promoting futurist ideals and dreaming of seeing some of these fantastical technologies and advancements often written about actually seeing the light of day, Long has begun adapting motifs and aesthetics from these works into the state while promoting his own writings of the genre as well.

However, since the passing of Lovecraft, this devotion turned to dogma as Whitehead began to view our late national father as an actual God-like figure. Taking his deep Christian convictions and fusing it with these ideas, the Eldritch Apostle has created a new syncretic Church for the world to now witness. Elevating the late Howard Philip Lovecraft as the physical manifestation of God, or as God himself, while raising the various elder beings of the wider Lovecraftian Mythos into lower positions within the new pantheon, Whitehead has created an odd fusion of Protestant Christianity and Lovecraftian occultism, incorporating aesthetics, practices, and ceremonies from both in a weird fusion of holy horror and blessed occultism. Revering the Necronomicon as equal to the Bible and revering both Whitehead’s and Lovecraft’s individual bodies of literary works as holy texts, this new Church of Providence has risen from the old cults that once snuck through the shadows of our state. Brought to light and now legitimized, the Eldritch Apostle has created a new faith that shall bring salvation through fear - fear in God and fear of the unknowable, unfathomable, endless expanse of the cosmos, and what might lurk inside - or outside - this dark, soul-crushing reality."

Incorporating elements from the Lovecraftian Mythos so that the two interpretations of faith align, Whitehead’s has dubbed this new divine text as the ‘Howard Phillips Lovecraft Bible of God and Providence.’ Within this text, a fused retelling of creation and history is shown, offering the true past, present, and future of the human race and the cosmos around us, shedding light on how tiny and insignificant we truly are both in the face of the unknown and in the face of God and the Elder Gods. With voices in his head telling him that Lovecraft is both God himself and just His greatest Prophet, even Whitehead himself is torn over the final word of the faith, leaving an open-ended question in the faith that is up to interpretation by the masses.

This seemingly insane avenue of thought is only Whitehead’s latest foray into what he has begun to call ‘Lovecraftian Science’ - a school of thought seen as pseudoscience to many that attempts to bring to reality the many fantastical and horrific things the Lovecraftian Mythos has recorded in literature. From the creation of living fishmen to his attempts at bottling a soul, Whitehead has tried it all in an attempt to further the advancement of the state, but has sadly failed at every turn. Despite managing to make some genetic mutants and freaks of nature through embryo manipulation and surgery, these poor creatures died shortly after creation before they could even be named, and nothing useful or moral has been produced in these endeavors, but yet Whitehead persists. In this latest attempt, he has sewn together freshly dead corpses of execution victims, jolting it with electricity over and over again in a vain attempt to jumpstart life. Though this endeavor will likely fail as usual, the Eldritch Apostle will continue trying in perpetuity, for that's what a good scientist does!"

While developing his own branch of the Lovecraftian mythos centered around Science Fiction over the occult or eldritch, he shall also proliferate baseline Lovecraftian ideas, creating a new syncretic cultural movement that will ensnare and entertains the masses as he formalizes a true ‘Lovecraftism’ for all the world to witness and emulate while softening the overall image and harsh practices that earned derision in the past.

The manifesto has been titled ‘An Examination of the Lovecraftian Ideology as Formulated by Howard Philips Lovecraft and as Organized by Frank Belknap Long,’ and seeks to thoroughly explain what our state and our ideology are all about. Frequently just nicknamed the ‘New Necronomicon’ or the ‘National Grimoire,’ this dense document outlines the goals, preferred policies, social stances, racial views, religious ideas, and general ideology of Lovecraftism in exhaustive detail. \n\nIn short, it summarizes Lovecraftian thought as a populist, technocratic, nationalist, anglophilic, occultist movement that is vaguely ‘Right-wing’ while simultaneously pulling from Leftist thought and millenarian in nature, calling for national rebirth and complete society reorganization. It is centered around the Cult of Providence - a occultist cult of personality built around the late Howard Philips Lovecraft that raises him as a God-life figure - and is Spartan in nature, calling for the proliferation and distintification of the New England culture while preaching White Anglo-Saxon Protestant supremacy. Economically, it functions as a mixed economy, pulling from both Corporatist and Capitalist notions while shaming the free, untamed market and overt Socialism, though it is deeply populist and features planned economics. Featuring a love for faux American and pure Anglo aristocracy and upholding the military as one the key arms of the state, it is elitist and martially minded while being largely isolationist and featuring many policies that would be considered pro-working class. Under a Lovecraftist system, the arts - especially literature - are elevated as the pinnacles of society, and much attention and funding is given to artistic pursuits. Finally, on the spiritual front, it supports and seeks to proliferate both Protestant Christianity and the Lovecraftian occultist mythos in a syncretic mix designed to bring salvation and morality to the masses through a fear in God and the unknown, raising the Elder Gods and Lovecraft to the heights of the Christian Pantheon as equal and completely unknowable beings. \n\nHowever, the ideology has changed a lot since Lovecraft’s first rise to power, and now much has been altered and tweaked by his rightful successor Master Long in order to fit his own ambitions, ideas, and hopes for the state. Overall, the document reveals that Lovecraftism is an ideology of contradictions, leaving many with more questions than answers. Regardless, this form-fit ideology perfectly encapsulates what makes Lovecraft’s homeland unique, and what makes Master Long such a visionary. Under the banner of Lovecraftian thought and under the guidance of the Master, we shall prevail eternally!"

The small black cat stuck with the young Howard, calling the little N****r-Man ‘one of the most fascinating and understanding creatures I’ve ever seen.’ However, on one tragic day in 1904, when the young Lovecraft was just 14 years old, N****r-Man went missing, never to be seen again. \n\nAll his life, Lovecraft fawned over the loss of his favorite feline friend, often reminiscing over the sounds he used to make, with Lovecraft being cited as saying ‘he used to talk in a genuine language of varied intonations—a special tone for every different meaning. There was even a special ''prrr'p'' for the smell of roast chestnuts, on which he dotes. He used to play ball with me—kicking a large rubber sphere back at me from half across the room with all four feet as he lay on the floor. And on summer evenings in the twilight he would prove his kinship to the elfin things of shadow by racing across the lawn on nameless errands, darting into the blackness of the shrubbery now & then, & occasionally leaping at me from ambush & then bounding away again into invisibility before I could catch him.’ \n\nFor years this hole in his heart nagged at him, until the day he began formulating his rise to power. Finally in charge of his own destiny as well as the fate of the nation, and finally over his crippling fears and anxieties, Howard Philips Lovecraft went to the finest pet store in New England and adopted a small black kitten to replace the companion he lost all those years ago. Calling him ‘N****r-Man Jr.,’ the small black cat stayed by Lovecraft’s side throughout his rise to power and well into his transformation into Providence. In his sorrow as he began to deteriorate in his last days, Lovecraft stayed close to his new N****r-Man fiercely, and the small black cat loyally stood by him until the final end. \n\nWith the passing of Providence, N****r-Man Jr. is without master and without home, though a decent portion of Lovecraft’s own final will was left in his name. With [tag.getleader] now having risen to stand where Lovecraft once stood, it is now also upon this successor to the King in Yellow to take on this additional duty of the state as well.

Howard. Smith grew close to Lovecraft during their time writing for the magazine together, and the two worked together, wrote together, and conversed together more than Lovecraft did with possibly anyone else. All throughout Lovecraft’s rise and the creation of our fantastical nation, Smith proved to be a loyal and capable ally to the now-late Lovecraft, and since then he has come to aid our state. \n\nHowever, despite possibly being Lovecraft’s greatest friend in life, Smith did not put his name forward to become Lovecraft’s successor, in spite of Lovecraft’s own private personal wishes declaring that Smith be his ‘heir’ - a fact kept secret by Smith at all costs. The main reason for Smith’s hesitance towards rule is his crippling agoraphobia - or fear of public environments and crowds - which keeps him largely confined to his cottage with his wife and children, quietly aiding the state from the privacy of his own home aside from the occasional trips he must on business or out of other necessities.

This ideological path has only brought us close to our friends in the Entente as we become further alienated from the rest of the former-United States and Americanism at large, ostracizing us from the rest of the Yankees but granting us new opportunities among our new allies. \n\nCertain lords and nobles within the Entente’s Anglo aristocracy have put forth the idea of giving Lovecraft his own title and estate, raising him to be the first in a new noble house within the reviving British Empire. Holding noble blood himself due to his familial connections to not only the old noble Lovecraft/Lovecroft family, but also to the Phillips family, the Allgood family, and the Place family - all lesser noble houses of old that have been exhaustively researched by Lovecraft himself in his obsession with determining his own roots, history, and blood. Not even needing a new heraldic design, the new house would use Lovecraft’s self-made Coat of Arms, made on his own when he was younger and first publicly drawn in a letter Lovecraft sent to his friend and fellow author Frank Belknap Long, combining the old Lovecraft heraldry of golden fox heads (sometimes depicted as boar heads instead) and a gold chevron on a light blue field with the Phillips family heraldry of a black lion on a dark blue field, the red and yellow heraldry of the Place lineage adorned with a red lion, and the complex heraldry of the Allgood line with its red cross on a field of white with blue stars in each corner and topped with a gold banner adorned with red flowers. \n\nIf we were to accept this offer, Lovecraft would officially rise a nobleman within the British Empire, having a seat in the House of Lords in the exiled Parliament, and with his own estate centered in Providence functioning as the center of his new princedom or grand dukedom, while also further extending this aristocratic stature to his wife Sonia Greene and his adopted daughter Florence Carol, as well as to all future family, creating his own aristocratic dynasty loyal to the Crown and the Entente. This would cement our status as a British ally and subservient, and would have us move away from Americanist ideas entirely, but would grant us an equal place at the table in our alliance, and grant New England a far greater place in the Commonwealth.

In a fury of high anticipation and excitement, the group plunged in the murky abyss and slowly made their descent. However, after hours of sluggishly sinking into the dark ocean, the intrepid explorers had their wonder and optimism turn sour, for all they could see was an endless darkness. Rising to the surface only to dive again the next day, this process repeated for weeks all across the area of Nemo Point, but not a single sign of R'lyeh’s location or even existence was uncovered. \n\nWith their hope turning to frustration, traitorous thoughts began to fill their head that Providence was wrong, or even worse - lied to his adoring masses. Quickly though, they came to their senses as the ideas and conditioning of Lovecraftism flowed into their thoughts, and the group came to the conclusion they simply could not go deep enough, or maybe they were looking in the wrong spot. Perhaps even, the city may be invisible, preventing our mortal eyes from witnessing its non-Euclidean splendor.

Born Sonia Shafirkin Haft in Ukraine in 1883, her Jewish family left the Russian Empire after the death of Sonia’s father, with her mother going to America while leaving Sonia and her brother in England for safety. Upon becoming a teenager, Sonia followed her mother to America, where she would grow up and eventually marry a Russian immigrant 10 years her senior, fathering his child until the baby passed away at age 3. Despite this tragedy, her first husband Samuel Morris would sire her another child in the form of a daughter in 1903 - Lovecraft’s beloved step-daughter Florence Carol - before finally killing himself in 1916 after a long history of mental illness.

Instantly she gravitated towards Lovecraft’s genius and spirit, and the two became fast friends and lovers. Just three years after meeting, in 1924, they married, and since then she and her daughter have stuck by Lovecraft’s side as he rose to become the face of the pulp movement, one of the biggest author’s in America, and eventually the national father of our new state, with both Sonia and Florence Carol all the while rising as two accomplished authors in their own right. \n\nNow, with Lovecraft’s death and with the rise of his successor [tag.getleader], the ‘Queen in Yellow’ as she was once known is now a grieving widow, and their daughter Florence Carol - the Princess of Providence - once again has lost a father.

It is likely that some freak stole the corpse, or that the coroners simply misplaced his body, but regardless, this information must be covered up at any and all costs, for the public cannot know what has happened until the truth is figured out internally.

There is one about a Voodoo sect in Harlem using a giant man-eating worm to summon a Chthonic deity, and another about a small boy holding a town hostage with his ability to do literally anything with his mind. There is one about elitist Egyptologists working with British aristocrats that sacrifice their cannibalized sex slaves to a deity called the Black Pharoah while sending slaves to an Africa cult working to unearth mummies from a cursed pyramid, while another depicts a blasted heath slowly mutated and its local town eradicated as the unfathomable color oozing from a crashed meteorite infects the town.

Though not all of Lovecraft’s interests and obsessions have paid off, and though many of the programs he started led to pseudo-science and wasted resources over any real accomplishments, many more have churned out usable advances. From the Aesthetic fields to the fields of hard Science, all of society progresses under Providence as we build this paradise-in-progress. \n\nHowever, the project Lovecraft has been most proud of so far has been our burgeoning rocketry program, under the direction of Robert Hutchings Goddard, Jack Parsons, Simon Ramo, and James Hart Wyld, along with the support of our new nuclear energy division under the control of Henry Blosser, Ernest Lawrence, and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Together, these geniuses have devised a way to launch a stable rocket into orbit so that it may loose an orbital probe, or satellite, out in space to gather cosmic data. \n\nNot wasting any time, Lovecraft ordered the first rocket, named ‘The White Ship’ after his horror story of the same name, to be built and launched as soon as possible, and so the state endeavored to do this task. The launch of The White Ship went off without a hitch - the first known successful rocket launch that made it into orbit in all of human history - but what happened after, no one could have expected. Within three hours of first loosing the probe, all contact with the unmanned device was lost. However, its accumulated data and instrumental readings continued to beam back to home base at the Goddard Test Site in Massachusetts, and what came back terrified all. The machines printing the read-outs for the analyst began to output strange figures and symbols in almost other-worldly colors and arrangements instead of normal letters and numbers, as if the machines were trying to process something completely foreign or trying to compute something unfathomable to the logic and laws of this world. As the analyst tasked with manning relay stared at the strange print-outs and mesmerizing displays, his eyes glazed over in a catatonic state, swirling with unknowable colors never seen before and unimaginable, as he began to convulse and mutter in tongues, with the only words being audible and understandable being fragments like ‘well’ and ‘blasted heath’. Lasting for minutes, he jerked and spat, uttering sounds seemingly impossible to make with our own mouths and throats as the data continued to flow in and print out from the lost probe’s final signals. As the last of the data came in and the last figures were displayed, some of the machines broke down from the strain as the analyst fell back from his chair, finally ceasing in his convulsions, letting out one final soft scream until all signs of life and struggle ceased. \n\nUnexplainable and unknowable, Lovecraft ordered the entire project to be classified and hidden, with the data gathered all destroyed or sealed away with Providence having the only keys. As if his old paranoia and fear began to haunt him once more, the fear of the cosmic beyond gripped Lovecraft and his associates, proving that not all things must be known, and not all things can be."

I’m no economist, but from recent reading I’ve been able to form a rough picture of the dilemma - the need to restrict consumers’ goods & to pile up a needless plethora of producing equipment in order to maintain the irrational surplus called profit - which has caused orthodox economists like Hayek & Robbins to admit that only starvation wages & artificial scarcity could stabilize the profit system in future & avert increasing cyclical depressions of utterly destructive scope.’ \n’Laissez-faire capitalism is dead—make no mistake about that. The only avenue of survival for plutocracy is a military & emotional reactionary regime whereby millions of persons will be withdrawn from the industrial arena & placed on a dole or in concentration-camps with high-sounding patriotic names. That or socialism—take your choice. All this from an antiquated mummy who was on the other side until 1931! Well—I can better understand the inert blindness & defiant ignorance of the reactionaries from having been one of them. I know how smugly ignorant I was...’ \n’Industry should be socialized by degrees, & only as soon as the mass of the people are ready to back up the various absorptive moves. The government must dictate hours & wages, & see that employment is universally spread. If private industry can meet such rigidly enforced demands, well & good. If not - & it probably can’t - absorption will be in order. I can’t see that socialism would hurt anybody who is willing to work & who expects a just return from the work he performs - including guarantees of proper security in old age & in times of necessary unemployment or disability. A few can reason, & can see that capitalism is automatically doomed by the natural course of economics unless upheld by reactionary bayonets.’ \n’Actually, there are many persons of the highest character & most impeccable background who honestly think that a general communistic programme forms the only ultimate solution of the present breakdown of capitalism—a belief which they derive from the abstract & impersonal study of national resources & their distribution; & which does not, of course, necessarily involve any endorsement of the sudden social changes & absurd formal *ideologies* advocated by the orthodox Marxians & discontented European riffraff. Such persons do not wish to see all traditions & settled ways of living ripped up indiscriminately, but they do feel that mankind will not be able to continue its civilisation unless its stagnating inequalities of resources & opportunities are eventually diminished through some far-sighted plan of distribution & some adequate way of enforcing that plan. To them, some sort of communism (in each case suited to the history & traditions of the race involved) seems the only way to enforce a civilization-preserving economic plan—hence they believe it will have to come in the end. The number of these honest & analytical communists or semi-communists seems vastly on the increase.’ \n ’The nations of the Third Internationale form a very hopeful sign—for there the plutocrats are gradually backing down under the combined pressure of increased government supervision & the competing system of consumers’ cooperatives. Wider Afro-Asia is also well on the way. The United States has the handicap of a lawless pioneer tradition which exalts in individual gain to a grotesque extent—but even here the Northern-European temperament has softened the savagery of reaction. The major discovery as to general drift is sound - some people seem never able to realize that no great discovery comes forth without attendant clouds of error & half truth. And when bourgeois capitalism found it profitable to reach down to the still-submerged elements & cater to their crippled, repressed, & grotesquely unformed tastes... this huge market merely aggravated the trend away from real excellence towards showmanship & charlatanry. The suave bosses of a business ‘civilisation’ have no wish to improve the masses—rather the reverse.’ \n’I read the old *Communist Manifesto* many years ago; & even though then wholly out of sympathy with it, was impressed by some of the isolated points it brought out. Today I would sympathize on more counts—but even so, would not give it a 100% endorsement. There is no question of the vast intelligence & far-sightedness of Marx & Engels, & of the basic importance of the large economic principles they discovered & formulated. The only mistake is to think that every ramification they developed, & every inference they drew, is infallibly accurate & worthy of slavishly literal following under every conceivable set of circumstances."

Howard is largely famous for his beloved creation Conan the Barbarian - the muscular barbarian hero from the Hyborian Age. However, he has another creation that is all the more fitting in our new state, being the chainmail-bikini clad female warrior Red Sonja of Rogatino, sometimes spelled Sonya. First introduced in his story ‘The Shadow of the Vulture’, Red Sonya is a gun-slinging warrior woman of Polish-Ukrainian origin with a grudge against the great Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Great, and who later proves herself at the Battle of Mohács and the Siege of Vienna before going on numerous adventures of her own in later installments. The archetypal strong, wise, and independent heroine, Red Sonya has become one of the most popular pulp characters in the state. However, it would seem that there is more fact than fiction in her inspiration. \n\nRobert Howard has openly admitted that the Red Sonya of Rogatino from his works is inspired by Sonia Greene Lovecraft herself, wife and widow to Providence and the new herald of the Lovecraftian dream. With the origins of the character even echoing Sonia’s own origins, with Greene being born in the lands of Tsarist Russia before coming to America, the similarities are striking, and the public has noticed. Red Sonia has quickly become the nickname of our beloved matriarch given to her by the adoring masses, for the people see in her the same heroic and beautiful heroine they adore reading about, raising her to be the Socialist hero they have always needed. Under the real Red Sonia, our cosmic and aesthetic reformation shall go on unfettered and without limits, guarded by our own hero who leapt straight from the pages of pulp fiction and into our hearts."

While we have been floundering about, not knowing whether to eradicate the Irish, to subjugate them, or to simply ignore them as we erode their every right and liberty as Lovecraft builds his cultural hierarchy, these pests have only grown stronger and more organized. \n\nRallying around James Michael Curley, former mayor of Boston and Governor of Massachusetts with famous ties to the Irish Mob and to other avenues of corruption, these Irishmen have created their own version of the original IRA of their homeland in order to resist the genius of Providence. Due to our seemingly anti-American union ideas, anti-Irish stances, and attitudes of cultural supremacism, this Irish Republican Army of New England seeks to tear down the Angloid puppet that is the Lovecraftian state while ending the persecution of those Providence deems beastial and base, and now, due to our recent missteps and apprehensions, they are in the position to do so.

As we work to ‘de-Lovecraftify’ our verdant paradise here in the American Northeast, we must decide whether or not to stay with the Entente and Ottawa. If we remain in the Entente, we shall fight for Irish rights across the alliance and fight to ensure that the perfidious Anglos leave us Irishmen and our home isle alone, or we can simply stab them in the back and walk away for the good of all New Englanders."

Though he has been accused of ties with the local Irish Mob and of corruption on a massive scale, Curley still fights the good fight, trying to maintain Irish freedoms and safety against an Anglophilic regime that is increasingly growing anti-Irish.

Founded by James Michael Curley, the former Mayor of Boston and Governor of Massachusetts, this IRA is largely composed of Curley’s corrupt sycophants and loyalists, members of Irish-American organizations such as the Friends of Irish Freedom, Clan na Gael, the United Irish League, and the Ancient Order of the Hibernians, as well as by fanatic volunteers, anti-Anglo extremists, and even members of the Irish-American Mafia and other similar criminal organizations and figures such as ‘Big’ Bill Dwyer, Owney ‘The Killer’ Madden, Jack ‘Legs’ Diamond, Charles ‘Vannie’ Higgins, Vincent ‘Mad Dog’ Coll, the Winter Hill Gang, the Gustin Gang, the Gopher Gang, the Westies, and more. As such, this IRA has no qualms in doing anything they can to disrupt our administration.

Led by Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera - freedom fighters and fathers of Irish independence - the group now seeks asylum here in the only Ireland left standing as they plot and scheme a way to take back the homeland. However, seeing an opportunity like none other, President Curley has expressed his willingness to fully aid in the exiled IRA’s efforts. Offering economic aid or even total support in any coming war, Curley has announced solidarity with these fleeing sons of Éire, but now we must finally decide on an actual plan.

Most notably, Barlow has close ties to the Mexican ARM and Mexicayotl movement - two politically-opposed groups dedicated to Mesoamerican culture and identity. A world-renowned expert in Nahuatl himself, Barlow is known to have a deep fascination with Aztec mythology, even working to slowly fuse some of these ideas and cultural myths into the wider Lovecraftian Cosmic Mythos and Lovecraftism at large, with many Mesoamerican inspirations already appearing in Lovecraft’s recent works. Also a member of the Providence Circle, he also helps many of the other authors allied with Lovecraft such as Clark Ashton Smith, Frank Belknap Long, August Derleth, Henry S. Whitehead, Robert E. Howard, and many more in their combined efforts of expanding the Lovecraftian mythos and the Lovecraftist ideology while keeping them all in-line and fully loyal to Providence and His whims over all else.

In these Antarctic explorations expeditions, scientists and explorers have found a great many fascinating discoveries in the cold and wind-swept ice sheets of the Antarctic tundra; however while the German ‘Neuschwabenland’ mission goes on, the exploration of the frozen continent by American teams had been stopped abruptly upon the breakout of the Second American Civil War. The war has left many of the elder America's Antarctic explorers stranded at the bottom of the world without supply or communication with the outside world. One such abandoned adventurer was one Richard Evelyn Byrd, who had made frequent trips to the continent, expeditions which had proven to be source of inspiration for our Lovecraft, who was often fascinated by Antarctic expedition.\n Lovecraft was thrilled when he received news that Richard Byrd and his men had been rescued by a group of explorers operating under Providence’s orders, and even further delighted when Byrd urgently demanded a meeting with Lovecraft once he was made aware of his leadership position.\n\n The meeting between the two was a fascinating one, with Byrd proclaiming that during the long period when he was grounded in Antarctica, he had found the mythical ‘Mountains of Madness’ while flying an aeroplane over Kaiser Wilhelm II Land. In addition, Byrd claims to have saw strange flying crafts, witnessed unusual sightings of public figures thought to be dead and claimed to have found the gates to Agartha, a mythical land supposedly in the center of the earth. While Lovecraft has his doubts about the validity of Byrd’s claims, he has nonetheless granted him a position within the army of Providence, christening him as New England’s latest admiral and approving of further funding into Antarctic exploration.\n\n This newest planned expedition; if granted approval from Providence would seek to search for the supposed gate to Agartha and mountain ranges mentioned in ‘At the Mountains of Madness’, which Byrd claims to have found during his stay on the continent. It is unclear how much of any of these outlandish claims by the Admiral are true however, as the long and lonely winters are known to drive men to madness..."

Typically the demise of such expedition had come from bouts of starvation, freezing to death, or some other unfortunate accident; however one particular ill-fated expedition: one joint Norwegian-American expedition, had suffered a far more interesting and peculiar fate.\n\n Byrd’s explorers only discovered the camp at the tail end of the strange occurrence; finding only two nearly frozen survivors in the charred and destroyed encampment. Before these two explorers succumbed to the cold, they told a chilling story of the camp being ‘infected’ by a strange and terrifying organism that came from a crashed spacecraft; a spacecraft which their Norwegian counterparts found frozen in the vast Antarctic ice. According to the survivors, this organism seemingly infected first the members of the Norwegian crew, then eventually moved to infect the American crew after its infiltration of the camp disguised as a sled dog. Furthermore they claimed that the organism mimicked their colleagues down to the last detail, even copying their personalities and other aspects such as health issues.\n\n Following the revelation, both the Norwegian and American crews were driven to murder their teammates by the paranoia incited; with both parties eventually burning their respective camps to the ground in a last-ditch attempt to kill the ‘Thing’.\n\n While most members of the latest expedition has dismissed this occurrence as simply a case of apparently contagious mass hysteria, others within the expedition have pressured Byrd to look closer into this incident; especially considering the expedition's otherwise complete failure to turn up anything of substance."

Working with people like W.E.B Du Bois, Emma Goldman, Voltairine de Cleyre, Henry George, and more, Morton carved out his own reputation within the American Socialist space before striking up his own literary career and eventually befriending Providence himself, working together are friends and professional co-workers both in private and in their literary and translators union the Crafton Service Bureau. Instrumental in Lovecraft’s political evolution as well as his spiritual evolution as Morton’s own dabbling in the Bahá'í Faith inspired Lovecraft to greater questioning of the non-visible, metaphysical, and non-material, it is people like Morton that keep Lovecraft on the right track and within sane parameters as he builds his utopia for all."

Stressing the unity of all people across all faiths and cultures, the rejection of racism, sexism, and nationalism, and the amalgamated creation of a unified world order that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes, the Bahá'í Faith has become widely popular across the nation.

At worst they were ambushed by mobs and beaten or shot with a dozen such cases being reported in the weeks after the Massacre. Until now however these attacks were disorganized, sloppy and easily repelled. However, recently the attacks have become more frequent and more organized. This led to a sneaking suspicion of an organized resistance that was finally confirmed when a home made bomb left a British barracks in Montipilier a smouldering crater. That night in cities from Maine to New York thousands of flyers pasted any open space declaring the creation of the New Minutemen. The posters, which the British futilely tried to tear down before anybody could see, decried the British as baby killers and worse than their forefathers in 1776. They demanded New Englander self rule and the expulsion of the British garrison. Lastly, they called on all ‘loyal and freedom loving Americans’ to join them in their fight against the British."

There are many factions within the organization all pushing for a different post war New England. Some want New England to remain free from Canada and the US, some want New England to be the staging point for a further reunification of the United States, some push for a specific leader and others have other...unique ideas. As recent scholarship delves back into our Revolutionary past for legitimacy for our nascent nation, a troubling letter has been found in the Boston archives. Termed the Newbergh Letter it was sent by a group of soldiers led by Col Lewis Nicola to Washington. In the letter Nicola urges Washington to overturn the government that had been holding up army payments, centralize the country and declare himself King of the United States. Washington’s response has also been discovered and expectedly and unambiguously shoots down the proposal. While most of the country has celebrated this as another nugget of proof for America’s eternal hatred of tyrants, others have had a different view. Deemed the Mythos Minutemen, they claim that they have found secret correspondence between Washington and Nicola. They say these private letters tell that Washington was receptive to the idea of becoming King but just felt the time was never right to. This position has come under ferocious attack from all sides of the debate. The Army points to the fact that Nicola swiftly apologized for the suggestion and asked for forgiveness. Something he obviously would never have to do if Washington approved. Academics point to the fact that the Mythos Men refuse to release the letters to be appraised. Not only that but they do name many times during Washington's term as President where he could have probably easily taken the crown. This, and the anti-Royalist sentiment stoked by the mainstream Minutemen, have left the Mythos Men a very miniscule fraction of the larger organization. Despite this, the fact the faction even exists worries some."

As the alarm was raised and British soldiers rushed to the area they came under a hail of gunfire as Minutemen squads set up in the streets and homes around the Armory ambushed and tied down reinforcements. Within an hour it was over, the Minutemen melted back into the dark and the British had lost a significant amount of firepower. Little did they know however this was but the prelude to the main event. As the British crowded into the Armory to take stock of what just happened, a massive explosion turned the building into a fireball. Dozens if not more died and the British were thrown into chaos. The delayed mine was the signal and the Second Revolution began in earnest. Sleeper squads across the city rose from their beds, grabbed their guns and took to the streets. British soldiers across the city began to frantically call for backup as they came under attack from all sides. Command and Control collapsed almost instantly and, in bits and pieces, the British began to evacuate the city. Scenes much like this took place in major cities across New England. While some attacks failed, many more were smashing successes. The British are now reeling from this blow and all true Patriots celebrate this day, the beginning of the Second American Revolution. They don’t have long to celebrate however as the Canadians will not let their American holdings go without a fight. When the British strike back, who's to say if the Americans will survive."

While the Minutemen have a C&C his role was mostly administrative with each cell left more or less to their own devices. However if we are to win this war we need a Commander who can bring order to the budding chaos of the New England Army. Three men have taken center stage in the ‘race’ to be appointed. The first is General John Joseph Pershing. General ‘Black Jack’ Pershing is one of the premier soldiers alive in America today. His military career spans decades and under his command many generals of the Civil War, including the traitor MacArthur, learned the trade. His extensive knowledge of military science and his already apparent skill in leading troops (his local Minuteman section is one of the most successful in the entire organization) make him the obvious choice. Some however object to Pershing on the grounds that he is pushing up on 80 years old. They instead insist on Leslie Groves who has made his name working on ‘secret projects’ for the old US Government and in Nicaragua in the 20s.Groves is famed for his organizational talents and love of the cutting edge. Still others present a third option, Hiram Bingham III. While he is not as seasoned a military man as Groves or Pershing he is a veteran politician and an accomplished explorer. It was he, with the help of local farmers, who ‘discovered’ the ancient Incan site of Machu Picchu in 1911. He served as Lt Governor of Connecticut in 1922 before being elected to be Connecticut’s 69th Governor two years later. He held that position for a single day, the shortest term in the state’s history, before appointing himself to the Senate to fill a vacancy. He served in the Senate most notably on the President’s Aircraft Board which gave him the nickname ‘The Flying Senator’. In 1933 however he was beaten by his Democratic opponent, one of the few Democratic flips that year. Now he has put forward his name to lead the Minutemen because, as he puts it, ‘Peace lasts longer than War’."

To bring America's monarchy to life, government officials have met with the descendant of the proud George Washington and Robert E. Lee, Dr. George Bolling Lee. Living in the shadow of his larger-than-life ancestors, Lee has lived a rather mundane life as a gynecologist, practicing medicine for well over three decades.

As the remaining British forces in New England limp back home Minutemen have begun to flood into areas of New England that had been under British occupation since the start of the uprising. From Maine to Massachusetts church bells ring and loyal patriots from all walks of life party in the streets. Even if they were not active supporters of the Minutemen, they still celebrate the return of the much wanted peace. As British protection melts away those who collaborated with the British have followed their masters back to Canada. Those few who were too stubborn to leave now face the anger of their neighbors. Already reports are coming in of hundreds of deaths as lynch mobs expose and try known collaborators in kangaroo courts. Minutemen in those areas have been ordered to stop the violence but they have proven less than eager to with some units even joining the facade.

After talking with Lovecraft, Mulder has suggested the creation of an “X-Brigade”, to deal with the existence of alien life forms.

But the men soon realized that a coverup was not as easy as expected, and the saucer appeared to be 2-3 times larger than originally estimated. The massive craft was first dug out from the ground, while almost a brigade of loyal National Guard units sworn to secrecy and Providence’s elite guard loaded the craft on to a fleet of heavy trucks and drove it to a secluded location under the dead of night.

Rather than the naïve platitudes of the old order, cosmicism states that there is no recognizable divine presence such as a god in the universe, and that humans are particularly insignificant in the larger scheme of intergalactic existence. There is no higher purpose, nor grand notions of what we could conventionally call good or evil. There is only the infinite futility of existence, a fragile and delicate flash in the pan of a dark and uncaring universe barely registered by the cosmic gods that dwell beyond our perception and shape our reality through hypergeometry.

With his rise to prominence and political dominance however, The Shadow Over Innsmouth has undergone a beautiful and terrifying transformation not unlike that of the Deep Ones of the titular Innsmouth itself. Consisting of two parts, the first half of the book is written from the perspective of the narrator and essentially consists of various curated poems, letters, and speeches previously written by Providence. Several passages are addressed directly to the reader on the nature of New England heritage and narrator’s personal philosophy, who is clearly a stand-in for Providence himself. It is generally understood that this first section exists purely to equip the reader with essential knowledge and build their mental fortitude before the second half.\n\n The story then rapidly unravels into an epic tale and deep dive into the very heart of Lovecraft’s mythos. It is an autobiography, a fabricated story, a description of godhood, equal parts truth and lie, a how-to guide for apotheosis, a profane poem, a holy scripture, an apology for Lovecraft’s actions, a profane gesture to those who'd question his or New England’s legitimacy, and an explanation of how a meek and patient man could rise to such greatness. It is at once a terrifying look into the mind of Providence, a guide on how to become like Him, and an intensely disturbing and immersive story that would take a lifetime to process fully.\n\nWhile weaker minds have been driven to madness by Providence’s magnum opus, those capable of finishing his work without losing themselves emerge fundamentally changed.

newengland.262.d:0 "For Long, Lovecraft has had to share his power, and be propped up by the most Extreme Anglophiles in New England. However, the days where Lovecraft is a puppet of Elites is over. \n\n The Loyal Coalition, an organization that Lovecraft used to belong too has wielded the majority of power in New England and have ruled alongside Lovecraft ever since the Providence Society took power. Like Lovecraft, their popularity cam from the hatred of outsiders, mostly Irish Catholics. But, instead of the Loyal Coalition being propped up by proud, pure WASPS, they were propped up by the Astors and Vanderbilts. Elites that will stop at nothing for a quick buck, and that included stepping on this Nation’s Loyal Citizens. \n\n They fully expected that Lovecraft would never take action against them, that he would remain timid and stay in place. Did they know how he hated them, maybe; but Lovecraft was of no concern to them. He would never challenge their power. \n\n That is what they thought, and they thought wrong. \n\n Despite Lovecraft’s Agoraphobia, Paranoia and fear; being in practical charge of a large State has changed him. He was no puppet, and the time to finally get rid of the Elites was here. The big Businessmen who have ruined New England for so long would do so no longer. \n\n The Purge began at 11:00, when Loyal Divisions of the Providence Guard fanned into the streets of Boston, dragging so called “Enemies of Purity” from their homes and offices, and some into Delta Green Black Sites. There, anything awaits them; and none of it can possibly be good. \n\n Even though some tried to resist, Lovecraft’s grip on the nation had become too strong. The Populace, the Military and the Bureaucracy were all loyal to him and him alone, something that the Elites weren’t counting on.\n\n By the end of the night, names were carefully crossed of lists as one by one, Lovecraft’s Enemies were Killed, Arrested or somehow, were condemned to a fate even worse."

As brother fights brother in a battle for the soul of the United States, the isolated citizens of New England have begun to become disenchanted with the ideals and promises of republicanism and democracy. In the wake of this turmoil, many previously-fringe political movements have begun to garner more support, such as the monarchists. Inspired by our new Canadian overlords and the oft-repeated myth of a monarchist Washington, the monarchists seek to create a truly American monarchy, complete with its own distinct royal line. Though they draw inspiration from the great general Washington and the British exiles in the True North, they seek to firmly establish New England sovereignty with the creation of a new dynasty to rule Yankeeland, entirely separate from the Canucks, as they feel bowing to an English monarch would be a betrayal of Revolutionary-era ideals.

The great and affluent families of New England, such as the Kennedys, Astors, or Vanderbilts all have begun to feel the pull of this fanciful ideology. Drawing Hoping to become the new aristocracy of this new potential New Englander kingdom, these rich families of monopoly barons, political titans, and esteemed businessmen all have begun to fancy and support the idea of a Kingdom on American soil; an idea once thought to be antithetical to the American Dream and our founding principles. Despite the apparent contradictions to the land’s founding ideals, these titans of industry have started to demand the allocation of Royal Titles to themselves and their families as they seek to officially become true nobility over their fellow New Englanders. Even worse, they have stated that if the titles aren’t granted, they would begin to support “alternate channels” to gain legitimacy and influence. We could just grant them the titles, as currently they hold little meaning in our republic, or run the risk by not granting them the titles, possibly driving them into the arms of the various separatist groups in our nation.

Drawing inspiration from the old myth that George Washington himself held a secret desire to be king as well as from the British exiles in Canada, the rich and affluent of our nation have fully abandoned the ideals of Republicanism. With their ascension to the forefront of our nation’s politics, the allure of monarchism can be felt from Buffalo to Augusta as great families like the Kennedys or Vanderbilts have begun to use their exorbitant wealth to finance monarchist-aligned separatist groups across New England. Seeking to use these rebels as a tool to gain power for themselves, they have infiltrated cell after cell of these monarchist groups in order to control more of the separatists by the day. If our administration doesn’t act soon, New England may fall to monarchical rule for the first time since the Thirteen Colonies still stood.

It seems that the appointment comes as an attempt to create a New Englander aristocracy, akin to the British noble class. There are even some whispers that Kennedy, among others, threatened the Crown with rebellion if they did not receive their due rewards for their loyalty. Regardless, it is apparent that this is just another step for the Kennedys as they climb the political ladder, and they can now claim an official status as nobles. For his part, Kennedy is said to be ecstatic, viewing his new title of “Baron Kennedy” as a triumph over the Boston Brahmins who have discriminated against him his whole life.

It seems that he had to do little more than meet with the King to secure himself a position in the growing New Englander nobility. Henceforth, Astor will be titled as “Duke Astor”, and the House of Astor will play an even more prominent role in New Englander politics than before. Astor’s rapid accumulation of wealth, power, and prestige has been met differently than one may expect of the Astor family, whose reputation is of ruthless business acumen. Instead, Vincent Astor is determined to clear his family’s name through philanthropy and other means. Ironically, he means to accomplish this change through the same means his family used to gain power to begin with. The creation of the House of Astor, however, may afford him new opportunities to shape his family’s image and grow his own prestige as one of the most powerful nobles in New England."

This match would tie the two families, and the two regions, closer together, while also securing the Kennedy family’s influence for decades to come. However, many wonder if the Kennedys, a family that is rumored to engage in corruption behind closed doors, are really worthy of the match.

If we wish to have a respectable government, this is a system that clearly needs reform. To do so, some have proposed we create a parliamentary system for the entire government, or perhaps just abolish the Senate and create a new ‘House of Lords’, like the old institution of the same name in Britain.

Vincent Astor, head of the wealthy and influential Astor family, has potential as a suitor, and it appears that he and Ingrid of Sweden have exchanged several private letters recently, though the contents of these letters are unknown to the public. In the Vanderbilt family, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, the widow of the late Reginald Vanderbilt, is still young, and could easily remarry, though to whom it is unclear. Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, the son of the elder Alfred Vanderbilt who died on the Titanic, seems more interested in horse racing than he is in women, but he has a number of suitors in Europe who could use an influx of wealth into their once wealthy families. The Kennedy family, looking to replicate the success they enjoyed with their son Robert, has looked to secure powerful matches for their other sons as well, though the reputation of the sons as womanizers has not helped in this department. As a whole, the allure of American wealth has caused many who would otherwise turn their nose at the idea of marrying into such families to reconsider. Only time will tell how many more matches will be made, but this is certainly the beginning of the integration of the American elite into the European."

Even the King has publicly voiced his approval of the nobility, and their leadership has been crucial in the road to recovery for the American economy. Further, with the support of these local elites, the Entente has crushed any resistance in its infancy, and the Syndicalists pose little danger now.

When the Civil War broke out, Trump was able to flee the city proper and move north to New England, owing this quick escape in no small part to the money he has made in the real-estate industry. The man is a prime candidate for an ennoblement, an extending hand into our nobility. However, his history is somewhat controversial for some of our more liberally-minded politicians.

newengland.287.d:0 "It is now time for the Electoral College to be held once again. With a strong proclamation from the king as always, it was officially opened with much of the American populace arguing and standing by to see who would come out on top. It has been many years since the Second American Civil War, and a new generation has appeared without knowing the horrors their predecessors had to face. Soon enough, America will only remember the time of Kings.  Of course, there are now new faces vying for the throne and it is up to the Electoral College to select the next King of America. As expected, our current King also stands to continue his reign, but only the Electoral College can determine who will lead America now."

###Liberal Victory###
newengland.122.t:0 "Syndicalists felled"
newengland.122.d:0 "We have felled the syndicalists, with our armies taking Boston after a brief battle with the syndicalists in Boston. With our victory, liberalism is safe and Canadian influence has been kept away from New England and although it may take awhile the recover our losses the revolutionary left is finished in New England. With this victory elections will be held shortly."
newengland.122.a:0 "Great"

###Sentinels###
newengland.130.t: "Settling Business"
newengland.130.d:0 "With the spread and victory of the Sentinels, the du Pont and Pitcairn families and their allies who are the main movers of the organization on the largest level have taken an eye towards the businesses of the New England families whom aligned themselves with 'Federalism' in an attempt the dominate the economic sphere. With the tables turn, a debate has broken out within the organization, with the Pitcairn's wanting to demand a 'fee' from them for their disloyalty to liberty and the du Pont faction preferring to utilize our militias at once to push them out of the region and seize their territory and businesses to ensure they do not get a second chance to destroy us."
newengland.130.a:0 "Push them out"
newengland.130.b:0 "Demand a fee!"

newengland.131.t:0 "Worker's Strike!"
newengland.131.d:0 "Worker's in one of the du Pont's industrial chemistry factories have begun to strike following a string of deaths they blame on 'unsafe working conditions'. This is utterly unbelievable as they had freely sold their labor under contract and are now attempting to extort a business they could leave following the end of their contract or, following egoist thought, if they were strong enough to resist it. This socialism needs to be stomped out at once."
newengland.131.a:0 "Fire them all"
newengland.131.b:0 "Send the militia"

newengland.132.t:0 "Fate of Jewish Business"
newengland.132.d:0 "It is no secret that many in the Sentinels, especially du Pont and Alexander Lincoln hold strongly anti-Semitic views, associating Jews with socialist subversion, racial inferiority and hostility to Anglo-Saxons. However, not all Sentinels are eager to back these views, with some merely being practical businessmen who would rather cut a deal with Jewish-owned businesses and one of the more intellectual wings of the Sentinels, the Egoists, not being enthusiastic about such plans. As such while seizing these businesses would be welcome to the most militant Sentinels it would see some slight pushback."
newengland.132.a:0 "Force them out"
newengland.132.b:0 "Have them trade with us"

newengland.133.t:0 "Independence of Boston"
newengland.133.d:0 "While our combination of dissolving the state with the expansion of the Sentinels and its military has seen the end of many former political entities with the dominance of either towns, business, individuals or us, Boston remains an issue under James Michael Curley's political machine. Promising the population protection from instability the machine continues to exist with its own police force, promising a continuation of democracy on their own level. We could allow this but having one of the largest trade hubs under their control, even if they do not stand in our way and allow us to do business there, would be less than ideal."
newengland.133.a:0 "Dismantle the machine. By force."
newengland.133.b:0 "Allow it for loyalty"

newengland.134.t:0 "Battle with Vermont"
newengland.134.d:0 "The state of Vermont under the leadership of George Aiken has refused to dismantle its government and allow the Sentinel form of government to take charge. Without federal funding they are strapped for resources however, so we could simply push into their territory now, although it would cost us some men."
newengland.134.a:0 "Take the territory"
newengland.134.b:0 "Tolerate them"

newengland.135.t:0 "Survival of the Fittest"
newengland.135.d:0 "Among the top Sentinels most fervent beliefs is in Social Darwinism, believing that a philosophy of survival of the fittest creates a stronger people. However, some of the businesses we have been taking have been pushing back with firearms of their own, and to take the lands of homeowners and force them to pay rent to us would be even more difficult even if we have the largest show of force at the moment. As such, many would have us slow our expansionism to focus on consolidating our men while we deal with these men through contract instead of force."
newengland.135.a:0 "Use Contracts"
newengland.135.b:0 "No, keep expanding"

newengland.136.t:0 "Children attempt to escape!"
newengland.136.d:0 "A group of children attempted to escape from one of our orphanages in New Hampshire! Growing restless with their workweeks after signing contracts in return for food and board, they broke out late at night after stealing supplies and were recaptured the next day. Even with our dominance of the area many are sympathetic of these children, causing an appeal for them not to be penalized."
newengland.136.a:0 "Extend their contracts"
newengland.136.b:0 "A single allowance"

###Radicals###
newengland.140.t:0 "The Fate of Democracy"
newengland.140.d:0 "A grand debate is threatening to tear apart the entire Remnant group, a disagreement over the role and nature of democracy within the framework of liberty. While most of the members are in the hardline Nockian and Mencken wing, viewing democracy as a grave threat to liberty, for if the people can vote the uninformed masses will be unfortunately beguiled by hucksters promising them 'redistribution' and 'social justice'. However, there is still a smaller faction that advocates for the democratic system to be upheld, for the love of liberty was enshrined in it. They propose that the Bill of Rights should be simply expanded to make implementing welfare and foolish populism simply impossible. Which of these stances shall persevere and guide our nation forward?"
newengland.140.a:0 "The Nockian Policy"
newengland.140.b:0 "The Moderated Policy"

newengland.150.t:0 "The Reconstruction of Tammany Hall"
newengland.150.d:0 "Prior to the civil war, Tammany Hall was at the core of the Democratic Party in New York. Viewed by syndicalists as a symbol of bourgeoisie exploitation and corruption, it was torched when the CSA seized the city in the opening days of the war, and would have been completely destroyed had local leaders not redirected the required resources to more pressing matters. Now with New York City in our hands, we must begin to reestablish symbols of liberalism in the area. Local construction magnates have drafted plans to repair the hall, and are simply awaiting government approval."
newengland.150.a:0 "Begin repairs immediately"

###Democracy###

newengland.160.t:0 "Curley Investigated"
newengland.160.d:0 "As apart of our investigation of the political machines in our region, it seems Democratic party leader James Michael Curley is now finally under investigation for corruption, specifically spreading and accepting bribes. This has led to outrage as the Democratic newspapers and Curley himself claim that this is a Republican ploy to undermine their enemies."
newengland.160.a:0 "Let him complain"

newengland.161.t:0 "Philip Buccola Arrested"
newengland.161.d:0 "New England Mob Boss Philip Buccola has been arrested for smuggling, tax evasion, murder and a host of other crimes. While a conviction for the head of the Boston crime family is unlikely it at least represents their dwindling power he could be arrested to begin with and is associated with the arrest of mafia soldiers as well."
newengland.161.a:0 "Good"

###Stoddard###
newengland.162.t:0 "New Immigration Laws"
newengland.162.d:0 "When Professor S. M. Terman conducted a New York study regarding the intelligence of children from different racial origins, his findings were astounding. He found that Northern European immigrants or descendants had I.Q.'s that were, on average, 20 points higher than those of the Southern European subjects! This is an astounding difference, and Terman also concluded that superior intelligence is five times as common among those of superior social status. So, having established that there is a difference, we now must look at immigration levels. Southern and Eastern Europeans have higher birth rates than those in Northern and Western Europe, and even worse, they are coming to our shores in much larger numbers. If we wish to maintain our current I.Q. levels or even improve them, we cannot continue to allow such immigration. As such, we have decided to outright ban immigration from such nations, as well as a few Asian nations that immigrants commonly come from. However, we are now faced with a harder decision. Should we apply these standards to impure populations in the warring regions of America to our south?"
newengland.162.a:0 "Yes, apply it across the board"
newengland.162.b:0 "No, they are purer and we need the manpower"

newengland.163.t:0 "Categorize the Races"
newengland.163.d:0 "All in Stoddard's administration agree that the work of categorizing the races is important, and yet, few can agree on what the categories should be. Lothrop Stoddard personally  takes his influence from William Ripley's work and advocates the existence of five major racial groups: White, Yellow, Brown, Black, and Red. Within the White group, there are several subcategories, including Nordics, Alpines, and Mediterraneans. Madison Grant largely agrees with these assertions, though he places more value on the Mediterranean race than Stoddard does. A different theorist, Carleton S. Coon, believes in the existence of different categories, with a Caucasoid race in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Western India. He also believes in a division of Sub-Saharan African between Congoid and Capoid races, while East Asia and the Americas are under the Mongoloid race and Australasia and Central India are in the Australoid race. The ideas of Stoddard and Coons are the main theories in the academic community now, but which should we choose? Whatever we choose, it will help us begin to implement Stoddard's vision in New England. However, we may have to put some parts of our society on hold while we conduct the survey."
newengland.163.a:0 "The Stoddard Model"
newengland.163.b:0 "The Coon Model"

newengland.164.t:0 "Categorization Finished!"
newengland.164.d:0 "After about two months, we have finally finished our study of the different peoples of New England and their racial origins. We can now effectively divide them depending on their status, and begin to sterilize those who belong to degenerate or inferior groups."
newengland.164.a:0 "Towards a Progressive future!"

newengland.165.t:0 "Our Friends in the South"
newengland.165.d:0 "It is time for us to decide how we will help our friends in the Klan. Lothrop Stoddard himself is a member of the Klan, and he has found himself sympathizing with their cause in the Second American Civil War. There are several different ways in which we could grant aid to the Constitutional American Republic. We could send a few thousand volunteers and a decent amount of equipment to bolster them, if that is what we believe would benefit them the most. On the other hand, we could mostly send them equipment with just a few hundred volunteers to go along with the shipment, and this would assist in their war effort if we believe they are low on supplies. We could also pick a middle ground between these two options. What should we do?"
newengland.165.a:0 "A middle ground option."
newengland.165.b:0 "They need more men!"
newengland.165.c:0 "They need more equipment!"

newengland.166.t:0 "Degenerate Segregation"
newengland.166.d:0 "The sun has risen on an important day in New England. Today, Lothrop Stoddard has ordered the military and private security forces to begin rounding up the disabled, the insane, and the degenerates in our society and send them away from the rest of the population. Only Stoddard and his close advisors know the details of this separation, but they will not be killed or harmed in any serious way and will be allowed to continue their lives in their new settlements. It will be similar to segregation in the South, though it will include those of lower value even if they are White. This change is for the better; we must ensure there is not contamination in the gene pool if we are to see Stoddard's vision to completion. To be absolutely sure that these elements do not escape and continue to reproduce with the rest of the population, there are whispers that the most inferior groups will be sterilized, so that eventually, only our superior men and women will remain. The higher grades of unsoundness would not be sterilized, but kept separate nonetheless, and through education, we will ensure that our population is enlightened and fully in support of this task."
newengland.166.a:0 "Let us nurture a racial conscience in our society!"

newengland.167.t:0 "Join the American Sphere?"
newengland.167.d:0 "With the Civil War over and the Constitutional American Republic victorious, we are now faced with a choice. Lothrop Stoddard is a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and he has many friendly feelings towards the Nationalist cause, feelings that are returned in full. Thousands of our people have filled the streets, clamoring for us to proclaim allegiance of one sort or another to our southern neighbor. For their part, the Americans have promised Stoddard a good deal of autonomy to control New England, so long as we are ultimately loyal to their cause. This is likely due in equal part to their trust of Stoddard and their current inability to provide for our population as well as theirs. Accepting this offer will be sure to anger Canada, but they have little choice in the matter. They cannot hope to face the combined might of a rebellious New England and a vengeful and war-ready America, nor would they want to, having more important conflicts to worry about with the Syndicalists in Europe. Still, they will surely ask for economic concessions of some sort from the Americans. Should we go through with this?"
newengland.167.a:0 "We will eagerly await the American response!"
newengland.167.b:0 "On second thought..."

newengland.168.t:0 "Helping True Americans?"
newengland.168.d:0 "The Civil War has raged on for years without an end in sight, the Constitutional American Republic could use our help. We have given them material aid and small numbers of volunteers before, primarily in the aid of the NDWL and Ku Klux Klan, but the best way for us to help their cause would be to intervene outright. Such an intervention would not be sanctioned by Canada, and they have told us they will not join us directly, though we know they have mulled over interventions of their own. Should we go to war and aid our Southern brothers, or stay out of the matter entirely?"
newengland.168.a:0 "They need us!"
newengland.168.b:0 "It is not our fight..."

newengland.169.t:0 "Last Bastion of American Civilization"
newengland.169.d:0 "With the Nationalists defeated in the Civil War raging in the south, we are left as the only government willing to do what must be done to ensure the continuation of our species. Not only that, but we are also the only government left willing to ensure its future prosperity, a future in which a pure superior mankind rules the day. It is tragic that we were unable to assist the Constitutional American Republic more in their time of need, but we have solace in the fact that our work has progressed well here in New England, and our independence is guaranteed by Canada and the rest of the Entente. We will now commit to the Entente's struggle with the Under-men in Europe!"
newengland.169.a:0 "For New England!" 

newengland.170.t:0 "Canada Offers New England For a Price"
newengland.170.d:0 "With the Civil War over and our faction having won, the fears in Canada of a Syndicalist southern neighbor are extinguished. The original pretense for their invasion was to protect New England from the leftist brutes both inside and outside their borders, but now both threats are gone, and they rightly believe that we want our land back. However, the Canadians, ever the crafty negotiators, have demanded economic compensation for 6 months for their protection of New England while the Civil War raged. Some of our advisors cry that this is an outrageous offer, but if we want New England back, we may as well just give them what they want and be done with it. What should we do?"
newengland.170.a:0 "Fine, fine, they can have their money..."
newengland.170.b:0 "We'll get it back another way..."

newengland.171.t:0 "New England Decision"
newengland.171.d:0 "The Constitutional American Republic has emerged victorious in the Civil War to our south, and now they are asking for New England back. Though it might be painful to lose New England from our sphere, we have more important things to worry about. Besides, we could extract concessions from them that would prove useful in our war in Europe. What should we do?"
newengland.171.a:0 "Send the offer."
newengland.171.b:0 "New England is ours!"

newengland.172.t:0 "An Agreement is Reached!"
newengland.172.d:0 "After much negotiation, the Americans have decided to accept the Canadian offer, and now we will be a part of their sphere rather than part of the Canadian one. This is a new day for New England, and the world will tremble at our united forces!"
newengland.172.a:0 "Hurrah!"

newengland.173.t:0 "No Agreement!"
newengland.173.d:0 "Despite our best hopes, it seems that Canada and America could not find an agreeable settlement to return New England to American control. This is devastating, but we will persist nonetheless!"
newengland.173.a:0 "A sad day..."

newengland.174.t:0 "Better Babies Contests"
newengland.174.d:0 "The so-called "Better Baby" contests are commonplace competitions that have been held in recent decades, usually in state fairs throughout the US in which babies between the ages of 6 and 48 months were judged for their health. Nurses and physicians judged infants participating in the contest on mental health, physical health, and physical appearance. The best children, in eugenic terms, have the biological potential to become the country's future elite. Such children should be given special care, be sent to the best schools and, if they are truly fit, even sent to universities. However, there are voices of criticism that say the initiative, although useful to promote healthy and superior lines, will not be successful because birth does not mean everything. Such critics are mostly from the environmentalist school of thought in Biology, believing that human intelligence and nature itself is derived from environmental factors rather than inborn characteristics. Shall we prove them wrong?"
newengland.174.a:0 "Social support for winning children must be guaranteed"
newengland.174.b:0 "This is a useful initiative"

newengland.175.t:0 "Negro Project"
newengland.175.d:0 "Birth control activist Margaret Sanger has postulated an initiative to provide Southern Black women and families with access to birth control and other forms of contraception. Free access to contraception and abortion would reduce the birth rate in the African-American community and act as a predecessor to more extreme programs in the future. However, this raises concerns that sex education, voluntary fertility control, and abortion access for the Black population will result in Black communities having fewer but healthier and more active children. Others have argued that such a program would also embolden those of superior genes to use contraceptives as well, something that is infeasible in our current genetic makeup. Some organizations, such as the Eugenics Board of North Carolina, have previously advocated a combination of sex education programs with the compulsory sterillization of black women who do not graduate from school. Which variant of the program will we choose?"
newengland.175.a:0 "The segregation so far is sufficient"
newengland.175.b:0 "Sex education and access to contraception costs little and will pay off in the future"
newengland.175.c:0 "Both contraception program and sterilization program are necessary"

newengland.176.t:0 "The Jewish Question"
newengland.176.d:0 "The Jewish question has turned out to be less of a question and more of a fiery debate. It was known to New Englander science that the Jews were not a separate race, but rather a mixture of different races with different attributes. For this reason, there was a problem with their racial qualification. Some politicians and acitivists, like Harry H. Laughlin, opposed any migration of Jews. Lothrop Stoddard considered Ashkenazi Jews as being influenced by Asian and Turkish races, which would make them completely inferior. At the same time, he considered Western European Sephardic Jews valuable to society. Even if they did not keep pure Hebrew blood, any foreign influences would come from European peoples. Many Sephardim have already made a positive record in US history (such as Judah Benjamin and Morris Jacob Raphall). The most complicated (and probably the most effective) of the proposals would involve examining each Jew separately and judging him for his IQ, body build, or skull shape. This research make it possible to find the most valuable elements and possibly obtain them for the new America."
newengland.176.a:0 "Total segregation of Jewish communities"
newengland.176.b:0 "Tolerance and acceptance of the Sephardim"
newengland.176.c:0 "Encourage further scientific study of Jews"

newengland.177.t:0 "Superman, the Man of Tomorrow"
newengland.177.d:0 "Today, there is a new 'Action Comics' comic, complete with a new superhero named "Superman". The main character is not a human but rather an alien, originating from a planet where his kind were gifted with numerous abilities. These powers included being faster than a speeding bullet, being more powerful than a locomotive, and even being able to leap tall buildings at a single bound. He owed all these abilities to centuries of eugenic programs carried out in his homeland - the mysterious planet Krypton. Although comic books are primarily entertainment for children, some people wish to use it in an educational campaign aimed at children and teenagers. However, there are voices complaining that the comic book was created by Jewish authors Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. They argue that Superman does not promote positive values, and instead corrupts the youngest minds in our society. One particularly vocal critic of this comic, as well as the comic industry in general, is German immigrant Fredric Wertham, who argues that comics cause delinquency. For his part, the owner of the publishing house printing the comic has also spoken up. The owner, controversial former military officer Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, emphasizes that the comic book has an educational value and is a manifestation of 'truly American art'."

newengland.178.t:0 "Sterilization of Criminals"
newengland.178.d:0 "In 1876, the Italian scientist Cesare Lombroso published his most important book, 'L'uomo delinquente' or  'Criminal Man' (this American edition was published in New York in 1911). Lombroso's general theory suggested that criminals are distinguished from noncriminals by multiple physical anomalies. He postulated that criminals represented a reversion to a primitive or subhuman type of person characterized by physical features reminiscent of apes, lower primates, and early humans. Such features are to some extent preserved, he said, in modern 'savages'. The behavior of these biological 'throwbacks' will inevitably be contrary to the rules and expectations of modern civilized society. Almost all scholars, including famous anthropologists such as Charles A. Ellwood, agree that the sterilization of hereditary criminals could benefit society as a whole. For some, such a solution would be insufficient, and they go beyond mere criminals. They question whether it would not be practical to sterilize people with criminal records but also those with physical characteristics suggesting that they are predisposed to commit a crime. This radical solution, however, has critics among scientists, including the late Charles Buckman Goring. They argue that the differences in the physical structure of criminals and ordinary people are marginal and fall within the bounds of statistical error. Further, many lawyers claim that preventive sterilization is incompatible with state constitutions, but they see no objection to the sterilization of convicts. What should we do?"
newengland.178.a:0 "We only sterilize convicted prisoners"

newengland.179.t:0 "Religious Leaders Criticize Eugenics Programs"
newengland.179.d:0 "Religious leaders have for years criticized the initiation of programs to sterilize racially unworthy populations. Now that we have begun to implement such programs in full, many of them have spoken up in dismay. They believe our actions are breaking up families and rejecting God's laws. Catholics are particularly radical in their attitudes towards our eugenics program. After the Pope condemned eugenics, as well as women's empowerment, in the 1931 encyclical 'Casti connubii', most clerics called for a boycott of our teachings and now our programs. Some Protestant churches also equate sterilization with abortion. For this reason they are against it."

The winner of this referendum would become the leader of the nation and  Likewise, with only a few Supreme Court justices still remaining both alive and credible, this would effectively hand the Supreme Court to the victor, and allow for appointees in occupied areas to be decided via an informal proportional representation depending on the results of the referendum. As some in [COR.GetNameDef] believe this is a ruse meant to give Stoddard control over America when others have worked so hard to secure a victory, and they  are demanding they bend the knee to the will of the people."

newengland.184.t:0 "Human Betterment Foundation"
newengland.184.d:0 "The 'Human Betterment Foundation' was an American eugenics organization established in Pasadena, California in 1928 by E.S. Gosney. It primarily served to compile and distribute information about compulsory sterilization legislation in the United States for the purposes of eugenics. Some members of the organization, including employees of numerous scientific institutions, went further than merely publishing and agitating for forced sterilization. For example, Lewis Terman was a pioneer in performing IQ tests to help determine the eligibility of individuals to participate in sterilization programs. Justin Miller was a judges who often adjudicated the sterilization of criminals and an activist to limit immigration from Asian countries. Miller was temporarily an executive officer of the California State Commission on Immigration and Housing as well. Despite the sincere enthusiasm of its members, the activities of the organization were previously limited. Will we give them government support? Or will we limit ourselves only to recognizing their activities?"

newengland.185.t:0 "Eugenics in the Southern States"
newengland.185.d:0 "The implementation of eugenics programs met unprecedented resistance in the Southern states. This is not surprising because a large part of the local White poor has a low IQ level. In fact, according to data collected by John R. Commons, at least 6 percent of the white population should be sterilized. Due to the resistance of the white population, the attempts to start sterilization programs so far have been aimed at people of color, mostly black women who were sterilized without their knowledge during gynecological visits or childbirth, as well as mulattoes. For the eugenics concept, some support was also obtained from the southern elite. Among others, the supporters of the eugenics cause include industrialist Henry Ford, lawyer Malcolm Donald, members of military personnel like George Van Horn Moseley and Wickliffe Preston Draper, and even Young Klan Members like James A. Colescott and Hiram Wesley Evans himself. There is still a risk that the rapid inclusion of white populations in sterilization programs will increase social resistance. How shall we proceed?"

newengland.186.t:0 "Mormon Eugenics" 
newengland.186.d:0 "Initially, Mormon preachers and missionaries were opposed to any attempt at birth control, and female activists were particularly active in this field. Julina Lambson Smith, the wife of LDS Church President Joseph F. Smith and mother of Mormon apostle Joseph Fielding Smith, instructed teachers to warn Mormon women against the evils of Birth Control. It should also be noted that during Joseph Smith's lifetime, Mormons had been viewed as racially inferior to Whites because of their perceived friendliness towards peoples of African descent (which, in the Jacksonian Era, was something no respectable whites engaged in). However, the initiatives of racial segregation appeared quickly. The Utah Legislature passed an anti-miscegenation law in 1888 which prohibited marriage 'between a negro and a white person'. Over time, subsequent postulates of eugenics were increasingly accepted by the Mormon community. In 1929, however, legislation was introduced to sterilize the disabled, intellectually handicapped, and sex offenders. Apostle John A. Widtsoe’s support of eugenics was reflected in his writings, where he wrote 'the present agitation for eugenics is really for more information... it is in this direction that eugenics work is now being done in Utah, and very probably nothing more important can be done in behalf of the science for some years to come.' Some Mormon preachers in 19th century, including B. H. Roberts, Joseph F. Smith and even George Q. Cannon, went even further and endeavored to use eugenic arguments to justify the practice of polygamy. In their opinion, a worthy man with many worthy wives was able to sire numerous and valuable offspring. Will we allow the Mormons to pursue their own eugenics agenda?"

newengland.187.d:0 "New England has had a long tradition of creating private police forces. In the past, they were supposed to provide protection against bandits, pursue horse thieves, or assist the state police. The most famous and also most numerous such formation was The Coal and Iron Police from Pennsylvania. It was established by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1865 but employed and paid by the various coal companies in the area. The task of this policeforce was to guard the property of mining and production plants, protect businessmen, and prevent violent strikes. The services of this private company are used primarily by great industrial magnates such as members of the Rockefeller, Carnegie, and du Pont families. The methods used by Coal and Iron Police were considered particularly brutal, which is why some politicians from the old system, including Gifford Pinchot and Michael Musmanno, demanded that it be dissolved. Today, however, the old politicians do not play any role, and it is up to us to decide the future of this police force."

Many former criminal organizations can now, at least in theory, operate openly and become legitimate entrepreneurs. Among the groups that have decided to operate openly, some notable groups include the so-called 'Gustin Gang' from South Boston and the organization led by Stefano 'The Undertaker' Magaddino from Buffalo. Private security agencies, founded by the citizens themselves, will watch over these businesses like all the others and at the same time will prevent other still possible crimes such as assaults, murders, and kidnapping."

newengland.189.d:0 "The seizure of property from those who did not accept Sentinel policies occurred simultaneously with several anti-Jewish incidents. Albert Jay Nock is known to personally have a low opinion of Jews, and so it is not surprising that this turn of events has occurred. Nock's argument was that the Jews were an Oriental people, acceptable to the intelligent Occidental yet forever strangers to the Occidental mass-man. In this way, he interpreted the perception of Jews in the eyes of the masses: a significant part of Jews earned money by producing nothing, only speculating and gambling in the stock exchange. In his opinion, such Jewish activities were no different from the usual petty deceptions and swindles of criminals. However, he did not want to apply either collective responsibility or involuntary oppression to the Jewish people. Some elites, such as Henry Louis Mencken, were much more critical of this group however, and felt that they should leave New England."

There were many mutual accusations of racketeering or forcible expulsion among these conflicts. Clashes between the militia connected with the Nordic League and the organizations of immigrants of Italian origin (like the infamous 'Black Hand') are particularly brutal. Irénée du Pont believes that followers of Lothrop Stoddard should be supported in limiting the influence of mafia organizations. Others, like Gaspare Messina as well as entrepreneurs like Enoch L.

Whether it be because of recent events or their own interests, Lermond's request for an alliance with us makes for some interesting possibilities regarding the coming conflict.

This arrangement, he argues, would have to be on New Englander terms. From what we can discern, this would mean that we would have little-to-no direct control over the affairs of the country. In other words, they would be an independent ally just as the other members of the Entente. Though this would not harm us and would in fact likely be a relief to our financial advisors, there are other considerations. The presence of a socialist country in the Entente, regardless of how much they have distanced themselves from the syndicalists, could make us look like hypocrites. On the other hand, the presence of a functioning socialist nation that is not insane may give us a perfect example to hold up against the Internationale, and the New Englanders would essentially serve as useful tools. On top of that, we could use all the help we could get in our war to restore the British and French empires. What should we do?"

It was a dubious claim at first, but soon more leaflets came down the Hudson, holding promises from Norman Lermond himself that he would allow them into his utopia in the making, and that he was a man who had made equality colonies and communes before, and so many would-be refugee’s accepted. The fighting was distant yet still audible as the group continued on; the cold was rough but the rumble of artillery behind them was all the inspiration they needed to know not to stop. The next they knew, signs and helpful farmers were guiding them into the newly assembled village of wood and brick cottage on a grassy bed by the Hudson, with government and charity workers offering them freshly made meals.

One of the first stations to use Frequency Modulation, or FM, broadcasting in the nation, WGTR has agreed to attempt a radical new idea courtesy of direct funding and support from President Lermond himself. Drawing on inspiration from Edward Bellamy’s love of the concept of a national radio program, President Lermond has brought Bellamy’s dream to fruition with the debut of the National Cable Radio Show. Operating as a form of continuous programming to entertain and inform the masses of New England, this revolutionary 24-hour broadcast features rotating performers and hosts, discussing topics from local and international news to comedy sketches and informative Socialist propaganda. Filling the airwaves ceaselessly with state-funded, creatively-free programming to entertain the masses, President Lermond with the help of WGTR has created a modern marvel in mass entertainment. With hit programs like the Yankee Weatherman with John MacDonald and The Midnight Zone, hosted by famed New England author H. P. Lovecraft, filling the airwaves on a weekly basis, the people of New England have never known such leisure and excitement, and radios have never been more popular."

However, chief among his natural loves are the great, sturdy pines that make up much of his native Maine’s oldwood forests, and molluscs, from the lowliest chitons to the more captivating nudibranchs or cephalopods. Particularly loving marine forms of mollusc, sea snails have long fancied our aging President, with his collection of seashells alone numbering in the thousands and himself even having a species named after him. This love and wealth of knowledge has not wallowed in uselessness behind closed doors or within quiet minds however, as Lermond has published his findings and work at length, as well as contributing parts of his collection to round out displays and inventories of museums across New England. On top of all this, he also runs one of the most popular literary publications in the nation with his monthly issues of The Maine Naturalist: a magazine showcasing both scholarly articles and photography and discussion on a wide range of biological and ecological topics coming from Lermond’s own Knox Academy of Arts and Sciences, further fostering a greater reverence for nature across all of our populace as more of our fellow New Englanders subscribe to the publication.

Nestled within the sleepy town of Warren, Maine, the school has been afforded greater access to funds and prospective students with his rise to fame and prominence, the Knox Academy has grown into one of the most sought-after educational institutions in New England, with their biology and natural sciences departments now even rivaling the contending programs in the Ivy Leagues like Cornell or Harvard. With Lermond serving as Dean, Headmaster, and occasional teacher/lecturer, the Knox Academy has continued to foster a love of nature into the hearts of thousands across New England. The centerpiece of this storied institution is no lecture hall or grand library, but instead it is the famed Knox Arboretum: personal garden and grove of President Lermond himself. Originally sitting on just 60 acres of property, the grove has now expanded to envelop well over 100 acres of pristine Maine wilds. Divided into dozens of themed sections, with localized pinetums, quercetas, salicetas, populetas, viticetums, and orchards all winding throughout its ever-increasing expanse, with a massive grove of Lermond’s favorite species of pines at its core, it has truly evolved into a natural spectacle for all of our countrymen to enjoy.

Creating the New England Malacological Union, Lermond seeks to band together all Mollusc-studying naturalists, marine biologists, researchers, and professors in order to protect the inherent rights of these intellectual laborers. Though only a few hundred number among their ranks at most, this move has pushed many other small, niche fields to unionize as well, driving up unionization rates across New England. Though President Lermond had political motivation for this act, he had long planned to create a similar organization including all Americans; a hope shattered by the harsh reality of the 2nd American Civil War. Everstill, Lermond and the mollusc union-members march on, now protected by the rights of the state while serving as a prime example on how to organize and unionize for the rest of the nation to follow."

Known as 'steamed hams,' the recipe calls for grilled hamburgers, layered in cheddar cheese and other standard burger toppings to taste, and slathered in the secret Pump sauce, then finally served on a platter atop a bed of french fries. Despite the name, the dish has nothing to do with steaming or hams, instead supposedly coming from a unique Albany expression, though no one else in Upstate New York calls this particular dish such a name - even in Utica. \n\nRegardless of this odd naming quirk, they grew in popularity among New England's political elite and educational staff during the Second Hartford Convention after a roast prepared for the nation’s leaders and local intelligentsia was ruined in an oven fire, causing a blaze that some would say resembled the Northern Lights.

miscnee.1.d: "A congressional hearing organised by the House of Unamerican Activities Committee was held today in Los Angeles, and while the hearings were initially held behind closed doors to achieve publicity, news of a so-called \"Hollywood Blacklist\" has emerged from the investigations.\n\nThe congressional committee met with prominent anti-syndicalists in Hollywood, including members of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals (MPA), an organisation of high profile conservative members of the film industry to defend the film industry from reactionary and socialist infiltration. At the committee, many members of the MPA, such as John Wayne, have argued that radicals in the film industry have been inserting propaganda onto the silver screen to incite labour union violence, manipulate voting behavior, and raise money for Syndicalists worldwide. The committee believed that enough evidence existed and expressed concern about \"everyone in the movie industry who might be used as agents of a foreign power to destroy our country.\" Popular actor Ronald Reagan, president of the Screen Actors Guild, testified that a small clique within his union was using "syndicalist" like tactics to steer union policy.\n\nAs subpoenas have begun to fill the mailboxes of movie writers, directors, actors, and executives - the fear of censorship has strengthened the liberal front in Hollywood. In response, a group of anti-syndicalist liberals formed the Committee of the First Amendment, arguing that the investigations violated the Bill of Rights. The Committee of the First Amendment argued that the American film industry - through its patriotic political mobilisation - had defended democratic America in the media during the civil war. Nonetheless, as paranoia continues to grow at a congressional level, the celebrities and stars of Hollywood find themselves increasingly investigated and scouted by the government they had helped to defend months prior."

All ten were dismissed from their employment contracts, and the executives pledged that studious would never knowingly employ a syndicalist.\n\nThe ten include Alvah Bessie, Herbert Bibberman, Lester Cole, Edward Dmytryk, Ring Lardner Jr, John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Samuel Ornitz, Adrian Scott, Dalton Trumbo, and Dorothy Parker. Officially blacklisted, the ten have tried to argue against HUAC and the Supreme Court but to no avail. Charged with contempt of Congress, they have been fined $1,000 each and sentenced to prison terms of six months to a year.\n\nAfter the sentencing, Congressman Hamilton Fish III and film director Myron Coureval Fagan issued a brief statement confirming that HUAC will continue to thoroughly investigate the American media industry for more signs of syndicalist infiltration. Fish and Fagan assured the American public that more subpoenas would be sent out within the coming weeks to cleanse Hollywood of red intrusion thoroughly. It is uncertain how many syndicalists HUAC believes to have infiltrated the film industry, but federal agents can be seen patrolling movie sets and studios in Los Angeles.

Of particular focus for this program, Weaver hopes that this housing program can provide subsidies for his fellow African American brothers and sisters.

miscnee.6.t: "Rural Electrification Administration"
miscnee.6.d: "Many large cities throughout [NEE.GetNameDef] have access to electricity. The rural Northeast can not say the same. Dense forests and poor infrastructure have left many of our citizens in states like New Hampshire or Maine in the dark. Before the outbreak of the civil war, as little as 11 per cent of the United States had access to electricity. With most power distribution lying in private companies' hands, there was no impetus for companies to create far-flung infrastructure across the country. Many companies had quoted prices of nearly 2,000 dollars per mile to build the needed power lines.\n\nThe Rural Electrification Act of [GetYear] seeks to remedy this issue. Loans are to be made available for large-scale projects such as new power plants or power lines and individual homes. The interest rate on these loans shall be kept low by tying them to the federal government borrowing rates. Furthermore, repayment plans can be extended up to 25 years to help bring affordable modernity to rural America!"

The enemy possesses a far greater industrial base than us and without the necessary steps, New England will be unable to produce the armaments and materials needed to win a modern total war.\n\nTherefore, Congress today has passed the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act of [GetYear]. The act is a federal law that will establish strategic materials supply reserves for the New England common defense, industrial demands, and military commitments. Signed into law by President [NEE.GetLeader], the act will see to it that large quantities of strategic materials from the mighty mills and factories to the average household's backyards will be collected and used to serve New England in America's darkest hour."

# Basilica
miscnee.8.t: "The Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul"
miscnee.8.d: "Faith and religion have long been keystone ideas in New England. While some questioned whether or not that would remain true as the nation descended into chaos with the outbreak of the second civil war - it appears that even in times of crisis, the New England faith remains as true as ever! After years of construction, the second largest church in New England was finally dedicated to the great happiness and satisfaction of Lewiston's French-Canadian population.\n\nDuring the mid 19th century, Lewiston experienced an influx of French-Canadians who came to work at the local textile mills. These Catholic migrants desired a place for worship, and for a time, the parishioners worshipped in the basement of St. Joseph's Church. Because of the large number of French-speaking parishioners, the weekly mass was moved to the nave of St. John's in 1872. But the number of parishioners simply outgrew the nave, and thus the construction for a new church began with the cornerstone of St. Peter's set in 1872. In 1881, the Dominican Fathers of Lille, France, and Quebec took over the administration of the church, and by 1889, the parish was known as S. Pierre S. Paul de Lewiston, Maine. By 1905, the parishioners numbered 10,000, and the splitting of the parish from 1907 and 1923 led to further delays on the project. Serious work on the project resumed in 1933 despite the ongoing Great Depression, and finally, it was completed in July of 1936.\n\nIts completion finished, now the church has finally been dedicated by the Diocese of Portland. The church's two organs, both made by Casavant Frères, a Canadian organ building company in Quebec, were also dedicated this year. Not only does the completion of the church reaffirm New England's traditional values of piety and religious freedom, but it also reflects the growing ties of the French-Canadians to their adoptive country."

# Sit Down Strikes
miscnee.9.t: "Supreme Court strikes down Labour case"
miscnee.9.d: "The right to free speech has always been a pillar of American democracy. While strikes and protests characterised much of the early 1930s, the government hardly cracked down on these acts of disobedience unless they grew violent. One of the techniques utilized by strikers would be the \"sit-down strike,\" a form of civil disobedience in which workers seized their workplaces by \"sitting down\" at their work stations.\n\nNonetheless, in a groundbreaking case made by the Supreme Court; the government of New England has ruled that participants of sit-down strikes could be fired and defeated a decision made by the National Labor Relations Board that declared that sit-down strikers could be reinstated. At the General Electric Plant in Schenectady, workers attempted to form a union. The company sent a labour spy into the union as the union began to clamor for a renegotiated contract. The company's continued refusal to compromise with the union led to the frustrated union to organise a sit down strike - shutting down a portion of the plant. After multiple attempts, police who were called to eject the strikers were finally successful. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered the company to reinstate the fired strikers, arguing that the company's actions before the strike were illegal. The case was brought to the attention of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes who ruled that \"sit-down strikes\" were \"good cause\" for discharging the workers and the NLRB did not have the authority to force the company to rehire the strikers. While it is not explicitly stated that sit-down strikes are illegal, the court's decision and wording implies that sit-down striking has been effectively subdued within New England."

With an origin at the end of the first civil war, baseball has remained a long-time American tradition - dramatically escalating in popularity during the first twenty years of the 20th century.\n\nDespite the drone of military aircraft in the skies, baseball is still a popular pastime for people of all ages across the country, especially in New England. The New Englander philanthropist and businessman Stephen Carlton Clark is a great fan of the sport and aims to honour those who have shown excellence worthy of memorial. A native of Coopersville in New York, Clark was pained to see the city struggle throughout the Great Depression and sought to increase the town's revenues by upgrading its cultural institutions. Designed to be a future pantheon of all baseball heroes, old and new - the hall had its most recent inductees, the class of 1936. In this roster are Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, and Walter Johnson. While the museum has recently just opened, fans are already pushing for their idols to be featured - proof of America's consistent love for the beloved sport even as the future for the American nation still remains uncertain."

A survivor's account stated that the reason for the derailment was due to the sharp curve named the Gulf Curve. The train operator, 65 years old Jesse H Earl was running behind schedule due to the weather and a faulty engine. Hoping to make up time, he kept the train moving at too great a speed to safely pass along the curve.

Earthquakes are not quite common in New Hampshire, although there were two strong earthquakes throughout its history during the 17th century.\n\nThe earthquake followed that of an earlier one on December 20th, and both of these earthquakes measured at a magnitude of 5.5 and maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (powerful). The earthquake lacked the destruction and size of the infamous 1906 one in San Francisco, but there were still damages to fix following its arrival. There were reports of fractured pipes, walls, and furniture, as well as fallen plaster near the epicentre. The earthquake caused damage to wells, turning the water brown, and even caused monuments in cemeteries to shift and an old house to move nearly 12 inches. Response teams were sent quickly to assess the damage, and thankfully the damages have proven to be just waves of minor damage."

miscnee.13.d: "Morale has always been an essential factor in the art of war. There is no secret that New England is indeed a "David" fighting against multiple goliaths - New England lacks the industry and manpower of the other civil war factions. With morale relatively low within the army, the Young Women's Christian Association president, Mary Shotwell Ingraham, has pushed President [NEE.GetLeader] to fund the creation of morale and recreational service for New England military personnel.\n\nWith the president's approval, multiple non-profit organisations combined to form the United Service Organisation. Churches, barns, railroad cars, museums, and even log cabins became recreational centres where GIs could rest and socialise. These establishments provided service members with a place to relax, have a dance, view films, and of course, a hungry GI could not deny the free coffee and doughnuts. The USO has been known for bringing concerts and events close to the frontlines to provide battle-weary troops with hope and encouragement in the desperate war to reunite the nation. Famous Hollywood refugees like Bette Davis and Spencer Tracey have joined the growing cast of current stars in the media to help the war effort by performing for the soldiers in the trenches. The USO has also seen a more significant influx of women volunteers - to provide a nostalgic hour for the weary soldier so he can talk and meet with the girl from back home in person. For many of these men, the girls they meet at USO events remind them of whom they are fighting for - bringing back to mind their loved ones and their sisters and friends they left behind to fight for American freedom."

miscnee.14.d: "In the chaos of the siege of New York City, cartoonist Joe Simon and Jack Kirby fled to Joe's hometown in Rochester, New York - hoping to escape the syndicalist red terror. Eager to aid young readers to enlist- Simon and Kirby brought their comic book creation \"Captain America\" into the hands of young Americans who quickly became infatuated with the patriotic character.\n\nMany eager recruits found resonance with the Captain's origins, as ordinary Steve Rodgers, who, despite his meager size, felt compelled to try again and again to enlist in the war against the radicals and revolutionaries that threatened America. At the encouragement of a scientist, Rodgers takes a super-serum in an experiment that dramatically enhances his physical abilities and size, transforming him into a near-perfect rendition of the human form. As "Captain America," Rodgers and his sidekick Bucky Barnes fight enemies of America such as the Syndicalists' Red Skull as well as the demagogues of Mac Arthur and Huey Long, who have been portrayed in the comics as warmongers intent on destroying all aspects of American life. While some have complained that Simon's character has been overly political, Simon himself has admitted that his character was a consciously political creation and that he and Kirby found themselves repulsed at the actions of the Silvershirts and the Red Guards. Captain America has found fans with many young Americans with nearly a million copies in circulation, reminding them that New England's government stands for the true America. With his ever-present vibranium shield adorned with the stars and stripes, \"Cap\" reminds the Yankee young reader that even the little frail boy from Brooklyn could become America's most outstanding soldier."

A single-engine Royal Canadian Air Force training plane flew overhead, nothing out of the ordinary given the ties and proximity between New England and Canada. Suddenly, the plane began to spiral out of control, diving nose first into a lake on the west shore. Concerned citizens rushed to the wreck but to no avail, the lone occupant of the plane had been killed in what appeared to have been an accident.\n\nThe pilot was Willie McKnight, a 23 year old pilot for the RWIF. Born in Edmonton, Willie was known for his notorious rebellious streak, proving to teachers that despite his athletic prowess - he was known for causing trouble. His cockiness persisting into University, McKnight signed up for the RCAF to partake in the retaking of the Home Isles by the Entente government. His aircraft in combat bore a distinctive human skeleton image carrying a sickle in its hands under the cockpit, on both sides of the aircraft - a memento mori for all his opponents but perhaps even an ironic joke at his syndicalist enemies. Nonetheless, despite McKnight's spectacular record of 17 victories it appears that fate does not favor the young pilot."

miscnee.17.d: "On a warm summer evening in August, the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad's New York to Buffalo passenger train suffered a severe accident when it collided with a freight train. Carrying 500 passengers from Hoboken, New Jersey, the train left Binghamton, New York, 30 minutes behind schedule while the freight train was traveling from Elmira to Mount Morris. The freight train had backed into a siding to allow the passenger train to pass, but then it moved back onto the mainline while switching cars. The freight train had ignored a stop signal and had moved onto the track of the passenger train. At 17:22 p.m., the passenger train sideswiped the freight train's engine and derailed with the locomotive of the freight train scraping the sides of several cars. The resulting impact tore open the side of the car, and boiler steam from the freight engine filled into the coach.\n\nMany people found themselves frantically trapped in the coach, and some could escape by breaking windows. All but one of the 29 fatalities were caused by internal or external scalding of the boiler steam. Thanks to the rapid response by a local sheriff, first responders were able to deploy rapidly to the scene, including firemen and the medical services. Many of the passengers on the train were army servicemen, and thus they formed a little police unit to keep spectators and onlookers away until sufficient policemen had arrived. Around 114 people were injured, with nearly 56 requiring hospitalisation. An official inquiry from the Interstate Commerce Commission and the New York Public Service Commission declared the incident to have been an accident, although the DL and W railroad had to install derailing devices as an added safety measure."

The BEANO \"T-12\" grenade is a spherical grenade with the weight and size of an ordinary baseball. The men at Kodak argue that due to its size and shape, the grenade would be perfect for our servicemen - as any young American man should be able to properly throw a grenade with accuracy and distance.\n\nWeighing at 12 ounces, the T-13 grenade is designed with a pressure trigger and in-flight arming device. It was intended to be literally thrown like a baseball, and it could be held with two fingers on its weighted \"butterfly cap.\" Once in the air, the cap would detach from the grenade, and a nylon string would unwind until a secondary arming pin attached is pulled - allowing the grenade to detonate upon impact. While the Kodak Corporation has praised the grenade as the future of the American infantrymen, our initial trials have proven to be disastrous, with more sudden accidents than successes. Our high command remains unimpressed; it seems like the T-13 won't make the cut."

The principal provider of his family, Carlson often turned to his own interests in inventing; he was heavily inspired by the success story of Thomas Edison. To Carlson, the idea of invention is alluring as it could provide an escape from his meager social status. Carlson attended the California Institute of Technology, a hard-working young man, where the school's tuition placed him further in debt. With the height of the Great Depression hitting the states in 1930, Carlson found himself out of work and out of money.\n\nIn 1936, Carlson began to study law at the New York Law School in Tribeca amidst the chaos that engulfed the American nation. Spending long nights at the New York Public Library, he grew tired of copying law books by hand due to his inability to afford them. This seemingly endless task led him to read an article in an obscure German scientific journal from Pál Selényi regarding the nature of copying machines. He conducted experiments after experiments in his tiny apartment - often smoky and smelly and sometimes even explosive. Despite developing arthritis of the spine, Carlson persisted - working with an Austrian immigrant, Otto Kornei. Finally, on October 22, 1938, the men achieved their breakthrough Kornei wrote: \"10-.22.-38 ASTORIA\" in ink on a slide which then had an electrical current generated and then transferred onto wax paper. In the hands of the two men was the world's first xerographic copy. While Carlson has already filed for a patent, it remains unknown whether or not businesses will approach Carlson for his invention.

In 1861, the men of the hamlet gathered at an informal meeting at a schoolhouse and passed an 85-40 resolution to secede from the United States. While the reasons for the vote are unknown, some have pointed out that Town Line's residents were motivated due to their willingness to avoid the military draft. Nonetheless, because Town Line was never an incorporated municipal entity and had no well-defined borders, the Confederacy and the Union did not recognize secession.

The book is a rhythmic children's story featuring a child's fanciful imagination while strolling through Mulberry Street (perhaps inspired by the actual Mulberry Street in Springfield, Massachusetts) while colourful and expressive illustrations dot each page.\n\nWriting under the moniker \"Dr. Seuss\", the author is Theodore Geisel, a 33-year-old New Englander of German descent with nearly ten years of writing and illustrating experience. Geisel attended Dartmouth College, where he rose to the editor-in-chief of the humour magazine \"Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern.\" Geisel continued his education by attending Oxford University in the Union of Britain to achieve his Ph.D. in English literature, where he met his future wife, Helen Palmer. Leaving Oxford in 1927 without finishing his degree, Geisel began to submit drawings and illustrations to make a living - achieving breakthrough success with a commercial piece for Filt, a bug spray. In 1936, after returning from a European voyage, Geisel felt inspired by the rhythmic sounds of the ship's engines which encouraged him to develop the rhyme scheme that makes up his latest book.\n\nFleeing New York City, as one of many American refugees - Geisel has returned home to his native New England in the hopes of escaping the tragic plight shared by many in the former United States. According to Geisel, the frustration of being consistently rejected led him to nearly burn his manuscript of Mulberry Street until he ran into an old Dartmouth classmate.

Shunned by his classmates and suspended at boarding school, Harvey is sent on a European excursion with his father to fall overboard in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. He is then fatefully rescued by a Portuguese-American sailor, Manuel Fidello (played by the handsome Spencer Tracy), and taken aboard a Massachusetts schooner. Onboard the "We're Here," Harvey finds that his status as the son of a wealthy New York socialite means nothing, and despite his spoiled acts, the boy is still offered a temporary crew ship until the boat returns to the States. He befriends the captain's son Dan (played by Mickey Rooney), and he grows closer to Manuel, with Manuel becoming an almost surrogate father for the young boy. In the movie's climax, the schooner races against a rival vessel when Manuel climbs to the top of the ship's mast. The mast cracks, and Manuel is plunged into the icy sea, much to the horror and sadness of Harvey. Returning to the States, Harvey is reunited with his father, who is in awe of his son's growth in maturity over the past months. They offer a solemn moment of remembrance at the Fisherman's Memorial in Gloucester, Massachusetts, with bouquets and wreaths - the closing shot being the memorial and a smiling Manuel.\n\nCritics have praised the movie for acknowledging the naturally formed bonds made at sea and the tribulations the waves have to offer.

Fleeing the nation as one of many American refugees with the outbreak of the civil war, Davis returned home to New England where she helped play a role in the growing New England film industry.

One of the highest grossing films of the year, her role in the movie paved the way for stardom. With the outbreak of war, Davis has also achieved frontline popularity especially among servicemen with her natural charisma and beauty - selling nearly 2 million in war bonds within two days as well as a picture of herself for 250,000. Willing to perform for black serviceman, Davis pushed for a sort of "Hollywood Canteen" for the soldiers where famous actors and actresses can entertain the tired troops.

Inspired by the syndicalist strikes across the steel belts, the workers reached the pinnacle of their anger when the company began spreading rumors that they would be bought by a firm that would not recognize the union. After the union threatened a strike, the company distributed its own strike ballots, which led to anger as union members seized and destroyed company ballots while also intimidating managers.\n\nSpurred on by the radical rhetoric of Bill Haywood and his SPA, the union members became increasingly violent as the protests escalated. Local police and private security forces were called up by Remington Rand on numerous occasions to break up the strikers. As the frustration of the strikers grew, so did their tactics. Emboldened by Red Guard militias, strikers had begun to create homemade bombs and hurl large iron balls at the police. Blood has been shed, as some of the strikers have even been shot by the police.\n\nWith no compromise in view, an obvious choice would be to send in the National Guard. Putting down the strikers and regaining the police force's discipline would ensure that this rabble would finally be dealt with. However, some stress that this may only fuel more tensions among our workers. The Syndicalists are right on our border, and they will no doubt capitalize on this strike to further paralyse our nation. Instead, they suggest that we approach the strikers in negotiation - this will also help us earn the trust of the striking workers."

Nobody knows who fired the first shot, but the strikers and Guardsmen were drawn into a chaotic swirl of violence and rage, leading to scores being injured.\n\nReinforcements of National Guardsmen had arrived in Tonawanda, Ilion, and Syracuse at the request of the state governor. Severely outnumbered, the strikers began to disperse, but the guardsmen began arresting strikers en masse, placing strike leaders in chains. The response from the National Guard was surprisingly effective. Faced with the strength of the military, the strikers agreed to end their strike, but serious concerns have been raised towards President [NEE.GetLeader]. The strikers will undoubtedly use this act as an excuse to garner support from the Syndicalist elements in Chicago.

Many of the strikers who had been arrested during the strikes were rehired.\n\nWhile many nationwide are hailing this as a success among the working classes, the strike's victory has worried some. If workers continue to be radicalized and organise deadly strikes that cripple the already exhausted economy, who knows how long before New England falls to the syndicalist menace.

miscnee.27.d: "Perhaps emboldened by the civil war that has torn apart our nation, workers in the shoe industry in the cities of Lewiston and Auburn took to striking. These strikers, many of whom come from French-Canadian descent, began demanding higher wages, conditions, shorter workweek, and union representation, with the number of the protests growing to the thousands. Shortly after the strikes began, the manufacturers offered a 10% wage increase to fulfill the strikers' demand - but these offers were quickly put down.\n\nWith the protests growing increasingly violent and with no signs of the strikers backing down, President [NEE.GetLeader] has requested that the governor of Maine deal with the situation at hand. The governor can call in the National Guard, which may involve further altercation and outright violence, although the protests will definitely be quieted. Alternatively, the governor can negotiate with the strikers although this would be a serious loss of face for the New England government to handle its own people."

#Crack Down:
miscnee.28.t: "Crackdown on the Shoe Strike"
miscnee.28.d: "With the approval of the Governor, the National Guard had been called to deal with the persisting strikers. Workers and union organisers attempted to march in solidarity across South Bridge in Lewiston, numbering in the thousands. Many of the protestors were women, eager to stand up for their working rights.\n\nThe National Guard and police immediately got to work in the fights with the strikers, and the strikers soon found themselves fleeing the scene. The Lewiston Evening Journal described the event as simply "Red Wednesday" due to the violence of the incident. Strike organisers such as Powers Hapgood were immediately arrested and sentenced to short-terms, and for nights, the guardsmen patrolled Lewiston and Auburn. While the President congratulated the governor for his initiative in subduing the unrest, the civil unrest, especially among Maine's French-Canadian population, has only grown in response to the harsh crackdown."
miscnee.28.a: "We gave them a chance."

#Negotiate:
miscnee.29.t: "Negotiations with the Strikers"
miscnee.29.d: "Listening to the words of his advisors, the governor agreed to enter talks with the strikers. While the strikers were adamant in receiving their wage increases, workweek, and improved conditions - the governor was also persistent in ensuring that the unions would be administered by the textile companies. Finally the strikers agreed to be supervised by company unions at the cost of having the rest of their demands fulfilled. The Lewiston Evening Journal summed the negotiations up as a much needed relief in these uncertain times.\n\nNonetheless, the governor's negotiation with the strikers has led to doubts as to whether or not he is capable of leading the state of Maine. Many in the nation do see syndicalism as an ever present threat and surely pleasing the workers would only encourage their radical ideas to spread further. Criticism from Democrats in Maine have been aimed at the governor's seemingly soft stance claiming it as a \"surrender to syndicalism.\""

# Niagara Bridge Collapse - Possible Expansion
miscnee.30.t: "Historic Bridge collapses across the Niagara Falls"
miscnee.30.d: "Thousands of onlookers gathered together to watch the final collapse of the Honeymoon Bridge today. Large gusts of wind coming from Lake Erie sent a massive amount of ice pouring over the falls. Nearly 100 feet of ice came crashing down on the bridge's abutments, ultimately compromising the structure. Not even the 24 feet tall fortifications added in 1899 after an ice bridge threatened to push the bridge over could prevent the collapse. Luckily the cold temperatures deterred most visitors to the falls, and thus, no one was injured.\n\nThe Northeastern states are currently experiencing one of the severest cold waves of winter. Sub-zero winds followed by a harsh blizzard have swept southwards from Canada, bringing New England to a two-year record for frigid weather. In some parts of the country, thermometers are reading 24 degrees below zero. For many New Englanders, the cold weather and snow blankets are signs of troubled and unassured times as the civil war rages on across the country. "

# Chocolate Chip Cookie
miscnee.31.t: "Fresh from the Oven"
miscnee.31.d: "Established in 1930, the Toll House has become a rather fashionable New England staple, in particular the inn's matron has been renowned throughout the country for her delicious recipes including what she describes as the \"chocolate chip cookie.\" A favorite spot for the young, the old, and even those in politics like Joseph Kennedy Sr, Ruth Graves Wakefield embodies the New England mother in her passion and dedication evident from her baking.\n\nBorn Ruth Jones Graves, Wakefield grew up in Easton, Massachusetts and worked as a home economics teacher and a hospital dietitian. In 1930, Wakefield and her husband Kenneth Donald Wakefield bought a tourist lodge in Whitman in Plymouth County. A junction located halfway between Boston and New Bedford, it was a place where passengers traditionally paid tolls, changed horses, and ate home-cooked meals. Ruth cooked and served all the food at the inn, gaining a cult following of fans who enjoyed her lobster dinners and desserts. But indeed, it is her cookie that has earned her national fame.\n\nNicknamed the \"chocolate chip cookie\", Wakefield claimed that she added chopped bits from a Nestle semi-sweet chocolate bar into a cookie. While reporters incorrectly stated the move was a mistake, Ruth claims that she intentionally sought to create a cookie with a delicious bite of chocolate. The cookie has reached soldiers stationed in Massachusetts, many of whom have written letters requesting it from their families while at the frontlines. The nation then became infatuated with the cookie with Wakefield agreeing to give Nestle the rights to the Toll House cookie name for one dollar and a lifetime's supply of Nestle. Indeed, they have become a national favorite - enjoyed by Americans young and old!"

# Thousand Island Bridge
miscnee.32.t: "Commemoration of the Thousand Island Bridge"
miscnee.32.d: "Stretching 8.5 miles (13.7km), the industrial marvel connecting the borders of New England and Canada has finally finished construction - connecting the state of New York to Ontario. On this day, President [NEE.GetLeader] officially dedicated the bridge to New England, declaring that it marked a period of continued friendship and camaraderie between the Americans and their northern neighbours. With his blessing and dedication, the bridge will soon open, much to the cheer of Canadian and American onlookers.\n\nThe brainchild of Dr. David Steinman and Dr. Holten Robinson, refugees from New York City, the bridge's construction authority is shared by the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority and the Federal Bridge Corporation Limited of Canada. The bridge's construction rate was incredibly fast and ten weeks ahead of schedule, taking only sixteen months for completion - a fantastic feat and testament to the cooperation between the nations. The design of the spans fit the regional topography producing beautiful bridges with artistic grace and attention to detail, with the colours chosen to match the surrounding environment. Following the president's dedication, the first civilian and military vehicles began across the bridge - the first of many as the bridge serves its intended purpose as an indestructible physical bond between the Canadian and American people."

# Coconut Fire
miscnee.150.t: "Coconut Grove Fire Claims 492 Lives!"
miscnee.150.d: "Located at 17 Piedmont Street in the Bay Village neighbourhood of Boston, a few blocks south of the Boston Public Garden, the Coconut Grove is well known among Bostonians as a popular hangout spot given the number of celebrities that frequent it. Visited by GIs, movie stars, celebrities, and even politicians such as Maurice Tobin - the nightclub also has been rumored to have links with the Mafia and organised crime. Initially a garage and a warehouse, the club offered its patrons dining and dancing in a \"South Seas\" like a tropical paradise with support columns made to look like palm trees and fixtures made to look like coconuts.\n\nAt 10:15 pm on the evening of November 28th however, a young soldier removed a lightbulb in the lounge to give himself and his date some privacy. A young busboy was called to replace the lightbulb, unable to find the bulb he lit a match, tightened the bulb, and extinguished the match. Witnesses would report that soon after, flames burst from palm fronds beneath the ceiling. Despite the best efforts of the staff, the flames simply spread throughout the nightclub, racing faster than patrons could move and covering the entire establishment with smoke. The building's main entrance was a single revolting door which became useless as the patrons stampeded in panic. By the time firefighters had arrived, 492 lives were lost. Perhaps more grotesque was the fact that some bodies were discovered with drinks still in their hands as the fire and toxic smoke had overtaken them too quickly.\n\nThe owner of the club Barney Welansky was convicted on nineteen counts of manslaughter due to his failure in following the loose restrictions of the city. Investigators also discovered that the club lacked licenses for serving liquor and food and the remodeling was done by unlicensed contractors. The mayor of Boston, Maurice Tobin has come under fire for his connections to Welansky with some calling for his resignation."

# VT-NH Border Transfer
miscnee.151.t: "A Long Dispute Settled"
miscnee.151.d: "Today, map makers from the Geological Survey rejoiced as the long-standing border dispute between Vermont and New Hampshire has finally been settled.\n\nThe new settlement fixes the boundary between the two states for 200 miles along the Connecticut River. New Hampshire's jurisdiction begins with the original low water line on the west bank of the river. For nearly 150 years, the two states had been arguing where the line ran. Both states collected taxes from property owners, and there was a recurrent debate between the states as to which state would control the bridges and control powerhouses.\n\nA.F. Hassen, chief of the cartographic section of the Geological Survey, said that some map changes in the past twenty years have been significant enough to change in the geographic text but obscure enough to mostly only affect scientists, road builders, and engineers. Most of these changes happened as a result of rivers changing course. Following the fixture of the Vermont-New Hampshire border, the Geological Survey began to look for other erratic rivers that may have changed course and, therefore, could drastically change the boundary lines."

# Grew Event
miscnee.152.t: "A Prince from the Land of the Rising Sun"
miscnee.152.d: "A curious visitor was spotted at the residence of Joseph Grew, the ambassador to Japan before the Civil War. The bespectacled and short visitor greeted Grew with a bow, and to the surprise of onlookers, Grew returned the favor. Grew then invited the guest and his entourage into his home, where it is reported that the men shared a delicious drink of tea.\n\nThe visitor is Prince Tokugawa Iesato, the first head of the Tokugawa Clan after the overthrow of the Tokugawa Bakufu and the ensuing Meiji Restoration. A youth in England gave Iesato the respect of the Entente Powers - during the Weltkrieg, Iesato had organised a condolence booklet in concern for the enormous death and destruction in Europe. Despite the tense relations between Japan and the United States, Iesato and Grew had come to treat each other as close friends and sought to encourage goodwill between the two nations. In recognition of Japan's gift of cherry blossom trees in 1912, Iesato had travelled to New England in a goodwill event despite the great civil war that now divides the United States.\n\nWhile their conversation was limited to only those who were present, there are rumors that the two men discussed the ongoing situation in the Pacific. For a long time, the United States had competed with Japan for domination of the great ocean. Now with the civil war plaguing the United States, the Japanese stand virtually unopposed in the Pacific. Even if Iesato himself is committed to peace, the Japanese nation certainly has ambitions in Asia - ambitions that it will now feel comfortable to pursue without the industrial giant of America present. While no open conflict has yet emerged between the two countries, only time will tell whether or not peace will reign in Asia."

# War Referendum Killed
miscnee.153.t: "War Referendum killed in the House"
miscnee.153.d: "It is revealed to the public that administration leaders in the New England Congress received a surprise when a new possible war referendum was brought to the debate. The bill proposes that a national referendum should be held before Congress can declare war, thus giving the ordinary men and women the chance to have a direct vote on their country's involvement in foreign conflicts. However, in the case where the nation is attacked first, a referendum would not be held.\n\nThe controversial bill has secured the 23 votes needed to bring the bill into the House. Many Irish-American delegates are eager to support the bill, believing that this will give New England the ability to stay away from aiding the former British Empire. These delegates and the people they represent are wary of the British, with the memories of the Great Famine and the War for Independence still fresh in their minds. Nonetheless, with the decision of 35 congress members in the balance, congressman James Farley rallied his fellow Irish-American congressmen to shut down the bill. Farley believes that America's place in the world is to help it and not to stay away from the world's affairs. His efforts have been successful; the possible war referendum act has been shut down.\n\nInterestingly enough, a parliamentary question was raised late tonight by the discovery that the list of signers bore the name of William P. Connery Jr, a representative from Massachusetts who had died by the time the petition was being presented. The rule requires that a discharge petition be signed by a majority of the membership of the House. But the law says nothing about the signature of a dead member and the question remains for now unanswered."

# Garbage Truck Maims Three
miscnee.154.t: "Garbage Truck Maims Three"
miscnee.154.d: "In a horrific accident today, three GIs were struck by a passing junk truck in the afternoon. The three men were native New Yorkers; Aaran Rivenavich, Thomas Luzzo, and Michael Malito served in the 244th Coastal Artillery. The soldiers are former refugees from New York City who had escaped the war-torn city to enlist in the army of the provisional government. When a projecting piece of load struck them, the men were returning from Port Ontario at Oswego, a prominent military base and refugee camp.\n\nAll three men were severely cut, and Luzzo is said to have a broken arm. The driver of the junk truck was held on charges of third-degree assault and improper loading. While the incident has attracted outrage from the victims' families, the state of New York has vowed to increase standards and measures for its junk disposal transportation."

# Currency Powers Fought
miscnee.156.t: "[NEE.GetLeader]'s Power on Currency Fought"
miscnee.156.d: "As the Provisional of New England struggles to rebuild the economy after years of the Great Depression, the issue of the President's power on currency has come up multiple times in Congressional debates. The Secretary of Commerce Charles W. Tobey and Vice President H. Styles Bridges have put together a joint resolution to repeal President [NEE.GetLeader]'s ability in current law to issue up to $3,000,000 of additional paper currency. They declared that this latent power could endanger small investors, holders of insurance, wage earners, and those with fixed incomes. In addition, the resolution also plans to curb inflation by placing tighter restrictions on who and how much money can be printed at once."

# Hopkins under Fire
miscnee.157.t: "Hopkins Under Fire"
miscnee.157.d: "From a sickbed in the North County Community Hospital, where he is recuperating from a throat infection, Secretary of Commerce Harry L. Hopkins has again answered "definitely no" to allegations that he belongs to the Socialist Party of America. In the days following Hopkins' implementation of Work Progress Administration relief programs, Hopkins has come under fire within elements in Congress, with some denouncing him as a syndicalist disguised in sheep's clothing.\n\nIn a speech to the House, Democratic representative John J. Connor from New York State declared that the \"head of one of our great departments is a registered socialist.\" When Connor was asked whether or not he referred to Hopkins, Connor shrugged his shoulders and replied that \"one must draw their conclusions.\" While Hopkins and his son have reiterated orally that Hopkins does not belong to the Socialist Party, this particular incident has illustrated the paranoia among congress members regarding the so-called \"Red Menace\". Those who are fiscally conservative are wary of the increasing role of the government in the economy and have come to see socialism as the nation's greatest enemy, both politically and morally. Even in the workplace, there are reports that those suspected of having leftist leaning beliefs or those speaking favorably of Haywood's movement in Chicago are being fired and discredited. Throughout New England, many in private are referring to this mass hysteria as a \"Red Scare,\" and some even jokingly remark that it is \"better to be dead than red.\""

# Hopkins WPA
miscnee.158.t: "The Work Progress Administration Under Hopkins"
miscnee.158.d: "In response to the continued economic woes from the Great Depression, Secretary of Commerce Harry L. Hopkins has announced an additional wage increase for workers in Work Progress Administration (WPA) agreements for workers in the rural areas of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The program now sets the new wage at $3.90 a month to more than 82,000 workers.\n\nIn the rural areas of New England, Hopkins argues that the wage earners there are only 45 per cent of the national average but with this new increase they will be getting 53 per cent of that average. This gives the impression of comparative underpayment in the North on the WPA. Nonetheless, opposing congressmen who are opposed to government intervention in the economy, find Hopkins' legislation too radical. Critics find themselves uncertain as to whether or not Hopkins' wage increase will actually benefit the rural farmer, especially since WPA wages can be determined by a single person. To quell doubt among the working class and politicians, Hopkins has helped organise the Community Mobilisation for Human Needs - an organisation dedicated to sharing the costs of relief between local, state, and federal governments."

# St Lawrence Waterway

miscnee.159.d: "In a brief conference today at St. Lawrence in Canada, the Canadian and American engineers met to discuss the possibility of a two-stage plan of power development. President [NEE.GetLeader] met with the Canadian Prime Minister to discuss the planned industrial project outlined by the American members of the Joint Board of Engineers in 1926 - hoping to foster good will and intentions between the nations.\n\nThe project plans to construct a proposed dam on Barnhart Island, with one power station being built near Massena, New York on the American side and another power house built on Cornwall on the Canadian side. While plans have indeed been drawn up, it is unknown as to when construction on the dam will actually begin. The meeting's successful conclusion and friendly atmosphere however has solidified relations between the two nations and there is no doubt that the future will see further cooperation between the American and Canadian nations."

miscnee.160.d: "At a conference in Montreal, prominent ambassador to Canada from the United States, John Winant gave a speech praising the goals of the Entente alliance. The British dominions and their allies are fighting together against a system that represents a perversion of social justice. The socialists who currently control the British Isles have gone too far in their pursuit of a noble ideal. In their efforts to raise up the working class, they have destroyed the natural order of society and turned the world upside down.\n\nLooking to the future, he said that when the war is done and arms are laid down, he is hopeful that the peoples of not just Britain but the whole world will rebuild democracy in a more perfect likeness than it has ever been done before."

# National Church Association Incorporated
miscnee.163.t: "National Church Association Incorporated"
miscnee.163.d: "An American entrepreneur, economist, business theorist - Secretary of Commerce Roger Babson has promoted establishing his so-called \"National Church Association Inc,\" a volunteer network where persons of any faith will have space to pause and worship.\n\nRepresenting the tenth generation of New Englanders, Babson heavily researched his ancestors - finding himself to come from a lineage of farmers, merchants, midwives, and sea captains. Holding the belief that traits are hereditary, Babson hopes to emulate the lives of his ancestors in his words and actions. After studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in engineering and a brief stint working on Massachusetts highway projects, Babson turned to a career of work as an investment banker. From there, his career expanded into economics advising, a brilliant financial forecaster keen on helping young and upcoming investors - Babson earned the distinction of being the first financial forecaster to predict the German economic collapse on Black Monday.\n\nSurviving what seemed to be an inescapable diagnosis of tuberculosis, Babson credits his recovery to his unshakeable faith. According to the Secretary of Commerce himself, Babson's most profound experience was his religious conversion at fifteen. From 1936 to 1938, Babson served as National Church Moderator for the General Council on the Congregational Christian Churches. During his tenure, he employed his fondness for statistics to showcase the church's weakness in attendance - fearing that a decline in church attendance would lead to a decay in society's morals. His appeals to chart a morally correct course for church and society were met with threats and defiance - ultimately ending his tenure as a moderator in disappointment.\n\nNevertheless, Babson refuses to give up. Now, as Secretary of Commerce, he has charted the course to open church doors for every day and hour. Babson's churches will be opened to peoples of all faiths so that all will have the space to express praise and worship to their most high. The opening of the first such establishment in Wellesley, MA, will be the first of many national churches for all Americans to practice their religions freely."

# Moderate Prohibition Agenda
miscnee.164.t: "A Moderate Prohibition Agenda"
miscnee.164.d: "Having entered the world of politics, Babson and his supporters have pushed for a morally conservative society. Babson himself has long belonged to the Prohibition Party and has expressed his great desire to see America return to its \"moral past.\"\n\nRepresenting the Prohibition Party, Babson's party members believe in outlawing gambling, alcohol, narcotics, pornography, and other indecent publications. The party has also expressed its desire to pass legislation to conserve natural resources, reduce debt and taxation, aid farmers, and assure workers and consumers of industry's products and profits. As the new Secretary of Commerce, Babson has used his platform to denounce America's "decaying moral order" and petition the American people to return to the churches.\n\nWhile the total prohibition on the vices may not be a reality any time soon, Babson's party has undoubtedly achieved a victory with new legislation promising to help small rural farmers. These farmers will receive government stimulus and will have their taxation reduced to help them prosper. Babson himself has acknowledged that his party's size prevents it from becoming as relevant as the Democrats and the Republicans, but he has declared that he hopes that the people of America will take notice of his movement."

# Noble Trade Agreement
miscnee.166.t: "Edward Noble Proposes Tariff Amendment"
miscnee.166.d: "Proposed by the Secretary of Commerce Edward Noble, the Reciprocal Tariff Act of [GetYear] has been put forth granting the President the ability to negotiate with foreign nations to reduce tariffs in return for reciprocal reductions in tariffs in the United States for up to 50%.\n\nThey were signed into law by President [NEE.GetLeader], the act will now give the president the power to negotiate bilateral, reciprocal trade agreements with other countries, bringing liberalisation to American trade policy around the globe. Ever since the first American Civil War, tariffs in the United States have been at an all-time high. In response to the decades-long Great Depression and Black Monday, tariffs in the United States and the nation embraced a trade policy of protectionism. The Reciprocal Tariff Act aims to bring down these barriers, bring down duties on foreign products, and encourage trade between nations.\n\nBefore establishing the Reciprocal Tariff Act, if Congress wanted to enact a lower tariff - it would be unliterary and tackle the foreign country's tariff rate as fixed. Congress would choose a tariff rate that was either a little lower or higher than the median preferred tariff, depending on the composition of Congress. Individual members of Congress were under tremendous pressure from lobbyists to raise tariffs to protect them from the adverse effects of imports. The Reciprocal Tariff Act now ties US tariff reductions to foreign tariff reductions, giving Congress the ability to approve the tariffs with a simple majority instead of a two-thirds majority. With the President given the authority to negotiate the terms, we will undoubtedly see a more liberal trade policy in the near future."

Named after the former Governor of Connecticut and current President of New England Wilbur Cross, the project plans to expand the infrastructure of the state of Connecticut and to alleviate the stress of traffic. The ambitious project aims to be the longest vehicular tunnel in all of New England.\n\nThe first section of this parkway, which acts as a continuation of the Merritt Parkway, was opened on Labour Day last year and directly connected with the Boston Post Road at Milford. As construction begins linking the Nutmeg State and the Bay State, engineers and advisors are hopeful that motorists will make use of this famous parkway. Since the opening of the first section of the Merritt Parkway, the route has witnessed a steady increase in the number of cars passing through it.

miscnee.168.d: "A fiery speech was just delivered by the acting secretary of state for [NEE.GetNameDef], John Foster Dulles. He denounced the totalitarian regimes across the Atlantic that hold the peoples of Europe in bondage. Their society is highly materialistic, atheistic and unconcerned by the concept of a moral law. Instead they claim that laws are merely the means whereby those in power carry out their will. God-given unalienable rights are a foreign concept to them where every protection that a man can have can be stripped away by the government's will.\n\nWhile some good has been done for the proletariat in the nations overseas, this was only made possible through the coercion, terrorism, and liquidisation of those whose reason or conscience compelled them to resist the changing regime. There are some similarities in the professed end goals of both the Socialist States of Europe and America, yet, the methods employed are utterly dissimilar.\n\nThe Totalitarian regimes in Europe are not wholly a government of peace and liberation, as much as they wish to tell the world through their propaganda machine. It may not, and it is my hope that it does not wish for international war. Such devastation in the modern age would be completely unthinkable. Even if this is the case, the peoples of [NEE.GetNameDef] must remain ever vigilant against the prospects of foreign agents infiltrating the country to stir up the seeds of class warfare amongst the free citizens of the West."

The power of Western liberalism and democracy is the ability to bring about largely peaceful changes to better society. [NEE.GetNameDefCap] can not afford to cling to the past simply because the past solutions proved reliable. Innovation and risks drove development across the world.\n\nDuring the last 150 years, the political institutions of the free societies of the West have brought about immense leaps in social and economic developments that the people living back then could hardly believe what a life we live today is like.

The horrors of the second American civil war showed the dire state of transcontinental travel across the nation. While some improvements were made to help the various factions supply their armies deeper into enemy territory, the time it takes a unit to cross the United States is still largely the same as back in 1919 when the Motor Transport group first attempted a crossing using the Lincoln Highway. With most major reconstruction projects coming to completion, Weeks was able to secure congressional approval to levy a federal gas tax to support the expansion of the Interstate Highway system.

Such a loan would help rebuild the world trade that suffered due to the collapse of the British, American, and German markets in the preceding decades. As countries moved towards retrenchment, global cooperation took a nosedive. Furthermore, the conflict of the Second World War saw multiple factions attempt to corner a market of resources solely for themselves.

The fight against the menace of syndicalism had been a victorious one, but the price had been painful. American newsreels and newspapers have been broadcasting daily scenes of the horrendous plight of the British; families crammed in bomb shelters, buses in craters, and the endless fires.\n\nThe American ambassador to Canada, W.

In its third major war, the German Kaiserreich has finally lost its place in the sun, and the American occupation of Germany has begun.\n\nAs the occupation of Germany begins, US Secretary Henry Morgenthau has announced his \"Morgenthau Plan\" to push for a period of peace and stabilisation in Europe while also ensuring that Germany's ability to wage war would never be used again. His Disarmament Program aims to cripple Germany for generations so that war will never be brought again to Europe while also hoping to quell the flames of Prussian militarism. The Ruhr, the so-called heart of German industrial power, is to be stripped of all existing industries so that Germany can never again have the power to wage war. Morgenthau has not been shy about his desire to effectively turn Germany into an agricultural and pastoral nation, although this has led to significant controversy among American leadership.\n\nArguments have arisen over the humanitarian concern of the Morgenthau Plan, with some estimators believing that the Plan will lead to the starvation of millions of Germans. The events of the last Weltkrieg showed that defeated nations hold nothing but resentment towards the occupiers and victors, and many are wary of angering the tired German population.

miscnee.176.d: "With the shifting balance in the political order and America's newfound position at the centre of the world stage, President [NEE.GetLeader] has created a unique non-ideological cabinet and non-partisan cabinet to discuss and tackle world issues. Two of these new cabinet members; Dean Acheson and W. Averell Harriman had known each other since their days at Yale University and in their early Wall Street careers. They are also joined by Charles E. Bohlen, a younger but Harvard graduated diplomat with experience serving with the Syndicalist regime of France.\n\nInfluenced by former Secretary of State Harry Stimson, the group was formed due to the President's lack of expertise in foreign policy. The group's divisive members allow it to be non-partisan, with the men striving for pragmatic American internationalism and an aversion to ideological fervor. The men tend to be practical, realistic, and non ideological - hoping to bring America back onto the world stage after the destructive civil war. With their expertise in diplomacy, it has been reported that the President values the group's advice, especially in containing syndicalism from corrupting the rest of the free nations of the world. It can be assumed that successor presidencies will take advantage of these wise men of foreign diplomacy to use America's strength and industry for the benefit of the free world."

miscnee.177.d: "Tragic news reached the State Department today as the Canadian government informed us that Ambassador Laurence A. Steinhardt had been unfortunately killed in an early morning plane accident near Ramsayville, Ontario. In addition to Steinhardt, the plane accident also took the lives of several American servicemen and Alan Harrington, a twenty-year old son of a United States minister who had been visiting his parents in Canada. The plane was a C-47 used by the ambassador for business flights and en route to New York, no foul play has been suspected so far. Witnesses saw the plane emitting heavy smoke shortly after leaving the Rockcliffe Airport before falling and exploding into flames. Only one American serviceman escaped by parachute, it remains uncertain whether or not the parachutes had either malfunctioned or that the men were hesitant to jump. Regardless, the incident is being investigated by the Royal Canadian Air Force and a United States investigation team sent from [NEE.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nBorn on October 6, 1892- Steinhardt grew up in New York City and served a brief stint in the army in the 60th Field Artillery. A member of the Republican Party, he ascended into politics with a close friendship with President Baldwin. Entering the world of international relations, Steinhardt served as the American Ambassador to Sweden where he was given the Order of the Polar Star by King Gustav V in 1936. The civil war in America forced Steinhardt to return home and he decided to offer his allegiance to the Provisional Government in New England. Following the great war, Steinhardt served as the American ambassador to [RUS.GetName] until his most recent and unfortunately final appointment as ambassador to [CAN.GetName]."

# Death Knell of Maine Klan
miscnee.179.t: "Death Knell of the Maine Klan"
miscnee.179.d: "Since its inception as a compromise between the divided congress of the American antebellum, the northernmost state of Maine has long been considered a land of moderation and tranquility. To this end, the political trends in Maine are a good measure of the national mood, with its September gubernatorial election widely considered a predictor of the following national elections. In recent years, however, a new wave of immigration from French Canada to the mill-towns of central Maine has disrupted the homogeneity and tranquility of the state. With a growing community of devout Catholics in the state, the entrenched Protestant majority increasingly turned to charismatic magician turned Ku Klux Klan Leader F. Eugene Farnsworth, who developed a deep web of Klan patronage and community which threatened to subsume the ruling Republican Party.\n\nThese tensions would come to a head in 1926, when a clique of pro-Klan Republicans led by Governor Owen Brewster were soundly defeated by the old guard of the party, which joined forces with their Democratic enemies to secure the election of an anti-Klan senator. In the wake of this electoral defeat, the Maine Klan suffered a number of legal and monetary setbacks, leading to a near universal collapse. While the Klan itself has all but dissolved, a more insidious legacy remains. A number of sheriffs and municipal administrators across the state were put in place by the Klan more than a decade ago, and continue to maintain Klan values in much of the state.\n\nAs far as official membership goes, on the other hand, all that remains are the Women of the Klan, who continue to fund a collection of local chapters through bake sales and church meetings."

# Formation of National Ski Patrol
miscnee.181.t: "Formation of the National Ski Patrol"
miscnee.181.d: "An experience of ski tragedies shook the worldview of amateur skier and insurance agent Charles Minot Dole in 1936 that would lead him to spearhead a national organisation dedicated to ski safety and rescue. On a ski trip in Stowe, Vermont, Dole fractured his ankle, and he had no one to save him but his friend Frank Edson who just happened to pass by. Two months later, Edson went on his own ski race and fractured his ribs and arms while also suffering from lung collapse. The severe injury led to Edson's unfortunate death - and would have a lasting impression on Dole.\n\nThe president of the National Ski Association, Roger Langley, asked Dole to chair a ski accident study for the NSA and set up patrols for the 1938 National Downhill and Slalom Races. The success of this little project convinced Langley to ask Dole to charter a provisional patrol on a national basis throughout the United States. Dole took heavy inspiration from the Parsenndienst, a Swiss patrol in Davos, Switzerland, forming his own ski patrol. However, unlike the Swiss patrol, members of the American patrol did not charge for rescue or care. His \"National Ski Patrol\" is centered around the motto \"Service and Safety,\" with patrollers mandated to take extensive courses to fulfill Dole's requirements and standards for effective and efficient patrollers. Since the organisation is entirely voluntary, Dole created an awards program based on local and national levels. The awarding program covers various commendable skills and achievements such as leadership, first aid, skiing, mountaineering, and avalanche training."

As American aid and relief continues to pour into war-torn Europe, isolationists and critics of American foreign policy have pushed to cut relief efforts. Acheson mentioned that he had heard that the European peoples seeking assistance were not hard-working and were instead reliant on American support.\n\nTo these critics of American overseas aid, Acheson argued that Europeans were not lazy - pointing out the rise in pre-war production in France and Britain. Acheson further admonished that if [NEE.GetNameDef] failed or refused to help the governments of Western Europe restore order; the citizens of these countries can easily fall sway to the seductive lure of syndicalism and socialism once more.

# Wells calls for the death of isolation
miscnee.183.t: "Wells Calls For The Death of Isolationism"
miscnee.183.d: "The past history of the United States has shown the futility of taking the isolationist stance. Despite a quick colonial war at the turn of the century with the fading power of the Spanish Empire, the United States began a shift in foreign policy towards isolation. While this trend successfully kept our young men from dying needlessly in the fields of Flanders over a European scuffle, American global interests were devastated. The collapse of the Third French Republic was to be a quick showcase of the tremors that were to come in the next half decade. Five years later, when the British Empire collapsed and the stock exchange plummeted, America found itself in its darkest hour since the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. As the Germans pushed the Americans out of the greater European market, and with longstanding American allies falling to socialist revolts, the United States was forced to turn inwards in hopes of outlasting the storm. This isolationist stance saw a decreasing American presence abroad until finally the fires of the second American civil war consumed America once more.\n\nIn a speech given to the New York Times, Secretary of State Sumner Wells decried that \"Isolation, in its earlier form, as an issue, is I believe, dead.\" If America wishes to see prosperity in the world, they can not make it happen while staying inside their borders at home. America must take an active approach to seek out allies and expand their presence. The way to secure future peace is through action, not merely words. Only then can the world know the strength of Democracy that spent much of the last two decades fading away in face of Authoritarianism and Socialism."

For the second time in its history, the city's once-mighty avenues and monuments were nothing more than mere shells of their former selves. Intense street-to-street fighting had led to each building in the city turned into a fortress - a depressing fate for what was once the heart of American democracy.\n\nWith order being restored across the nation and the world recognition of the reunified United States of America, the question of the nation's capital has arisen. Despite being utterly ruined, Washington D.C. is a powerful candidate. The return of a President to the White House and the Congresses held in the Capital would legitimize the Provisional Government of New England as the heirs to American democracy. On the other hand, the city of Boston also poses a powerful argument. The birthplace of the American Revolution and the temporary capital during the nation's darkest days, Boston has undoubtedly proved its worth as the nations' capital. And finally, there is the proposal that the nation's capital should be moved westward, to the middle of the country.

Back in his younger days in 1890s Washington before returning to Maine, Lermond worked with figures like Henry Demarest Lloyd, F. G. R. Gordon, and Ed Pelton under the endorsement of major early American Socialists like Eugene Debs, Frank Parsons, William Bliss, Myron Reed, and Eltweed Pomeroy to create the Equality Colony of Skagit County. Operated by the original Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth under Lermond and Pelton’s control, the BCC was established to oversee the utopian project while educating the masses on the principles of Socialism, establishing colonies and industries across the state until all is socialized, and to unite all Socialists under a single fraternal association. Though our new state advanced the first two points in spades, the unity of all Socialists is up to interpretation. Though our state stands unified under our form of Leftism, the wider Western World dominated by the former America is not, but perhaps we could change that. Though we have tried to diplomatically pursue Leftist unity on a grand scale, the internationalist cause of our own purified design has failed in the face of the far more popular Third Internationale and other alliances like it.

This has once again sparked the national debate on not only drugs but alcohol as well, with many Prohibition-aligned Socialists threatening to leave the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth over this issue. Known to partake in cannabis consumption himself, especially when strolling through his own beloved Knox Arboretum in Warren, Maine or the other botanical gardens and natural parks that have rapidly begun to dot the nation, Lermond personally advocates for recreational drug usage in smart moderation when not dealing with matters of state or of other importance, even backing certain marijuana and psilocybin farms run by his friends and righteous independent associates in order to deliver natural medicine to the people that need it while fueling our infantile Socialist economy. However, Lermond also preaches that alcohol has led to many avoidable sins and plagues that now afflict America, and personally believes that laws such as prohibition should likely be left up to each individual commune and union in the nation as opposed to a nationally-binding law, in the interest of true freedom, unity, and personal autonomy.

newenglandmilflavor.4.d:0 "’The unanimous Declaration of these United States of America, when in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the previous United States was a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world...’"

newenglandmilflavor.5.d:0 "As anti-Anglo sentiment begins to rise in New England once again, as if it was the age of the Thirteen Colonies all over again, certain pejorative terms have become common in New Englander vernacular and slang once more, mostly aimed against the invasive Brits. Terms like macaroni and dandyboy - derived from the fanciful and extravagant, though feminine-looking, dress of old British nobility - as well as others like Angloid, orc, and more have become common in everyday speech, and these slurs are used heavily against the invading Canucks and their Entente attack dogs. Though we agree with our citizens’ anger, can we allow this vitriol to be spoken aloud by the public, in public?"

newenglandmilflavor.6.t:0 "A Modern-day Benedict Arnold"
newenglandmilflavor.6.d:0 "The famous Revolutionary General for America turned traitor and British informant and spy Benedict Arnold is infamous for being the United States of America’s greatest and most widely-known, and widely despised, traitor. Stabbing the Continental Army in the back and betraying Washington and the rest of the Thirteen Colonies for a shot at a cushy life in the British-controlled post-war colonies if the Anglos won, Arnold and his allies instead lost the war, but justice evaded this snake. He was able to flee to Britain after America won its independence, becoming a profitable businessman in England and Canada before dying in England in 1801. Though we were not able to bring this traitor to justice, we have been given a second chance at revenge, for a new Benedict Arnold has arisen, \n\nGeneral Prescott Bush served with the Second Continental Army as an officer in the opening months of this new anti-Anglo conflict, but Bush and his family secretly made contacts with Anglo forces in hopes of securing a position among the Entente nobility by aiding the Canuck forces in their march to victory. However, this snake was caught due to letters revealing his traitorous crimes being intercepted by loyal officers, and now Prescott Bush has been put on military trial as a traitor, facing the death penalty and the total disgrace of his familial line. How shall we deal with this rat?"

newenglandmilflavor.7.t:0 "Home Defense in the Age of the New Revolution"
newenglandmilflavor.7.d:0 "The Second Revolutionary War is in full swing, and our proud patriots have been giving the Brits hell. However, despite New England’s large industrial base, we are still struggling to arm every volunteer and patriot who wishes to fight for New Englander sovereignty while also providing arms to our households so that they may defend themselves against roving British raiders and scavengers. To remedy this shortage, we shall break out the museum pieces and revive traditional domestic gun-smithing techniques so that any and all Minutemen who wish to pick up a rifle against the Anglo menace can do so. \n\nWe shall tell all to own a musket for home defense, for that is what the Founding Fathers intended. Just imagine the sight - four ruffians break into your home. As you cry out ‘what the devil?!’, you grab your powdered wig and the Kentucky rifle given to you by the state from the Boston Colonial Museum. Just point and aim, blowing a golf ball-sized hole through the first man, dropping him dead on the spot. Drawing your percussion-cap or flintlock pistol from your holster, you fire and miss the second shot entirely due to its smoothbore barrel, instead sending the round through an exterior wall and nailing the neighbor’s dog. Running to your final resort, you ready the colonial cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grapeshot, yelling ‘Tally ho, lads!’ as the grapeshot shreds two Angloids in the blast; the sound and extra shrapnel of the blast setting off alarms around the neighborhood. Finally, you affix your bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He bleeds out as he awaits the arrival of military police due to the impossible-to-stitch wound caused by the triangular bayonet, saving your home and your livelihood from the Anglo menace. Just as the Founding Fathers intended."

newenglandmilflavor.8.t:0 "The Debate on American Civil Religion"
newenglandmilflavor.8.d:0 "American Civil Religion describes the non-sectarian quasi-religious faith that permeates throughout the United States of America and its culture and socio-economic reality, foundationalized within the national symbology, culture, history, and mythos of America. Rooted in pan-Christian religious themes, Americanist nationalism and patriotism, deification of the Founding Fathers and their ideals, and the furthering of the idea that America itself is the fated shining city upon a hill spoken about by Jesus himself. This civil religion has become popular in some circles, especially nationalist and other extremely patriotic and Americanist associations and organizations. Though potentially dangerous, the ideas of ACR could further the ambitions of our current regime and further cement the ideas we are trying to instill on the wider American public. What should our position be on these controversial ideas?"
newenglandmilflavor.8.a:0 "Declare this civic religion as the state religion of America."
newenglandmilflavor.8.b:0 "Support the movement, but refuse to take an official stance."

newenglandmilflavor.9.d:0 "With the end of the Second Revolution against the British, we achieved peace in our time. Now that the violence has subsided and life is back to normal all over the country, an accountability commission has been established to solve issues our armies may have inadvertently caused. However, the information pouring into the commission has been alarming. The facts show that the New England IRA has been up to some unexplainable criminal activities ranging from the extortion of local businesses to the murder of local British officials and their families. They have also been involved in the car-bombing of innocent civilians, and some reports have also incriminated some of our commanders in drug dealing and killings involving the drug business. Some of our war heroes even engaged in reprisal killings of random pro-British civilians in revenge for crimes against our people. These crimes have cast a shadow over the army, and we are pressured to take action against these individuals due to the nature of their crimes. However, moving against them may antagonize immigrants and make them victims due to them taking action against personal enemies after being driven from their homes by the British."

newenglandmilflavor.10.t:0 "The New American Dream"
newenglandmilflavor.10.d:0 "While the rest of America tears itself to bloody shreds and bombs centuries of prosperity and innovation into dust, New England has taken a different shape. Having sworn off its ‘debased and barbaric’ brothers just over the border the new nation has begun to focus on internal improvements. Roads have been repaved, bridges repaired, factories raised and ever more products disgorged onto a hungry world. While most of the ensuing prosperity has collected at the very top of society, the sheer weight of the economic boom has brought prosperity to all New Englanders. On average the average working man’s wage has risen nearly a dollar in the past three months, his net worth has nearly doubled and his outlook is more optimistic than any time surveys have been taken. This resplendent prosperity has also made New England a haven for immigrants everywhere. Not only are they once more arriving by the boatload at a reopened Ellis Island but more and more fellow Americans are showing up at our borders, all but begging to join our shining city on a hill, a last beacon of the Gilded Age."

newenglandmilflavor.11.t:0 "The Extent of Desegregation"
newenglandmilflavor.11.d:0 "Pershing despises racism in all forms. To him it is not only practically wrong, but morally so. He black men die on the field of battle just as well and as heroically as white men. Since taking over command of the country Pershing has decided to attack this moral wrong without hesitation. Upon commencing the Reclamation General Pershing has told his advisors he will declare that in all areas of the country New Englander forces occupy, especially in the South, the land will be forcefully desegregated. To the layman it may be puzzling why this declaration has to be a blanket proclamation for the entire country given the North’s historic liberal attitudes to race. However, by giving the situation even a cursory second glance it becomes clear that in some major Northern cities like Baltimore, Detroit and Sacramento segregation is but an informal reality, but a reality all the same. Policies like redlining especially have created ghettos where, while legally not exclusively black, are exclusively black all the same. Pershing intends to smash this system and lift the American black class into parity with the white man, with the barrel of a gun if need be. However some of his more cautious advisors have voiced their expected objections. They maintain that segregation is an American institution no matter how vile and to break it up would only inspire more Whites to resistance."

newenglandmilflavor.12.t:0 "Readopting the Constitution"
newenglandmilflavor.12.d:0 "As America descends into Tyranny to the South President Bingham rules over a land that is everything America should be. Equal, prosperous and free. However for far too long the old American Constitution has been set aside for the Hartford Constitution, drafted by our contemporaries upon our nation's original founding. While passable until now as our regime takes on a more and more American flavor, many have begun to push for the original American constitution to be reintroduced as the basis for law in New England. Bingham generally supports this but some have raised a pertinent point, New England is very different from America. The American Constitution is tailor made for the America that no longer exists. Instead they suggest we simply lift the best parts of the Constitution and the best parts of the Hartford Constitution and fuse them into a newer, better document. Americanists in our administration however say this is tantamount to treason. New England is America reborn and America should live by American rules, those rules laid out in the Constitution of the United States."

newenglandmilflavor.13.d:0 "When we first received the message from New England we had the code checked again, and then checked it a third time. Our diplomats simply could not understand what they had just received. However, after the triple confirmation the picture was painted. New England, that traitorous hive of scum and villainy that fought so hard to break away from our benevolent rule, has come crawling back. Under their new ‘President’ they have decided that being left all alone between one nation that deems their entire existence a historical abortion and another that wants nothing to do with them is simply a recipe for disaster. So, rather than tie their boat to the sinking trash can fire that the Americans have made themselves, they instead turn to the only other kid on the block, us. They want to join the Entente, again, not as a member of the British Dominion but as a full and equal partner. While politically letting them in could be a good or bad thing, depending on how we spin the move to the press, economically the advantages are plain. New England has come far from its destruction during their ‘Second Revolution’. Adding them to the Entente would give us a massive boost to our warmaking capacity for when we go back to the Homeland."

newenglandmilflavor.15.t:0 "An Offer from New England"
newenglandmilflavor.15.d:0 "The offer was incredible. In a letter personally written by President Bingham, New England has offered to pay Canada a sum of 100 million dollars for the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The Canadians living within those lands would be given six months to decide if they wanted to stay in New England or leave for Canada. Those who move would receive help from the New Englander government including financial support. The offer is almost too good to be true. That is why some within the Canadian government vehemently oppose it. Not only would it be giving away some of the largest ports Canada has on the Atlantic Ocean, ports that would be absolutely vital for Operation Homecoming, but the deal is simply too good. They refuse to believe that Bingham is not hiding some poison pill among all the sweetness. However the decision is not theirs to make. Technically it's not even Edwards since Canada has a strong Parliament. However the Parliament will do what the King says and, after much spirited debate, Edward makes his decision."

Already the Bank of New England has begun to move the money necessary. In the meantime the Army has prepared its own operation in conjunction with the Canadian Army. Slowly and methodically they have moved into the new provinces. They have been met with suspicious stares so far but thankfully only that. Due to a concerted propaganda campaign many sympathizers have been laid before us, keeping the crowds quiet. Now, as the flag is raised over the jewel of our newest purchase, Nova Scotia, all Americans can rejoice in our most recent victory."
newenglandmilflavor.16.a:0 "A win for Brotherhood and Friendship!"

newenglandmilflavor.17.t:0 "Canada Spurns Us!"
newenglandmilflavor.17.d:0 "Today Canada has notified us that they will not sell off their Maritime Provinces. The reason was overtly diplomatic, coated in the honeyed words so delicately spun by a professional diplomatic corps. However all Americans from Bingham down to the lowest farmer knows why they really denied us our destiny. They still look down on us as little more than upjumped colonials! Even now after centuries of partition and our boundless attempts to deal with them in good faith! They don't think we are worthy of their kindness! Well the military already has a solution to this problem. Operation Schuyler calls for a swift strike into the Maritimes. The left flank of the advance will be anchored on the St Lawrence while our valiant forces overrun the Canadian garrisons to the River’s east. Our generals predict victory in just a few weeks. However Bingham still has reservations. War with Canada will be bloody and naturally kick us out of the Entente and leave us vulnerable to the jackals south of the border."

Our garrison in the city was caught off guard during the night and disarmed with nary a shot fired. As the sun rose on the Big Apple our flag was torn off the Empire State Building and the flag of New England was raised in its place. Our military staff has naturally been riled into a fury over the bold gambit, demanding the green light to counter this plain and bold faced invasion. However the President has been more reserved. New Englander forces have not advanced past the outskirts of NYC. Advanced forces stretch over the New Jersey Turnpike and have seemingly blocaded the entire state. Indeed they seem to have taken Long Island and dug in. To eject them from the city would bring about a long and drawn out urban conflict that would drown the city in blood.

As well wishes and congratulations fly around the War Department all the men in the room know that they have just pulled off and gotten away with stealing the greatest gem of the North East. New York is the center of American culture and a shipping hub rivaling any other. In our hands not only will it be safe from the horrors of war but we can develop it further."

However, that delusion was put to rest today. Today we have received a demand from President Bingham demanding that we agree to annexation into the New Englander state or face war. This is a war few believe we could feasibly win. New England, even as the smallest of the statelets that were split off from the old United States, dwarfs us in power. We surely could make any attack on our Venice of the West bloody, but it's doubtful we could fight it off completely. That is why many in our administration are urging us to accept, or at least ask for autonomy within the new State. However the jingoists within our city led by the NYPD demand that we not give in. They pledge that they could turn New York into a fortress that will stand against any assault for a thousand years."

Rather than condemn many thousands of their brothers and sons to a pointless conflict they have decided to accept the inevitable. Not only have they laid down their arms and begun the arduous process of annexation, they have done so by integrating themselves back into New York State. This has been met with some grumbling from ‘Upstaters’ who had enjoyed being the focus of the state's attention for once. Now with the Big Apple back in town however many are resigned to being just another side show to the City that Never Sleeps."

newenglandmilflavor.22.d:0 "Our demand for NYC’s annexation has been countered. Instead Mayor [NYC.GetLeader] asked for significant degrees of autonomy, unseen in America. The Mayor points out that NYC did just find without the rest of the State until now. Not only that but much of the city's population have come around to the idea of an independent NYC. If not totally independent, he assures us they can settle for independence from Albany. New York State however has flatly rejected the compromise. New  York City is a massive cash cow for the State and while the government lives in Albany, it lives off of the endless bounty the City provides. Since its separation the State has struggled to make ends meet and suffered greatly under the repeated budget cuts. They want New York City back not only for historical reasons, but also plainly so they can return to the normalcy of a bountiful treasury. Going over the objections of New York Bingham has drawn up a compromise where NYC agrees to annexation, but will be granted statehood rather than be put back into the state of New York."

Political forces at home drive him to incorporate our state into his. However he acknowledges our progress so far in our independence. He has offered to admit us as a State of the New Englander Union, separate from Upstate New York. Those who wanted us to initially submit urged us to take the deal. They point out that there probably will not be a better offer and again, we cannot win a war against New England. However the military still scoffs at this proposal.

After a flurry of negotiations New York City agreed to give up its misguided experiment with nationhood and rejoin the mother country. However, over Albany’s objections we have agreed to accept them as an equal partner and the newest state in our great Union. This of course necessitates some minor political reshuffling. Upstate New York, now lacking New York, has taken on the name of Hudsonia, taking after the river that cleaves through the state. New York City meanwhile has become a different kind of city state. Rather than taking the name New York the new State has been named Gotham after a name for the city used by Washington Irving.

They demand we punish this insolence with overwhelming force. Already plans are being drafted for a multipronged land and sea assault on the city. In opposition to the military the doves in our administration have urged us to accept the offer. They point out that the payment is but a penance to the massive profit the Port of New York brings in. The Treasury predicts we would make our money back in just three years. Finally a more minor faction suggests we just leave the New Yorkers to themselves.

Meanwhile the City dwellers are growing tired of having their tax dollars diverted to pay for the rest of the state. They have been advocating for a split for weeks now with City dwellers wanting to split Long Island off into the new state of Gotham and many upstaters already referring to themselves as Hudsonians rather than New Yorkers.

To squash New Englander nationalism Groves plainly has two options. The more straight forwards and probably faster method is through a combination of raids on New England Nationalist organizations and breaking up New Englander regiments that refuse to shake their false identity. This however is dangerous as some of these organizations are very...active. To crush them could result in conflict and potential deaths.

New England is freer, more prosperous and better led than any other part of the country. Not only that but MacArthur was on the ropes before Groves jumped in. Its plain to everybody except MacArthur that he would’ve probably lost had it not been for New England. Due to these factors and more, Groves has been pushing for leadership in the Federalist cause. Mac has served his purpose, now he must retire in favor of a leader that was actually elected to his office. Mac however, naturally, has demanded full and total New Englander submission. The impasse was clear and immediate. As the weeks dragged on, a new folder appeared on Groves’ desk revealing a war plan drawn up by the general staff should MacArthur become...belligerent."

This has shocked many within the administration who figured Groves a loyal and devoted MacArthurite. MacArthur however is less than surprised. He says that he has always figured Groves for the traitor he has turned out to be. He has already begun, in secret, to amass forces near the New Englander border to counter the expected demand. Despite the old General’s eagerness to fight his newest enemy, he is but one man. There are many within the administration and outside it who are simply tired of war. They are exhausted and want nothing more than to be done with the whole matter. These traitorous cowards have presented a demand that MacArthur indeed resign and hand over the government to Groves. They threaten a coup if MacArthur refuses! Of course they could just be bluffing, Mac is the most popular general in a century. But what if they aren't?"

It is short and to the point, a signature keystone of MacArthur's style. As Groves reaches the end of the message, he is dumbstruck. MacArthur, the egotistical, megalomaniacal savior of America, has agreed to give up power. Groves lets a smile creep over his face as he slowly sets down the message. For a brief moment, he lets himself shudder with nerves and smile with elation. Then, just as suddenly as the moment came, it was over. The decades of military life and training kicked in, and Groves let his emotions simmer. He sat up and picked up the phone, about to call the border garrison commander and tell him to begin occupation operations. He still had a lot of work ahead of him."

He has denounced Groves as a traitor and demanded once more that he submit New England back into the Union. This time however he made it explicitly clear Groves will be tried for treason. Groves laid the paper onto the desk and ran a hand through his graying hair. To resist is almost an impossible task. America is reunited under MacArthur, largely by Groves’ own doing. Just tiny New England facing all that combined industrial and military might? The war would be damn near apocalyptic. Maybe for the betterment of all he really should give up. It would save everybody a lot of needless bloodshed, even at the cost of his own life. But, on the other hand New England fought off Canada with a lot less. Sure it wasn’t easy, but it was done. Not only that but to condemn millions of Americans to almost perpetual dictatorial tyranny would be a tragedy. Groves holds the last torch of the Founders’ vision for America.

Some fought for dictators, others for populists, some for simple hearth and home. However, all fought, and now all must receive their sentence. We could purge the lot of them, it solves the problem quite neatly and sends a strong message.

From the Syndicalist Party to the Old Democrats every major political force from before the war has finally been destroyed. This has angered many as many still identify as a member of one of the old parties. Some even said this is just a prelude to Pershing rolling back his promise all together.

While he may be progressive to some people, he may not change in the future should the situation require it. Not only that but America is saved. Pershing’s mission of uniting the nation is done and frankly, many feel the nation no longer needs him. They urge him to retire and walk off into the history books truly as a second Washington. As a man who appeared in America’s hour of need, put the nation to rights and then restored democracy and salvaged America’s traditions. However on his other shoulder sits a cabal of generals who have a completely different view. They see the failure of Old America and want it to never happen again. They pin those failures on the inherent weaknesses of the Democratic system. They claim the factionalism and partisanship that destroyed America once will destroy America again without some unifying figure, a figure much like Pershing.

Many liberal politicians, Washington insiders and Pershing himself want to restore democracy. They see the American system as almost sacred and feel like giving it up would be tantamount to treason. However they are opposed by a majority of the Army who shed much blood, sweat and tears actually fighting to reunite the nation. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have expressed their reluctance to return to a ‘failed system’ as they call the old way. While treading lightly around Pershing, praising democratic ideals in the same breath as denouncing them, in private they are more blunt. Many have told senior aides and friends that to give the country back to the politicians who destroyed it in the first place would be asking for disaster. Instead they want Pershing to name one of them as his successor. This would turn the US into a plain military dictatorship and work in opposition to the stated goals of the Reclamation. However, ideals and reality rarely mix well. In the end however it is up to Pershing and after a stressful few days he comes to a decision."

There are three major ones, the Federalists, the Democratic Republicans and the Whigs.  Each of them broadly appeals to one faction of the old parties. However there are dozens of smaller parties to fill many different niches.

However, despite being united against the insurgent Democratic Republicans and Federalists, the Whigs are anything but cohesive. The Evangelical Christian wing of the party caused early chaos trying to push through planks to ban porn and alcohol while the more radical capitalistic members, once part of the disgraced Sentinels, tried to also push their own ‘Anarchist-Capitalist' message on the ticket.

The armed forces have put forth five men who might be able to provide such stabilizing hands of governance, in the huge shadow of Pershing’s deeds. Of the five, three are ironically descendants of heroic American figures themselves, with the son of Pershing and the descendants of Ulysses S. Grant and Hamilton were put forth in competition along with Marine Corp general Merritt Austin Edson and Pershing’s former aide-de-camp George Marshall. \n\nThe first and favored candidate is Pershing’s own son, Francis. However, by even having such a candidate as an option, there are already accusations of nepotism and breaking American tradition by having the son of a leader be his immediate successor, and so there are doubts as to if such a selection will truly provide the unity and stability we wish. Facing the accusations head on, Francis Pershing himself has argued for breaking apart those dissidents who destabilize America during much needed peacetime, a much more worrying heavy handed approach to Pershing’s own ideals. A more friendly candidate is Ulysses Grant III, who seems to shy away from complete control in his hands in favor of allowing lower inputs from advisors and local leaders. Of course, he will continue military rule as it is Pershing’s wishes, and so he can be counted on as continuing the non-partisan Presidentship, but not going much further than the Chiefs of Staff’s wishes for the president. \n\nThe next candidate is Pierpont Hamilton, the descendant of Founding Father and Secretary of Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. And compared to the other candidates, this one does not shy from admitting out loud that tiptoeing around reality has only further wounded America, and that the Federalist favored approach of centralized control is what’s needed to prevent a third fracture of America. Thus Hamilton will centralize control around himself and his trusted generals to rebuild America. Coming in fourth is Merritt A. Edson, commander of the New England marines and founder of the infamous Marine Raiders spec-ops division. With deep ties to the Navy and a master of naval aviation, ‘Red Mike’ Edson is expected to empower the Navy and growing airforce while largely leaving matters of domestic governance up to a local loyal cadre of Federalist officials and loyal politicians. \n\nFinally, there is Pershing’s own favored choice before he died, his best friend and closest ally in the Armed Force - George C. Marshall. Serving together for decades across all theaters imaginable, Marshall served as Pershing’s right-hand man for years, and is seen as the natural choice by many, especially those wishing to avoid the nepotism that would come with appointing Pershing’s son. A military genius with a sharp mind for economics and diplomacy, Marshall is seen by many to be the Third Washington after Pershing and our chief Founding Father.

While they doubt ARPA’s stated timeline of a decade to get to the Moon will be accurate, debate in academic circles has begun to shift from if it's possible, to how long until it is possible.

Bringing the battered and bruised Federalist cause under his wing, Groves has achieved the daunting task of bringing America back from the brink. Now with such a mission completed, there are those who are discussing if it truly is best that Groves continues to lead, after all, he was a wartime leader, one who sailed our great union’s ship through the fire and flames of civil war, but is he still fit after such a stressful task to lead reconstruction and American life from this point forward? Whilst those who raise the concerns are not entirely wrong about their worry for Grove’s health and stress, there are also those among Grove’s loyalists who state that these petition’s and raised voices are a potential plot, propped up by those who would blindly give syndicalism the chance to rise forth without the constant vigil of Groves, but also, and perhaps even more insidiously, those of Macarthur’s stock are taking this as a chance to usurp Grove’s faction in the federalist front. These rumors that our cabinet and advisors speak of are indeed worrying if, at all, they are properly true and founded upon, as that would mean that the federalist cause is splitting apart by simple factionalism and loyalty to individual leaders. The last thing we can afford is more fratricide, especially after the gargantuan effort to end such sorrowful bloodshed during the civil war. Thus, Groves must decide. Can he safely trust in the cause enough so that if he retires from the scene, the ship will continue to sail freely and without cracks in the hull?

But before he can finally hop into that sedan and be free from this burden, he must select one of the candidates who have been fiercely contesting for his favor these past weeks. The name that has been circulated around in Grove’s loyal circles the most is that of Adna Chafee Jr, a general who has been blissfully ignorant of the politics of our state, while he diligently worked on Mechanizing our armed forces to a modern standard. It remains to be seen how he will perform if given the Presidency, but he has served faithfully to the cause, and thus can be relied on to maintain the status quo that was set by Groves. \nThe next is one who is controversial within our advisor circles, as he was one of Macarthur’s stock, fighting in the defense of D.C. General Westmoreland is a pretty young officer, but has risen in infamy due to his deeds during the fighting, the controversy aligns with the factor that he is not one of our original officer corps, but one that was under the control of Macarthurites, and the campaigns around the federal capitol seem to have sharply changed their demeanor and fervor. This has not been disproven, as Westmoreland has been talking into Grove’s ear himself, playing to his fierce hate of the red menace, Westmoreland promises to ensure a never ending crackdown on them in a starkly hardline stance. \nA more up and coming candidate that is certainly the underdog in this competition, John Fitzgerald Kennedy has been a young officer that has been faithfully serving with us along the way, and has beaten back the accusations of him being just a candidate propped up by his family lineage. He seems to favor a more saving grace stance for our Junta’s position, believing that if America is to be properly healed, whilst also following Grove’s idea that the junta must continue as democracy cannot be safeguarded so soon, then we must give a helping hand to our citizenry. How can the people support the junta if they do not have food or shelter after such a destructive war. \nRegardless of all their ideals, the decision is firmly in Grove’s hand, one that will be quickly decided as he is awaiting a well promised vacation."

Bingham has finally had enough.. Looking back in time, he has drawn inspiration from the first great Presidential conservationist, Theodore Roosevelt, and has begun to draft legislation to establish a slew of new National Forests and Parks in an effort to save what little nature remains. Not only that, but he has also pushed through legislation requiring all logging companies to plant a tree for every tree they cut down as part of their efforts to rebuild what has already been lost.

Chafing under this strict regime, citizens have begun marching out to the streets to protest the enacted martial law, the lack of overall democracy in the nation, and some even calling for Bingham to step down in favor of the Hartford Convention, which has been inactive since Canada forced the body to disband.\n\nWhilst restoring democracy is the end goal of Bingham, who does not seek to see America radically altered, the goal of preserving America has led him to maintain military rule, to better ensure American preservation. But with the people themselves having propped up such socialistic and despotic characters, Bingham is convinced that if democracy returns, it must be favored towards him, so he can ensure that a slice of the American pie can survive. Of course, that is if we cave into the demands, as the military remains under our absolute order, meaning that if we must disperse those agitators with shot and bayonet, they stand ready for such violence."

newenglandmilflavor.53.d:0 "Towards the end of the Revolutionary War, or the War for American Independence, a group of General George Washington’s once-loyal soldiers began to threaten mutiny over unmet demands. These veterans demanded that, in compensation for their service and sacrifices to birth our free nation, they should be paid not in money, but in land. The Great General Washington was able to talk down these would-be mutineers in a powerful, charismatic, and moving speech called his Newburgh Address, and it has since been likened to Alexander the Great’s speech that ended the infamous Opis Mutiny by loyal American patriots and admirers of Washington himself. Pershing, though a sound leader, a great general, and a hero of New England, is not Washington, and with his enemies among the conservative Right always critical of his seemingly ‘liberal’ ways - largely over Pershing’s support of a desegregated Army - still active and loud as ever within the military, he likely cannot sway the masses. As such, General Pershing must make a choice - attempt to woo the men with a rousing speech and only pay them in normal means, or should we accept the demands of these veterans and give them each a small plot of land as thanks for their service?"

All shall receive a small plot of land, one bigger than what we would have given if we just accepted in the first place, and will still receive their normal pensions in order to further appease them. The nation heals, and the Army is pleased, but Pershing’s pride has definitely taken a hit, and minorly so has his popularity."

newenglandmilflavor.56.d:0 "Infamously, the Newburgh Letter of 1782 was sent to General George Washington as he camped in Newburgh, New York, and was written for the army officers under Washington by Colonel Lewis Nicolas, suggesting that George Washington should be elevate to the role of King of our newly independent United States. The letter serves as a large part of the foundation of what has since been called the ‘Washingtonian Myth’, or the myth that Washington himself approved of the letter in secret. In reality, the letter deeply offended Washington and troubled him that his own men could possibly want such a thing. \n\nNaturally, as both history and we all know, Washington denied such a ludicrous request, but that has not stopped this myth and idea from resurfacing. In our newly independent New England and under the ‘new Washington’ that is General Pershing, some deranged ‘patriots’ have suggested that Pershing go along with the Washingtonian Myth and support one of the ‘true heirs’ to this never-existent throne, while others have even suggested that Pershing himself become king. Like his predecessor before him, however, General Pershing has been outraged at such a notion, and has publicly proclaimed that anyone caught supporting such an un-American idea shall be declared a traitor to the state."

Despite the initial intent of blackballing Pershing with this reputation, the old general has turned this pejorative into a self-beloved and now widely-respected moniker, for Pershing has never rebuked on his dedication to racial equality and race-blind comradeship within both the Army and wider society. Unlike many of his contemporaries both in our army and the army of the other various American factions, Pershing sees no difference in the ability of his men in regards to skin color or ethno-religious background, for he only sees able-bodied American heroes and proud sons that are patriotically serving their nation. This attitude has begun to expand outside the Army as well, spreading ideas of racial equality, civil rights, and de-segregation across the nation. Whether these spreading ideas amount to anything, however, is yet to be seen."

newenglandmilflavor.59.d:0 "As President Pershing’s ambitions have grown, so have his ideas. Pershing genuinely hates few things in this world. Having traveled so much of it, he has learned to love much of what the world has to offer. One thing he has forever hated however, with every aching bone in his aging body, is racism. To him racism is not just superficial, as Africans and Asians look much the same as anybody else anatomically, it's also damaging to the moral and social fibers of a nation. Old America shows that danger plainly with its repulsive history of lynchings, race riots and the most vile practice of all, slavery. Just south of the border in fact many Negro Americas suffer under the increasingly racist and despotic ‘Constitutional American Republic’. While Pershing is smart enough to realize unifying America is a long term goal, he has already begun to plan for its aftermath. In this planning his first endeavor and one that he has pledged to his staff to pursue as fiercely as he can, is to eradicate racism. If America is to survive, he says, then it must do so as one people. Already he is beginning to implement some of his ideas for destroying racism on a national scale by proposing an amendment to the 13 amendment removing the provision allowing slavery as a punishment for crime."

Most of them pay little mind to our state and those that do by and large see us as British puppets. However, there has been one surprising exception to the sea of distrust and disinterest. In the Deep South the long oppressed Negro has decided not to wait for liberation, but to seize it for themselves. These brave revolutionaries have seized vast swaths of the so-called ‘Black Belt’ and founded the Black Belt Republic. Its leader is also surprising, its former Lt Colonel Charles Young. Young is famous for his leadership of the Buffalo Soldiers and served with Pershing in Mexico, now he has gained more fame now leading his Negro brothers in revolt against the Jim Crow South. Having heard of our promise, Young has extended to us a unique offer. He offers to unite our two nations in an alliance of brotherhood and equality promising that together we will achieve the dream of a truly free and equal America. While Pershing is receptive to this offer he has been cautioned against it. His more hesitant advisors warn us against throwing our hat into the broiling charnel pit that America has become. They stress that we don't have the industry, population or capacity at the moment to liberate all of America. The other side is just as adamant. They claim that with the major powers distracted it is the perfect time to strike. A lightning advance could sweep up mountains of territory and give us the resources needed to finish the next push. Not only that but they point out that we will not be doing this alone, the BBR is as capable a fighting force as any other. With our two forces united, who could stop us?"

newenglandmilflavor.61.d:0 "As Pershing works to rebuild America and heal the scars of war his image has undergone a dramatic shift. While he was once just another warlord, if not more beloved than most, now he is more than that. Americans both in New England and in the rest of the country are beginning to see Pershing as a new Washington. While his critics point out that he sent thousands of men to their deaths every day just like the other factions, his supporters maintain that it was for a higher purpose. While the other leaders were transparent political goons using men’s lives like pawns in chess for self-serving power plays, Pershing used them for the greatest goal there is, to unite America. Pershing, while usually quite modest, has begun to lean into the comparisons to Washington. He joined the Society of the Cincinnati and speaks at its events frequently. He set up camps at Valley Forge and Mt Vernon where he spends most of his time away from the halls of power. He even adopted a modified version of Washington’s famous uniform as his standard military dress uniform. The worship of him has gone so far that the Cult of Washington, once relegated to the fringes of American society, has come to the forefront. Now saying that Pershing is Washington reincarnated they have deified him in their perverse civic religion. While some of Pershing's advisors want him to shut down the growing cult, fearing just how extreme it may get, others encourage him to nurture it. They feel that any support is to be accepted."

newenglandmilflavor.62.d:0 "General John J Pershing in his long career has been many things. Chiefly among them is a soldier. Graduating West Point in 1886 his military career has spanned over five decades and he has served in every major US involved conflict since the Spanish American War. Through his long career in the Army he has invariably met many hundreds of ambitious junior officers. In fact just about every single officer of any note in all of what was once America at one time or another served under his command. While Pershing never met every single one of them personally, of course his style of leadership and drive has seemingly rubbed off to varying degrees on his proteges. While the Old General hates to see them use these lessons against their countrymen, in private he has admitted to a bit of pride in having such a profound influence over America’s military. Now at the head of a state himself he has begun to implement some reforms Pershing has seen as long past due. Training has been overhauled, once long agreed doctrine has come under new eyes of scrutiny, and units have begun to be gradually desegregated. Pershing guarantees that this is just the start of a long road to perfection."

newenglandmilflavor.63.d:0 "Today, for going above and beyond the call of duty, showing drive and ambition, for executing one of the most arduous and well planned campaigns in American history to completion and, most importantly, for uniting America under the banner of Freedom and Democracy once more the Restored Congress of the United States has bestowed upon General Pershing the rank of General of the Armies, making him America’s first six star general. Pershing accepted the promotion gracefully and attended the joint session to give a speech. In it he not only thanked Congress for the honor but he thanked the people for their trust and he thanked the military for their valor. He then called upon Congress to go one step further. He asked that General Washington, the true Father of the Nation as Pershing puts it, be promoted to six star general as well. While he does admit to having pulled off a feat of equal importance as Washington, he has steadfastly refused to admit that he has done better than him. After an emotional plea to the heart as has become Pershing’s oratory trademark the Joint Session quickly took up the issue. After two minutes of half hearted debate Congress posthumously promoted General Washington to General of the Armies as well, backdating the promotion to October 19th, 1781."

Many of them have been damaged, like the Lincoln Memorial, or outright destroyed like the Washington Monument. While a tragedy this has given the government a unique opportunity to honor the Founders as they should be. The first such monument to get a revamp with the Washington Monument. The obelisk was rebuilt in its entirety but at its base a rotunda was built. This frankly cavernous building was quickly decorated more like a shrine than a monument with Washington’s memorabilia dotting the walls and a giant statue sitting near its center at the base of the Obelisk showing Washington upon his noble steed Blueskin. Attempts by the government to get permission to have Washington moved from his burial place at Mt Vernon to the monument that bears his name have failed. However that has not stopped the construction of the Tomb of the Founder, an ornate and some would say Imperial looking room filled with statues of Washington at all periods of his life from his boyhood to the Presidency. In the center, carved from immaculate marble, is an empty marble coffin sitting upon a polished marble headstone bearing the simple engraving ‘WASHINGTON 1732 - 1799’. The Lincoln Memorial has been done in much the same way, becoming more like an Acropolis honoring the Great Liberator Abraham Lincoln. The statue that sits upon its mighty chair now looks out upon the city and smiles, knowing that freedom once again rings across the land. Lincoln’s family refused to give up as well so his ornate tomb within the statue lays empty...for now."

newenglandmilflavor.65.d:0 "While he isn’t dead yet many have called for General-President Pershing to get a monument in Washington DC along with the other founders. After much deliberation, some hesitation by Pershing and an arduous construction process the monument has finally been unveiled. The Pershing Park monument is mostly a large park full of trees with a few minor statues showing Pershing or soldiers as if they were walking towards the center of the park. If the visitor were to follow the statues line of sight they would be drawn to a large rotunda made of Calacatta marble sitting atop a five tiered platform. Carved into the walls on the bottom floor are scenes of the First Revolution. On the second stair are scenes of the Civil War. On the third, scenes of the Second Revolution. On the fourth, scenes of the Reunification of America. On the base of the fifth and final level, that being the base of the rotunda, are carved scenes of New America with children playing, men and women smiling and the sun shining on a newly united nation. The rotunda itself is flanked on all sides at all times by the newly established Presidential Memorial Honor Guard. Taken from the creme of the military crop these men are dressed in sharply designed uniforms to be kept spotless at all times. They are to walk ten spaces to their left, turn on their heels, walk twenty spaces to their right, turn on their heels once more, then walk ten spaces back to the center and stand for ten minutes. At least four will be assigned to every monument in the city at all hours doing that routine, guarding America’s most hallowed halls. The rotunda is not closed off by walls between the pillars, instead it lays open so the large bronze statue of Pershing at its center can forever stand guard over the nation he fought so hard to save.  Upon Pershing’s request there is a building off to the right of the rotunda  that is home to the Book of Names. In that massive tome is the name of every soldier who died during the Reclamation so their name will never be forgotten."

However, after disobeying an order from MacArthur to shoot all dissenters on sight, he fled to New England to escape execution himself. There, through a complicated set of coincidences and luck, he rose through the ranks rapidly and now stands as the leader of the nation. While initially overwhelmed Groves has settled in quite nicely to his new role and has been noted as a studious bureaucrat, regularly working into the early dawn hours to finish his work. However, for all his success at home Groves has not forgotten the regime he once served. In recent speeches Groves has taken a hard line to MacArthur, firmly severing any lingering suspicions of his true loyalties. It has even been reported that Groves recently sent MacArthur a letter. Manifesto may be a more appropriate term as the letter is nearly six pages long and is stuffed full of insults and denunciations of MacArthur and his dictatorship. The letter finishes with paragraphs of Groves declaring his intent to ‘carry the torch of the Founders’ and ‘burn away all traces of your treason’. There is no word on whether MacArthur actually received the letter but if he did, it doesn't take a genius to guess how he felt about it."

While he never showed anybody the list and the number of names on the list kept changing on the subsequent speaking tour, the Army took his claim seriously. After a meticulous combing of the ranks 7 Syndicalist subversives were found and imprisoned for terroristic intent. However the Army then released a statement refuting McCarthys further claims of Syndicalist penetration in the government. However such a blow, which would shut down McCarthy’s antics in any other time, failed to make much of a dent. The Nation has gone into a Red Hysteria. Police stations are flooded with calls of suspicious persons outside homes, factories, roads and power stations. Most of these tips are junk but the rumors spread further than facts.

The truth was revealed when their leader, Leo Krzycki announced to the crowd they had herded into the city’s square. They simultaneously announced the creation of the Mosinee Commune and declared the Groves government illegitimate. The Mayor, Ralph E. Kronenwetter was woken up while attempting to take a nap in the city hall by the Rebels, and was dragged out while wearing his pyjamas. In the Town's new "Red Square", he was forced by gunpoint to accept Krzycki as the new Mayor of the Town during the proclamation of the Commune. A few hours later when Syndicalist rebels attempted to detain the police chief Carl Gewiss, a small gunfight erupted as the Rebels attempted to execute the police chief for resisting their "Revolution" which ended with the chief getting stuck twice in the leg though he survived the wound after being evacuated to Green Bay. The Commune lasted all of 18 hours and ended after, during another speech in the town square the residents of Mosinee rioted. Krzycki was captured and almost lynched, The Mayor was liberated from the Red's gasp during the riot and while in the process of proclaiming the return of Democracy, collapsed and would die a few hours later, having suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage. The rebel cell fled into the night and the city was liberated just in time for the Green Bay Army garrison to arrive.

While television cameras have been able to broadcast in color for almost as long as they have been able to broadcast, commercial TV sets are unable to pick up the color. As the DTFP works to come up with a cheap color TV, they have already begun to release patents for color photographs. The first test market, contracted through Kodak, was Washington DC with President Groves receiving the first new Kodak color camera. His first picture was actually a self portrait of him and his family. This photo was then donated to the newly established Smithsonian Museum of Science and Technology.

In the beginning they were massive draws as people came out in droves to see the first color film in the US, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. As the public marvels at this new innovation the DTFP is on the cusp of an even bigger innovation, commercial color TV. A new standard for color TV called Compatible Color has recently been more or less perfected, along with a lot of progress with RCA’s ‘shadow mask’ system. Though an alternative has been brought up with Scottish inventor John Logie Baird’s Telecolor system, however only a two gun version exists while a three gun model would be needed to be used with Compatible Color. Not only would it allow for the broadcast of color TV to the masses, it would be compatible with all existing black and white models. However to get the best quality John Q Public would have to get a native CCTV. To develop and produce the stunning new invention the DTFP has looked for a company to create them. They have narrowed down the dozens of applicants to just three. Each of them have their advantages and disadvantages and only one can be chosen. The first and most favored is the Radio Corporation of America. Not only were they one of the first American companies to rebound to Pre-Civil War profitability, RCA is also one of the pioneering TV companies around. They were one of the first to commercially sell TVs with the TRK models. All they are asking for to meet the requirements of the contract is a generous cash infusion. The second option would be Zenith Electronics Company. They had already made a name for themselves building high quality radios before branching out into equally well built televisions. While their products are pricey, their craftsmanship almost approaches artisanal levels. They are requesting by far and alone more than any other contender. However they promise not only to develop commercial color television sets but also develop remote controls for TV’s. This last promise has almost drawn more criticism than their ambitious plans for the TV as it's doubtful whether Americans would want a remote for a TV that would already have dials. The last choice is Philco or the Philadelphia Battery Company. They are known for their cheap radios and TVs that have a reputation for being cheap, low quality and short lived. Not only does Philco promise to develop a color TV model, but they promise to make it both affordable to the average American and “styled like it came from the 1960s!” all for much less money than anybody else. While the promise of bringing color TV to the average Joe is tempting, their tendency to use cheap parts can’t be easily dismissed."

One of the major selling points for some models that use the Chromacolor CRT is the Space Command Remote Control. The remote is wireless and uses ultrasonic sound as a trigger mechanism produced in the hand held unit by mechanically struck aluminum rods of carefully constructed dimensions, with a receiver in the television responding to the different frequencies this action produces. With being quite the innovation from older wired models produced in the months prior President Groves himself has praised Zenith for this invention. One minor issue is that enough audible noise is created by pressing to the point where it can be heard, despite this American consumers have begun affectionately calling the remotes “Clickers”. Zenith’s president Eugene F. McDonald has been reported as saying that this isn’t the end of their innovations, boasting that “We haven't even reached our Zenith yet!”.  The Chromacolor has swiftly become the best selling electronic in American history despite its high asking price and TV shows are quickly planning their switch to color.

These include the obvious like using better quality glass in the picture tubes or making the tube larger to make it stronger to the more round-about solutions like including a plastic covering on the TV screen so if the tube explodes and the screen shatters, nobody will be hurt. Along with the glaring issue of faulty CRTs the vacuum tubes within the tv set have been noted to burn out horribly quickly due to overheating in the case, with one wooden cased model literally bursting into flames during testing. One of the solutions Philco has suggested is placing a small fan unit in the case. The government, for their part, doesn’t really care what Philco ultimately decides to do. As far as the DTFP cares Philco just needs to get a functioning TV set out soon. The DTFP had been promised a release months ago and had been teasing it to the public ever since. The repeated delays however threaten to scuttle the entire launch and botch the rolling out a truly revolutionary piece of technology. Philco has a strict deadline now or the government will pull their funding. As said deadline rapidly approaches the government's advertising campaign has once again kicked into full gear. However it's still up in the air whether Philco will deliver."

newenglandmilflavor.76.d:0 "Today, after much trial and tribulation and after going nearly 10 million dollars over budget, the Philco Predicta has been released to the public. Initial fears over the troubled development cycle rubbing off on consumers seems however to have been unfounded. People have instantly taken a liking to the sleek cabinet designs and the greenish tint to the screen, a result of a protective plastic barrier in case of accidental explosion, has quickly become iconic. The Predicta even has a few innovations to call its own. Most popular and promising is the fact that the Predicta’s screen can be rotated nearly 180 degrees giving the average American a freedom of viewing angle not enjoyed by other prospective models. Not only that but the TV itself only costs $200 making it almost too affordable to the average American family. The newly converted TV factories are pushing their workers into overtime in a seemingly forever lost battle against the ever growing pile of backorders from across the nation. As a response many TV shows are now starting to broadcast in color as well as Black and White to take advantage of this newest of scientific innovations."

A further 30% of respondents who did not have one did indicate that they intend to buy a color TV within the next three months. The effect of color TV has seemingly even extended past the physical pane. Other studies, albeit more informal, indicate that people are dreaming in color more as well. While in the 30s similar studies indicated that about 75% of Americans ‘rarely if ever’ saw color in their dreams, the rollout of color TV’s has seemingly changed the dreams of Americans as well. A recent study by the University of Massachusetts states that of people who own a Color TV 80% now dream ‘almost exclusively’ in color. "

However,that has changed in the recent weeks thanks to various incidents reported in the Midwest. Up to a dozen thousand viewers across multiple states have so far reported an unusual interruption in the scheduled programming, consisting of distorted colorbars and sound played seemingly 'in reverse'. Usually such a problem could have been chalked up to some sort of temporary issue with local broadcasting equipment, yet in this instance the audiovisual errors were only a small part of the problem.\n\nWhat has already been dubbed by sensationalist paper headlines as the 'Colorbars Incident' has so far been connected to a wide range of physical and mental ailments in viewers. Most have notified the Department about temporary memory loss and headaches, but what is most concerning to our administration as a whole are the reports of sudden bloodlust and the reportedly strange feeling of being controlled by some unseen force. Various ultra-conservative religious groups have deemed the very idea of a color image receiver as Lucifer's work after these events, which of course is seen as preposterous to most of our population who all still greatly enjoy the visually rich sight that color television provides, despite occasional problems.\n\nThe Department of TFP and the wider government as a whole has launched an immediate investigation into the so-called 'Incident' on the grounds that a potentially foreign and nefarious force may be trying to ‘hack’ into our broadcasting network for some unknown purpose. According to inspector James Vela, the head of a special team created to investigate any possible clues leading to the perpetrators of the attack, his team has already received documents leading to a possible suspect only known under the supposed name 'Kennith'. Mr. Vela in an interview given to the press also recalled a similar event some time ago during which a radio transmission about textile arts was seemingly hijacked to carry subliminal messages meant to affect the targeted listener group, that being small town housewives. Back then, the authorities arrested one woman charged with murdering her husband after he tried to leave the house in the middle of the night, yet she was declared legally insane owing to her pre-existing mental problems and the stress caused by the progressing breakdown of her relationship with her spouse and possible post-partum depression, mania, or hysteria. If that incident and the recent 'Colorbars' one are connected remains to be determined by experts in the criminal field, but the investigation into these strange happenings have only just begun."

As he has explained in a recent barnstorming tour of the country President Bingham has come to the conclusion that New England cannot survive alone, and Canada is the only major power close enough to help us. This about face in Entente policy has not only caught many New Englanders off guard, but the Canadians as well. Their first responses were terse and unbelieving, simply unable to comprehend why a nation that fought so fiercely against them would so soon turn around and join them. However, after weighing the options the Canadians have, if not gladly, accepted New England back into the Entente.

Rather than let the most holy document man ever produced be relegated to rot in some African hovel Bingham has decided to retrieve it. However he is sure Hoover will not simply give it over. Instead Bingham has decided to dust off his old explorers cap and go after the Declaration himself!

newenglandmilflavor.82.d:0 "Bingham and his crew of four others arrived at Hoover’s Liberian mansion long after dark, taking advantage of the moonless night to sneak close to the compound's walls. Hoover had used his fortune and time to build himself a fortress in the African bush. The walls rose high above them, the smooth marble impossible to scale. Not only that but a small army of mercenaries were hired by Hoover to guard the compound night and day. The metal of their rifles glinted in the light made by the men’s torches. After subduing a few guards in the way the crew reached the large, heavy wooden gate. Fortunately for Bingham the gate was only high enough to prevent a single man scaling it. Stepping off Bingham’s back one of his compatriots known only by the affectionate nickname ‘Short Round’ was able to clamber over the gate and silently open the gate from the inside, letting the rest of the five man squad into the compound. After a few minutes of sneaking through the massive front yard, hiding in bushes and darkened corners to avoid roaming patrols, the crew were able to get to the front door. They were surprised to find it unlocked. Short Round happily went to open the door and continue the mission, only to be stopped by Bingham. The crew instead went to a nearby window and peered into the hallway. There they saw a tripwire set in front of the door. On the other side of the wire was a massive log tied to the ceiling, ready to swing down and push out any careless entree. After a few more nervous minutes of sneaking around the house, the squad entered into the house through an untrapped back door. Once inside the pair found the home dark and quiet, save for the sound of the first movement of Brahms Symphony No 1 coming from a distant radio. It seemed to be coming from the upstairs office. Since the home itself seemed unguarded the squad quickly made their way upstairs, following the music until, much against Bingham's better judgment, they burst into the office of Herbert Hoover. There they found nothing but the former 31st President reading the Declaration with a magnifying glass. The two sides, clearly not entirely expecting to meet each other, spent a tense minute staring each other down. Finally Hoover moved by folding the Declaration up and putting it in his jacket and pulling out a pistol. Bingham and his squad, left with few other options, simply charged him. This caught Hoover off guard who hadn't loaded his gun, figuring the mere sight of it would intimidate Bingham. After a short scuffle Bingham and his men tied up the former President and stole away into the night with the Declaration. They had a lot of ground to cover before they made their rendezvous point."

They were apparently looking for an American national treasure that they claim Hoover stole during his flight to our fair nation. After finding what they were coming for they left themselves just as quickly as they came leaving the poor former President tied up and beaten savagely in his own home, fearful for his life. We have demanded the Government of New England pay poor Mr Hoover an indemnity for the emotional and physical trauma suffered by Bingham and his goons.

His third oldest son, Alfred Bingham, is a Syndicalist author whose allegiance to the ‘Boston Commune’ in the early days of the Civil War before Canada came to secure New England caused his father a lot of headaches. Alfred has no love for his father, and Hiram has no love back. In fact, he was dismayed when a letter was given to him and he found that it came from Alfred. During the Canadian attack on Boston much of the Commune’s leadership was killed, Hiram had hoped that his third son was among them. However he now had proof of his own naivety. Using the letter head of a self styled ‘First Chairman of the New Englander Syndicalist Republic’ Alfred seemingly wrote a letter to taunt his father. In it Alfred spoke of his father’s ‘crimes’ against the Republic and its people. He said that the current government was illegitimate and swore to overthrow it, even if it took until the end of time. Hiram was enraged and threw the letter out as soon as he read it. He has ordered the Army to step up their partisan hunting operations, especially around Boston."

His diplomatic aptitude is apparent and his time in Japan has been very fruitful, helping to forge new trade deals with the Far East and expand New England’s diplomatic presence in the region. His seventh son Jonathan Bingham has begun to cultivate a domestic political career of his own as well. Recently he had been appointed a senator for Connecticut and has begun to forge strong and beneficial political relationships across the isle and within his own party. The President is wildly proud of (almost) all of his sons but those two have the most immediate potential. While the President despises nepotism, he has never been as tempted as he is now to go back on his ideals. Both of their stars are already rising and its clear they will only rise higher even if the President doesn't help pad their resume. On the other hand, by giving them some nice, cushy and most importantly powerful positions not only will they get a leg up on their competition, they can further prove their competency to not only their peers in government, but the people as well.

After graduating college he gained the accolade of becoming the first man to bring the existence of Machu Picchu, the ancient Inca city that the President still believes is the site of a massive temple. He would return to Peru three more times and discover the ruins of Rosaspata and the last capital of the Inca, Espiritu Pampa. These were some of the most thrilling adventures of his life and his journals of the expeditions were best sellers. As President that sense of adventure has never left. While he cannot in good conscience go out galavanting across the world and neglect his duty as President, Bingham has begun to gather money to fund future expeditions. One of pet projects is to explore the Darien Gap in Panama. The rough terrain and hostile environment of the 66(ish) mile gap makes traversing it impossible for wheeled transport and almost as impossible for all but the most seasoned of explorers. An expedition in 1924 became the first post-colonial transversal of the gap. However, President Bingham intends to not only map the Gap thoroughly but also tame it to pave the way for further development."

The lessons from the Civil War and the Reclamation were hard learned and will not be forgotten so easily. If it happened twice, it could easily happen again. To safeguard the true American government in times of national catastrophe, such as another Civil War, Operation Citadel has been begun. The Operation calls for the fortification of New England to convert the new heartland of American prosperity and culture into an unassailable fortress. Along with a fortification of the entire region, covert operations, such as the manipulation of local media and strict control over what is and isn’t published shall be undertaken. These covert operations shall attempt to keep the culture and people of New England in a permanent state of patriotic Americanism, and hopefully squash any syndicalist infiltration.  Should the worst come to pass and chaos overtakes the nation, the national government will no longer be caught flatfooted. Operating from the secure and prosperous New England any future American government will have a much easier time securing the nation. As not only will the government have a safe base to operate from, but the true culture and glory of America shall exist alongside the continuity government. The plan has rubbed some Americans wrong however. The many millions in states outside of New England feel abandoned and senators from some states decry the program for a ludicrous waste of American tax dollars. The President and his New Englander Congressional allies have managed to fight them off for now however. So, the plan continues and America’s heart will never again come under such dire threat again.

newenglandmilflavor.100.d:0 "The horrors of the Second Civil War have been relegated firmly into the past. The fear, terror and anarchy of those times are just fading memories now. Instead, the people celebrate the times they are in now. Never before has America been so unified, so prosperous and so free than it is now. When the President launched a recent tour of the United States he was met with jubilant crowds everywhere he went. Even those who were once ferocious enemies like the factory workers of Detroit and their bosses, have found common ground under our administration. The nation as a whole has also found itself with a new driving purpose, to serve as the glowing light of freedom and democracy in a world missing such things. America’s newfound prosperity has once more drawn the attention of masses of poor and hungry foreigners. As the great refugee ships from Europe and Asia once more set sail to our shores America is ready to welcome them with open arms."

newenglandmilflavor.101.d:0 "While most Americans may not actively identify as Constitutionalists, Syndicalists or Unionists anymore, many of them do look back on those days with some degree of nostalgia. To counter this growing feeling of secessionist nostalgia the Party has launched a massive media campaign. Called the ‘Shining City Campaign’ the Party has begun to formulate a massive media campaign. The campaign's ultimate goal is to remove the last vestiges of sympathy for the former secessionist states that once tore this great nation apart. TV Shows glorifying the First Revolution will become staples of programming, cultural icons are being commissioned to create works in their fields about America and new monuments to American heroes have been raised. The Government has also commissioned the Great American Songbook, a book of civilian submitted songs that are cornerstones of American culture. These Songs will be recorded and preserved at the Library of Congress. Already suggestions are flooding in for recommendations. While it is too early to say just how effective this campaign will be, there have been some early dividends. The most significant is the birth of the so-called ‘Civil Religion’, In areas we have owned the longest like New England and the states nearest to it, our repeated rhetoric has buried itself into many Americans' consciousness. Now some people in those states have taken their love for America nearly too far. They now nearly worship its institutions and its Founders as heavenly ordained. Washington, to them, is not just the founder of America, but the Chief God of the Founding Pantheon. While this phenomenon affects a small fraction of a fraction of the populace, it still worries some."

newenglandmilflavor.102.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning, General John Pershing, Savior of America and Heir of Washington, passed away peacefully in his sleep. With his death long prepared for, a provisional transfer of power has taken place. As per his own wishes, a Transitionary Executive Council has been established until the next president is chosen. Within his last will and testimony, Pershing called on the Council to prepare the way for a return to democracy, however, he also stipulated that if the Council believed the nation was not ready, they could instead elect to choose a successor from the armed forces to carry on the torch. With Council not wishing to let instability plague the nation due to the lack of a true leader, the body has chosen to settle this question as quickly as possible, to ensure national stability. As the day turns to night, the body after hours of debate decides to...    "

newenglandmilflavor.103.d:0 "We have news from New Orleans, the capital of the secessionist American Union State. Huey Long, the traitor, appears to be dead, and not a day too soon. Alfred Mitchell Bingham, a truly dreadful beast, has risen to power in his place. Alfred, President Bingham's third son, is an outcast in the family. When Huey launched his America First Party, Alfred became the movement's leader in the North-East as a leftist and subversive. When Huey took up arms against Washington, the schism between father and son widened into a canyon as Alfred fled to join Huey on his fool's crusade. Both men now lead a country. Both men are Presidents, and they have very different visions for their country. Some have suggested that President Hiram Bingham set aside his political reservations and personal hatred for his son in order to reach out to him. Perhaps, with old family ties, they can forge a strong alliance and bring peace to America. President Hiram, on the other hand, has flatly rejected this proposal. He didn't want anything to do with his son when he was rabble-rousing, and he doesn't want anything to do with him now that he's committing treason. While his coldness to his son makes some of his newer associates uneasy, to those who truly know the President, this is just the start of another chapter in their long running feud."

newenglandmilflavor.111.d:0 "America, as nation, as always been a land of Liberty and Freedom. Liberty to live ones life as they see fit, Freedom from tyranny of any sort. Even as America burned in the fires of civil war, these ideals lived on. Indeed, every faction of that horrid conflict was in the final analysis fighting for an interruption of our founding ideals. With the rise of Pershing, and the restoration of a Republic freed from the strangle hold of two corrupted political parties, the true ideals of America have once again begun to flourish. With the rise of the Federalist Party, the true and original authors of the American political system, once again dominate the very thing they brought to live.\n\nIn the absence of the Federalists, America greatly deviated from her course. There is no better example of this than the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. Passed in 1912, the amendment alters the Constitution by allowing the direct election of Senators by the people. Under the original framework, Senators were chosen by state legislatures, both as a way for the States to have a check on the Federal Government and to act as a more controlled body then the populist House. Since the passage of the 17th, this fundamental aspect of American Federalism has been shattered, and a Tyranny of the Majority has ensued. With a Party that finally understands this vital truth finally in power, the Federalist dominated Congress has passed an Amendment to the Constitution that repeals the 17th, finally restoring true federalism to America. With the Amendment now passed to the States for ratification, a mass effort of lobbying has begun. Federalist advisors have ensured the Party that it will only be a short time before the Twentieth Amendment becomes law, finally putting an end to the Tyranny of the Majority that has reigned in America for so long."

newenglandmilflavor.112.d:0 "In a historic moment, the remainder of the Thirteen Original Colonies not already under the New England banner have officially petitioned to rejoin the Union under the leadership of General John Pershing, the self-proclaimed heir of George Washington. The announcement was made by Pershing himself in a speech to a crowd of soldiers and their families in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. Due to his long-standing commitment to the ideals of George Washington and his vision of a united America, there had been growing support in many of the recently liberated states to reunify under the banner of the 'New Washington' much like they did in 1776. In his speech, Pershing emphasized the importance of unity and the need to come together as a nation in the face of the ongoing Civil War. He also paid tribute to the sacrifices made by the founding fathers, including George Washington, as well as the many brave soldiers who gave their lives to make this possible.\n\nThe news of the Thirteen Colonies' reunification has been met with widespread celebration across New England, with many seeing it as a symbol of hope and unity in a time of ongoing chaos and uncertainty. It is hoped that this momentous occasion will serve as a catalyst for greater cooperation and collaboration in the newly-readmitted states toward the ongoing struggle to reclaim the rest of America. While this may remain a purely symbolic gesture in some areas still under the control of hostile militants, those directly under our control have already begun to dedicate more resources to the war effort."

We have been America for over 150 years and that name, America, has gained a lot of baggage with it. Some of it is rather good like Manifest Destiny, Westward Expansion and the Gilded Age. However, it also means a lot of bad things too. Blacks in our country identify the name with their one time oppressors who did nothing while legions of their countrymen were enslaved, oppressed and murdered. The Indians identify it as the regime who stole all of their land and confined them to poor, destitute reservations and left them to die. For us to truly move on, some say, we must shed our old name for a new one. Columbia."

One of the most simple ones would change the field of 50 stars to a concentric circle of 50 stars which has been nicknamed the Wheel Flag.. It would please those who want a change but not stray too far from orthodoxy. Another suggestion is to adopt the old Betsy Ross Flag, 13 stripes and 13 stars in a circle on a field of blue. Then there is the Hopkinson flag which has the 13 stars arranged into three columns of 3 stars and two columns of 2 stars. A third suggestion is the Forster Flag which is truly unique. It is a blood red flag with six small white stripes in the top right corner on the front and seven on the top right in the back. Another suggestion is the Bennington Flag, which comes from the Revolutionary Battle of Bennington. The flag has the prerequisite 13 stripes. However in the blue canton it has a large 76 with 13 stars in an arch over the numbers. In addition, many have suggested, seemingly as a joke, the use of the flag of Easton, Pennsylvania. In essence, the flag of Easton is the same as the first American flag, but reversed. In the canton, the 13 stripes have taken the place of the stars, which reside in the place of the stripes. Interestingly enough, technically the flag does comply with the  1777 Flag Act as the location of the stars and stripes was not specified. Finally, some may propose the flag flown by captain John Paul Jones. Described by Franklin, and interpreted by the Dutch, it contains irregularly placed blue stripes along with 13 8-pointed stars."

These fringe academics obsessed with colonial and pre-modern American history suggest that we should rename the nation in a twin effort of honoring our Founding Fathers and ancestors while also cleansing America’s identity of the bloody failures of our recent past. Pulling on the ‘Fredonia’ idea started by the Founding Fathers, continued in the 1800s by Dr. Samuel Mitchill in his Fredon concept, the Fredonian Masonic Lodge of Massachusetts, and by the Fredonian rebels in Nacogdoches, Texas under General Empresario Haden Edwards, and now recently popularized once again by the Marx Brothers and their new comedy moving-picture ‘Duck Soup’, this group seeks to revive the Fredon or Fredonian concept once again by officially renaming the state, with the most common suggestions being the United States, or Territories, of Freedonia, or just Fredonia or Fredon itself.

lermond.1.t:0 "The White-Capped Devils Strike!"
lermond.1.d:0 "Normal Wallace Lermond is one of the most beloved and widely respected men in New England, but despite his widespread popularity and kind heart, there still exists opposition to this elderly titan of utopian Socialism. In the backwoods of Northern Maine, one such group of these detractors congregate - the Maine branch of the Ku Klux Klan. One of the largest KKK brotherhoods in the Northeast, the Maine KKK have long plotted against Lermond’s open, populist, and egalitarian policies, calling him an ally of the Judeo-Syndicalist cabal that tries to control the world. \n\nWith hate in their hearts and with blood on their minds, this northern offshoot of the Maine has plotted to kill our leader, creating a homemade bomb over the past few months with smuggled parts sourced from the black market and their ODP contacts. Planning to place the bomb in Lermond’s own arboretum and setting it to detonate when Lermond is schedule to hold a speech within his personal tree garden, the plan could possibly work. With the team assigned to deliver the payload on their way now, all that remains to be seen is if these backwoods yokels actually managed to create a working and deadly bomb or not."
lermond.1.a:0 "The bomb is disrupted in transit and detonates before reaching Lermond, killing all involved."

Found on a bench in his arboretum, Lermond had peacefully died in his sleep, surrounded by the nature he loved so. With his death, our nation is left without leadership, and in his absence, the Central Committee of the Socialist Party has taken control of the presidency until such time a Party Congress can be called. Regardless of Leadership, New England has lost her truest son, and we'll never be the same without him"
lermond.111.a:0 "Godspeed you magnificent bastard"

lermond.2.t:0 "The Inter-Party Election"
lermond.2.d:0 "With the death of President Lermond, the Party has moved to elect a new successor from within their own ranks. The main faction dominating the Party conference has the Lermondite loyalists nicknamed the Old Oaks. They are a group of sworn and devoted Lermondites that seek to guide New England forward with little to no deviation from our original path as set by our fallen father. They are largely dominated by three camps, being the young Left-Libertarian moderates under Lermond’s own student Barry Commoner, the communalist ‘Hiveists’ under Harvey Bulfinch Lovell who is the son of Lermond’s old colleague John and sworn to his late father’s ideals inspired by bee behavior and biology, and the main Lermondite loyalists known as the Oaken Core, which is led by Lermond’s own protégé and life-long friend Henry Augustus Pilsbry. \n\nOpposing this coalition of Lermondites are the two competing radical factions: the Industrialists and the Young Jeffersonians. The Industrialists under Erwin Bratton ‘Harry’ Ault are a group of Forsterite-inspired Syndicalist moderates that seek to capitalize on New England’s nascent industry in order to build an egalitarian worker’s paradise that still respects the environment as per Lermond’s wishes. Opposing the ‘traitors’ to Lermond’s vision are the Young Jeffersonians under the young philosopher and activist Paul Goodman. They seek to accelerate Lermond’s dream by harkening back to America’s frontier and colonial past, creating an ecological anarchist utopia built around cooperating communes. \n\nOnly one faction can truly win out however, so who shall rise to lead New England now in the wake of Lermond’s tragic demise?"

lermond.3.d:0 "With the victory of Erwin ‘Harry’ Ault and the Industrialist faction, New England is expected to take a significant departure from core Lermondite principles. New England shall progress towards ‘Eco-Syndicalism’ - a system in which we shall pursue rapid industrialization measures in the urban sprawls of New England while still leaving the vast swathes of our pristine wilderness protected and intact. We shall take measures to combat pollution and environmental damage without compromising the industrial power we can achieve here in this rich corner of America. Loosely tied to Lermond’s wishes, we shall still bring proletarian paradise to our people instead of delusions of utopian paradise."
lermond.3.a:0 "All forward for green industrialization!"

lermond.4.t:0 "The Oaken Core Holds Firm"
lermond.4.d:0 "Surprising no one, the Lermondite Oaken Core has won out in the internal elections, with Pilsbry, Lovell, and Commoner banding together in a coalition in order to stave off the radicals. Now, together and united in their loyalty to Lermondite thought, these titans of Eco-Socialism shall guide New England towards true Bellamy-inspired utopia. Although only one can lead them, and though their dedication to strict Lermondite thought varies, this broad front is as strong and mighty as an old Oak, ready to stand stalwart eternally in order defend New England and to bring utopian egalitarianism and agrarian perfection to our people."
lermond.4.a:0 "Mighty as the Oak, we stand strong against factionalism and revisionist tendencies."

lermond.5.t:0 "The New Labor Movement"
lermond.5.d:0 "Based upon his Wage Worker platform, President Ault has now moved to enact his plan of a New Labor Movement to break from the delusions of Bellamyist utopianism. By departing from the core of Lermond’s influences gathered from Bellamy’s naive form of Socialism, we shall find newfound prosperity by embracing American forms of Syndicalism. An old ally of Foster from their time together in the WWP, we shall adopt many principles of Fosterite Syndicalism while adapting them to fit our decentralized nature and desire to separate the urban industrialized hubs from our idyllic natural preservers. A new central Trade Union Congress shall be established and attached as a new House in the Legislature, representing the rights and needs of the wage-working class. Furthermore, unions - especially industrial and crafts unions - shall be incentivized and endorsed openly by the government, but we shall refrain from restricting the rights of non-union members unlike our European counterparts. We will build an Eco-Syndicalist paradise as we fuse our industrial realities with our environmental concerns."

lermond.6.t:0 "Tea with Foster"
lermond.6.d:0 "Once political allies and fellow members of the first Wage Workers movement while working together in Washington, William Z. Foster and Harry Ault have had a turbulent history despite their past friendship - with Ault even being the brain behind Foster changing his middle intial to Z in order to differentiate himself from another activist with the same name as he while operating in the Washington area together in their younger firebrand years. After the Wage Workers movement fell apart and was cannibalized by other, stronger Socialist movements, Foster and Ault went their separate ways, occasionally crossing paths until the borders came down during the Second Civil War. As the war raged however, Ault and Foster would sparingly correspond through letters, though Foster usually chastised our leader for being far too moderate. \n\nIn an effort to build cordial relations once more, President Ault has invited Foster over for tea and brunch, and to Ault’s slight surprise, Foster has actually arrived. What started as a smooth and peaceful if stale meeting however soon turned hot as Foster and Ault got into a large debate, or more like screaming match, over whose form of Syndicalism was more beneficial to the working masses. It escalated further, with Foster calling Ault a revisionsity revolutionary traitor and filthy moderate while Ault called Foster a deceitful tyrant and a plague upon the environment. The meeting ended abruptly as curses and familial insults about certain persons’ mothers were exchanged, and with Ault throwing his tea in Foster’s face. It would seem that they would not be meeting again."

To commemorate his passing, statues and art of our beloved leader have been erected all across the nation, with his own Knox Arboretum and Knox Academy becoming national monuments and landmarks, while the Arboretum itself now serves as Lermond’s final and ever-verdant resting place. Furthermore, Lermond’s hometown of Warren, Maine has been renamed Lermondville in his honor. All across our utopian state, the people shall cheer and rejoice even without our fallen titan and hero, for we shall live forever in proletarian prosperity thanks to his sacrifice."

lermond.8.t:0 "Supporting the Colonies"
lermond.8.d:0 "The ‘colonies’ of New England and all the communes and collectives scattered around the nation already do more than enough to meet the needs of the state and our people. As such, we should move only to support and expand the ones that we have now instead of wasting funds in frivolous pursuits that fly in the face of Lermond’s original vision. This shall stabilize our economy in these turbulent times and bring greater long-term economic benefits to the state."
lermond.8.a:0 "Tighten our belts now in order to prosper later."

lermond.9.t:0 "The Young Jeffersonians Ride In"
lermond.9.d:0 "Sidestepping the established Lermondite Oaken Core and the radical revisionist Ault, Paul Goodman and his Young Jeffersonians have risen to lead the Party and New England. An advocate of Ecological Anarchism, Goodman seeks to accelerate Lermondite thought to what he believes is it's inevitable conclusion. Seeing modern pollutive industrialization as a cancer that needs to be cured, Goodman seeks to replace this harmful apparatus with an anarchist system built around frontier democracy and cooperating communes that spread our industry out and limit it to only what is necessary to provide a comfortable well-being for our people so as to not further damage the environment."
lermond.9.a:0 "Our liberty depends on the sanctity of the environment, and that cannot be limited without being lost."

lermond.10.t:0 "Keeping Lermondist Economics"
lermond.10.d:0 "Keeping in line with Lermondite economic doctrines, [root.getleader] has decided to codify Lermond’s theory and ideology into one cohesive and coherent document. This new document shall serve as the framework and foundation of our economy going forward, and shall be based around the Grange and Bellamy-inspired teachings of our fallen leader. Our worker colonies, communes, collectives, and adherence to utopian Eco-Socialism shall never waver or deviate, for these central pillars are what keeps our state stable and prosperous. Even though Lermond is gone, that does not mean that his legacy and teachings end here!"
lermond.10.a:0 "Give us your poor, and we shall build utopia."

lermond.11.t:0 "Commoner's Approach"
lermond.11.d:0 "Rising to the top of the coalition, surprising many due to his young age and seeming inexperience, Barry Commoner seeks to guide New England towards progressive and moderate Left-Libertarianism based squarely in Lermondite Eco-Socialist thought. Trying to bring more people into our movement and seeking to reduce how much our Socialist state alienates much of the masses, Commoner and his ‘Commoner’s Approach’ shall sweep the masses of the everyday common man into our party, shrinking the apparatus and bureaucracy of the state, rolling back stricter and more authoritative laws, and overall bringing our utopian populism to all with greater cohesion and less obstacles than ever before."
lermond.11.a:0 "Full steam ahead with the Commoner’s Approach!"

lermond.12.t:0 "Pilsbry at the Helm"
lermond.12.d:0 "Lifelong friends, colleagues, and scientific associates, Henry Augustus Pilsbry was perhaps Lermond’s greatest ally in the harsh political world of New England. Fellow malacologists, naturalists, and biologists, the two worked with each other on numerous experiments, and co-chaired both the Knox Academy and the Malacological Union. The most devoted of the Lermondite loyalists and least likely to deviate from Orthodox Lermondite Thought, Pilsbry shall instead focus the nation’s attention on something greater. Working with other ecologically-minded nations and movements around the globe, Pilsbry shall work towards the creation of the People’s Biosphere - an international alliance of ‘Green’ states. This new alliance shall be the crowning glory and achievement of the Lermondite movement, and we shall work diligently to preserve the world’s ecosystems while making our fallen founding father proud."
lermond.12.a:0 "The Oak stands strong and dedicated to Lermond over all."

lermond.13.t:0 "Lovells Colony of Hives"
lermond.13.d:0 "With his own father being in the Knox Academy with Lermond, Harvey Bulfinch Lovell has been around Lermondite thought for most of his life. Following in his father’s footsteps by diving into the behavioral and biological study of bees as well as Lermondite and Bellamyite principles, Lovell is the most unorthodox of the Lermondite loyalists. He has begun to implement his idea of a network of ‘hives’ that will become the basis of New England society. These ‘hives’ are practically just collectives and communes, each dedicated to a single product, task, industry, or service. Furthermore, each is run by a dedicated Hive King or Queen Bee that serves as the trained and experienced expert that leads the rest of their ‘drones’ in their chosen task. These hives will cooperate in a distributist network, and shall function as the new vehicle of industry, goods, and services. With these bee-based principles being put in place, Lovell will transform New England into a buzzing network of prosperity, efficiency, and utopian egalitarianism."
lermond.13.a:0 "We shall live as the bees do, and be all the better for it."

lermond.14.t:0 "Funding the Pioneers"
lermond.14.d:0 "In order to better prepare the next generation for our way of life and in order to further spread how many partake in our Youth Pioneers and our various collectivist programs, we shall further fund these varied programs set up by Lermond and incentivize new people to join. We shall not force any of our population to live within our new system, but we can persuade people to come to our side of things if we show them just how beneficial and prosperous it can truly be. We will win over the old and the new, one new collective or youth trip at a time."
lermond.14.a:0 "Building utopia was never going to be quick or easy."

lermond.15.t:0 "Industrial Society and its Plight"
lermond.15.d:0 "Paul Goodman has seen the writing on the wall, and knows that our current path - the current path of all humanity - will lead to our downfall. Though he cannot stop the world, he can save our slice of eden here. Revolting against industrial modernity, Paul Goodman has begun a push to decentralize our industry, spreading it across our nation and keeping it to only necessary levels in order to stave off environmental collapse. Furthermore, fossil fuels have begun to be phased out slowly in favor of utilizing the hydroelectric potential of Niagara Falls and the Hudson River, though the engineering behind such feats shall be done carefully to have as little of an environmental impact as possible. Goodman shall build a Ecological Anarchist utopia in line with Lermond’s ultimate dream, and build a verdant, decentralized, collectivized paradise amid the verdant greenery."

lermond.16.d:0 "Going in line with Goodman’s Yeomen policies, a lot of equipment, products, goods, and foodstuffs in our nation are now being made by local craftsmen, farmers, artisans, and other skilled laborers. Though production output has slowed, we have had far less of an impact on the environment while also moderating our people and teaching them patience - virtues lost in the modern age. Along with these changes, frontier democracy has also taken root, following the lead of our ancestors that laid the noble foundations of this great land. All shall have a voice, and local government provides all as a direct instrument of the decentralized masses, finally freeing the proletariat and the planet of the vices of modernism."

During his late high-school years, Groves started to enroll in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea. He would be assigned several times, becoming commander of Company D of the 1st Engineer Battalion, helping during the New England flood of 1927, being sent to Nicaragua in 1929 to conduct surveys for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, and he being assigned to look over Nicaragua's water supply after the 1931 earthquake. It was upon his return to a shattered United States that he gained his last promotions, rising to the rank of field marshal in New England, mainly due to the sheer lack of capable staff in the region.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- A brilliant engineer, he has been following closely the development of Nuclear Fission technology keeping regular contact with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner."

As the internal situation deteriorated, Clark was on leave in New York, and when hostilities broke out, he moved to New England looking for safety. With the lack of capable staff, Clark has been hastily promoted to Brigadier General, where he'll now have to oversee the creation of a new army.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While his loyalty is unquestioned, his friendship with now enemy Generals have raised concerns that General Clark will be unable to do his duty when the time comes to face them openly on the battlefield."

When the civil war broke out, Ryan decided to remain in his home state of Massachusetts, hoping to aid the New England government's claim to legitimacy amidst the chaos. In his studies of European warfare, Ryan is heavily influenced by the concepts of vertical envelopment and believes that New England should invest in airborne training. With permission of the high command, Ryan began organising and searching for volunteers to join New England's first airborne forces."
NEE_ERNEST_HARMON_ARMY_DESC:0 "Tragically orphaned at the age of ten, Ernest Nason Harmon was raised by his relatives in Newbury, Vermont, and would spend much of his early life in the village of West Newbury. He attended Norwich University for a year before receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1913. Prominent in school activities such as horse riding, hockey, football, and boxing - Harmon's time at West Point also drew him close to fellow graduate Mark W. Clark. In 1921, he was assigned to West Point as an instructor in mechanical drawing, and his additional duties included coaching for the football team and West Point's first lacrosse team. He would serve in the 6th Cavalry Regiment in Georgia and four years as a Professor of Military Science and Commandant of Cadets at Norwich.

An officer aboard the battleship USS Massachusetts during a blockade of Santiago de Cuba, Hart was commended for his courage commanding a steam cutter in Cabanas bay searching for landing sites. Despite extensive fire from shore batteries, Hart was successful in his mission and took no losses despite repeated hits. His proficient ship handling would get him placed in the USS Vixen, where he would make lifelong friends with the then Lt. Alexander Sharp Jr and Ensign Arthur MacArthur III (the late elder brother of Douglas MacArthur).\n\nAfter a stint about a sloop, Hart would teach ordinance and gunnery at Annapolis. His connections at the institute included marrying the daughter of the then Superintendent Rear Admiral Brown.

The start of the civil war has seen Hart join the New England government along with other members of the Atlantic fleet in hopes of preserving democracy.

newengland.3016.d:0 "We have secured the old lands of the fallen United States, once again uniting the American people under one government as we don the mantle of the grand ol’ Union. However, we could not have achieved this herculean task alone, for the Entente have stood behind us and backed our cause as we fought tooth and nail to save America and her people. However, now united and at peace once more, many have begun to question our position in the Entente, playing second fiddle to failed empires and exiled jingoists. Though their plight is not too dissimilar from the hole we just dug ourselves out of, that has not stopped the call from many to leave the Entente behind in order to pursue our own goals. To just turn our backs on these stalwart allies would leave us alone and without aid, but at least we would not be beholden to the will of foreigners. Should we stick with these loyal allies, or should America blaze its own path forwards once again?"

### Ideas ###

CAN_reactionary_resistance:0 "Reactionary Resistance"
CAN_reactionary_resistance_desc:0 "Supporters of the crooked Royalist order continue to menace our new Socialist government at every step. They must be dispatched with haste and with extreme prejudice, lest they threaten the Socialist paradise we have laboured so hard to build and topple the revolution we have fought so hard to achieve."

CAN_ruined_nation:0 "A Ruined Nation"
CAN_ruined_nation_desc:0 "The war for Canadian Liberation has resulted in nothing short of the complete destruction of the 'normal' Canadian way of life. As the first major war fought in Canadian borders in more than 100 years, the campaign to liberate Canada from the Reactionaries has caused untold devastation and the decimation of much of our nation's infrastructure."

CAN_mounties_soc_rebuild:0 "The Mounties"
CAN_mounties_soc_rebuild_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Canadian Mounted Police, or 'Mounties', have been rebuilt from the ground up, ridding them of any trace of Royalist tint. The changes to the RCMP will ensure that it is a police force designed to protect and serve the Canadian populace instead of menacing them. No longer shall the Mounties serve as the King's secret police."
CAN_mounties_soc_rebrand:0 "The Mounties"
CAN_mounties_soc_rebrand_desc:0 "Once the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the new 'Revolutionary Canadian Mounted Police' serve much the same purpose as their royalist predecessors. While some Socialists have protested the full restoration of the RCMP, calling them the same 'Secret Police' that terrorized Canadians before, the CCS trusts that Canada will be safer with the Mounties still around."
CAN_mounties_soc_secretpolice:0 "Empowered RCMP"
CAN_mounties_soc_secretpolice_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Canadian Mounted Police, or 'Mounties', have been given extended powers to survey and detain suspected dissidents across the country. The new authority of the RCMP has caused many to accuse them of becoming a sort of 'secret police'. While these accusations are clearly nonsense, there is no doubting their efficiency in preventing unrest and dissent in our country."

CAN_red_quebec_issue:0 "Quebec Issue"
CAN_red_quebec_issue_desc:0 "While tensions with Canada's large French-Canadian population has eased ever since the overthrow of the Monarchy, tensions between the predominantly Anglophone population of Canada and Quebec still remain. Quebec, formerly ruled under the iron fist of 'Le Chef' Maurice Duplessis, has instilled within the populace a certain rabid hatred for Syndicalism, making governing matters in the Province difficult."
CAN_status_quebec:0 "The New Status of Quebec"
CAN_status_quebec_desc:0 "As our soliers depart from the streets of Montreal and Quebec City, the vast Province of Quebec is forced to reckon with a new reality: the reality that they are finally free from opression. While the mad supporters of 'Le Chef' continue to oppose the new status quo at every step, and while the transition from Province to Nation weighs heavily on the Québecois government, with time, all will be sorted out."

### Focuses ###

CAN_Canada_Liberated:0 "Canada Liberated!"
CAN_Canada_Liberated_desc:0 "At long last the forces of Exile and Reaction have been banished from our fair shore. Free from the Mad King's tyranny, Canada can finally flourish under a Government by Canadians - for Canadians. Just like in 1925, the King's subjects have thrown off their chains, banishing the forces of reaction to foreign shores. One can only wonder how long it will be until their subjects revolt against them as well."
CAN_Congress_of_Canadian_Socialists:0 "Hold the Congress of Canadian Socialists"
CAN_Congress_of_Canadian_Socialists_desc:0 "Now that the many Socialist groups of Canada are no longer confined to the shadows, a congress of Socialist groups in Canada has been organized to elect a new Government. While the incumbent [Root.GetRulingParty] Bloc has a strong lead, any number of groups could find themselves in the lead by the Congress' end."

CAN_Burn_the_Royal_Portraits:0 "Burn the Royal Portraits!"
CAN_Burn_the_Royal_Portraits_desc:0 "The time has come to banish the vestiges of Monarchism from Canada. The remnants of Royalist Tyranny shall be burned in the streets - while the King's insignia shall be broken off public buildings with crowbars. A Republican Tide has washed over Canada, and when it has receded not a single symbol of the King's reign shall remain. "
CAN_Fate_of_the_RCMP:0 "Fate of the RCMP"
CAN_Fate_of_the_RCMP_desc:0 "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, or the 'Mounties' as they were better known, were at one point the King's most rabid attack dogs against the forces of Socialist Liberation. With the Royalists banished, the question of the Mounties has once more come up. Shall we do away with this symbol of the Old Order, or shall we restore the RCMP on our terms?"
CAN_Smash_the_Establishment:0 "Shatter the Establishment"
CAN_Smash_the_Establishment_desc:0 "The remains of Canada's Old Order still lurks in the shadows, plotting the destruction of the Socialist Paradise we've built. To keep the forces of Reaction from returning once more, drastic action must be taken."
CAN_Eradicate_the_Imperialists:0 "Eradicate the Imperialists"
CAN_Eradicate_the_Imperialists_desc:0 "Despite all their failures, supporters of Arcand's ill-fated 'Imperial Unity Party' still roam the countryside. Concentrated in Northern Ontario, these terrorists have led an underground resistance against our young Socialist Government, and have been launching sporadic attacks on Supply Depots and Military Bases ever since they popped up. Dubbed 'Rotha's Raiders' due to the leadership of one Rotha Lintorn-Orman, these Reactionaries pose a mortal threat to the Socialist Order. They must be eliminated."
CAN_Socialist_Constitution:0 "A Canadian Constitution"
CAN_Socialist_Constitution_desc:0 "Through our revolution we have established Canada firmly as an independent nation - not as a mere extension of the King's reign. With that in mind, the time has come to write up a series of governing documents which will in ink and pen stroke firmly establish Canada's nationhood. No longer shall we be mere Britons and subjects of foreign Kings, we shall be Canadians, in name and in spirit."
CAN_Great_Red_North:0 "The Great Red North"
CAN_Great_Red_North_desc:0 "Under the King's Iron Fist Canada was written off as nothing more than a hotbed of Reactionary Tyrants and backwards thinking. Thankfully, in the 20 years since the Canadian people have risen up against our Imperial masters, shattered our chains and sent the Royals running. A crimson tsunami has washed over the North, establishing Canada as a shining beacon of Socialism in the New World."

CAN_Rebuild_Canada:0 "Rebuild Canada"
CAN_Rebuild_Canada_desc:0 "Our war against the Royalists left a great many dead and a great deal of our great nation with grievous damage. The first step towards building a Socialist Paradise in Canada rebuilding the great nation we all call home."
CAN_Distribute_Exile_Wealth:0 "Distribute Exile Wealth"
CAN_Distribute_Exile_Wealth_desc:0 "The concentration of Wealth and Industry around the affluent British Exile community has finally come to an end. With it, the time has come to return these ill-gotten gains to the people of Canada. [CANGetExilePolicy]" 
CAN_intern_exiles:0 "The resourceful and well-connected Exiles have fled Canada's shores, while those who have either chosen to remain or have been captured by Revolutionary Guards now pay their debts to society. Ironically, the Exiles now toil in camps that bear a strong resemblance to the 'Unemployment Camps' used to herd destitute Canadians during the Great Depression."
CAN_expel_exiles:0 "Now that the remaining Exiles have fled, Canadian Citizens can finally breathe free without languishing under the tyranny of wandering Aristocrats. While our nation is reeling from the loss of manpower, it is worth it to be truly free from our British 'Guests'."
CAN_expel_wealthy_exiles:0 "Now that the wealthiest Exiles have fled, Canadian Citizens and the can finally breathe free without languishing under the tyranny of wandering Aristocrats. Additionally, the truly displaced Exiles can reap the benefits of a truly free society."
CAN_seize_exile_wealth:0 "The Exiles, despite inflicting immeasurable damage to Canada, are still humans, and must be treated accordingly. While their wealth has been seized by the state, these Émigrées have been allowed to continue living their lives in Canada. Free from the burdens of Kings and Reclamation, they are no longer 'Exiles' - rather they are Canadian Citizens just like the rest."
CAN_exile_default:0 "Now that the Exiles have been stripped of their political influence, it is up to the Government to decide the final fate of Canada's Exile community"
CAN_Agricultural_Revolution:0 "Canada's Agricultural Revolution"
CAN_Agricultural_Revolution_desc:0 "The heartland of Canada's newfound Revolution was in the Prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Far from the intellectual centers of Syndicalist thought in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, these rural areas provide a vital backbone for Canada's socialist transformation. Piggybacking on the work done by the CCF, [ROOT.GetLeader] and the [GetRulingParty] shall forge a true Agrarian Arcadia in the nation we call home."
CAN_New_Economy:0 "A New, Red Economy"
CAN_New_Economy_desc:0 "[CANGetEconomicPolicy]"
CAN_vanguardist_economy_desc:0 "Yielding to the vision of the CPC/MEL/CUM bloc, Canada's economy will be reorganized on radical lines. The creation of a Command Economy will allow the Government to exert much-needed control over the production and allocation of essential goods. This path forward will ensure that the keys to Canada's economy will be kept out of the hands of Capitalists and Social-Reactionaries."
CAN_unionized_economy_desc:0 "Following the line of Canada's many Syndicalist groups, Canada's economy will be reorganized under Trade Union Guidance. The days of workers toiling in squalor and working for unfair pay is over, as all working Canadians will now fall under the umbrella of a Trade Union. Workplaces that refuse Collective Bargaining agreements or attempt to gatekeep Workers from Union Representation will be shut down or placed under new management."
CAN_collective_economy_desc:0 "Under the influence of the Socialist SPC/SDP/CPC bloc, the CCS has started the creation of a Publicly Owned Economy. In this system, large assets and enterprises will be owned and operated by the Masses themselves. This program of society-wide ownership will ensure that Canada's industry and natural resources will work for the people, not against them."
CAN_publicly_owned_economy_desc:0 "Following the CCF's example, the CCS has agreed on a program of Publicly-Owned economics. Private enterprises shall still be allowed to exist under the Government's watch, while larger industries and natural resources shall fall under the government's jurisdiction. As well, essential utilities, such as Electrical, Hyrdo and Transportation infrastructure shall be kept out of the hands of Private Business."
CAN_eco_default:0 "With Canada's Socialist transformation complete, the time has come for the CCS to decide on a new course for our Nation's economy. Each faction of the CCS has their own unique approach, but only time will tell which one will get the chance to implement their vision." 
CAN_Socialist_CBC:0 "Trans-Canada Broadcasting System"
CAN_Socialist_CBC_desc:0 "Now that we have taken over the former Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, we can begin the establishment of a Canada-wide broadcasting system, one fully under the control of our new Socialist government. This will help heal our wounds, bring together a divided nation, and limit the influence of potentially subversive reactionary broadcasts."

CAN_Triumph_of_the_FPU:0 "Victory of the FPU"
CAN_Triumph_of_the_FPU_desc:0 "In an incredible upset, the Newfoundland centric Fishermen's Protective Union has claimed victory in the first session of the CCS. This East-Coast Union's claim to fame has propelled them to victory on the national level, allowing them to implement their Maritime-centric policies across both Canada and Newfoundland."
CAN_Expand_to_the_Pacific:0 "Pacific Expansion"
CAN_Expand_to_the_Pacific_desc:0 "A mari usque ad mare - From Sea to Sea. Canada as a nation now extends from St. Johns to Vancouver, and contains coastlines on both the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. With these vast seas come countless Fishermen struggling to make a living. With the FPU in power, these Fishermen can be represented by a government which truly understands their plight."
CAN_Alliance_With_Sector_Unions:0 "Trade Union Alliances"
CAN_Alliance_With_Sector_Unions_desc:0 "The FPU, while mighty, only represents a very small sector of the Canadian workforce. To keep their hold on power, the FPU has moved to allign various Trade Unions across Canada. From the Trades and Labour Congress, to the French-Canadian Confédération des Syndicats Nationaux, to other profession-specific Guilds such as the United Auto Workers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the International Longshoremen's Association."
CAN_Venerate_Coaker:0 "Veneration of William Coaker"
CAN_Venerate_Coaker_desc:0 "At first the figures recognized as Canada's founders were bloodthirsty Imperialists such as John A. MacDonald. Today, the founder of Modern Canada is undeniably personified in Sir William Coaker: founder of the FPU and the man who led Canada to victory against the forces of reaction. The FPU shall give credit to their founder, and elevate Coaker to his rightful place among Canada's Fathers of Confederation."

CAN_Canadian_Union_of_Maximists:0 "The Canadian Union of Maximists"
CAN_Canadian_Union_of_Maximists_desc:0 "Perhaps the only major organization in Canada which advocates for Charter Totalism, the Canadian Union of Maximists or CUM has claimed victory in the first session of the CCS. Despite their veneration of Mosley and advocating for a Charterist approach, the CUM is remarkably moderate in comparison to their Totalist counterparts across the world."
CAN_Studying_Mosleys_Axioms:0 "Following Mosley's Axioms"
CAN_Studying_Mosleys_Axioms_desc:0 "Oswald Mosley is perhaps the most influential person in the creation of the Totalist ideology. Drawing heavily from Mosley, the CUM has moved to enshrine Maximist policy into Canadian Law, and invite Mosley himself to oversee the process. While Mosley is undeniably suspicious of our group's 'Moderate' stances, Mosley is not one to snub an attempt to spread his ideology."
CAN_Alliance_With_Aboriginal_Groups:0 "Alliance with Aboriginal Groups"
CAN_Alliance_With_Aboriginal_Groups_desc:0 "Canada's many Native peoples have long been abused at the hands of the Royal Government, and have disgustingly been looked over by even mainline Socialist groups. Crate has long been a fighter for Native rights, famously securing equal pay for Native Indian workers in the mines while he was a Union Organizer. Now in power, Chairman Crate has sought to make amends, and has officially moved to bar discriminatory action by our government towards our nation's Native Peoples."
CAN_Canadas_Moderate_Maximists_Miracle:0 "Canada's Moderate Maximist Miracle"
CAN_Canadas_Moderate_Maximists_Miracle_desc:0 "'Totalist' is perhaps the dirtiest word in modern politics. The vile label hurled at even the most moderate of Socialists, often by other Socialists themselves. However in Canada the word 'Totalist' conjures a much different meaning. Far removed from the images of repression and black-booted thugs dragging honest people into the night, Canada's Maximist Revolution has been executed with the trademark Canadian friendliness. While there is always discontent lurking in the shadows, Canada today has prospered under the guidance and vigilance of Chairman Chuck Crate, who has ensured that the words of the Totalist Charter will contribute to a freer and more equal Canada."

CAN_Marxian_Education_League:0 "Victory of the Lovestoneites"
CAN_Marxian_Education_League_desc:0 "Followers of American Socialist Jay Lovestone have come up on top in the first congress of the CCS. Influenced by his strange 'Market-Socialist' and Internationalist ideals, supporters of the 'Marxian Educational League' seek to radically reshape Canada's political and cultural climate. Whether their grandiose plans will bear fruit is anybody's guess."
CAN_Lovestoneism:0 "Following in Lovestone's Footsteps"
CAN_Lovestoneism_desc:0 "As the most prolific inspiration for Moriarty's movement, Jay Lovestone's expertise and input will do wonders in reshaping Canada from a frosty refuge of Reaction to a true Northern Worker's paradise. Even if more 'Patriotic' socialists draw links between Lovestone's influence and the MEL's internationalist messaging as some sort of sinister plot to erase Canada, Moriarty is confident that Lovestone's involvement is the best course of action for Canada."
CAN_Nationalist_Market_Socialism:0 "Canadian National Market Socialism"
CAN_Nationalist_Market_Socialism_desc:0 "The influence of Nikolay Bukharin's policies has permeated Socialist circles across the world. While traditionally limited to more moderate circles, a focus on National Market Socialism is a unique facet of Jay Lovestone's Right-Communist ideology. Now that Lovestone's followers are firmly in power, they have begun implementing these controlled Free Market and NeP-influenced policies across Canada."
CAN_Eternal_Revolution:0 "Canada's Eternal Revolution"
CAN_Eternal_Revolution_desc:0 "Canada's Revolutionary Transformation is only just beginning. While the new Red Order may be young, we can not be deluded into letting down our guard. Our leadership has proclaimed that the Revolution cannot end where it stands or stagnation is inevitable, and that without constant vigilance our nascent Socialist Order may be struck down in its prime. Every true Revolutionary must do their duty to ensure that the Royalist taint is never more allowed to pollute our fair land."

CAN_Communist_Party_of_Canada:0 "The Communist Party of Canada"
CAN_Communist_Party_of_Canada_desc:0 "Despite being fragmented between various different factions, the Communist Party of Canada has claimed victory in the first Congress of Canadian Socialists. Taking inspiration from Earl Browder and other 'Patriotic' Communists, the CPC of Tim Buck seeks to implement Communism in a way which harmonizes with the Canadian way of life."
CAN_Browderian_Inspiration:0 "Browderist Inspiration"
CAN_Browderian_Inspiration_desc:0 "Down in the States', Earl Russell Browder has crafted a unique form of Socialism not at odds with everyday American life. As a nation which bares many cultural and historical similarities with the United States, Earl Browder's unique form of Patriotic Socialism is one that can be right at home here in the Great White North. Of course, just because we follow a form of Socialism which bears similarities to that of Earl Browder does not mean we are subjects of the Americans - Red American or not. Chairman Buck shall endure to keep Canada safe from dangerous American influence, and unquestionably independent, and thus ending the erosion of Canadian sovereignty by American culture and media."
CAN_Create_the_CSIS:0 "Create the CSIS"
CAN_Create_the_CSIS_desc:0 "While we have reconstituted the RCMP as a force dedicated to the Canadian Revolution, the efforts of our brave 'Mounties' still aren't enough to weed out the reactionary filth that continues to plague Canadian Society. In order to defeat the class enemies of the revolution, we have laid the groundwork for a Canadian Socialist Intelligence Service, managed directly by the ruling committee. A clandestine security organization that will always have an iron fist or a dagger in the back ready for counter-revolutionaries."
CAN_Maple_Syrup_Communism:0 "Maple Syrup Communism"
CAN_Maple_Syrup_Communism_desc:0 "Just as Earl Browder has trademarked his own brand of 'Apple Pie Communism', up north Chairman Tim Buck has become known for his 'Maple Syrup Communism', a patriotic brand of Socialism defined by their home countries own trademark favorite foodstuff. Indeed, under the guidance of Chairman Buck we will teach Canadians that communism is not only compatible with the great Canadian way of life, but indeed an expression of it, and that Patriotism and Internationalism are not incompatible, but are in fact integrally related."

CAN_Workers_Unity_League:0 "[CANGetSyndParty]"
CAN_Workers_Unity_League_desc:0 "[CANGetSyndPartyDesc]"
CAN_Workers_Unity_League_Victory:0 "The Workers’ Unity League"
CAN_Workers_Unity_League_Victory_desc:0 "The Workers' Unity League, a militant industrial union labour organization with close ties to the Communist Party of Canada, has claimed victory in the first Congress of the CCS. The WUL, unlike other Syndicalist and Trade Unionist groups, is notable for their policies of Entryism and their admission of unemployed individuals."
CAN_Synd_Commie_Victory:0 "The Communist Compromise"
CAN_Synd_Commie_Victory_desc:0 "Alas, none of the disparate factions within the CCS have been able to claim the mantle of victory during the Congress' conclusion. Without a clear mandate, the various factions of the Communist Party of Canada have united in an attempt to secure victory. This has led to the Workers' Unity League-aligned Communist Candidate, [ROOT.GetLeader], to claim victory."
CAN_Communist_Alliance:0 "Our Alliance with the [CANGetSyndPartyPartner]"
CAN_Communist_Alliance_desc:0 "Our victory in the CCS was not secured alone, as the support of the [CAN_Communist_Alliance] proved vital to our ability to govern and exercise our party's will. Seeking to repay the favour, the [CAN.GetRulingParty] will formalize their alliance with the [CANGetSyndPartyPartner], a move which will greatly help our government's ability to assert its authority. "
CAN_Legacy_of_the_Trek:0 "Legacy of the Ottawa Trek"
CAN_Legacy_of_the_Trek_desc:0 "One of the key factors which brought down the Meighen government in 1935 was the public's discontent with policies towards the Great Depression. This public discontent was best manifested in the 'On to Ottawa Trek', a mass protest organized by the Workers' Unity League and the Communist Party of Canada. While this protest was met with either apathy or outright hostility, its legacy has helped cement the legacy of the [CAN.GetRulingParty] both with the Canadian population and the left-wing political sphere."
CAN_Workers_Popular_Front:0 "Canada's United Front"
CAN_Workers_Popular_Front_desc:0 "While the King's goons have been expelled from Canada with extreme prejudice, there still remains the omnipresent threat of Counter-Revolution and Reaction waiting around every corner. To keep our movement united, the [CAN.GetRulingParty] has sought to create a 'Popular Front' of left-wing and socialist movements. While most of these movements are not shy about their distaste for one another, [ROOT.GetLeader] has made it clear that they will not let Leftist bickering lead to the end of our glorious revolution."

CAN_One_Big_Union:0 "OBU Resurgence"
CAN_One_Big_Union_desc:0 "Crawling back from near obscurity wrought at the hands of the former Royalist government’s harsh anti-syndicalist stances, the One Big Union has finally reclaimed its rightful place as Canada’s premier socialist organization. Inspired by and aligned with the Industrial Workers of the World and Browder’s CPA in America, and by the main powers within the Third Internationale - particularly the TUC of the Union of Britain, the OBU shall now serve as the World Revolution’s local heralds here in the True North as they work to bring about a unionist revolution across all Canada."

We shall always remember this great act for being the fiery crimson catalyst that emboldened proletarian fervor across Canada, igniting the revolutionary embers laying dormant inside each and every workingman’s heart across this True North once glacially imprisoned in reactionary delusions.

Fueled by our urban industrial heartlands around the Great Lakes and other major metropolitan areas on the coasts, a strong spine with sinew and bone of solid steel has begun to be built across our heartlands, linked by an expanding national highway system populated with domestically created automobiles and dotted with white picket fence-filled suburbs and luxurious cooperative housing complexes for the proletarian masses to live in when not working at any of their trades or careers, all sponsored and provided by the OBU’s ever-extending reach.

By creating a small media wing to garner attention and support with the newspaper and other new avenues like adding radio shows and even television spots to the Clarion’s programme, perhaps we can get more and more people to join the party while the bulk of the party continues work on grabbing mass attention and support by passing legislation, ensuring good governance, and by doing any other beneficial acts now that matters of state are in our hands."

The transformation, as rapidly as possible, of capitalist property in the means of wealth production (natural resources, factories, mills, railroads, etc.) into the collective property of the working class. \n2. The organization and management of industry by the working class. \n3.

Militant revolution is no longer required to bring about Kingsley’s social revolution, so we shall shift to using more peaceful methods of revolutionary action, such as wealth distribution, the encouragement of political organization, Marxist-influenced education, effective legislation that eases the proletarian plight, and when all else fails, propaganda. Though the key ideas of Impossibilism - or the uncompromising Marxist tendency to pursue total revolution without falling prey to petty ideas such as Capitalist reformism through social democracy or seeking compromise with Capitalist systems and other such cowardly tactics, shall remain unchanged, we shall shift course slightly to match the current electoral reality. No longer do we have a Capitalist society or reactionary machine to rage against, so we shall instead work within this new system while maintaining our uncompromising desire to create a fully Marxist society - we shall just do so through the ballot box of a Socialist republic instead, and overtime we shall have the unmatched dominance we require to fully envision Marx’s dream."

Thanks to this stance of evolutionary socialism and to similar ideas pushed by old Marxist thinkers like Eduard Bernstein, we shall continue to evolve our platform as needed to fit the needs and desires of our constituents, ensuring that the needs, wants, and desires of the masses is not only heard, but heeded as well, creating a socialist democracy where all are truly involved and invested in, and where even a single voice matters."

While we won’t be going around proselytizing the faith or building up churches everywhere as some of our detractors fear, with many of our own members not even being practicing Christians themselves, we shall use the humanist side of Christian doctrine to influence how we treat our fellow man in order to build a more moral, peaceful, and brotherly society in God’s benevolent image."

canada_soc.1.d:0 "After decades of subversion by the Royalists, Canada's many disparate Socialist groups are now free to assemble in the open, no longer burdened by the constant harassment by the RCMP. Now these groups gather in Ottawa to decide the course the newly Socialist nation of Canada shall take, be it one of Totalism, Syndicalism or Radical Socialism.\n\n Controversially, the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation has also been allowed to participate in the Congress. The CCF, while gleefully participating in the King's sham democracy, was also Canada's main 'legitimate' Socialist movement before Canada's revolution.\n\n Almost a dozen groups are in the running, each of them presenting their own array of policies and proposals. As the Congress opens it is still anyone's guess who will come out on top... "

canada_soc.2.t:0 "Fate of the FPU"
canada_soc.2.d:0 "As the Congress of Canadian Socialists opens, one elephant in the room has been weighing heavily on the minds of every faction involved; that being the fate of the Fishermen's Protective Union. The FPU was the first Union in Canadian Territory which successfully managed to rise up against their Capitalist overlords, and while they have forever gone down in history as the Union which freed Canada, their hyperfixation on Atlantic-Canada and Newfoundland issues has been off putting to the wider Canadian Socialist scene, and has made them a stranger to Canada's Socialist Underground. This has manifested in calls by several factions of the CCS calling for the FPU to step down, and allow a more broadly Canadian Union to represent them on a national level. In any scenario, the FPU would remain an exceedingly powerful Union both in Newfoundland and in the rest of Canada. "

canada_soc.3.t:0 "Fate of the Tories"
canada_soc.3.d:0 "The first issue on the docket for the CCS is the fate of the Conservative Party of Canada. The CPC or 'Tories' as they are colloquially referred to were fervent sycophants for the despotic reign of the British Exiles. Now that the Royalists have been overthrown, the newly-Socialist Canadian Government is tasked with deciding the ultimate fate of the Tories. Hardliners have favoured both illegalizing the Conservative Party and throwing their primary members and organizers in jail. Others have supported simply illegalizing the Organization and any such organization which would spawn in its place. Moderates have favoured an approach which would allow a thoroughly Republican version of the Conservatives to exist in some capacity. "

canada_soc.4.d:0 "The next issue on the docket for the CCS is the fate of the Liberal Party of Canada. The Liberals, while still guilty for playing ball with the Royalist despots, were far less open to the insane demands of the Exiles than their Tory counterparts. While some have disputed the extent of their collaboration, it can not be denied that the Liberal Party was the main 'Legal' front to challenge Exile dominance within the Canadian Political System. This fact, combined with some choice words from certain former Liberal Leaders paints a picture of a Party dedicated to fighting the King's tyranny within the bounds of the legitimate establishment, and that they only played ball with the British due to fear of retribution. Others have been less than impressed with the Liberal's Defense. Hardliners have proposed both illegalizing the Liberal Party and throwing their primary members and organizers in jail. Others have supported simply illegalizing the Organization and any such organization which would spawn in its place. Moderates have taken the Liberal's defense to heart, and have supported allowing the Liberal Party to continue existing in some capacity. "

canada_soc.5.d:0 "With Canada's main political issues settled, the CCS has moved on to the question of the Economy. Notably what form it shall take in the new Canada. The CCF has proposed a policy which would institute Public ownership of the Economy while allowing private businesses to still operate. The SPC/SDP/CPC bloc has put forward a similar policy which would favour Collective ownership. The Syndicalist bloc has unveiled a plan which would create a Trade Union Economy, while the CPC/MEL/CUM bloc has put forward their proposal for a fully nationalized Command Economy. Folded in with the Economic issue was the issue of Agriculture, each with a different proposal by the different parties. The CCF supports the founding of agrarian co-operatives, the SPC/SDP/CPC bloc supports the subsidization of Agriculture while the TLC/OBU/WUL/CPC bloc supports the creation of Agricultural unions across Canada. The CPC/MEL/CUM bloc has put forward their own unorthodox policy of forced Agricultural Collectivization, a policy which has received a lukewarm reaction from Canada's Agrarian heartlands.  "

canada_soc.6.t:0 "Issue of the Exiles"
canada_soc.6.d:0 "The final issue on the CCS's agenda is the matter of the millions of British Exiles who had come to settle in Canada after the British Revolution. While most of these Exiles were wealthy aristocrats trying to avoid reckoning for their crimes, a great deal of Britons who fled to Canada were simple folk merely trying to escape the Red Terror in Britain. Most of the factions in the CCS are ambivalent towards the lower-class Exiles who fled Britain simply out of fears of violence; despite this, much of the CPC/MEL/CUM bloc favour the internment of all Exiles regardless of class, stating that their decision to flee from the Union of Britain was proof enough of their reactionary views. While it is commonly agreed that the hoarded wealth of the Exiles brought across the Atlantic are to be seized, the matter of the Exiles themselves is far more contentious. The Syndicalists support expelling the Exile class altogether, while the SPC/SDP/CPC bloc only wishes to expel the most upper-class Exiles. The CCF favours an approach which would simply seize Exiles wealth and allow them to continue to inhabit Canada and work an honest dollar."

The CCF themselves have defended their cooperation with the Monarchy, stating that they only moderated out of necessity, and worked with the Canadian establishment as a way to help the workers of Canada in a broadly legal way. The CCF has also stated that they had planned to do away with the King entirely if they were ever granted the authority to do so.

This has been largely thanks to key American figures like Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who famously worked to organize anarchist communes across eastern Canada around Ontario and our own icy coasts during the 1920s with the help of local Leftists like Italian-Canadian anarchist Attilio Bortolotti and his utopian allies in Emma Goldman’s Libertarian Group of left libertarian anarchists and Georgists, the Québécois-born Knights of Labour member and anarcho-esperantist associate of the SPC Albert Saint-Martin, and the beloved insurrectionary hero Arthur Caron and his clique of various anarcho-syndicalists and individualists, along with the vibrant Yiddish anarchist scene in Toronto centered around the Holy Blossom congregation of Rabbi Maurice Eisendrath, as well as with the few remaining Canadian Trotskyites left attached to their dying movement. \n\nThis diverse group of varied individualists, synthesists, platformists, insurrectionists, Left libertarians, and even a few illegalists rarely work with each other if at all, but they are all committed to some vaguely unifying sense of anarchist socialism, though their definitions of what form this anarchism should take is wildly varied. In no real position to take power for themselves, being too disorganized to even have a large enough party stand at national elections, these various anarchist groups have instead glommed onto other movements, finding allies in other, more established and widely-popular parties like the TLC, the CCF, the SPC, the FPU, and more.

The SDP was originally founded by the right-wing of the Socialist Party of Canada, who opposed the rigid and doctrinal approach of the SPC. Despite quickly adopting an Evolutionary Socialist approach, the SDP was still targeted by authorities as a dangerous Communist movement, and was briefly banned by Prime Minister Borden's order-in cabinet. Their brief illegalization, combined with outlawing of the Party's newspaper contributed greatly to the SDP's downfall in the early 20's. However the party would experience a second wind after the founding of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. While many SDP members originally supported the Party's foundation, the Winnipeg Manifesto's spineless moderation to the forces of reaction led to a mass exodus of socialists from the party. The SDP, along with other underground movements such as the SPC and the CPC would labour under the oppression of the Mad King for years until the revolution finally arrived. With the SDP coming out on top during the first Congress of the CCS, the party has been revitalized, forging an alliance with the CCF and other Internationalist forces. Jacob Penner, our party leader and renowned Marxist, has mingled with the Communist movement in Canada. And while Penner has gravitated away from Communism SDP after the Bolsheviks defeat in Russia, the SDP still remains on good terms with CPC leadership; even allowing Communist candidates to run in elections under the SDP banner."

canada_soc.24.d:0 "William Arthur Pritchard is a name well known to many within the [ROOT.GetRulingParty]. A Marxist, a Labour Organizer, an editor, a journalist and a politician, Pritchard is a storied figure within Canadian Labour circles. First becoming a Socialist activist while working as a miner, Pritchard was a founding figure within many of Canada's Socialist movements; including both the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, the Socialist Party of Canada and the One Big Union. Pritchard soon became a central figure in the pre-war Canadian socialist movement, a status which would eventually land him behind bars on trumped-up charges. After several failed runs for federal politics, Pritchard became the Reeve (or Mayor) of the City of Burnaby, where he took a number of steps as reeve to ameliorate the plight of both the unemployed and homeowners who had lost their homes because they could not pay their taxes. Additionally, Pritchard made efforts to encourage the town's self-sufficiency, resolve labour conflicts and even repudiated Burnaby's municipal debt to protest Federal inaction during the Great Depression; an action which spurred the B.C. Provincial government to dissolve their Municipal Council. Despite his titanic status within the Socialist movement, there are some who have turned on Pritchard, declaring him nothing more than a revisionist due to his anti-Revolutionary stances and conflict with members of the Communist Party. While doctrinal conflicts may have soured Party opinion towards Pritchard, his status within our movement cannot be denied. When all said and done, [CAN.GetLeader] has decided that Pritchard is..."

canada_soc.25.t:0 "The Impossible Triumph"
canada_soc.25.d:0 "The Socialist Party of Canada, the sole force ultimately capable of overthrowing the capitalist system, has had a hard lot since the Weltkrieg. When our group was the biggest authentically Socialist movement in Canada, many of the now former members included the likes of militant trade unionists, social democrats, nascent Leninists or rising syndicalists. Yet, they all became deluded by the ideas which drove the working class away from true liberation, instead advocating for either bourgeois-extending conciliation, labourist reformism and gradualism; or the elitist and post-Blanquist Bolshevik vanguardism.\n\nThe only sure way through which the slave caste of Canada could wrestle the State power away from their masters was, and continues to be, our guiding ideology – Impossibilism. We reject the notion that the workers’ lot ought to be ameliorated now, as it is nothing more than postponing the ultimate death blow against the current order. That much was clear to Karl Marx himself, who wrote that: "However, the democratic petty bourgeois want better wages and security for the workers, and hope to achieve this by an extension of state employment and by welfare measures; in short, they hope to bribe the workers with a more or less disguised form of alms and to break their revolutionary strength by temporarily rendering their situation tolerable."\n\nIt is impossible to merely reform the system, and thus it must be overthrown by the proletariat which was previously uplifted in its class consciousness. Only through local spontaneous action of people flying the banner of the SPC can true Marxism be achieved. Such a stance has, however, led our opponents to label us as nothing more than Troskyite orphans clinging to the “Permanent” Revolution concept or even Centralist-Vanguardist bastards of Lenin. These bitter tongues from parties now withering in the rays of the new era know nothing of our true platform. While the education of labouring groups may be similar to the “permanent” idea, it does not stumble into the pitfall of wanton warmongering, nor does it exclude any possibility of independent action. The latter is inconceivable to the forlorn “Moscovites” that cannot comprehend a world where they are not chained by a “democratic” centralist executive committee.\n\nThe masses of Canada, having cast off their chains thanks to our efforts, may now see that the Socialist Party of Canada was always by their side. Through impossible, our long-awaited goal has become possible."

Now, as new snap elections are held to fill the seats left vacant by the purge and with the CCF finally free of the fence-sitters and backstabbing moderates that hampered our peaceful and democratic revolution, we shall shift to wholeheartedly support the original Regina Declaration - largely written by political theorist Frank Underhill and progressive poet Francis Reginald Scott alongside other members of the League for Social Reconstruction - instead, allowing us to focus on a fully Socialist doctrine supported by nationalized economics, social democratic trade unionism, an expansive welfare and healthcare system, agrarian reform and modernization, and the Social Gospel, among other points of interest supported by the surviving radical core of the CCF."

With both candidates, the incumbent Tom Moore and his opponent Percy Bengough, both being moderates that oppose radicalism and centralism, and both campaigning on largely the same things the TLC always has, pulling from our Platform of Principles with policies like free compulsory education, and eight-hour work day with a six-day work week down from seven, government inspection agencies to police industry standards, a minimum living wage, public ownership of telecommunications, water, lighting, and railway/transit infrastructure, use of union label, the advancement of women’s rights, and much more, the crux of this inner-party election has less to do with specific domestic policy, but more so on factional and foreign policy. \n\nMoore, originally a carpenter within the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, has long worked closely and comfortably with our American counterparts in the American Federation of Labor to the south, being an old friend of the late titan of the AFL Samuel Gompers as well, and is expected to continue to pursue close relations with the Yanks. On the other hand, Bengough - originally a machinist from London operating in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and, beginning in 1916, the International Association of Machinists - has long championed the idea of Canadians making their own unions for Canadians here in Canada, as opposed to always linking ourselves to the domineering Yankees.

The nearby towns of Brisco and Parsons, connected to Edgewater by a single road, were also reported capture. The loss of control of these remote Rocky Mountain settlements would typically be a matter of little concern; after all, small towns across Canada often fall under the control of rebels before being swiftly retaken. However the challenging terrain of the Rocky Mountains has made our job snuffing out the rebellion in Edgewater far more challenging. While the B.C.

With no way into the town by land, the B.C. Premier has requested [ROOT.GetLeader]'s assistance in crushing this rebellion. A fleet of bombers dotted the skies above the town, reigning a hail of holy fire on the rebel town, killing almost all of the town's inhabitants and burning it nearly to the ground.

The size and general emptiness of our country has served as a detriment to the new Socialist government, as countless resistance cells have been able to utilize our nation's terrain quite effectively against the Government in Ottawa. From bands of raiders hiding out Ontario's vast forests, to reactionaries hunkering down in Prairie towns, to armed holdouts hiding out in the mountains of British Columbia, there is no shortage of resistance presence in our great Nation. To this end, the Revolutionary Canadian Mounted Police has proved invaluable in keeping a lid on resistance activity in rural areas, raiding rebel outposts, seizing weaponry; things of that nature. Just like their predesecors in the RCMP and North-West Mounted Police, the new Revolutionary RCMP is tasked with enforcing the law in the Hinterlands.

canada_soc_flavour.8.d:0 "The story of the British Monarchy's flight to Canada is one that many know well. The workers uprising in Britain which spiraled into Revolution sent the King and his underlings fleeing to Canada like rats jumping from a sinking ship. However for a brief period, it seemed that Canada, not Britain would be the one to fall to the fires of revolution. Throughout the period of Revolution which gripped Europe, Socialist and Syndicalist groups at home in Canada attempted to seize the opportunity, and begin a revolution of their own right here in the Great White North. Commencing with the Vancouver General Strike of 1918, Labour Unions in Canada grew increasingly militant as a result of the Military's violent suppression of the strike. The violent response to the strike led many Labour leaders to call for a violent revolution against the Canadian Government. While a valiant effort was made to uproot the forces of Reaction, ultimately it fell short, no doubt due to the Trades and Labour Congress denouncing the growing radicalism of the Labour Movement. While a spark of hope was re-ignited after the British Revolution, the Monarchy's flight to Canada quickly quashed any such hopes, as the new Government came down hard on any hint of Labour militancy. Years of suppression of the Labour movement followed, only marked by brief periods of freedom pushed by Liberal governments and their CCF partners.\n\nYears later, we can look towards the pioneers of yesteryear, remembering what could have been and maintain hope for what is. While their Canadian Revolution may have failed, their passion set the stage for the Socialist paradise here in Canada we enjoy today."

The earliest days of the Socialist movement in Canada were defined in equal parts by militant Trade Unions sprouting in the Cities, and by Agrarian Christian-Socialist movements confined mainly to the rural Canadian Prairies. The Calgary-based Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, the largest legal Socialist movement operating in Canada during the era of Exile maintained its support base mainly in the Prairies, managing to secure several prominent positions both on the Provincial and Federal level. After the Revolution, the CCF has found themselves as the undisputed voice of the Prairies, managing to outlive both the SocCreds, the Tories and the Grits. As we work with groups such as the CCF and the Social Gospel Movement, Canada's new Socialist government has truly solidified Canada's rural heartland as among the most integral centerpieces of the new Socialist Canada.

Both of our movements have worked to upturn the former Political establishment, aiming to radically alter or even overthrow the system that existed during the era of Exile. While William Aberhart, the de-facto leader of the SocCred movement expressed virulently anti-Syndicalist sentiment, the small anonymous tract known as the 'Yellow Pamphlet,' in which Aberhart outlined his ideals was co-written by communist H.B. (Hilly) Hill. Indeed, there were certainly influences from the Manifesto of the Communist Party, but another important source of Aberhart’s thinking came from the utopian novels of American author and socialist Edward Bellam which he had read before 1929. Once Aberhart came to power, the Paris-based newspaper Pravda had its reporter in the press gallery cover this unusual leftist experiment. Even despite the ongoing Red Scare in Alberta, the left-wing tone of Aberhart’s government still attracted support from the Communist Party. When SocCred Party Whip Joe Unwin was released from prison, Social Credit and Communist Party leaders celebrated together, calling each other 'comrades.' To some, Aberhart’s ideas and connections show that he was neither right wing nor conservative; and that he owed more to leftist thinkers like Karl Marx and Edward Bellamy than to Douglas’s version of capitalism. However Aberhart still has several detractors within the Socialist movement, denouncing his rule over Alberta as a period of dictatorship, further pointing out Aberhart's supposed part in a royal-backed conspiracy to overturn Canadian Democracy in the event of Bill C-7's failure. Furthermore, many have labeled Aberhart's closest allies such as Ernest Manning as wanton opportunists who attempted to push Reactionary and Conservative ideals under the banner of Social Credit."

Historically linked to the famous Hoito Restaurant as well as also running their own museum, dance hall, and performance stage, the Finnish Labour Temple has grown from a mere center of organized labour to a cultural cornerstone off Thunder Bay. \n\nFrom the beginning, the Temple was immersed in wider Canada’s revolutionary fervor, hosting the annual convention of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada just a few months after opening with a focus on the ‘industry, thrift and co-operative spirit’ of the Canadian Finnish community. Continuing operations through the next few years and into the Great War, the Temple, now swollen with members thanks in part to a partnership with the Social Democratic Party, the rapidly emerging One Big Union along with other smaller, similar groups, and the encroachment of the American IWW, would eventually deal with its first major schism starting in 1919 as the Weltkrieg ended, the Bolsheviks failed, and the French Revolution was underway, splitting the Temple into two broad camps - the Communists and the Syndicalists - flanked by smaller groups of Social Democrats, moderate Labour advocates, and whatever else, and it is this ever-growing schism that the Temple must still deal with to this day. Regardless, the Finnish Labour Temple still continues on its efforts of spreading a Socialist message, whatever form that Socialism may take, along with the glories of Finnish culture all across the True North along the way, so we shall stand by this group as we favor the side of the schism that benefits us most."

What's more, Ottawa has been breathing down [root.getleader]'s neck, demanding that ratification is completed soon, or else. Due to this, many within the cabinet have begun pressing for [root.getleader] to use their influence to get the bill passed ASAP. What's more however, a group from the opposition have also begun pressing for our beloved leader to back their side. With such a national divide, and with the Foreign Office threatening to enforce the bill anyway, many close to [root.getleader] fear he must make a decision soon, lest the gridlock in parliament get any worse."

scc_anglosphere.6.b:0 "This is our last chance, Down with the Federation!"

scc_anglosphere.7.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Ratify!"
scc_anglosphere.7.d:0 "In a shocking move, the government of [FROM.GetName] has narrowly failed to pass a bill which would ratify the Common Socialist Constitution, the last step towards the Red Anglosphere. Allegedly due to the influence of [FROM.GetLeader], with the failure of the bill, the nation has refused to join the Federation. This treachery cannot stand! Already, the Canadian Red Navy has been informed, and invasion plans are being drawn. If they want a fight, they will have it. For the Anglosphere shall be one, and none can stop that now. Glory to Socialism, Glory to the Anglosphere!"
scc_anglosphere.7.a:0 "The Anglosphere shall strike them down!"

scc_anglosphere.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Joins Us"
scc_anglosphere.8.d:0 "In a not surprising move, the government of [FROM.GetName] has formally ratified the Common Socialist Constitution, thus joining us in the dream of a United Anglosphere. While the vote was a narrow one, thanks to the influence of [FROM.GetLeader], it passed handily. With their ratification, yet another nation unites into the warm embrace of the Red Anglosphere, a home for all workers!"
scc_anglosphere.8.a:0 "Long Live the Anglosphere!"

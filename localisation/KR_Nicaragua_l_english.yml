### Leaders ###
POLITICS_AUGUSTO_CESAR_SANDINO_DESC:0 "Sandino's emergence as a minor guerilla leader fighting in the 1926 Liberal Revolution was completely unexpected, with his presence not really being noted until the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro, which he disagreed with. Beginning with a small guerrilla force of 300 fighting in the south, he intensely fought in the jungles, slowly weakening the United States Marines. However, he kept being pushed further and further south until he was forced to leave his force with Francisco Sequeira Moreno and retreat to Mexico. There, he met with socialist leaders such as Zapata and became known in the international community. He also became a member of the EMECU, a spiritualist organisation which believed in the founding of a universal commune under God. Returning to Nicaragua in 1931 with Zapata coming along, many rallied to his side and his forces grew bigger than ever, until he and his men managed to liberate Managua in January of 1932, forcing the United States to retreat. Now slowly gaining a mass following, his presidency is loved by many with some even going as far as to create groups in his name to promote him and his rule."
POLITICS_FRANCISCO_SEQUEIRA_MORENO_DESC:0 "Francisco Sequeira Moreno was born into a poor family like much of the families of Nicaragua, and has spent the majority of his life illiterate. Following the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro between the 'Liberal' revolutionaries and the United States, he emerged as a guerrilla leader fighting within the north of Nicaragua. Him and his regiment of 400 men killed many, but were forced to retreat south and fight on with Sandino. While Sandino was in Mexico, he bravely fought in in the south against the United States occupation until Sandino returned, and became one of the leaders in the push northward and the eventual liberation of Managua. Once the revolution ended, he ended up forming his own party known as the 'Partido Campesino de Nicaragua', focused on rights for the lower class and improving the education system. While also learning how to read starting in 1932(Something he still struggles with), he is an adored individual among many of the Nicaraguan lower class."
POLITICS_JUAN_BAUTISTA_SACASA_DESC:0 "Juan Bautista Sacasa was Vice-President of former president Carlos José Solórzano until he was overthrown in a coup by former president Emiliano Chamorro Vargas. After Adolfo Díaz rebelled, he was sworn in as president by Liberal revolutionaries in the south led by José María Moncada Tapia and assisted in the liberation of Managua. However, after the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro, he stepped down as president due to his disliking of United States influence and went back to exile in Mexico. Serving mainly as an observer in Sandino's revolution, he decided to return to Nicaragua around the same time as Sandino and was present for the liberation of Managua. With him and Sandino finding themselves agreeing on basic principles, Sacasa was able to form his own party known as the 'Partido de la Revolución Liberal'. Mainly supported by those who prefer traditional democracy compared to Socialist and the small higher class, he has surprisingly managed to gain a decent base of support and some dedicated followers of his cause."
POLITICS_ELILIANO_CHAMORRO_VARGAS_DESC:0 "Serving as President from 1917-1921, Vargas is a military man with an extremely controversial reputation. Initially supported by the United States in his first presidency and helping to negotiate a treaty that allowed the United States to build a canal through Nicaragua. His presidency was largely looked over besides succeeding to pay off a significannot portion of Nicaragua's debts. However, despite his efforts, he failed to win the presidency in 1923. Following the 1926 election of Carlos José Solórzano, he couped the government, setting off the chain of events that led to Sandino's government. For this, some credit him as the beginning of the revolution while others discredit him as power hungry. All that matters now however is that his dream of returning to the presidency has finally come true."
POLITICS_ADOLFO_DIAZ_DESC:0 "Adolfo Díaz has been one of the main targets of a smear campaign from Sandino, and for not entirely wrong reasons. Helping put down liberal president José Santos Zelaya in 1910, he was sworn in as president with much help from the United States. Leading the presidency first from 1911-1917, he was the definition of an American puppet furthering the goals of American companies like the Tonopah Mining Company. In 1914, he suffered a liberal revolt which one part in many long years of the 30 year long US military occupation, with marines being forced to suppress the revolt. These marines stayed in Nicaragua for over a decade to keep order while also giving the US permission to build a Nicaraguan canal. However, after Chamarro's coup in 1926, the 2nd Marine occupation force swore him in as president. His attempts to suppress unrest failed, and he was forced to concede for new president José María Moncada. Ever since he lived in the US, until now. A foreign force has occupied the country, and he is once again needed to suppress the unrest that plagues the region."
POLITICS_ANASTASIO_SOMOZA_GARCIA_DESC:0 "Somoza started a humble life in Nicaragua like many others, gaining the rare opportunity to go to business school in Philadelphia, and there he married his future wife Salvadora Debayle Sacasa, niece of Juan Bautista Sacasa. From there he was able to work his way up the ladder until the liberal revolution in 1926. Unremarkable overall in battle, his real attention getter was his excellent English from America itself, working as the broker of peace between the liberal rebels and Americans. From there he managed to get further relations with the Americans, joining the newly formed Guardia Nacional until just before the expulsion of the Americans, he was named head of the organisation. However, once Sandino reached the capital, he was forced to retreat to Honduras who accepted him and the leftover of the Guardia with open arms. To his dismay, Juan Bautista Sacasa due to joining the Sandino regime forced his wife to divorce him. Wishing to reclaim his homeland and his wife, he has finally succeeded in his goals."

### Events ###
nic.1.t:0 "The New Republic of Nicaragua"
nic.1.d:0 "The American occupation of Nicaragua and reinstallation of Adolfo Díaz effectively made Nicaragua an American puppet state. Fortunately, however, hope was not entirely lost. Liberals across the country rose in armed rebellion to topple the American puppet regime, and eventually succeeded when the fall of the capital forced Adolfo Díaz to flee to America. The new liberal regime however, brought very little change and continued to collaborate with the Americans under former Liberal revolutionary José María Moncada. The creation of a militarised national police force known as the 'National Guard' under Anastasio Somoza García with the help of United States Marines further cemented the continuation of the status quo.\n\nDissatisfied with the direction of the new government, several former liberal revolutionaries such as Juan Bautista Sacasa left the country. Others returned to armed revolt: the young Francisco Sequeira Moreno organised resistance in the north near the border with Honduras, while Augusto César Sandino launched an insurgency in the South. Harried by forces loyal to the regime, Moreno's northern resistance of 400 men managed to retreat south and join with Sandino and his 300-man regiment. This new consolidated force slowly began to retreat into the southern jungles while gaining expertise in guerilla warfare.\n\nHowever, this could not last forever. Increasingly desperate, Sandino fled to Mexico by plane in an attempt to elicit foreign support while Moreno continued the fight. While in Mexico, Sandino met with Emiliano Zapata and the two found not only common ground, but even became fast friends. Further bolstered by materiel support from both the Commune of France and Union of Britain, Zapata personally accompanied Sandino back to Nicaragua along with a small force of Mexican volunteers.\n\nHis position improved, Sandino's domestic support began to grow massively, and his revolutionaries began to fight their way north. Once flagging morale boosted by Sandino's newfound success, Syndicalist protests erupted in the capital, and the approach of the revolutionary army led to the Marines' retreat to the country's east. The Americans judged the situation of the underdeveloped National Guard hopeless and the cost of the Marines continuing to hold the capital prohibitively high. Soon after, the 'Liberals' and their National Guard dogs escaped to Honduras, leaving the capital open to Sandino's final push. Along with this, Sacasa who retreated to Mexico due to his hate of the former government returned to help in the formation of the Revolutionary Government."
nic.1.a:0 "For the revolution!"

nic.2.t:0 "Liberation Day"
nic.2.d:0 "Today is the anniversary of the revolution which liberated our nation from the Americans and their lapdogs. While Sacasa and Moreno were both involved in the revolution, Sandino is more widely credited for the revolution's success. Sandino's popularity has increased because of the celebrations, but to supporters of opposition parties, the day has only further their disdain for the man. They claim that this celebration with all its cult-like pomp and circumstance is 'Sandino trying to brainwash the population'"
nic.2.a:0 "Central America is next."

nic.3.t:0 "Sacasa Travels Across the Country"
nic.3.d:0 "With the recent celebrations of Liberation Day, Sandino and his supporters have a slight edge in popularity over the other parties. To counter this, Sacasa has begun a countrywide tour to meet with constituents in hopes of securing their vote come April. While so far, the campaign seems to have been a success, Sandino's supporters, known as 'Sandinistas', now claim that Sacasa is disrespecting the Liberation Day holiday and Sandino himself with this move. Some prominent Sandinistas have even called for violence against Sacasa himself."
nic.3.a:0 "These elections will be intense, it seems."

nic.4.t:0 "Sacasa Speaks Out"
nic.4.d:0 "While abroad I had the pleasure of the company of many good natured men of influence, and the fortune to learn the fundamentals of good governance and political practice. I now realize that to attribute our present state of isolation to some global conspiracy would be foolish. The nations of the world, on the whole anyway, are good. We would be better served to stand together with those who would have us against the imperialist tendencies of the great powers of the world. The dream of the liberation of all Central America, and perhaps even the independence of Nicaragua itself, rests on our own willingness to employ greater moderation in our foreign policy. The present perversion of liberal thought in our nation is sad indeed, and I say here today, we must no longer turn our backs on destiny. Thank you!'\n\nFierce applause followed."
nic.4.a:0 "A complete 180 for the PRL!"

nic.5.t:0 "'Sandinistas' Rise Up"
nic.5.d:0 "With the spike in popularity of the PRL, Sandinista radicals have begun disrupting Liberal rallies in the capital in support of Sacasa. The violence has reached a breaking point with a protest shut down by the Revolutionary Guard in response to violence. These radicals are beginning to hurt Sandino's reputation as he has so far refused to take any action to stop these incidents. Some even hold suspicions that he is behind the violence. Sacasa for his part has taken advantage of the situation, stating that these acts of thuggery are representative of both Sandino and his base."
nic.5.a:0 "A tough blow for the revolutionary."

nic.6.t:0 "Sandino Speaks Up"
nic.6.d:0 "Violence, that committed in the name of righteous cause, when directed against our own nation, our own people, is unacceptable. The actions of those few who would lower themselves to such behaviour are slowly but surely ripping our country apart, distracting us from the true goal of spreading the revolution to Central America, and freeing our brethren around the world. I beseech all who have even a shred of dignity for a return to peace!'\n\nThe Sandinistas have ceased to engage in political violence."
nic.6.a:0 "A comeback for his reputation."

nic.7.t:0 "Moreno's Yearly Visit"
nic.7.d:0 "For four years now, Moreno has been on a tour of the countryside and our nation's most isolated rural villages. Although the revolution has precipitated a significant rise in his social status, he remains a source of great pride and standard to aspire to for the peasantry who see him as one of their own. His popularity has risen slowly but steadily over the years thanks in part to his activity in the countryside, and he has now managed to position himself as a new compromise candidate between Sandino and Sacasa. The nation holds its breathe in anticipation of his full entry in the race."
nic.7.a:0 "The people sure love relatable politicians."

nic.8.t:0 "Moreno Speaks to Local Children"
nic.8.d:0 "'You children will be our future, and must never forget that. Even if you do feel hopeless, you can carry on the revolution even if we fall. My intention is to always stand for you, the common people. Hell, back in the day, I couldn't read and there was no money, so I stand for the common man! That includes all of you, to ensure you won't have to live the same life I did! For a better Nicaragua and Central America!'\n\nLooks like Moreno secured another village."
nic.8.a:0 "Well, that's another village for Moreno."

nic.9.t:0 "The Second Election"
nic.9.d:0 "At last this incessant campaigning is over, it's time for the elections to officially begin. Although it was at first predicted for Sandino to win the election easily, recently he has fallen in popularity and Sandino's rivals, Sacasa and Moreno, have capitalized on the situation.\n\nSacasa primarily finds support among the small urban upper class and minor landowners due to the other two candidates' worrying redistribution policies. Moreno's main base of support is the rural peasantry from which he himself originally hails. Finally, Sandino has a very mixed support base, which mainly consists of the youth and those who were involved in the revolution with him, resulting in his followers being very fervent in their belief of him. Everyone seems to have a chance this election, but the result ended up being..."
nic.9.a:0 "Sandino keeps the mantle of president."
nic.9.b:0 "Moreno charms the people and assumes the presidency."
nic.9.c:0 "The Liberal Revolution attracts the people and Sacasa is elected."

nic.10.t:0 "Sandinistas Rally in Managua"
nic.10.d:0 "In what has been dubbed the 'Managua Rallies', over 500 Sandinistas have begun to protest in our capital. While it was not initially violent, a group of Sacasa supporters sparked backlash when they attempted to disrupt the protest and were forcefully expelled. One of them died and another was injured.\n\nSacasa has already denounced these protests, but unlike the last time, Sandino has not mentioned anything of it. Many are beginning to see this as the beginning to a new, long-lasting split, in our nation between Liberals and Socialists but Sacasa has claimed that he still intends to cooperate with Sandino. The unity of the revolutionary republic against our oppressors comes first, after all."
nic.10.a:0 "Sandino better not act out of line."

nic.11.t:0 "Juan Sacasa is Inaugurated"
nic.11.d:0 "At 11 AM this morning, Juan Bautista Sacasa was officially inaugurated as the President of the Republic of Nicaragua. Sacasa mentioned many things during the ceremony, like how he still retains the intent of throwing off the yoke of the United States and ensuring the rest of Central America is freed as well. He also mentioned his desire to establish ties with the new rising powers of the world in order to escape pervasive American influence.\n\nThe main concern among the mainstream Socialist movement is his alignment towards liberalism rather than Socialism. While his supporters love the change, it is a worrying sign for the large peasantry in the country and the increasingly hostile Sandinistas. Sacasa will need to play his cards carefully if he wishes to appease the socialists and others within the country and to win over new supporters for future elections."
nic.11.a:0 "To a new future, Nicaragua!"

nic.12.t:0 "The Peasantry Complain"
nic.12.d:0 "The people of our nation's east have begun to complain of abuses carried out by the United Fruit Company. A sad reminder that while the revolution liberated the nation, some areas remain entrenched in the past. While moving fully against the company won't be possible while the United States is around, we will have to do something to appease the people in the region.\n\nOne of the more popular solutions is to work with Moreno, who is loved by the eastern populous, to calm the people. However, there is the potential for such a move to backfire, transferring much of our government's authority to Moreno. Of course, the situation there could very well change in the future, so perhaps a simple reassurance could prove sufficient in spite of the risk of backlash from the affected population."
nic.12.a:0 "Moreno knows the people well, he can assist."
nic.12.b:0 "They'll need to be patient."

nic.13.t:0 "People Lack Confidence in the Government"
nic.13.d:0 "Our reliance on Moreno to calm the eastern populace has borne fruit, with Moreno and his PCN growing more popular by the day as a result. While this has turned out good for him and the country overall, it has severely decreased our popularity among the general populous who are beginning to see us as weak due to our reliance on outside individuals to deal with our problems. We'll need to prove them wrong sometime in the future through decisive action and proof of our independence from others. When we will have an opportunity to accomplish this in the eyes of the people, however, is anyone's guess."
nic.13.a:0 "We just wanted to please the people..."

nic.14.t:0 "The Situation Slowly Improves"
nic.14.d:0 "Our lukewarm reaction to complaints of abuse from the east has driven the people there further into the arms of Morena, who has already traveled back to the area to assist the locals. What little support we had in the area has been reduced to nothing; the region is now entirely behind Moreno.\n\nWorryingly, due to increased agitation by the Sandinistas in the capital, we are currently unable to respond and salvage some modicum of face. We must be more careful in the future."
nic.14.a:0 "Moreno's popularity grows..."

nic.15.t:0 "Sandino Speaks on Socialism"
nic.15.d:0 "Sandino has decided to speak in the city of León, the second most populous city in our country to attract supporters. The speech itself summarized a lot of his thoughts, like the importance of religion in the revolution and his association with individuals from Mexico. The second half of the speech touched on a most sensitive matter, the growing divides between the socialist and liberals within the country. According to him, 'What was once thought to be very similar is now proving to be very different in practice. I can only hope this is addressed in the future to help safeguard the future of Nicaragua and the revolution'. Of course freeing Central America comes first to Sandino before personal ambition, right?"
nic.15.a:0 "Liberalism and Socialism are one and the same, no?"

nic.16.t:0 "Establishing New Relations"
nic.16.d:0 "With the Liberal focus on economic self-reliance and separation from the United States, we've come across a roadblock. The economic conditions in Nicaragua will always require it to partially rely on one power, so our only option until the revolution can be fully carried out is to establish economic bonds with new nations to remove American influence.\n\nOne possible option is Germany, who already has a large amount of influence in our neighbour to the south, Costa Rica, and have proved to be valuable investors in that nation. Much like the Yankee, however, the Germans would aim to make us reliant on them completely, so asking them for help might not advance our self-sufficiency as much as another possible option, the Dominion of Canada. They are, however, very focused on stopping the spread of syndicalism in the Americas, so we may face some diplomatic pressure to liberalize slightly."
nic.16.a:0 "Germany can help us stand internationally."
nic.16.b:0 "Canada can help us remain safe in America."

nic.17.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Wants to Increase Ties"
nic.17.d:0 "The Nicaraguan ambassador has recently come to us with a deal. In an attempt to escape American influence, they want to open up new trade deals with our country along with diplomatic ties. This investment could bring numerous advantages in the future, with the variety of cash crops in Nicaragua mainly being exported to us instead of the United States."
nic.17.a:0 "Hooray to our new friends!"
nic.17.b:0 "Central America is America's domain."

nic.18.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees!"
nic.18.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to our deal. While many do celebrate our breaking of ties with our overbearing northern neighbour, many within our government worry that establishing ties with another reactionary power in [From.GetNameDefCap] could possibly let our nation fall back into imperialist subjugation."
nic.18.a:0 "Hopefully this will erode American influence."

nic.19.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
nic.19.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused our offer for increased ties between our nations, claiming that “doing so would strain ties with the United States, which is undesirable.” This has brought great flak towards Sacasa and his presidency, and some have claimed that the current government are 'American pigs'. Revolutionary fervor is high, and people are beginning to speak of a revolution against the revolution."
nic.19.a:0 "America still watches closely, and so do our people."

nic.20.t:0 "Sandino and Morena Organize"
nic.20.d:0 "Both Sandino and Morena have met in León which has become a mini hub of operations for them. The announcement once out of the meeting has made it known that the Frente de Soberanía Nacional and the Partido Campesino de Nicaragua will have increased cooperation in a hope to help one or the other win the next election and sideline the liberals. Whether or not this will work is yet to be seen, but it's something we'll need to keep a close eye on."
nic.20.a:0 "Hooray?"

nic.21.t:0 "The New Sandinistas"
nic.21.d:0 "Sandino has begun making attempts to 'tame' the Sandinistas as of late into an organized force ready to fight and liberate Central America. While he has only managed to organize them and they are still in training, he has begun scheduled exercises with them, and claims they'll be ready to deploy in a month. While this is good news for the army, this could bring trouble if Sandino tries something in the future. To our slight advantage, this has been seen as a sign of weakness by a small amount of their supporters and have begun to support Sacasa instead."
nic.21.a:0 "We'll allow it, for the sake of the revolution."
nic.21.b:0 "We can't afford that risk."

nic.23.t:0 "Francisco Sequeira Moreno is Inaugurated"
nic.23.d:0 "Today at 12:06, Francisco Sequeira Moreno has been Inaugurated as the 2nd president of our new Nicaraguan Republic. Large crowds appeared for this event, with some traveling across the country just to see the event in-person. Moreno has promised to lead Nicaragua into a new direction, one for the lower man, one for the forgotten much like himself."
nic.23.a:0 "A new day for the lower class."

nic.24.t:0 "Peasants Celebrate in León"
nic.24.d:0 "Despite not much being done so far in Moreno's first term as president so far, a large amount of people in León have gathered to celebrate their hero. Moreno has had a very consistent base of support in the administrative district due to that being where his guerrilla resistance began, and is seen as a symbol to the northern people. Moreno hasn't commented on the event so far to avoid allegations from people with differing political opinions claiming he is trying to create a cult around himself."
nic.24.a:0 "People don't forget their heroes."

nic.25.t:0 "Complaints about Wealth Distribution"
nic.25.d:0 "The small but very vocal citizens who manage to make a decent living for themselves have begun to complain about the wealth distribution policies. Considering they are already barely scraping by in their day to day lives, this is going to deeply affect them and possibly move more of our citizens to a lower class. This is a concern that will need to be answered if we wish to move forward with our policies into the future."
nic.25.a:0 "We'll stay on the course."
nic.25.b:0 "We'll try to satisfy their needs."

nic.26.t:0 "Liberal Protests"
nic.26.d:0 "The decision to keep moving forward with our wealth distribution policies has had the already predicted effect of hurting the people who were making a decent living in Nicaragua. People from around the country have taken up to the street in protest, while the lower class holds counter protests in reaction. Those affected have claimed to be 'Betrayed by Socialism' and have slowly dropped out of their support of the president, and have begun to prefer Sacasa as a presidential candidate.\n\nThis has put Moreno in quite a precarious situation. While he still retains his large support base among the rural class, he has further alienated those who weren't big appreciators of Socialism into full on Liberal supporters. Moreno hopes to regain their trust in him overtime, but it is a grim looking situation for the FSN overall."
nic.26.a:0 "We just can't satisfy everyone."

nic.27.t:0 "Complaints from Chinandega"
nic.27.d:0 "Chinandega has been a very consistent support base for Moreno even during the first election, where he manages to secure over 80% of the vote in the district. This is all due to his fighting operations in the north shifting to Chinandega after he was kicked out of León. The people appreciate him and what he stands for immensely, or at least they used to.\n\nChinandega has recently seen a worrying drop in support for Chinandega due to the weaker distribution policy he enacted. What used to be 80% towards Moreno has crashed down to 40%, with many of the new votes going to the other popular socialist candidate, Sandino. While Moreno and Sandino are on good terms and generally respect each other, it hurts Moreno deeply to say the people who once regarded him as a hero to turn on him like this."
nic.27.a:0 "They were so loyal too..."

nic.28.t:0 "School Construction"
nic.28.d:0 "The recent education project Moreno has enforced has begun to reap its fruits, with the first school officially being finished as a result. Known as the 'Spanish School of Nicaragua', it is meant to serve as a starting point for the education system in Nicaragua, with the goal of letting people learn how to read and write in a basic sense."
nic.28.a:0 "For a literate future!"

nic.29.t:0 "Moreno and Sandino Meet"
nic.29.d:0 "Moreno and Sandino have begun a meeting in León today. Not many know the reason for this, but some have heard rumors of an attempted coalition party between the two in order for the country to truly be prepared for the liberation of Central America. Sacasa and his supporter base have deep worries about this news, as a merging of the parties could result in his chances of winning any future elections being slim to completely none."
nic.29.a:0 "We'll see in the future."

nic.30.t:0 "Sacasa and Sandino Congratulate Moreno"
nic.30.d:0 "The Inauguration of Moreno was met with generally good reception, with even the opposing candidates Sacasa and Sandino congratulating him on the event. Sacasa was cited saying he is a 'Truly respectable figure' and Sandino saying 'He'll always be my partner in crime'. The general approval of Moreno even among Sandino and Sacasa supporters has grown as a result, and many think Moreno has a bright future ahead of him."
nic.30.a:0 "A truly great Republic."

nic.31.t:0 "Moreno's Drinking Problem"
nic.31.d:0 "Moreno barged into a government meeting 30 minutes late today regarding complaints around certain opposition towards the wealth distribution policies. As he sat down, he nearly tumbled over before managing to secure himself on his seat. He ended up yelling at multiple people during the meeting (Even if he agreed with them), passing out three times, and nearly barfing once.\n\nIt was later learned that Moreno had arrived at the meeting extremely drunk. Moreno has had a drinking problem ever since his times as a guerrilla fighter, something everyone thought he overcame after the revolution and his entrance into politics. Many predict that the stress of the position he is in is starting weigh down on him, but he has promised to never do something like this ever again."
nic.31.a:0 "Hopefully it's just a phase."

nic.32.t:0 "The Sandinistas Organize a Celebration"
nic.32.d:0 "Sandino's election saw immediate reaction among his loyal Sandinistas, with a huge celebration taking place in the capital. Surprisingly enough for the Sandinistas, the celebration lacked extreme violence like their other protests and celebrations in the past. Sandino and others have described this as a 'step towards peace in Nicaragua, and the revolution'. Many are distrusting of this however, thinking this is a facade to make a forgiving organisation despite their violence."
nic.32.a:0 "Maybe this is a transition towards peace?"

nic.33.t:0 "Sandino's Inauguration"
nic.33.d:0 "Sandino's inauguration has occurred today with the most noticeable people arriving being Moreno, who congratulated Sandino on his victory in the election. The other was the presence of the Sandinistas, who's constant screaming and celebration were seen as mildly disrupting towards the event. Something everyone noticed however was Sacasa not arriving at all or even issuing a statement. which has suddenly caused some extreme divides between the Socialist and Liberal camps in Nicaragua. But who knows, maybe he just forgot...?"
nic.33.a:0 "The status-quo has been kept."

nic.34.t:0 "Sandino Meets with the Sandinistas"
nic.34.d:0 "Sandino has summoned a 'meeting' with the Sandinistas in León, which many of the known heads of the Sandinistas attending. What they thought was going to be congratulating them for their achievements towards Sandino's campaign turned out to be rather severe ridicule over their violent actions that hurt Sandino's reputation during his campaign. This struck hard among his supporters, with Sandino directly sighting them as turning into a group of thugs. The head Sandinistas left looking depressed, but rumors have begun to circulate of the Sandinistas attempting to organize into a more concise and less violent group."
nic.34.a:0 "A small step back for a big step forward."

nic.35.t:0 "Liberal Protests"
nic.35.d:0 "The fears of Sacasa not attending the inauguration have been met, with a Liberal protest being held in Matagalpa over the lack of troop presence in the region. The region has long been locked off by our troops due to the United States watchful eye, and the people are still under harsh American influence. The people want us to officially march into the region and remove the United States, but that obviously isn't an option. We are left with two choices, ignore the protest or declare it illegal to calm the region."
nic.35.a:0 "We'll have to allow this to continue."
nic.35.b:0 "Declare the protest illegal."

nic.36.t:0 "The 'Socialist Meeting'"
nic.36.d:0 "Both Sandino and Moreno have met up to discuss the recent Liberal protests in Matagalpa, which some believe has been orchestrated by Sacasa and his PRL party itself. Many things were brought up, with even the idea of banning the PRL being spoken of, but was quickly shot down. The end result ended up being on them both agreeing to demand an explanation from Sacasa, with action coming afterwards depending on his response."
nic.36.a:0 "A sudden drift for the nation."

nic.37.t:0 "The Liberal Split"
nic.37.d:0 "In regards to the demands of a response, Sacasa has delivered a message to the people and his followers. His response declared the Liberal Revolution all but dead in Nicaragua, and his intent to resign from politics due to what he sees as a 'Socialist Country in the making, forgetting its original goals'. Many have rallied behind him, refusing to participate in future elections unless the situation is dealt with. Sandino's reaction has been less than pleased, as the once seen as revolutionary republic is falling before his very own feet."
nic.37.a:0 "The divides are beginning to show, but the revolution comes first."

nic.38.t:0 "Sandinistas Tamed"
nic.38.d:0 "In reaction to the split of the Liberal section of the Republic, Sandino has begun to pool his efforts into 'taming' the Sandinistas. Turning them into a small, and at this moment unorganized military force is meant to disrupt enemies as the actual army advances. Many worry about what exactly these troops will be doing when not watched by others due to their reputation, but Sandino has assured the populace that they will be kept in line. “They shall prove themselves to be key in our spread of the revolution and the light of God to Central America”, claims Sandino"
nic.38.a:0 "Let's hope they'll be kept in line."

nic.39.t:0 "Sandinistas Almost March East"
nic.39.d:0 "Despite what Sandino said, at noon today the Sandinistas army attempted to march east into the unofficially demilitarized zone setup by America. Luckily the actual army managed to stop them before it was too late, but this could have possibly ended up in us with a conflict with America. We'll have to be careful about keeping an eye on these troops from now on, unless we want more close calls like this in the future. After all, poking Uncle Sam is not optimal right now with the growing political divides within the nation, and will have to wait until later despite the Sandinistas wishes."
nic.39.a:0 "Bunch of rabble-rousers..."

nic.40.t:0 "American Unrest Grows"
nic.40.d:0 "With the recent elections in America, many have noted the rapidly increasing unrest located within America. From protests to internal political strife, many are predicting the fall of the giant who has oppressed our people for so long. This has raised morale among the people, especially the eastern populace who predict the day they can remove American influence from their region. Who knows, maybe the contention within America can also see a new ally pop out to give us the help we need in the future?"
nic.40.a:0 "Our chance could come soon."

nic.41.t:0 "American Chaos"
nic.41.d:0 "It has begun. The previously predicted unrest in the United States has officially erupted, with the giant known as the United States completely collapsing upon itself. While chaotic for them, this provides us with a golden opportunity. The far too long locked off region of Eastern Nicaragua is now ripe for the taking, with us now having the ability to seize the lands for ourselves and rid our country of imperialist influence once and for all. The people have already begun to celebrate, and now is the time. It is time to secure our country!"
nic.41.a:0 "The opportunity has arrived!"

nic.42.t:0 "Liberal Camp Unrest"
nic.42.d:0 "As the invasion of Honduras has begun, many liberals have unexpectedly begun to protest the invasion and spread of the revolution. Claiming that Honduras has managed to transform itself into a peaceful liberal democracy, and the unnecessary shedding of Nicaraguan blood and guns on those who align with us. Many sources lead to the one behind these protests being Sacasa himself, who is organizing this in an attempt to try and gain the presidency for himself as an attempt to 'Sideline liberalism in favour of socialism'."
nic.42.a:0 "Such foolishness."

nic.43.t:0 "Socialist Camp Unrest"
nic.43.d:0 "As the invasion of Honduras begins, many socialists are completely distressed over the move itself. What was originally thought as an attempt to free Honduras has transformed into an attempt to sideline socialism in Central America in favour of Liberalism. As many realized, the old guard in Honduras was removed in favour of a popular socialist government, making people feel like it's an indirect clamp down from the liberal side of things. The most outspoken about this problem and the divides within the republic has been Sandino himself, who has been rumoured to begin a personal recruitment campaign for Sandinistas in case of a 'liberal betrayal'."
nic.43.a:0 "He is being paranoid."

nic.44.t:0 "The Recruitment of Abelardo Cuadra"
nic.44.d:0 "Abdelardo Cuadra. Cuadra is known by many within Nicaragua for siding with the National Guard and the Americans during Sandino's resistance, but as a hired fighter. He's been very controversial as he was allowed to stay in Nicaragua despite his resistance against Sandino, claiming he was just trying to scrape by during the hard situation, and the Americans came knocking. Sandino's disdain for him has made him much more attracted towards the liberal camp as a mini attempt of resistance for Sandino.\n\nWhat wasn't expected however was for him to be officially hired today by Sacasa himself to help reorganize the military to a more professional structure. This has faced immediate backlash from the socialist camp, with unrest sure to rise further."
nic.44.a:0 "A necessary step."

nic.45.smalltitle:0 "Minor Protests from the Socialist Camp"
nic.45.bigtitle:0 "Major Protests from the Socialist Camp"
nic.45.small:0 "The hiring of Cuadra has actually had less backlash then expected from the socialist side of things. Despite some very minor unrest, they have largely failed to organize an organized movement in response to it. Some on the liberal side point to this occurrence happening due to our successful liberation of Honduras, which helped to immensely raise confidence in the government. Despite our success, we'll need to keep an eye on the situation to make sure it doesn't make to organize and grow."
nic.45.big:0 "The hiring of Cuadra has caused an extreme reaction from the socialist camp, with the move being seen as desperate from Sacasa due to the failure in Honduras, and ensure the stability of his regime. Really, this rumour is not entirely false as the Liberals have seen a sharp decline in popularity since the loss, and will manage to hold on by a miracle if these protests manage to grow any bigger."
nic.45.a:0 "A possible calm before the storm?"

nic.46.smalltitle:0 "Sandino Endorses the Socialists"
nic.46.bigtitle:0 "The Socialist Camp Unites"
nic.46.small:0 "In a more shocking move, Sandino has decided to officially support the socialists, declaring the current government illegitimate, against the revolution, and a threat to the principles of the revolutionary democracy. This is seen as a desperate move from Sandino's side, as Sacasa's approval rating has managed to see an increase since the victory in Honduras. While the socialists still number many, most seem to think they'll fail to pose a real threat, especially since Moreno hasn't announced his support for the cause either."
nic.46.big:0 "It seems both Moreno and Sandino have put their backing towards the growing socialist and anti-liberal movement. Both of their support has largely managed to unify the socialist sphere of politics against the common enemy, Sacasa and his liberal section of the government. This entirely new and unseen threat has put the ruling government in great danger, with many thinking it's time is limited and the dawn of a truly socialist revolution will soon be upon us."
nic.46.a:0 "Seems the time has come."

nic.47.t:0 "Moreno's Neutrality"
nic.47.d:0 "Despite what Sandino initially assumed would be direct intervention from Moreno's side of the pond, Moreno has seemingly left Sandino for dirt as he is forced to resist on his own against the liberal ruling government. All he got was a meager letter wishing him luck in his ambitions, and a summary of what is the equivalent to Moreno's resignation from politics. His followers seemed to have follow stead, really avoiding supporting either side with the dawn of the loss of their leader and figurehead for the future."
nic.47.a:0 "Convenient for us."

nic.48.t:0 "Outright Revolt Begins"
nic.48.d:0 "The combination of both Sandino and Morenos's forces has stuck our government in a rough situation to put it lightly. The fade of liberal support following the failed attempt in Honduras was already a worrying enough sign, but it seems the inner hatred towards the government has finally been released among the people. Many have taken to the streets against the government in the wish of deposing us in favour of Sandino and Moreno, with violence breaking out on the streets as a result of Sandino's Sandinistas. Nicaragua has just become a much more dangerous place."
nic.48.a:0 "Are we really that hated?"

nic.49.t:0 "Liberals Demanded to Step Down"
nic.49.small:0 "It seems Sandino and his Sandinistas has officially demanded that the ruling government step down immediately and favour Sandino as president. Our government currently has a very strong grip on the country, with the majority of the people believing in it and the socialists becoming more and more of a fringe cause, so many are telling us to just ignore the demands in order to remove the threat of socialism once and for all."
nic.49.big:0 "It seems the socialist camp in the country has together demanded that the ruling government and specifically Sacasa step down in favour of a temporary socialist coalition with new elections being held a month after. The threat of socialism has managed to attract many, with some of our government officials advising we step down peacefully before the violence escalates further, while hardliners believe we must resist to the last in order to safeguard liberalism and the future of our nation."
nic.49.a:0 "Sacasa agrees to step down."
nic.49.b:0 "Sacasa refuses the demands."

nic.50.t:0 "The Socialist March"
nic.50.d:0 "The socialists have officially begun to march on the capital in an attempt to try and remove Sacasa from the presidency by force. While if we handle the situation correctly the country should be fine, but we have no clue how much traction this will cause. We will need to be prepared for the worst case scenario if it comes to that."
nic.50.a:0 "Is this left unity?"

nic.51.t:0 "Clash at the Capital"
nic.51.small:0 "It seems as predicted that the march has not gained much for traction from when it started, with only a few in the capital itself joining Sandino's desperate cause. The military should be able to suppress the final mouthpiece of resistance fine, but the previous month of suppression seem to reaching their minds, with whispers of defection lying about. It would only take one spark to possibly ignite the powder-keg that leads to our fall."
nic.51.big:0 "The socialists have gained a steep advantage in the capital, with their side being entrenched and a stalemate occurring between us and them. The army has quickly become exhausted from not only the previous month of suppression and this certainly hasn't helped. The people within the capital predict a mutiny within the army stemming into defection a high likelihood in order to end this standoff once and for all, but only the future knows what will occur."
nic.51.a:0 "Sacasa and the liberals retain power."
nic.51.b:0 "The army defects, and the socialists triumph."

nic.52.t:0 "Changes in Nicaragua!"
nic.52.d:0 "Shocking news! In Nicaragua, Sandino and his men have managed to take control over the control once again, sidelining President Sacasa! He has fled to our country, leaving us to fend for ourselves due to the changes. A sense of instability has washed over parts of the nation, causing our government to be more careful in its actions in order to not upset the very gentle balance."
nic.52.a:0 "Dire news indeed."

nic.53.t:0 "Former President Emiliano Chamorro Vargas"
nic.53.d:0 "In a move to establish true democracy, Sacasa has invited formally exiled president Emiliano Chamorro Vargas back to Nicaragua. Vargas is technically the start of the 1926 revolution, as he couped the elected president, causing him to be deposed by the United States and putting Adolfo Díaz in power. Sacasa served as vice-president during this, causing him to have good relations with Vargas. Sacasa's main worry since his revolution is people thinking he is leading a dictatorship due to the lack of an opposition party and the people turning on him, so a small amount of opposition would increase his opinion among the people."
nic.53.a:0 "Hopefully this will ensure democracy."

nic.54.t:0 "Fresh Elections Announced"
nic.54.d:0 "Sacasa today has announced new elections in a month following the recent revolution. So far, the political chances of Sacasa being removed from the presidency seem minimal to none, but the invitation of Vargas to the country could see a shakeup to the current liberal dominance within the country."
nic.54.a:0 "May the best man win."

nic.55.t:0 "Conservative Party Reformed"
nic.55.d:0 "The invitation of Vargas to the country has had somewhat predictable results, as he has to decided to reform the Conservative Party from the 20s under his leadership as a bid for the presidency. The party includes some former presidents and those who opposed Sandino during the revolution. So far the party has gotten moderate response from those who hold a grudge agaisnt Sacasa for the removal of the socialists and small traction in the capital. The chances of them winning the election are not the highest, but a turnaround in attitude could easily occur depending on how each party campaigns."
nic.55.a:0 "We'll see."

nic.56.t:0 "Party Campaigning"
nic.56.d:0 "Both the Conservative and Liberal parties have been trying their best to campaign in order to win the election, going around to the multiple departments in order to convince the populace to vote. Many have noted the conservatives putting extra effort into this front due to their view as the underdog party, but there is always a chance their campaigning could fall onto the deaf ears of the populace."
nic.56.a:0 "Election season is always fun."

nic.57.t:0 "The [GETYEAR] Election"
nic.57.d:0 "It is finally time for the long foreseen elections in Nicaragua, with the two parties that have managed to gain the most traction among the people being the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, both campaiging their hardest in order to ensure the people vote for them this time around. As the ballots begin to close, the winner of the elections is..."
nic.57.a:0 "The Liberal Party!"
nic.57.b:0 "The Conservative Party!"

nic.58.t:0 "The New National Guard"
nic.58.d:0 "In response to the lack of a professionalized military following the revolution back in the early 30s, Abelardo Cuadra has begun to form a new National Guard based off the American format. As someone formally apart of the National Guard, Cuadra's new guard has been watched over by the president to ensure it doesn't get involved in politics like the military forces in other countries, while also ensuring it remains large enough to defend the country. So far it's development has gone well, making the people feel safe against foreign powers while also knowing their democracy is secured."
nic.58.a:0 "Great!"

nic.59.t:0 "Disputes in the Guard"
nic.59.d:0 "As the guard continues to grow and develop, Vargas has found himself getting increasingly involved within it following his loss in the election, wanting to contribute something to the country. This has led to disputes between the current head of the guard Cuadra and Vargas himself on the direction to take it. Cuadra wants it to be a strong, offensive force built upon trying to overthrow the dictatorships within America while Vargas wants to make it a force built upon defending Nicaragua and it's people. Due to the very little common ground between them, we'll have to side with one over the other."
nic.59.a:0 "Cuadra is completely right."
nic.59.b:0 "Vargas knows what Nicaragua needs."

nic.60.t:0 "Nicaragua Wants to Further Ties"
nic.60.d:0 "Nicaragua has possessed an interest in furthering it's ties with other countries in order to ensure it's safety and economic development. Investing in them can bring some profit to us as well through an increase of exports from their country such as cash crops and other things they have to offer like cattle."
nic.60.a:0 "Sure thing."
nic.60.b:0 "We'll have to pass."

nic.61.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
nic.61.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] has agreed to increase economic ties and cooperation between both of our country. We've received some minor aid for economic development which should help make Nicaragua grow and prosper as a country."
nic.61.a:0 "Great!"

nic.62.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
nic.62.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] have decided against increased economic ties and cooperation between both of our country. We'll be needing to look towards new partners and allies in the region into the future if we wish to not remain isolated diplomatically and economically."
nic.62.a:0 "We'll need to look further."

nic.63.t:0 "The Fate of Moreno"
nic.63.d:0 "Moreno, unlike Sandino, decided to try to avoid direct conflict with us due to our immense influence during the Liberal Split. Despite his neutrality, he still diplomatically supported Sandino's side in the conflict and must be dealt with accordingly. He is still loved among a lot of the lower populous despite his cowardice, so we'll need to tread carefully. He could just block him off from politics and leave it at that, but he could prove dangerous. It might be necessary to expel him from the country entirely which will cause some instability, but will prevent him from making a move again."
nic.63.a:0 "He can do no harm, just block him form politics."
nic.63.b:0 "He's too dangerous, expel him."

nic.64.t:0 "Sacasa 'Resigns' from Politics"
nic.64.d:0 "In a weirder set of moves, Sacasa has officially resigned from politics siting his reasons being the devolution of true democracy and a drift towards socialist democracy. This came as unexpected to Moreno, as he has had little to no problems with Sacasa in the past. Many from Sandino's side predict this as him preparing to try something uncanny in the future, and that more cooperation between the socialist camps is required to prepare for this. But surely, he must just be paranoid, right?"
nic.64.a:0 "A bit suspicious."

nic.65.t:0 "Movements from Sacasa"
nic.65.d:0 "After Sacasa already resigned from politics back in 1936, he's been noted for doing exceptionally little since then, or at least we thought. People have begun to note him meeting with many opposition leaders to Sandino's government, spending on personal guards, and other things. While he hasn't tried anything yet, people have suggested we keep an extremely close eye on him and try to establish further ties with Moreno just in case the worst occurs."
nic.65.a:0 "What could he be up to?"

nic.66.t:0 "Sacasa Hires Abdelardo Caudra"
nic.66.d:0 "As we've been keeping a closer eye on Sacasa, he has recently hired mercenary general Abdelardo Cuadra as a personal general and guard. This wouldn't be the worst under normal circumstances, but Caudra is a more controversial figure. He directly served the Guardia Nacional during the civil war, fighting Sandino's forces many times. He wasn't kicked form Nicaragua due to him not having any real loyalty to the Guardia and defecting last second. He is known for still not liking Sandino or Moreno much after all that has happened, so Sacasa's hiring of him has been seen as extremely controversial."
nic.66.a:0 "Keep a closer eye on him."

nic.67.t:0 "Sacasa Declares our Government 'Undemocratic'"
nic.67.d:0 "It seems Sacasa has finally begun to make his move against the government, officially calling out the government in Matagalpa, claiming we are sidelining democratic liberties and throwing away the revolutionary republic in exchange for a socialist one. Of course, these claims are ludicrous, but some have actually begun to leave the socialist government and favour Sacasa after the claim. A potential crisis could be under way, but we'll need to wait longer to see the full reaction of the people."
nic.67.a:0 "A true villain in disguise."

nic.68.t:0 "An Unexpected Result"
nic.68.d:0 "It seems Sacasa's resistance has fallen on completely deaf ears, with almost no one joining him in his cause and even the small mercenary groups outright refusing his offers. Many attribute this to the success in Honduras raising confidence in the government by a marginal amount. Never the less, Sacasa has since retreated from the country out of embarrassment, leaving us secured in power."
nic.68.a:0 "Well, that was simple."

nic.69.t:0 "Sacasa's Mercenary Army"
nic.69.big:0 "Sacasa has begun to organize a mercenary army of disgruntled former Guardia Nacional members and veterans of the army before the occupation who dislike the new system of government. So far Sacasa's support among the people has been alarmingly high as well, especially among the Miskito people in the east who wish to Sacasa in power.\n\nSacasa has been left with two choices, trying to secure the eastern countryside and setup a base of resistance from there, or move to the capital immediately in an attempt to secure the presidency for himself. Either could work, but his choice turns out to be..."
nic.69.small:0 "Sacasa has begun to organize a mercenary army of disgruntled former Guardia Nacional members and veterans of the army before the occupation who dislike the new system of government. So far Sacasa's support among the people has been moderate, while only securing major support from small section of people in the west and capital, and his eastern support being almost non-existent..\n\nSacasa has been left with two choices, trying to secure the eastern countryside and setup a base of resistance from there, or move to the capital immediately in an attempt to secure the presidency for himself. Either could work, but his choice turns out to be..."
nic.69.a:0 "Sacasa moves to secure the eastern countryside."
nic.69.b:0 "Sacasa heads straight for the capital."

nic.70.t:0 "Sacasa's Failure"
nic.70.d:0 "Despite his almost non-existent support of people in the east, Sacasa's first objective was to secure the majority of the eastern countryside for himself. As most expected, this did not turn out as planned at all for him. His already small band of forces were fiercely resisted by the people and his army quickly became demoralized. Having enough of this, his army turned on him, forcing him to take his few still loyal soldiers and retreat to Costa Rica. His leftover legacy has been destroyed roads and railways in the already hardly industrialized east caused by the sheer chaos of the event."
nic.70.a:0 "Foolish move on his part."

nic.71.t:0 "East Versus West"
nic.71.d:0 "As Sacasa moved through the countryside, he managed to gain support from a decent amount of villages who held disdain for Sandino. The main point of trouble was towards the Moreno supporting villages who resisted significantly, but were handled properly. Nicaragua has effectively been split east and west, with minor conflicts near the capital. The people on both sides are beginning to get restless. It will only take one spark in either side for the sides to completely turn."
nic.71.a:0 "Tensions explode in the west! The people defect to Sacasa."
nic.71.b:0 "Unrest in the east explodes! Mercenaries rebel and Sacasa is defeated."

nic.72.t:0 "Clash at the Capital"
nic.72.big:0 "Sacasa's move to charge straight towards the capital has seen enormous success, having people rallying in the streets, calling the socialists 'Traitors to the revolution' and multiple people within the army defecting. By the time he reached the capital, many were protesting outside the building claiming that 'Honduras would be free if it wouldn't be for the socialists'. Seeing how the tides were changing before Sacasa even arrived, both Moreno and Sandino have both left the country before things escalated into violence against them and others. No one knows where they have went, only that they still remain within Central America itself, most likely in a country accepting of them, waiting for their chance to return."
nic.72.small:0 "Sacasa's advance has quickly become contested with the streets of the capital being littered with brawling between Sacasa's few liberal supporters and socialist supporters within the capital. Many predict that Sacasa is not going to be coming out on top here due to lower overall support in the country and the slow belittlement of his troops, but tides in the capital could change."
nic.72.a:0 "The liberals take charge!"
nic.72.b:0 "Sacasa is expelled from the country."

nic.73.t:0 "New Elections"
nic.73.moreno:0 "Today Moreno has announced new elections following the shakeup of the Liberal split, with the only parties actually managing to prove themselves capable of winning the elections turning out to be Frente de Soberanía Nacional and the Partido Campesino de Nicaragua, both led by prominent socialists. Some have sited this as Sacasa's fear of a socialist democracy coming true."
nic.73.sandino:0 "Today Sandino has announced new elections following the shakeup of the Liberal split, with the only parties actually managing to prove themselves capable of winning the elections turning out to be Frente de Soberanía Nacional and the Partido Campesino de Nicaragua, both led by prominent socialists. Some have sited this as Sacasa's fear of a socialist democracy coming true"
nic.73.a:0 "It will be a intense race."

nic.74.t:0 "Liberals Move Towards Moreno"
nic.74.d:0 "While many of the previous Sacasa supporters have adopted boycotting the election in response to the previous expulsion of Sacasa, some of the middle class supporters of his have slowly begun to drift towards Moreno coming these elections. This has provided Moreno with a significant boost in general approval towards the populace, increasing his chance of winning the election."
nic.74.a:0 "An interesting turn."

nic.75.t:0 "Massive Sandinistas Rally"
nic.75.d:0 "Seemingly as a direct response to Moreno's liberal drift, Sandino has directly collaborated with the Sandinistas in order to organize a rally. The rally paraded throughout the streets of Matagalpa, with festivities for everyone. This has helped turn around the situation for Sandino, with many seeing the election being highly contested between the two."
nic.75.a:0 "Sandinistas sure have changed."

nic.76.t:0 "The [GETYEAR] Election"
nic.76.d:0 "This year’s elections have finally come, with Sandino and Moreno going head to head against each other, with Sandino having a broad base of support and Moreno managing to attract some of the former liberals to see his cause in a new light. Victory could be anyone’s guess, but it turns out to be..."
nic.76.a:0 "The Frente de Soberanía Nacional comes on top!"
nic.76.b:0 "The Partido Campesino de Nicaragua slides into victory!"

nic.77.t:0 "The [GETYEAR] Election"
nic.77.d:0 "Following Sandino's single handed liberation of the capital and country, these new elections Sandino announced were just as anti-climactic as many expected from it. With the only real party being the Frente de Soberanía Nacional, Sandino crushingly won the election as expected. While people are happy to be free from the influence of others many are thinking, is this the beginning of a new dictatorship?"
nic.77.a:0 "Predictably, Sandino comes out on top."

nic.78.t:0 "Nicaragua Needs Assistance"
nic.78.d:0 "Nicaragua in preparation for the final liberation of the rest of Central America has requested a shipment of guns from us. If Nicaragua and the other socialists do manage to come on top, it could bring great benefits to the socialist cause through cash crops and other resources."
nic.78.a:0 "Send them what they need."
nic.78.b:0 "We have our own conflict to worry about."

nic.79.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sends their Support"
nic.79.d:0 "Thankfully, [From.GetNameDef] has sent their full support towards our cause. These weapons will prove extremely useful in the liberation of the rest of Central America."
nic.79.a:0 "We thank them."

nic.80.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Support"
nic.80.d:0 "Worried about an upcoming conflict with the Germans, [From.GetNameDefCap] has decided against giving us the weapons we require. We'll have to fend on our own, but of course we'll still come out on top in the end."
nic.80.a:0 "A shame."

nic.81.t:0 "Yank's Training Regimen"
nic.81.d:0 "At the request of both Sandino and Moreno to further professionalize the army, Yank Levy, known guerrilla fighter who has assisted us for over 4 years now has begun to lead training in the army. Teaching them all about guerrilla warfare and how to defend themselves in the deep jungles, it has set the army down a new road to help us into the future. This is something we'll need to promote more in the future."
nic.81.a:0 "We wish him luck!"

nic.100.t:0 "Tegucigalpa Falls"
nic.100.d:0 "Tegucigalpa has officially fallen to the advancing Nicaraguan forces. We have put up a stiff resistance in our beautiful capital city, however we have no choice but to evacuate. Our government is split on where to evacuate to though. Some say that the war is lost and that we should flee abroad, while others wish to continue the resistance in San Pedro Sula. If we evacuate abroad, we surrender our nation to the Nicaraguans. If we stay in San Pedro Sula, we risk having the entire country occupied. What does the government choose?"
nic.100.a:0 "The government abandons the country."
nic.100.b:0 "The government retreats to San Pedro Sula."

nic.101.t:0 "The Country Falls"
nic.101.d:0 "Our army has fought bravely against the Nicaraguan invasion. We have resisted their superior military forces for as long as we could. However, we couldn't hold out forever. Most of our nation is now under Nicaraguan military occupation and our armed forces are about to collapse. Before it would have been too late, our government has decided to flee to Guatemala, to return once our nation is liberated, while others have retreated to El Salvador. Now that our nation stands without any leadership, Nicaragua has achieved their goal of bringing the revolution to Honduras."
nic.101.a:0 "Long live the revolution!"

nic.102.t:0 "Honduras has been Taken"
nic.102.d:0 "Honduras has been forced to surrender by our forces, with their government and the exiled military dispersing to our countries across Central America. Obviously directly occupying the country will cause problems diplomatically with other Central America nations, but it would also result in a hate growing towards our government. We shall liberate our comrades in the revolution for a better Central America, and more so a better Honduras."
nic.102.a:0 "Our first of many victories."

nic.103.t:0 "Honduras Falls"
nic.103.d:0 "The Honduran government has officially begun to retreat from Honduras into neighbouring Guatemala. This also comes with the regret that the leftovers of the Guardia Nacional have also escaped in El Salvador, leaving our eternal enemy alive for a while longer. While we are unable to catch them now, this spells a great victory for us and the revolution. The fall of Honduras is but a stepping stone in achieving our goals of liberating Central America from American imperialism."
nic.103.a:0 "A true victory!"

nic.104.t:0 "Our Doom"
nic.104.d:0 "Our government is at its wits end. Us managing to begin losing in the war has caused great divides within the revolutionary cabinet, with Sacasa already having fled to Mexico and Moreno beginning to fall back into his drinking habit. The faith of the people and even other socialist nations have begun to take a deep dive. While the government's ability to function seemed to be barely making it yesterday, it seems the end is near.\n\nSeeing the downhill battle this has turned out to be, Sandino has taken it upon himself to resist the oncoming hordes. Similar to the events almost a decade ago, Sandino has taken a small section of the military and retreated south to continue the fight there. Seeing the chaos, the previously exiled military has secured the capital for themselves and constructed a new government, with all the former government officials retreating abroad, waiting for their next chance."
nic.104.a:0 "It's 1927 all over again!"

nic.105.t:0 "Nicaragua has Fallen"
nic.105.d:0 "News has recently broken out from Nicaragua. Ever since we had begun to gain the advantage in the war against them, in-fighting among the Nicaraguan government has begun to increase. This reached a boiling point yesterday when Sandino officially left Nicaragua and fled to the south, intending to continue resistance himself there. The exiled military within our country has already occupied the capital, and setup a government in the area. Of course, resistance within Nicaragua is... stiff to say the least against the new government, which means we'll have to keep a close eye on how the situation there unfolds until they can stand on their own two feet."
nic.105.a:0 "Victory has come."

nic.106.t:0 "The Occupation of Nicaragua"
nic.106.d:0 "The war against Nicaragua has seemed to have gone better than we could have ever imagined. We have managed to occupy their entire country, allowing us to put the Guardia Nacional back in control of the country. However, in the south Sandino has begun to stage his own resistance against the government with a small band of soldiers. While he doesn't present any immediate threats, we'll have to be careful and hope the new Nicaraguan government will deal with him soon. Until then, we'll need to keep a watchful eye on the situation until everyone in Nicaragua calms."
nic.106.a:0 "The first of many victories."

nic.108.t:0 "Patrol Raided"
nic.108.d:0 "A patrol in the south of the country made of a small regiment of 300 men has apparently been raided by Sandino's troops. The total amount of loses so far is unknown as the clash is still going on, however it is predicted to be a bloody battle with heavy losses on both sides. We'll need to hope and pray that the entire patrol won't be destroyed during the raid, but it will all depend on the performance of the troops."
nic.108.a:0 "Hopefully the patrol survived..."

nic.109.t:0 "Industry Damaged"
nic.109.d:0 "Reports have sprung up from both the south and west that the Sandinistas have begun to raid multiple locations across the country. We are still gathering the exact information of what was damaged, but there is a high likelihood that the transportation systems were damaged, with also small reports of civilian and military industry being hurt by these raids as well. We'll have to see the overall damage once a full report is made on the incident."
nic.109.a:0 "Where is that report?"

nic.110.t:0 "Strikes Across the Nation"
nic.110.d:0 "Sandino's resistance has begun to inspire many, with strikes beginning to sweep across the nation as a result. Many have begun to proclaim themselves 'Sandinistas' as well and openly resisted the need to work for the state. Due to our high military presence, we could easily send our troops nation-wide to crush them before they get popular, or we could let the strikes pass to possibly create a small amount of sympathy for the government."
nic.110.a:0 "Damn it all, send the Guardia."
nic.110.b:0 "Let them resist."

nic.111.t:0 "Protests in the Capital"
nic.111.d:0 "Tensions have exploded today in the capital as a small group of protesters made up of 5 people were shot by the Guardia Nacional, against the wishes of their general. This has erupted into increased resistance against the government, with many leaving their work in the capital to protest the ruling government. This has brought an overall decrease to the already low popularity of our government."
nic.111.a:0 "Things really aren't going our way."

nic.112.t:0 "Gun Storage Raided"
nic.112.d:0 "One of our many storages for weapons has been raided today by Sandino and his Sandinistas. Despite the Guardia's best efforts to catch them before they could escape, they managed to slip through with only 2 of their men dying. The group is now busy checking the number of guns that were managed to be lost, but it is predicted to not be much. But predictions could always be wrong..."
nic.112.a:0 "Better not be too much."

nic.113.t:0 "The Resistance Rises in Popularity"
nic.113.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, Sandino's southern resistance has begun to grow across the nation, especially in the east of the country. Day by day, more take to the streets against what they claim is a government not by Nicaraguans. The government is beginning to worry that we can only hold our position in power by sending our men for so long, and that a popular revolution might be inevitable. Of course, it's our job this doesn't happen and to keep the country safe from the clutches of Syndicalism."
nic.113.a:0 "Further suppression is required!"

nic.114.t:0 "Sandino's Resistance Shrinks"
nic.114.d:0 "Due to our efforts, Sandino's resistance against the ruling government has temporarily been halted. Our successful manoeuvring and superior firepower compared to the dastardly rebels has managed to slowly overwhelm them, shrinking the people's support of him nation-wide as they begin to feel that they are supporting a lost cause. If we keep this up, we could see a complete halt to Sandino's resistance soon enough."
nic.114.a:0 "Forward, to victory!"

nic.115.t:0 "Crushing the Resistance"
nic.115.d:0 "Sandino's fierce resistance in the south is something that must be dealt with immediately before it spreads across the entire nation, overwhelming our country. However, certain figures within the government have begun to debate over just how far we should go. Some believe that suppressing too far will just end up with more flocking over to Sandino's cause, while some believe that not pushing far enough will make people begin to see weakness in the government. This is a delicate issue that will need to be treaded carefully if we want to see the end to the unrest plaguing the country."
nic.115.a:0 "Light suppression should get the job done."
nic.115.b:0 "A moderate amount will do the trick."
nic.115.c:0 "Go big or go home, total Guardia watch."

nic.116.t:0 "Nicaragua Requires Guns"
nic.116.d:0 "The provisional government within Nicaragua has officially begun to make moves against the Sandinistas in the south of their country. However, the overall suppression of these movements has required more guns and equipment than expected, and they have petitioned us to give them supplies to secure their country from the threat of Socialism. Not sending the supplies could result in the worse for our and their country if we're not careful, so it would be wise to listen to their request."
nic.116.a:0 "Crushing the resistance is necessary."
nic.116.b:0 "That is no affair of ours."

nic.117.t:0 "[OVERLORD.GetNameDefCap] Delivered Supplies"
nic.117.d:0 "Thankfully, [OVERLORD.GetNameDefCap] has sent supplies just like we asked. It's an overall amount of 500 guns, with should be more than enough to crush the rebellious scum plaguing our country and people. The news of the shipment arriving in the first place has made Sandino see a drop in support, as his troops become demoralized over our superior manpower and weaponry."
nic.117.a:0 "More to crush the revolutionaries."

nic.118.t:0 "[OVERLORD.GetNameDefCap] has Refused"
nic.118.d:0 "It seems [OVERLORD.GetNameDefCap] has refused our request for equipment to help suppress Sandino and his revolutionaries. Their official reasoning is that they think we are more than capable of fighting them off by our lonesome, and that further assistance won't be necessary. Of course, we'll see how correct their assumption is in the future depending on how the future plays out."
nic.118.a:0 "We'll continue the fight on our own."

nic.guardia.t:0 "Positioning the Guardia"
nic.guardia.d:0 "The Guardia Nacional created by Somoza himself has officially been recreated after it's destruction in 1932. Currently composed of 3000 Nicaraguans, they stand ready to serve the nation and defend it from the threat of Sandino and his traitors, the people who wish to destroy our great nation. However, where we will position them to deal with traitors is another question. The people in the east are known to be somewhat upset over our regime, while Sandino's rebels still rage on in the south. One of the more popular suggestions have been to position them in the capital to keep the recent protests and strikes down, which could lower Sandino's overall support."
nic.guardia.a:0 "Send them straight to Sandino."
nic.guardia.b:0 "Have them patrol the west."
nic.guardia.c:0 "They should control resistance in the capital."

nic.119.t:0 "The Guardia Fails"
nic.119.d:0 "Our decision to deploy the Guardia and send them straight after Sandino has proven to be a terrible idea. Due to its relatively new nature, the experienced Guerilla fighters of Sandino has superiority in the forest and jungles against our force. 200 of our men were killed before we knew it, forcing them to retreat before further losses were taken. This failure on our part has caused support for Sandino to rise across the country, leading to further chaos."
nic.119.a:0 "Curses!"

nic.120.t:0 "The Capital Remains Silent"
nic.120.d:0 "Everything is quiet for the capital and its people. While we faced initial resistance against the position of the Guardia there, it quickly died down as they learned what would happen if they resisted against us. The general atmosphere of the capital has made those outside of it fear what would happen if they resist, causing Sandino's support to die down."
nic.120.a:0 "A victory for us."

nic.121.t:0 "Sandino Marches North!"
nic.121.d:0 "Today Sandino has announced his official liberation of the capital, intending to finally put an end to the Guardia's rule over Nicaragua once and for all. Him and his band of initially 1000 soldiers have begun rapidly moving north, but the dodgy terrain and resistance by some has slowed down their advance. Some are predicting this is going to gain immediate traction among the people, with many flooding to his cause as a result, but we will have to wait and see. All that can be known is that Nicaragua's future is now on the line."
nic.121.a:0 "We must win at all costs!"

nic.123.t:0 "Sandino's Liberation"
nic.123.d:0 "Sandino's troops arrived at the capital today with more men then we could have ever imagined. Immediate blockades were setup on all the streets to defend the capital, with the Guardia positioned to defeat any that marched against us. However, the fierceness of Sandino's troops were severely underestimated.\n\nWhat started out as one minor insurrection turned quickly into outright revolt within the Guardia. Every minute, troops were turning against their generals and who they once considered friends to bring support to Sandino's cause and allow him a position to advance. By then we had already lost the hope of the people within the capital, who quickly joined the Guardia traitors in tearing down the barricade. Somoza quickly evacuated the capital with those few who were still loyal to him back into Honduras."
nic.123.a:0 "Back and better than ever!"

nic.124.t:0 "Sandino's 'Liberation'"
nic.124.d:0 "Sandino's troops arrived at the capital today with less men than expected. Immediate blockades were setup on all of the streets to defend the capital, with the Guardia positioned to defeat any that marched against us. Many saw first-hand just how far Sandino's fervor and the size of his army fell on the way to Matagalpa.\n\nSandino's band of a mere 300 soldiers, only 100 equipped with guns began to charge the barricade. Many described the sight as 'somewhat depressing' with Sandino's men slowly being mowed down and the few soldiers with guns killed. Sandino quickly escaped following this, seemingly embarrassed over the failure of his push. Rebel movements have begun to largely calm down all over the country, with Sandino reported being seen in Costa Rica, but none have confirmed this rumor."
nic.124.a:0 "The traitor has fallen far."

nic.125.t:0 "Sandino's Liberation"
nic.125.d:0 "Sandino's troops arrived at the capital today with about as many troops as we expected. Immediate blockades were setup on all the streets to defend the capital, with the Guardia positioned to defeat any that marched against us. However, the fierceness of Sandino's troops were not to be underestimated.\n\nWhile Sandino's regiments began to charge immediately at the barricades that were setup, they quickly saw the futility in this and a staunch defensive began to take place on both sides. For five hours, both sides have begun to go grow weary of the continuous standoff, until a change occurred. A soldier in the Guardia began to defect while others began to follow suit. While the defections aren't much now, they could grow out of control if not handled correctly..."
nic.125.a:0 "The Guardia holds the line!"
nic.125.b:0 "More troops defect and Sandino breaks through!"

nic.126.t:0 "Nicaragua Falls to Revolution!"
nic.126.d:0 "News has just broken out of Nicaragua and reached our doorstep by Somoza himself! It seems Sandino's resistance has managed to come back to power through popular support and a push on the capital. Many people have begun to argue within the government on over how exactly this was led to happen, some blaming a lack of action in the region while others blame the incompetence of Somoza and the Guardia Nacional. What matter now however is our next move. Somoza is begging us to interfere while they're weak, but we are already exhausted from the last war. Is that a move we can afford to make?"
nic.126.a:0 "They can't get away with this!"
nic.126.b:0 "We don't have the strength for another war."

nic.127.t:0 "Honduras Retaliates!"
nic.127.d:0 "It seems Somoza and the leftovers of the Guardia have managed to convince the Hondurans to come back to invade our nation once again. Even though we are severely unprepared for full-on war, it seems the Hondurans will not be backing down this time. We'll have to resist to the end if we wish to survive against them and the enemies to the revolution."
nic.127.a:0 "For the revolution!"

nic.128.t:0 "Honduras Remains Quiet"
nic.128.d:0 "It seems the 2nd time exiles of the Guardia Nacional have failed to convince the Hondurans that they should make an effort to invade our country for a second time. This will leave us with sufficient time to recover from the brutal year before this and prepare the full liberation of Central America once again."
nic.128.a:0 "Another victory for the revolution."

nic.129.t:0 "Nicaragua Asserts its Independence"
nic.129.d:0 "With the Guardia Nacional making its final moves in crushing the remaining Sandinistas and exiling them from the country, their reliance on us has been very diminishing at a quick rate. As a result, today Somoza has announced Nicaragua's official independence from Honduras, declaring the Sandinistas completely dealt with, while establishing his thanks to Honduras for our assistance in their efforts."
nic.129.a:0 "They grow up so fast."

nic.130.t:0 "The Second Nicaraguan Occupation"
nic.130.d:0 "After a second war with Nicaragua, we've managed to beat Sandino and his underlings back, with the leftovers of his government retreating to a fellow socialist country, most likely plotting his eventual return. Somoza has been positioned in the capital for a second time, with our own army having an increased watch on the region to ensure this never happens again."
nic.130.a:0 "The Guardia is back again..."

nic.131.t:0 "The Occupation of Honduras"
nic.131.d:0 "In what many see as a miracle, not only have we managed to take complete control over our country once again, we've managed to completely beat back Honduras despite all odds being against us. A new Socialist government has been put in place to replace the old, decrepit one before it. To many, this has been seen as a complete comeback for the revolution in Central America internationally."
nic.131.a:0 "A truly legendary victory."

nic.132.t:0 "The Liberal Betrayal"
nic.132.d:0 "As the capital Managua fell not long ago to the marching liberal forces of Honduras, Sacasa quickly took the chance to defect to the Hondurans and lead a new government in Managua. Sandino and Moreno immediately cursed him, but it was far too late. Soon after, the military began to let down their arms and defect to Sacasa, with Moreno and Sandino fleeing south to Costa Rica, awaiting the day that they can return and the spread of the revolution to Central America."
nic.132.a:0 "A new step for the republic."

nic.133.t:0 "The Occupation of Nicaragua"
nic.133.d:0 "We've managed to take the Nicaraguan capital of Managua from the invaders. A man who was previously denied the presidency, Juan Bautista Sacasa has defected from their revolutionary republic and joined us, offering to serve as president until the region could be stabilized. We have little other choice then to accept his offer, as we lack many other collaborators since the expulsion of their previous military and the fact that a Honduran leader would be highly unpopular."
nic.133.a:0 "One down for a new Central America."

nic.134.t:0 "A Transition in Nicaragua"
nic.134.d:0 "As we marched into the Nicaraguan capital of Managua, a liberal candidate in Nicaragua who was denied the presidency known as Juan Bautista Sacasa quickly took the chance to defect to our side and lead a new government in Managua. Sandino and Moreno immediately cursed him, but it was far too late. Soon after, the Nicaraguan military began to let down their arms and defect to Sacasa, with Moreno and Sandino fleeing south to Costa Rica, awaiting the day that they can return and the spread of the revolution to Central America. The war is over now, with a friendly Nicaragua now bordering us to the south."
nic.134.a:0 "A step towards peace."

nic.135.t:0 "The Socialist Betrayal"
nic.135.d:0 "As the capital Managua fell not long ago to the marching socialist forces of Honduras, Sandino and Moreno quickly took the chance to defect to the Hondurans and lead a new government in Managua. Sacasa immediately cursed him, but it was far too late for the tides to turn. Soon after, the military began to let down their arms and defect to Sandino and the Sandinistas, with Sacasa fleeing south to Costa Rica, awaiting the day that they can return and the spread of liberalism to the rest of Central America."
nic.135.a:0 "A necessary step for the revolution."

nic.136.t:0 "The Liberation of Honduras"
nic.136.d:0 "We've managed to take the Nicaraguan capital of Managua from the invaders who threatened the ideals of socialism. Sandino, known as the 'Saviour of Central America' managed to be denied the presidency in 1936, leaving him waiting to re secure his position and expel the liberals. He's offered to become the new president until the region can be stabilized, and we have little reason to disapprove as we know he'll be friendly towards us and has a sense of legitimacy to the Nicaraguan people compared to a local Honduran leader."
nic.136.a:0 "Another for the revolution!"

nic.137.t:0 "A Transition in Nicaragua"
nic.137.d:0 "As we marched into the Nicaraguan capital of Managua, the 'Saviour of Central America' Augustus Sandino officially defected to our side, claiming the Liberal Revolution to be dead and that socialism is needed for Nicaragua to prosper. He's already declared us allies in arms and established his government, leaving much of the military to defect to him in Nicaragua and Sacasa to retreat south to Costa Rica. Peace has officially been signed between both of our countries, leaving a sense of calm for both of our people."
nic.137.a:0 "Socialism always comes out in the end."

nic.1002.t:0 "A Front Against Radical Reds"
nic.1002.d:0 "Nicaragua is the main beacon of the Centroamerican radical red menace. We can’t afford to lose Central America to more of the same south of the border, but we don’t have the means or the men to take them out."

nic.1003.d.civwar:0 "As the 30-Day Deadline set by General Douglas MacArthur looms on the horizon, an interesting proposal has landed on the desk of the new acting leader of the crumbling United States of America. Coming from the rogue southern “President” [COR.getleader] and arriving at the White House this morning, the small and plain envelope contained a plea for assistance and the outline of a possible joint-operation that would benefit both potential successors to the Mantle of America. The document enclosed explained that the vile leftist Augusto Sandino and his Marxist revolutionaries have moved to take power in Nicaragua, former center of American influence in Central America. With this development noted, [COR.getleader] seeks to have his force’s work in unison with the American military, particularly with our Marine Corp, to both discreetly invade and topple the Sandinista Regime in Nicaragua and return American dominance to the region. By silently landing at the mouth of the Rio de Porto Gordo and sailing down the rapids to Managua, the marines would covertly and efficiently move to assassinate Sandino and topple his regime. Though we are rarely even on speaking terms with these Southern secessionists, the allure of crushing socialism’s hold wherever it may appear in the New World is far too great an opportunity to pass up. What shall be our official response: do we put aside our differences for the time being to save Central America from itself and the plague of socialism, or ignore these rebels and focus fully on the looming conflict?"

nicdec.1.d:0 "The moving of our troops into the eastern half of Nicaragua has caused mass celebration among the people, with bread being handed to the marching troops as they continue to liberate the countryside. The approval of our ruling government has also gone up massively due to this, with people calling us the 'True saviours of Nicaragua'."
nicdec.1.a:0 "A victory for all Nicaraguans!"

nicdec.2.t:0 "A New Issue"
nicdec.2.d:0 "While the initial liberation of the east went well, the actual process of liberating the people there from foreign influence has been much less successful. The United Fruit Company, despite it's rather steep decline, has hired mercenaries in Nicaragua to upset our nationalisation of their industries and land. The people have already begun to complain about them, and decisive action will need to be committed to soon if we wish to have the people's approval."

However, our army is still in its youth and as such, the operation has had its... jagged edges.\n\nA large amount of road-work was destroyed during the operation due to carelessness, while 22 people were killed in the crossfire of the actual operation."

nicdec.4.t:0 "The Mercenaries Accept the Bribe"
nicdec.4.d:0 "Luckily for us, the mercenaries accepted our generous bribe and have actually joined the army as reserves themselves. Unluckily for us, this is being largely seen as a sign of corruption within the government, with it being willing to bride its way out of any situation. While overall approval hasn't gone down much, it has put a bit of a bump in our reputation, which we will need to work to recover."
nicdec.4.a:0 "The problem was solved in the end."

nicdec.5.d:0 "Our plan to arm certain towns and villages with rifles worked, with most of the mercenary assaults being warded off as their numbers slowly dwindled until they officially surrendered today with only 27 men left in their ranks.

nicdec.7.t:0 "The Economy Weeps"
nicdec.7.d:0 "While we have been officially freed from the grips of the United Fruit Company, their absence has led to a rather noticeable hole of investments into the economy, with large swathes of land still being unkept, and several factories outright stopped in the west.

Some of the population in the west agrees with them as well, leaving us at a standstill on whether to continue the recruitment or abandon the project until later."

nicdec.16.d:0 "The conflict on the border with Honduras has managed to escalate into full-on war, largely ending the conflict in the west and extending it to the east as well.

The Commune of France would mainly be interested in seeing us be able to defend ourselves against the Americans should they ever become a threat, while the Union of Britain would most likely be interested in seeing our economy grow to increase our many exports. Who should we choose to ask for assistance from?"
nicind.3.a:0 "The Union of Britain would be reliable."

nicind.4.t:0 "Nicaragua is Looking for Investors"
nicind.4.d:0 "A fellow Socialist in Central America has begun to make itself known, and has specifically requested investment from us. Investing in their country would surely benefit us in the long run, as more allies against Germany is always better, but we may need to keep to ourselves to eventually face the German threat."

However, there are many partners within both Europe and America, like Canada to our north and Germany to our east. [GER.GetNameDefCap] would mainly be interested in seeing us be able to defend ourselves against other threats to defend their interests, while [CAN.GetNameDef] would most likely be interested in seeing our economy grow to increase our many exports. Who should we choose to ask for assistance from?"
nicind.5.a:0 "[CAN.GetNameDefCap] would be reliable."

nicind.6.t:0 "Nicaragua is Looking for Investors"
nicind.6.d:0 "A Central American country wishing to separate itself from the United States known as Nicaragua has begun to make itself known, and has specifically requested investment from us. Investing in their country would surely benefit us in the long run, as more ways to rake in profit is always better, but we may need to keep to ourselves to eventually face the Syndicalist threat."
nicind.6.a:0 "We'll offer them civilian industries."

nicind.10.t:0 "The Status-Quo Economy"
nicind.10.d:0 "Nicaragua has and always will be fully reliant on the whim of foreign powers, and it's a sad truth our country has begun to face. The Socialists before us had lofty ideals for the economy and self-preservation, but they too failed in the end. The absence of the United States has left a noticeable hole in our reliance, and new reliance on others will need to be made for our continued survival."

nicind.11.d:0 "Our recent occupation of Nicaragua has left them in a bit of an economic stump, which wasn't at all helped by their history of revolutions and removal of the United States from the picture. They've specifically asked us for economic assistance to rebuild. It's expected of us as the one occupying them to help them and their needs, but we have our own needs as well."

NIC_rebuild_academy:0 "Rebuilding the Academy"
NIC_rebuild_academy_desc:0 "Sandino's Revolutionary Guerrilla Army directly encouraged the people to forget advanced tactics and stick to fighting in the rough and dirty. We have higher standards then this, and this must be represented through a renovation of the academy itself."
NIC_ending_political_influence:0 "Ending Political Influence"
NIC_ending_political_influence_desc:0 "The military holding political influence is what caused the Guardia to be so felt during the United States occupation. To prevent this from ever happening again we will have to limit the military's involvement within state affairs."
NIC_resolving_high_command:0 "Resolving the High Command"
NIC_resolving_high_command_desc:0 "Our initial reorganisation of the military has left the high command struggling to adapt.

NIC_free_press:0 "Freeing the Press"
NIC_free_press_desc:0 "While the revolutionaries promised freedom, to those in the press, they brought anything but. The press was barred from most forms of dissent and while it was not subjected to the same degree of suppression as in other authoritarian and socialist states, it was nonetheless problematic.

NIC_religous_zeal:0 "Religious Zeal"
NIC_religous_zeal_desc:0 "Socialism must paradoxically be understood and practiced with a zeal comparable to that of a religious fanatic to be truly sensible. We must target our propaganda carefully to promote such an ethos among the people."
NIC_military_budgets:0 "Moving the Military Budget"

NIC_arming_militias:0 "Arming the Militias"
NIC_arming_militias_desc:0 "Our largely militia-based army is in constant need of weaponry, and our country is lacking in that department. As leftovers from the American occupation run low, we'll have to rely on the Sandinistas to scavenge for more to use."

NIC_new_industries:0 "The New Market"
NIC_new_industries_desc:0 "With the lingering economic legacy of the American-imposed plantation economy dealt with, a plethora of alternative agricultural products are proliferating rapidly.

NIC_food_distribution:0 "Agrarian Reform"

NIC_banana_desc:0 "Thanks to the exploitative practices of the past, much like some American slapstick cartoon, the residual effects of the banana has left our nation flat on its behind. A large portion of our agriculture is still based on the banana, and while some would suggest abandoning the crop entirely, we know better. We should further invest into the intensive production of this tasty fruit while ensuring that its cultivation benefits our nation."
NIC_appeasment_economy:0 "Keep the Status Quo"
NIC_appeasment_economy_desc:0 "There is nothing wrong with the current system! In exchange for tax breaks and plantation privileges, the foreign investors improve our infrastructure and aid the development of our nation. If anything, we should work more closely with these beneficial interests."

NIC_rely_overlord_desc:0 "Sandino's revolutionary regime has severely reduced foreign investment in our nation, particularly in the all-important agricultural sector.

NIC_foreign_reliance:0 "Foreign Reliance"
NIC_foreign_reliance_desc:0 "Exports beget a reliance on foreign powers, and with foreign powers we aren't talking about Honduras. Our largest trade partners are the global superpowers, be it the US, Germany or even Japan.

NIC_central_university:0 "Create the Central Nicaragua University"
NIC_central_university_desc:0 "Our economy has strengthened, and our budget can now finally support the construction and maintenance of a proper, Nicaraguan university.

ARMY_NIC_AUGUSTO_CESAR_SANDINO_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 18, 1895, in Niquinohomo, Nicaragua.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Augusto Nicolás Calderón Sandino lacks any formal sort of military training, but his exploits throughout his life have made him a legendary figure in Nicaragua and Central America as whole. First, he tried to join the Guerra Constitucionalista on the side of the liberals, but Jose Maria Moncada, Chief of the Nicaraguan Atlantic Liberal Army at the time, refused to allow Sandino to serve. Sandino then gathered a group that came to be known as the 'Montañeses' and successfully attacked El Jícaro in November 1926. This victory granted him great renown and he was finally accepted by the Liberals, and would go on to become one of the national figures of the uprising. However, the Liberal victory in the war was short-lived, and with Moncada's betrayal, Sandino took up arms once again, this time leading a 300 men strong regiment in the south. The constant skirmishes since then and Yank Levy's technical support have greatly improved his military ability, and right now stands as one of the most experienced fighters in Nicaragua\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Leader of the Frente de Soberanía Nacional."
ARMY_NIC_YANK_LEVY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 5, 1897, in Hamilton, Canada.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Bert 'Yank' Levy joined the 39th Battalion of the Canadian Royal Fusiliers to fight in Palestine and Transjordan, where he became an expert machine gunner and got acquainted with Guerrilla Warfare thanks to several meetings with T.E. Lawrence's scouts. He would later become involved in the last stages of the Mexican Revolution, and would join up with Sandino's forces during the Guerra Constitucionalista, sticking with Sandino since then as the British Revolution and subsequent red scare in Canada have turned him into persona-non-grata in his home country. He has since then assisted Sandino, helping him and his recruits to learn the ways of guerrilla warfare."
ARMY_NIC_FRANCISCO_SEQUEIRA_MORENO_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 27, 1903, in Somotillo, Nicaragua.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Despite not having any form of military training, Sequeira took part in the Guerra Constitucionalista. He first was forced to join the conservative army fighting the liberals, where he displayed some talent to lead troops into combat, but after refusing to take part in the execution of civilians, he escaped to the liberal forces. In the liberals, he became the leader of the Columna Occidental, and quickly opposed Moncada after the Liberal victory when he asked for disarmament of the liberal forces. He has since then opposed the American occupation of Nicaragua, and after linking up with Sandino's forces, managed to hold out in the south while Sandino gathered support in Mexico and then took part in the offensive to take part in the Western part of the country.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Leader of the Partido Campesino de Nicaragua."
ARMY_NIC_ABELARDO_CUADRA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Circa 1904, in Granada, Nicaragua.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Abelardo started to study to become a lawyer when the Guerra Constitucionalista started. He volunteered to join the Conservative forces and was under the command of Carlos Chamorro, the brother of Emiliano, and later of General Adán Vélez. However, the young soldier was only fighting for profit, and when assisting the party proved to be an unprofitable endeavour, he joined the Guardia Nacional and became a teacher in the Military Academy of Nicaragua. He was later recalled by the American intervention troops to assist them against Sandino, and he has since then become a well-known mercenary in the region."
ARMY_NIC_EMILIANO_CHAMORRO_VARGAS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 11, Acoyapa, Nicaragua.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Emiliano Chamorro Vargas never really received formal militar instruction, however this politician became General during the Guerra Constitucionalista against the Liberal forces. Despite his defeat at the Constutionalist war, Chamorro has improved his organisational skills with time, and while he has still a long way to go from becoming a hardened officer, he's still a reliable commander in battle.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Leader of the Conservative Party of Nicaragua."

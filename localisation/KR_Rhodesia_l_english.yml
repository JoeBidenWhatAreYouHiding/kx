### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_GLESSING_DESC:0 "Born in St. Petersburg, Russia in just 1914, Gottfried Lessing was merely a boy when he experienced the Bolshevik revolution, yet even with the cause ending in fiery failure before Lessing was able to participate that would not stop Bolshevism and Communism from formulating the foundations of Lessing's future dive into politics. A few years after the Bolshevik's defeat in the Russian Intervention, Lessing - now a young man and would-be firebrand - moved to Germany where he attempted to spread the ideology of Lenin and incite a workers revolt. Failing in this goal, Lessing was eventually chased out of Germany in 1935 by the Geheimpolizei, forcing him to seek refuge in the Union of Britain, though the Anglos denied him entry on account of his support for Bolshevik groups within the UoB. Chased out of a nation once again, Lessing fled Europe and began a journey that eventually lead him to the jungles of Rhodesia where he attempted to set up a Marxist-Leninist Society among the native population in a remote village outside Harare while organizing his own political group - the Southern Rhodesia Communist Party - alongside his ally, the Zimbabwean writer and anthropologist Lawrence Vambe, and his lover and political partner, the famed British author Doris May Lessing."
POLITICS_DORISLESSING_DESC:0 "Doris was born in Kermanshah, Iran, on 22 October 1919, to Captain Alfred Tayler and Emily Maude Tayler, both British subjects. Her father, who had lost a leg during his service in the Weltkrieg, met his future wife, a nurse, at the Royal Free Hospital in London where he was recovering from his amputation. The couple would leave Britain after the revolution and go to Iran, for Alfred to take a job as a clerk for the Imperial Bank of Persia. In 1925, the family moved to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. As a girl Doris was educated first at the Dominican Convent High School, a Roman Catholic convent all-girls school in the Southern Rhodesian capital of Salisbury. She left school at age 13 and was self-educated from then on. She left home at 15 and worked as a nursemaid. She started reading material that her employer gave her on politics and sociology and began writing around this time. In 1937, Doris moved to London in the Union of Britain to pursue her writing career and socialist beliefs. She only just returned to her home of Rhodesia after it was liberated by the proletariat and its chains were broken, and now works alongside her lover - the famed Russian exile and Communist activist Gottfried Lessing - to bring moderated and socially-enlightened Leftist thought to Africa fused with her own beliefs on Sufism, Feminism, Scepticism, and Modernism/Post-Modernism."
POLITICS_GARFIELD_DESC:0 "Todd was born in Invercargill, New Zealand, in 1908. Todd emigrated to Southern Rhodesia from New Zealand in 1934 as a Protestant missionary and ran the Dadaya New Zealand Churches of Christ Mission school. Todd plans to introduce modest reforms aimed at improving the education of the black majority by taking tax-money paid by Rhodesian property owners and appropriations from the British colonial authorities, and directing it toward black schools. He has also devised a plan to give elementary education to every African of school age. Todd previously pushed a bill through the Legislative Assembly that would allow for multiracial trade unions in order to undercut the growing white nationalist influence in the unions."
POLITICS_HUGGINS_DESC:0 "Huggins was born in Bexley in north Kent, England on the 6th of July, 1883. After practising medicine and training as a surgeon in London, Huggins travelled to Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia in 1911 to act as a locum to some doctors there. He would return to the UK in late 1914 following the outbreak of war and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps with the rank of Captain, stationed at Colchester Hospital which had become a casualty clearing station. Although he wanted to go to France he was sent to Malta where he dealt with incoming casualties from the Battle of Gallipoli. He returned to Southern Rhodesia at the end of the war and bought Craig Farm on the outskirts of Salisbury. He began again as a surgeon, quickly becoming the best known in Rhodesia. Though he was on the side of union with South Africa when there was a referendum on the matter, he has since accepted the Rhodesian decision to 'go it alone.'"
POLITICS_BOMBER_DESC:0 "Harris was born on 13 April 1892, at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where his parents were staying while his father George Travers Harris was on home leave from the Indian Civil Service. With his father in India most of the time, Harris grew up without a sense of solid roots and belonging. Harris was educated at Allhallows School in Devon. A former Allhallows student, the actor Arthur Chudleigh often visited the school and gave the boys free tickets to his shows. Harris received such a ticket in 1909, and went to see the play during his summer holidays. The lead character in the show was a Rhodesian farmer who returned to England to wed, but ultimately fell out with his pompous fiancée and married the more practical housemaid instead. The idea of a country where one was judged on ability rather than class was very inspiring to the adventurous Harris, who promptly told his father that he intended to emigrate to Southern Rhodesia instead of going back to Allhallows for the new term and would arrive in Rhodesia in 1910. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Harris did not learn of it for nearly a month, being out in the bush at the time. Despite his previous reluctance to follow the path his father had had in mind for him in the army, and his desire to set up his own ranch in Rhodesia, Harris felt patriotically compelled to join the war effort. In October 1915, after unsuccessfully attempting to find a position in first the cavalry, then the Royal Artillery, Harris joined the Royal Flying Corps and would learn to fly later that year. Harris remained in the newly formed Royal Air Force following the end of the First World War, but would return to Rhodesia after the defeat of the government by the syndicalist forces."
POLITICS_FIELD_DESC:0 "Winston Field was born on 13 April 1892, in Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, England. He would move to Southern Rhodesia in the 20's and become a tobacco farmer. After the fall of Britain to Syndicalisim, he became a committed anti-syndicalist and a powerful voice in the British-dominated areas of the Federation, namely Rhodesia. Now he has been elected to lead Rhodesia through her first of many challenges, unto the bright and early dawn."
POLITICS_BADEN_DESC:0 "Baden-Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell at 6 Stanhope Street, Paddington in London, on 22 February 1857. After having been educated at Charterhouse School in Surrey, Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, Baden-Powell successfully defended the town in the Siege of Mafeking. During the final year Weltkreig Powell was appointed supreme commander of British Africa in order to boost failing British Morale. After the war's end he was offered a role in both the Canadian and South African militaries witch he turned down in favor of retirement in German occupied Rhodesia from where he coordinated with many nations in order to promulgate the Boy Scouts program. Powell Despises Syndicalisits for destroying his beloved Empire, and has been called to lead a free, British Rhodesia in this hour of need. With the hero of the Matabele war on their side Rhodesians are ready to reclaim lost glory."
POLITICS_BURKE_DESC:0 "There is something almost tragic about the life of Desmond Lardner-Burke, it's probably why he's such an intractable individual today. Born in the Cape of Good Hope in 1909, young Burke aspired to be a lawyer but fate wouldn't have it that way. Burke was only a young boy when word returned home that many of his brothers were slaughtered by the German Imperial Forces in East Africa, this set off a chain reaction that would come to define Burke for the rest of his life. When the empire collapsed in 1925, the legacy of Cecil Rhodes died with it, this fact coincided with the death of his brothers by German hands, fueled a furious anger inside Burke, one that would never cease. Burke became active in politics soon after and helped form a grand coalition of Pro-British and Far-Right factions dubbed the "Rhodesian Front", which would rise in popularity during the 20s and early 30s. Burke would be the face of this movement, becoming known as a young radical in a sea of old politicians, he would use this popularity to get several of his ideological points to the masses and subsequently entrench them in the Rhodesian Front. After allying with the United Federal Party and seizing power after the 1937 Constitutional election, Burke now resides over a nation as shattered and broken as he once was, but Burke will rebuild Rhodesia into his image and stand up to the Hunnic Menace, by any means necessary."
POLITICS_DAVIES_DESC:0 "Originally from Wales, Harry Davies moved to Southern Rhodesia in 1920 and became an estate agent in Bulawayo. Eventually getting involved in politics, Davies ran for the Southern Rhodesian Labour Party in Bulawayo District in the 1924 general election, but was not elected. After standing successfully in Bulawayo South in the 1928 election, he sat in the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly for 20 years. In 1929 he was elected leader of the Southern Rhodesian Labour Party, thereby becoming Leader of the Opposition, a post he held until 1936 when he toppled the UFP's mandate and ushered in the first Rhodesian Labour Government."
POLITICS_BARING_SANE_DESC:0 "A younger, more fiery Evelyn Baring once proclaimed that 'as long as Evelyn Baring lives and breathes, the sun hasn’t set on the British Empire, as long as he breathes, German Domination over Africa is anything but secure'. Of course, these words no longer echo through the underground of German-Occupied Lusaka. Rather, a more tepid Evelyn Baring now repeats these empty words as the meager Governor of Southern Rhodesia, still lucky enough to be under British control. After bouncing around various administrative jobs, Baring settled into a position in the German-Occupied former British Colony of North-Rhodesia. While he worked diligently under the Hüttig administration, Baring never shied away from voicing his disgust at how the Germans wrongfully invaded rightful British holdings, and horror at how his beloved British Empire had seemingly crumbled to dust before his very eyes. As Hüttig grew more and more oppressive, Baring began organizing British Remnants in an attempt to drive the Hun from North Rhodesia, and turned to the South for assistance. However, Baring was met with silence from both South Rhodesia and South Africa, who deemed Baring’s cause as hopeless. They were ultimately proven right, as Baring's many attempts at seizing power were all repelled effortlessly. With Baring and his British companions now expelled from North-Rhodesia for good, any hopes at destroying hold on the region have been dashed for good. A broken man who has given up on his grandiose plans for the reclamation of British Africa, Evelyn Baring has settled into the quiet job as Governor of South Rhodesia, nonetheless a consolation prize to him after so many failures. While nothing to scoff at, to many in Baring's Clique, being shoved into the post of Governor of Rhodesia is an insult to those who wish to see Baring lead the destruction of Hunnic Africa."

zim.1.t:0 "The Southern Rhodesian Army rises!"
zim.1.d:0 "Southern Rhodesians have had to hold their patience for years. Ever since we were sold out to appease the Boers of South Africa, we have been lobbying for the province's removal from the union and the establishment of responsible local government.\n\nWe never wanted to the use of violence to accomplish this goal, but Pretoria left us no choice with their illegal detachment of the Empire. Our electorate shares our concern, and the mobilization of our regiments is so far a great success."
zim.1.a:0 "Rhodesia is forever loyal!"

zim.2.t:0 "Rejoining the Empire"
zim.2.d:0 "We have finally regained our freedom from those South Africans. Now it is time to reassert our loyalty to the Empire again.\n\nRealistically speaking, the overwhelming support we are receiving here in Southern Rhodesia is likely insufficient to actually defend our sovereignty from the Afrikaners and their professional military. Therefore, our envoy, who will be leaving from Mozambique where he will be joined by a representative from Natal, will also request formal recognition by the Empire and seek official reinforcement. We recognize that the focus of the exiles is at the homecoming, we do. But if we, his majesty's loyal subjects from Southern Africa, are to help them fulfill this goal, we will need their help now."
zim.2.a:0 "Safe travels!"

zim.3.t:0 "Imperial Experts"
zim.3.d:0 "We are seeking the expertise of the wider empire to help develop Southern Rhodesia. The empire has many areas of expertise however, so we ought to choose where we will seek to develop our nation  further: in the field of the land military, the airforce or economically after all..."
zim.3.a:0 "We are in need of economic development!"
zim.3.b:0 "The army needs better weapons!"
zim.3.c:0 "A more modern airforce would be beneficial!"

zim.4.t:0 "Expanding the Native Reserves"
zim.4.d:0 "When Southern Rhodesia was integrated into South Africa, the region, which historically had a much larger amount of land designated to the Native population, suddenly had to adhere to the South African Native Land Act of 1913 that mandated that the Native Reserve Lands should be brought down to 8% of the total land mass. This threshold was never hit because of the huge disparity, but over the years, native reserve lands shrunk heavily and the reserves have become overcrowded, forcing their inhabitants to similarly overcrowded slums in the urban areas under poor conditions. Now that we are no longer bound to South Africa's legislation, voices have risen to rectify these measures.\n\nHowever lot of the forfeit reserve lands has been bought by White farmers, and not all of those are willing to vacate their property when the government offers to buy it. Expropriation is an option, but it wouldn't be popular if we expropriate whites in the interest of the natives, so some in the government say we should only recover land voluntarily."
zim.4.a:0 "We will do our best, but we can't expropriate!"
zim.4.b:0 "Every last acre is going back to those reserves."
zim.6.t:0 "The Cabinet Question"
zim.6.d:0 "The United Federal Party has already long been a party with internal contradictions: the party has formed out of several left-wing parties, is generally regarded as left-wing as such, and even campaigned on semi-left-wing policies. However, many high-ranking party members, among them party leader Godfrey Huggins, actually subscribe to conservative thought.\n\nHaving won the first elections of independent Southern Rhodesia has rushed this issue to the breaking point: a cabinet now needs to be formed, and it seems likely that Godfrey Huggins will become prime minister. The question is then, whether Huggins will extend an olive branch to the left wing for the good of party unity, or if he will simply only appoint ministers that support his own position."
zim.6.a:0 "Both wings deserve representation!"
zim.6.b:0 "The left wing is misguided!"

zim.7.t:0 "Complaints from United's Left Wing"
zim.7.d:0 "The left wing of the United Party is growing increasingly dissatisfied: with prime minister Huggins' refusal to appoint left wing ministers in his cabinet, the left wing of the United Party has been deprived of most of its influence on the executive and thus government policy.\n\nProgressive United Federal Party MPs are now up in arms, and threatening to block government legislation if they are not satisfied with the Labour Party and the Rhodesia Party."
zim.7.a:0 "Let them scream!"
zim.7.b:0 "Try and Appease Them."

zim.8.t:0 "The Prime Minister seeks to dissolve Parliament"
zim.8.d_left:0 "The United Party is quickly tearing itself apart, as left wing opposition to the government of their own party grows increasingly resolute and hinders the government's ability to pass policy severely.\n\nRecognizing that this current situation is untenable, the prime minister has contacted the Rhodesia Party opposition and come to an agreement: the Rhodesia Party will join a coalition witht the UFP to help oppose Labour and the UFP's Left-Wing.\n\nSeeing an opportunity in this newfound cooperation to wipe out the progressive reform opposition, the prime minister now petitions the governor to dissolve the Southern Rhodesian Parliament and write new elections. However, it is also clear that the combination right United and the Rhodesia Party already have a majority in the current mandate which has been elected just a few months ago..."

zim.9.d_normal:0 "With the horrors of "Black Monday'' still fresh in the minds of each and every countryman across our lands, many have been calling for a change in direction. Though the United Federal Party saved our colony from the brink, it was also responsible for getting us so close to that ledge in the first place. With this in mind, a call for snap elections has been growing throughout the colony and today, the powers at be have finally given their answer. The UFP, along with the rest of our parliament, have announced that new snap elections will be held in order to reorganize the direction of our fair state. The chief rival to the UFP is the Rhodesian Labour Party, but many still believe the UFP's dominance to be insurmountable. Now the choice lies within the hands of our esteemed electorate...."
zim.9.d_ufp_fell_apart:0 "Following the fall of the Huggins government and the subsequent realignment between the right UFP and the Rhodesia Party, the governor has called new elections for the Southern Rhodesian parliament. As is tradition, all Southern Rhodesians who fulfill the property qualifications can vote. It is widely expected that the new United Rhodesia Party will win in a landslide, but the Labour Party and the now much smaller leftover of the United Federal Party have been campaigning viciously in the hopes of perhaps enabling themselves to deny this new political behemoth a majority and form a Labour-led coalition between the two parties instead."

zim.10.a:0 "Let them scream!"
zim.10.b:0 "Try and Appease Them."

zim.11.t:0 "Opposition Parties Unite in Calls for Elections"
zim.11.d:0 "While the United Party has managed to maintain itself, the opposition in the Labour and Rhodesia Parties have grown resolute in their calls for an early election. To keep the party intact, Prime Minister Huggins has had to make sizeable concessions to both sides of the aisle, leading the opposition parties to label the UFP as ineffective, a grave insult in this time of crisis. As the days progress, it has become increasingly clear that the UFP's mandate, while young, is in jeopardy."
zim.11.a:0 "Hurrah for the United Party?"

zim.12.t:0 "Huggins steps down as Party Leader"
zim.12.d_left:0 "Following the disappointing result for the United Federal Party, their leader Godfrey Huggins stepped down as both party leader and official leader of the opposition.\n\nThe United Federal Party gathered in Bulawayo to elect a new leader for the party, and the choice has fallen on Garfield Todd, who has been the foremost left-wing MP in the party so far. It might be expected that this will mean the United Federal Party will enter a new stage in the future."

The South Rhodesians proposed a 'Economic Reconciliation' , which would allow for goods and other capital to flow through each other borders and assist both nations greatly, though South Rhodesia would benefit far greater.

zim.44.d:0 "Industrial Conciliation Act is draws from it's South African counterpart with legislation to exclude blacks and other minorities from certain professions to protect white employees and their interests. The idea of the act is to protect White employees from competition in the labour market  compared to the cheaper black employees, who are generally not recognized as workers. Of course there are those in the government that see this Act as draconic and backwards comparing to something akin to the confederate states of America."

zim.45.t:0 "RRWU/Salisbury Municipal Authority"
zim.45.d:0 "With the provincial division now promoted to the status of high court speaking the law of the land, a highly contested court case can finally see its completion by proper procedure.\n\nWhen Southern Rhodesia declared its independence, there was a need for improved rail infrastructure between Salisbury and Mozambique, so as to ensure the young nation’s dependence on South Africa would be reduced. To ensure that these emergency works would be carried out smoothly, the city of Salisbury brought forward a ban against striking, curtailing the power of the powerful railway unions, with the Rhodesian Railway Worker’s Union at its head. The latter contests that Salisbury had the right to do this on the grounds of the Union of South Africa’s Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924, which encompassed Southern Rhodesia but has not been formally repealed, and took to the judiciary to make its point.\n\nThis first decision is doubly important because not only will it reveal whether South African law passed while Southern Rhodesia was under South African dominion still holds, it also sets a precedent on how the newly autonomous colony will be handling the traditionally so powerful railway unions.

zim.50.d:0 "The time has come to reveiw the status of the Governor of Southern Rhodesia. Some have suggested appointing a new Governor, while others have suggested simply sticking with [ZIM.GetLeader]. Others have said that in these trying times, where Rhodesia is threatened by Boers, Natives, Syndicalists and Mittelafriakns, we have no need for a Governor, and that the Prime Minister must have the authority to act unilaterally. In the event we do appoint a new Governor, several qualified candidates have been suggested for the post, however in the end the Rhodesian Government has recommended one person for the post."

Under the stewardship of the UFP, we have saved our people and their ways of life. However, we did not escape our near-immolation without being left with the scars and marks common in such an engagement, and it will be some years before our slice of the Dark Continent is fully healed and our economy is recovered. The financial collapse has also revealed cracks in the facade of the UFP's seemingly unstoppable popularity, and it seems an actual challenge from the Labour Party for the soul of the nation is not as fanciful as it once seemed."

rhodesia.6.d:0 "Since our colony's foundation, a heated point of conflict between white immigrants and the natives has been the issue of land rights and ownership in the colony. With the past acceptance of the Land Apportionment act, no Native African in the colony could purchase land outside of predetermined ‘Native Purchase Areas,’ or NAP’s, essentially creating native reservations while white settlers are free to purchase land nearly anywhere. With the recent effects of Black Monday still being felt, some feel it may be time to reform this act, one way or another. On one hand, many MP’s believe the act to be far too restrictive to both our cultural and economic growth and that natives must be allowed to purchase some lands off the NAP’s, or at least have the NAP’s be enlarged as overpopulation has become a rampant issue in these zones. On the other hand, some MP’s believe the act to not be restrictive enough, blaming the native landowners for most of the troubles Black Monday caused or exposed. Regardless, this bill has greatly inflamed debate within our parliament and a decision on its passage will take countless hours of arguing and compromise. Eventually, the parliament door opened and an announcement was made; the final result was..."

Though we operate and cooperate with the rest of our sister-colonies in the German monstrosity known as Mittelafrika, our hearts still lie past the White Cliffs of Dover. As such, we still maintain a remarkably close and cordial relationship with our Anglo-Saxon cousins in South Rhodesia, which stands as one of the last free holdouts of Anglo-Africa. Despite the geo-political borders separating our citizens, the interactions and connections between us still bind us together and are as strong as ever. To alleviate this egregious separation, many in our parliament have called for a plebiscite to be held on the issue of Rhodesian unification. They argue that the South Rhodesians are closer to us than any Hun or Krout, and such a move would only be natural. In response to this, the nay-sayers of such a plebiscite fear reprisal from the Kaiser and his forces for such open talks of what could be considered treason. We must walk a delicate line here going forward."

Of the myriad of possible candidates for party leader stand three factions whose prominence and political clout far out measure their compatriots. The frontrunners of this trio are none other than Garfield Todd. This titan of the Labour party is the favorite to win and is expected to tow the party line, but whispers have been heard of a possible upset victory from Labour Party dark-horse Doris May Taylor, a radical from the Socialist Wing.

Similar to the Labour Party’s three-wing divide, our UFP too has three main wings that are vying for control. The two most prominent of these factions is the Social Conservative Wing, led by Winston Field, and the Social Liberal Wing which is headed by Godfrey Huggins. As these two factions go for each other's throats in the debates, Desmond Lardner-Burke and his Rhodesian Front have stalked the conference like a hunting lion, gathering support from under the noses of his opponents.

Brave ministers from our parliament have called for a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Burke, seeking to oust this "old fool" and replace him with a younger and more zealous face: proposed leader of the Rhodesian Front, Ian Smith. Though this measure has been seen as overly drastic by some MP's, enough felt it was at least worth debating and so the vote was called. Our colony's future hangs in the balance and a path must be chosen. Whoever is chosen will either lead us to glory, or doom us all to die on this unforgiving contient.

Even here, in our relatively stable oasis of order here on the banks of the Zambezi, the cracks have begun to show as this situation further deteriorates into madness. \n\n To secure the Rhodesian government and our last remaining shreds of law and order, many within our cabinet have suggested a return to full military rule for the time being, until a more stable and less-life threatening time returns. The main figure these militarists have called for to rule Rhodesia in this hour of need has been Sir Arthur Harris, honored Marshal of the Rhodesian Air Force. Ever an honorable and talented man, Harris has served in Rhodesia since before the Weltkrieg and has built a respectable and revered military career here in Africa. With this keen-eyed veteran at the helm, Rhodesia would likely weather this brewing storm caused by Mittelafrika’s collapse, but such a drastic cessation of the normal democratic process would likely anger many. We walk a delicate line now, and Rhodeisa’s future hangs in the balance."

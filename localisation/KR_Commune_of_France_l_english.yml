### Leader Bios ###
## Commune of France ##
POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC:0 "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchist to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Now leading the Anarchistes faction, he hopes to be able to implement his syncretic ideal for the benefit of the Commune as a whole."
POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC:0 "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC:0 "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC:0 "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordiality with syndicalists and anarchists."
POLITICS_VINCENT_AURIOL_DESC:0 "Vincent Auriol, long accused by hardline syndicalists of harbouring sympathies for the bourgeoisie, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. He advocates the gradual transition to a more democratic system of government in the Commune."
POLITICS_FELIX_GOUIN_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Born as Alfred-Georges Gressent, to a working-class peasant family in 1878, Georges was invested in politics from an early age. Becoming an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel whilst working as his secretary, however he was not always a man of the left. After publishing political thought directly inspired by his mentor, Sorel, he became an acquaintance of monarchist writer Charles Maurras. Joining Maurras’s movement, Action Française, he developed his ideology of fusing working-class based politics with monarchism. In 1911 he founded the Cercle Proudhon with fellow AF comrades, this group espoused national-syndicalism, integral nationalism and antisemitism whilst rejecting liberal and conservative democracy. Overtime as syndicalist movements evolved throughout France, the Cercle became overtly left-wing whilst maintaining an aggressively nationalist stance on world politics. When the French Civil War broke out, Valois took advantage of the crisis by turning his group into a fully fledged political movement. The Sorelians were born, disowning any previous reactionary views, Valois and his comrades took to streets of a broken France to demand the destruction of the French Third Republic.\n\n Now he has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny. He has also advocated for vengeance against Germany and the reclamation of lost French territory."
POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC:0 "Marcel Déat was born in 1894 to a modest family, in his youth he excelled at his studies and became involved in left-wing politics. A student of Radical politician Émile Chartier he joined the SFIO, however this political stint came to end when the Weltkrieg broke out. A staunch patriot he enlisted in the French Army and saw active duty, earning the Legion of Honour and five bravery citations. The Weltkrieg shaped his political views, forging a deep hatred for Germany and the French elite who he saw as failing the nation. During the lead up the French Civil War, Déat has positioned himself to the right of the socialist movement, advocating for an authoritarian, anti-capitalist state. Despite his early works being published by Valois Marcel himself never joined the Sorelians, only occasionally cooperating with certain elements of their movement.When the General Strike led to civil conflict Déat declared loyalty to the Commune.\n\nRepresenting 'Néo-Socialisme', Déat has proved himself to be capable in forging connections with former political enemies and taking action against the collapsing Syndicalist order. With the chaos resulting from Valois' death Déat sensed the opportunity and struck out against the mad revolutionaries of Bucard, securing France in hopes of finally implementing his constructive reformation."
POLITICS_MARCEL_BUCARD_DESC:0 "Many things Marcel Bucard has been called over the years. Syndicalist, Anti-semite, Nationalist, Worker. Beginning life as the son of a butcher in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Marcel Bucard initially studied to become a Catholic Priest. This all changed however with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg where he patriotically signed up to fight off the German horde in defense of the French nation rising through the ranks and winning admiration for fellow french patriots and friends in the trenches. No matter how hard he fought however the horrors of the war cemented his personal hatred for Germany and its mistreatment of the French people. Originally a reactionary, the Weltkrieg provided him with a deep hatred for the French upper-class who he saw as cowards for surrendering to the Germans. The revolutionary period that swept France saw the Bankers, Liberals, Capitalists, the exploiters of the French nation abandon it and flee with the riches of its people. Countering this was of the utmost personal importance to Bucard who joined Valois’s Sorelians, eventually taking leadership of his own faction, the ‘Revolutionary Francists’. Giving speeches towards crowds of disenfranchised French patriots against 'Ruthless banking clans' and their 'Liberal lapdogs' he easily recruited among the galvanized Weltkrieg veterans.\n\nNow in control as the Chief of the French Rejuvenated Revolutionary Syndicate, Bucard sees the destruction of the German Empire as his main objective. To him, the superior French proletariat have smashed the chains of their masters and can no longer be defeated by any force!"
POLITICS_MAURICE_THOREZ_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez was born in Pas-de-Calais, France on the 28th of April, 1900. Becoming a coal miner at the young age of 12. He would go on to join the French Section of the Workers’ International at the age of 19. His time in the SFIO introduced him to Marxist thought, causing him to become enamored with the ideas of Communism and a very enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik uprising in Russia. The ultimate failure of the Bolsheviks led Thorez to conclude that they had not been pure or strong enough, that they had failed both Lenin, Marx, and Robespierre by their inability to take every measure necessary for the revolution. Thorez would take up arms in the Second French Revolution, declaring himself as a syndicalist to disguise his true communist nature. A charismatic leader, many flocked to him for his bold speeches and devotion to the Revolution. Once the Commune of France had been established, however, he revealed his true colors, declaring the Commune a bourgeois fourth republic, and converting his followers to the ways of communism. Now calling themselves the “Jacobins” after the radicals of Robespierre, Thorez and his followers became an immense thorn in the side of the CGT. Considering himself to be the successor to Robespierre and Lenin, Thorez would be dismissed as a political failure for his inability to win a seat in the BGT. But now with his rule secured by his astounding victory in the 1936 elections, the “political failure” is determined to live up to his predecessors and crush all who stand in his way of creating a true Communist French utopia."
POLITICS_FRENCH_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "With Chairman Valois now dead, power has been vested within the Sorelian Council. Valois never named his successor in the event of his death, therefore to avoid further conflict the Comité de Salut Public was formed. The council lacks unity with it being split between multiple competing factions. Valois’s right-hand man Jacques Arthuys currently maintains order whilst commander of the Revolutionary Legion, Marcel Bucard, leads the Revolutionary Francists. With the threat of anarchy looming, can the council unify behind a single leader or will it collapse..."
POLITICS_BLACK_GUARD_DESC:0 "The system of the former Fédération des Commune de France was based in part on anarchist principles, principally those of the honorable Proudhon, with peasants and workers in each Commune devoting a mandate to unions which were responsible for their representation, yet the specter of statism still reigned over a France that was ultimately not totally free. But now that Makhno has reversed the Sorelian perversion of Commune ideals, he and the Black Guard created a more perfect version of the Communard system, mixed with the Anarchism that Makhno had begun to implement in Ukraine.\n\nThe peasants and workers of each commune, grouped in associations such as cooperatives and trade unions, now decide for themselves, through a system of participatory democracy, on political decisions at local level, without the need for the old BGT representatives and their national planning, which is not suited to manages the diverse realities of the entire French territory.  Regional congresses do exist, however, to promote cooperation and trade between the various inhabitants of the Free Territory, but they have no legislative role. Justice is exercised by popular tribunals representing every profession, age and sex, to ensure a truly democratic system. The 'armed forces' of the territory are made up of volunteer militias, although Makhno's Black Guard is the territory's main armed organization, having sworn to defend its integrity and boasting many seasoned members, Nestor Makhno aided by his militias intends to succeed in preserving this nascent utopia, as he tried to do in his native Ukraine."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "Born into a military family, 20 September 1872, Maurice Gustave Gamelin was always destined for military greatness. Entering into the Saint-Cyr Military Academy he graduated first in his class, going on to serve in Tunisia. Serving as attaché to future Maréchal of France, General Joseph Joffre, this position provided Gamelin with a solid knowledge of strategic and tactical warfare. During the Weltkrieg he distinguished himself for helping plan the victory at the Battle of the Marne. Quickly being promoted all the way to Brigadier General however with the German offensive of 1918 pushing further and further into France, Gamelin was recalled to Paris. Leading a desperate defence of the capital he held the lines just long enough for a civilian extraction saving countless lives. After the war he maintained a high ranking position in the military, as civil tension escalated he refused to allow politics to sway his loyalty to France. When the syndicalist revolutionaries were successful, Gamelin offered his services to the government and was made Maréchal of the Commune of France. This came to an end when the Jacobin regime was declared.\n\nAs the Jacobin rule of tyranny tore France apart, Gamelin realised that his backseat in politics must end. Forging an alliance Léon Blum, a Popular Front backed by the military, has overthrown Thorez’s dictatorship with Gamelin proclaimed as Maréchal. Many now regard Gamelin as the defender of Communard democracy, and saviour of France."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Born into a poor peasantry family in Ukraine, 26 October 1888, Nestor Ivanovych Makhno was forced to adapt quickly to a harsh life. Extreme poverty led to him finding work for himself, being employed at a local iron foundry he witnessed the rise of revolutionary anti-Tsarist politics. Having experienced the Tsarist Regime’s brutality himself he joined local anarchists and took part in robberies resulting in his imprisonment. When the Weltkrieg broke out he remained a prisoner, sentenced to death by hanging, this came to end with the Russian Revolution. Being freed he left for Ukraine, forming connections with anarchists he established the ‘Black Army’ to fight against both Ukrainian nationalists and the intervening German forces. When Germany secured its dominance of the nation he fled his homeland for France.\n\n Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his popularity and notability in French politics. Forming the ‘Black Guard’ terrorist organization which has now overthrown the Sorelian regime. With the failures of Ukraine and France, Makhno has been further radicalised by the Illegalists. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future. However his efforts to destroy any remnants of authority in the commune with the establishment of the ‘Free Territory of France’ have so far been successful. These successes may be in vain however, for his personal army of anarchists are the only thing that can prevent France’s neighbours from taking advantage of this chaos..."
POLITICS_LOUIS_NIEL_DESC: "Originally a simple, modest café boy, Louis Niel's life story continues to inspire young Syndicalists today. Born in Corsica in 1872 into a modest family from Bastia, Louis was self-taught, taught to read and write on his own, and quickly forged a political conscience by observing the deplorable living conditions of workers in his native Corsica, which he traveled throughout his teenage years.\n\nHe soon left for the mainland, however, to join the local branch of the CGT in Montpellier, where he was noted for his diligence, exemplary intellectual qualities, calm, thoughtful temperament and undeniable administrative, organizational and stewardship skills. Universally liked and respected by all the Socialist, Communist and Revolutionary currents of the left, Louis Niel wrote articles for a variety of newspapers, from the Anarchist 'Les Temps Nouveaux' to the Communist 'l'Humanité'. These qualities enabled him to climb the ranks of the CGT step by step, until he found himself in the position of General Secretary and thus leader of the CGT in 1909. Despite his skills, Louis Niel found himself elected in a climate of Syndicalist tension, notably between the Reformist and Revolutionary currents. Niel tried to reconcile the two as best he could, but found himself up against the charismatic Léon Jouhaux. These conditions led to his resignation, famously declaring 'I never thought I'd fall into an environment so decomposed by political passions or personal quarrels'. He returned to his life as an administrator and organizer in the shadows, and played a key role in coordinating the unions during the Revolution against the Third Republic.\n\nNiel did, however, return to the limelight recently: after the CGT had seen its majority dwindle and feared losing it, it decided to elect Louis Niel, a unifying figure, as President of the Congress of Trade Unions, a role he accepted without complaint, but without enthusiasm either, content to follow the CGT line. The political climate is not the most unstable at the start of 1936, but some people fear that if a major crisis shakes the country, Louis would not be the ideal man to respond..."
POLITICS_ALBERT_CAMUS_DESC: "The son of pied-noir parents living in Mondovi, Algeria that has since risen to be the darling face of Algeria’s Syndicalist settler movement, Albert Camus stands as the living embodiment of the Commune’s struggle between its colonialist past and its humanist future. Born in Mondovi, Algeria in 1913, Camus is the son of a Great War veteran who tragically lost his life while serving in the Zouave regiment in October of 1914, and a working-class mother who was both deaf and illiterate, leaving Camus to be the man of the house from a young age. Always uncomfortable with the greater rights he was allowed when compared to his Arab and Berber peers, and with his working class background serving as a strong foundation, Camus rapidly found himself drawn to Leftist ideology from a young age, eventually studying at a prestigious lyceum near Algiers in the years immediately following the French Revolution and the split of France, forcing him to take his newfound Socialist beliefs underground while he maintained secretive contacts with fellow Leftist thinkers across the Mediterranean. Philosophically an absurdist and an existentialist, Camus would develop his own literary thoughtform while drifting towards Anarcho-Syndicalism ideologically, all the while espousing the creation of a ‘new Mediterranean culture’ built around a modernized and syncretized concept of Hellenic Humanitarianism that would see the egalitarian conglomeration of French pied-noir and native Algerian culture and socio-economics into one homogeneous whole, bringing about the formation of a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural revolutionary melting pot as a core part of France proper which would raise up the Algerian proletariat to be equals with their fellow Euro-blooded countrymen in the Metropole. Aligned with the ENA of Messali Hadj and committed to anti-colonialism while straddling the fence between Algerian autonomy as an ally and Algerian integration as a full department, Camus is nonetheless Algeria’s preeminent face for the Syndicalist cause who shall make the necessary decisions to ensure Algeria contributes as much to our Hellenist revolution as possible."

### Ideas ###

THINT_exact_vengeance:0 "Desire for Revenge"

FRA_home_of_the_international_revolution: "Home of the International Revolution"
FRA_home_of_the_international_revolution_desc: "The Federation of the Communes of France is the first country in the world where a revolution of a Socialist nature has been successful and a workers' state has been established. This fact lends great prestige to our country and makes it the center of the world proletarian revolutionary movement, with numerous organizations representing workers from all over the world to be found, for example the leadership of the Left Kuomintang, many pan-African intellectuals, thinkers of the Negritude movement, militants of the ENA and many others.\n\nFor all the world's proletarians, France is a light in the darkness of an imperialist world, and all the world's Socialist militants share the dream of one day being delegates to one of the great congresses of the Third International in Paris."

FRA_communard_spirit_idea:0 "Communard Spirit"
FRA_communard_spirit_idea_desc:0 "We are the legacy of the Paris Commune, the first socialist state ever created and then brutally repressed by the Republican reactionaries. In 1920, the workers finally got their revenge and overthrew the decadent system. We, sons and daughters of Communards must protect our state and our spirit, we will not be commanded by tyrants anymore!"

FRA_bad_intel:0 "Inefficient Intelligence"
FRA_bad_intel_desc:0 "Ever since the former bourgeois Republic tried to stifle the worker's uprising in France, the idea of a centralised intelligence service is seen by many as a hallmark of the reactionary oppression of the post-Weltkrieg social movements. As a result, the Commune's intelligence services are limited to extremely scrutinised intelligence committees to prevent a repeat of this situation."

FRA_to_war_idea:0 "Revanchist Rearment"

FRA_military_buildup_two_idea:0 "Calibrated Economy"
FRA_military_buildup_two_idea_desc:0 "As the world slowly approaches war again, we can rapidly capitalise on our healthy economy to rapidly switch parts of our economy to focus on military build-up. More factories are dedicated on arming our soldiers and building military structures, without any severe impact on our population."

FRA_ruralism_idea:0 "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_idea_desc:0 "The wide-reaching reforms to our industry and economy means than we no longer have massive industrial centres surrounding populous cities. This incidentally makes any attempt by enemy forces to cripple or even destroy our economy that much harder, with the biggest rural industrial centres far smaller and far more numerous than the great industry centres of Europe."

FRA_market_socialism_idea:0 "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_idea_desc:0 "Market Socialism is far more than a socialist interpretation of a market economy. By putting all the new worker cooperatives in a fair and equal competitive economy, we can make our civilian economy more dynamic and more efficient without having to directly intervene or go through slow, bloated unions in most cases."

FRA_mass_production_idea:0 "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_idea_desc:0 "Factories have always had a serious advantage over the artisan. By chaining production tasks, they can produce in a small frame of time infinitely more product without nearly equal quality. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent that process, let's improve on it. We seek absolute efficiency in production to beat the German capitalists."

FRA_modern_farms_idea:0 "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_idea_desc:0 "Farms are often seen as an old, quaint detail of the national economy, but we know better. By modernising and mechanising the Commune's farmlands, we can massively increase our agricultural output and both speed up and optimise harvest, production, refining and delivery. To our civilians, and to our troops."

FRA_war_eco_agri_idea:0 "War, Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Sorelian minister Marcel Bucard, the concept of War, Economy and Agriculture is an interesting one. Claiming that a war with Germany is not only inevitable but fast approaching, the Sorelians demand a rapid conversion to an economy whose industry can not only sustain a war, but whose agriculture can sustain its soldiers. In sum, a sort of total war economy."

FRA_inter_coop_idea:0 "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_idea_desc:0 "There is no shame in seeing what other countries are doing, and borrowing their new economic and industrial ideas to improve our own. Obviously, there are very few ideas we can seriously borrow from capitalist and reactionary societies, but our fellow Syndicalist brothers are fine examples at times."

FRA_dedication_idea:0 "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_idea_desc:0 "French workers work for more than their pay, and they certainly do not work at gunpoint. Every can they seal, every brick they lay, every rifle they assemble, every tank they weld together, is a service to their country and the spirit of the Commune at large."

FRA_industralization_idea:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_industralization_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Jacobin economy minister Jean Jérôme, Industrialisation is no strange concept to anyone in the Commune or abroad. This policy aims to rapidly increase the industrial capacity of France in order to catch up to our arch nemesis Germany. This is accompanied by a work culture and the creation of dedicated factory towns."

FRA_mass_fire_support_idea:0 "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_idea_desc:0 "Every man has his rifle and grenade, every squad has its machine gun. By organising our divisions to provide fire to each other, we can another a new layer of fire support. Every time a division advances, all the other divisions suppress the enemy. By doing this in waves, we can rapidly gain ground. Now to supply the equipment needed."

FRA_mass_conscription_idea:0 "Mass Conscription"
FRA_mass_conscription_idea_desc:0 "Whereas our enemies have trouble enlisting enough soldiers to fight their reactionary and imperialist wars, every man is ready to fight for the Commune. Let us mobilise as many as our economy can sustain, we will overwhelm the reactionaries with our ultimate dedication to the Commune."

FRA_empower_rifleman_idea:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_idea_desc:0 "The Rifleman is more than a soldier with a gun. For too long he has been seen as incapable of any higher thinking other than firing his rifle by monarchist officers, seeing the working man with disdain. We will not make this mistake, the Rifleman should decide local tactics, increasing his efficiency on the battlefield."

FRA_military_academy_idea:0 "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_idea_desc:0 "We have to face the harsh reality that the Weltkrieg led to the downfall of most of our prestigious, if reactionary, military academies. While some claim this to be an acceptable status quo, we know better. Let us invest in new military academies to train skilled officers, for the future of the Communal Army."

FRA_centralized_hc_idea:0 "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_idea_desc:0 "The new Communal Army was not built like the old French army, many Communards resenting the military administration that tried to stifle the Commune, but we cannot leave our Officer Corps shattered. Let us centralise our High Command again, to better organise things some people like to forget, like logistics."

FRA_tank_quality_line_idea:0 "Quality Tank Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_idea_desc:0 "What good is a tank if it doesn't perform as well as enemy tanks? We should not sacrifice on quality in favour of quantity, all this will lead to is more burning husks on the battlefield. Quality tanks, even if fewer in numbers, will take many times their numbers, making them a safe return on investment."

FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea:0 "Tank Assembly Line"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea_desc:0 "What good is a tank if the enemies have many more to throw against us? We cannot let perfectionists sabotage our assembly lines for minimal gains, or else we will be outnumbered. Quantity will allow us to overwhelm our enemies with entire divisions of cold hard steel, and many more shells flying at them."

FRA_fast_army_idea:0 "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_idea_desc:0 "Speed is more than a small advantage or a way to get to the next point faster. Speed is integral to warfare. Those who think that the next Weltkrieg will be fought in trenches are deluded at best, mobile warfare is the way of the future. We must capitalise on fast, motorised divisions, if not a motorised army."

FRA_Red_Army:0 "Red Grande Armee"
FRA_Red_Army_desc:0 "Our army is in better shape than ever to face the evils of this capitalist world."

Capital_Ship_Primacy:0 "Capital Ship Primacy"
Capital_Ship_Primacy_desc:0 "A grand navy will be crucial to defeat the Kaiserliche Marine and bring the pain to Germany's northern coast. And in that role, the grand Battleship still shines. Its naval artillery will flatten the reactionaries with rolling barrages of thunder and steel, and send their boats to the bottom of the sea."

Carrier_Primacy:0 "Carrier Primacy"
Carrier_Primacy_desc:0 "The future of naval warfare is not in big, clunky warships, but in a combined arms approach with another front of future warfare, air warfare. Let us ensure that every naval group has a Carrier. Its fighters will ensure global air dominance, its naval bombers will wreck enemy ships and harbours alike."

To many, Bucard is seen as a reactionary who switched sides to save his own skin, however despite this the new chairman has confirmed his commitment to crushing the bourgeoisie nations. Supported by both the military and the Revolutionary Legion, Bucard has forged alliances with left-wing nationalists eager to fight the Germans, but also with groups sidelined by the CGT such as futurists and technocrats.

FRA_mining_expansion_desc:0 "The economic and infrastructural development of the regions of the Alpes and the Massif Central allows for a greater exploitation of the mineral resources available there. Our prospectors discovered new mineral deposits and we are now ready to start exploiting them on an industrial scale!"
FRA_plan_prost:0 "Plan Prost"
FRA_plan_prost_desc:0 "The engineer and urbanist Henri Prost came up with a plan to develop highways around the Parisian region to link the outlying suburbs. This idea is receiving widespread support and the BGT decided to fund new projects to expand highways through the Commune. The communes of Marseille and Lyon also asked him to draw highway plans for their cities."
FRA_autoroutes:0 "The Autoroutes"
FRA_autoroutes_desc:0 "The highways proved a massive boon to the economy and worker mobility in urban regions, now an ambitious plan has been put forward to expand them to the whole country! Linking every corner of our country will have a massive impact on our regional development and can only benefit the Revolution."

FRA_eco_direction:0 "Direction of the Economy"
FRA_eco_direction_desc:0 "Our economy is fairer to the workers and generally quite potent while reactionary economies live and die on the whims of capitalists, but internal conflicts have prevented us from steering our economy. It is time to call for a meeting of the BGT, so that these questions are once and for all settled by one the Commune's faction."
FRA_orth_syndicalism:0 "Orthodox Syndicalism"
FRA_orth_syndicalism_desc:0 "The course set since the revolution has been reaffirmed. This orthodoxy has proven effective, and with a bit of fine-tuning can be even more so."
FRA_reduce_unemploy:0 "Reducing Unemployment"
FRA_reduce_unemploy_desc:0 "Beyond the Rhine, unemployment is at an all-time high, we must ensure that the French worker will always have a job to feed his family. In this simple task of providing our people with the fruit of their sustenance, we prove our inherent superiority to the capitalist economies and their constant crises."
FRA_work_design_coop:0 "Worker-Designer Cooperation"
FRA_work_design_coop_desc:0 "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques. This also allows us to quickly train and educate our workforce to new techniques, by letting the designers directly teach the workers about them."
FRA_improve_manage:0 "Improve Management of Unions"
FRA_improve_manage_desc:0 "The Unions have for long been directing the economy, but they have some gaps and loopholes in their rules that can be exploited, leading to disastrous results for our economy. However, we will not question the place of the unions in our country. Instead, we will tighten management and rewrite some work codes."
FRA_dedication:0 "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_desc:0 "The worker has to realise that he is working for the greater good of the Commune and the French people as a whole. He must feel invested in his work at all times, and it is this way that we will improve our national spirit and our productivity. No need for whips or oppressive business owners."
FRA_fac_towns:0 "Factory Towns"
FRA_fac_towns_desc:0 "Our plan to rapidly expand the Commune's industrial base can be supported by the establishment of new factory towns, cities specially designed to provide housing and modern commodities to them and their families, while making sure they live close to their workplaces."
FRA_Industrialisation:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_Industrialisation_desc:0 "Jean Jérôme is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Jacobin, he is a proponent of Communal Industrialisation. While our country has always been one of the modern economies of Europe, we cannot yet compare to the Ruhr Valley. Only by ambitious industrial base expansion can we hope to measure to Germany."
FRA_inter_coop:0 "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_desc:0 "While our technical expertise is one of the best in the world, it is too easy to ignore any breakthroughs that are made in friendly countries on a false pretence of superiority. From new production techniques to management theories, we must stay observant and borrow anything that could benefit our own economy."
FRA_war_eco_agri:0 "War Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_desc:0 "Marcel Bucard, a Sorelian, is a proponent of the 'War, Economy and Agriculture' theory, calling for a rapid conversion to a war economy along with an ambitious development of the agriculture. Should the German reactionaries attack, we will certainly have a use for the rifles and the bread."
FRA_modern_farms:0 "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_desc:0 "Farming has been a staple of civilisation since ancient times, and yet it has profoundly changed in just one century. Recent tools like tractors allow a single farmer to harvest fields in a single day that would have required dozens of farmers and a week in the past. Let's mechanise our farms, to put more food in our platters and our rations."
FRA_war_industry:0 "A War Industry"
FRA_war_industry_desc:0 "Despite rising animosity from Germany, our economy is still mostly dedicated to the production of civilian goods and is not suited for a major war. We need to develop our production of arms and equipment if we are to defend the Commune against external threats efficiently."
FRA_mass_production:0 "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_desc:0 "Our enemies are many, and our army is quite large as a result. This army needs a lot of equipment, and this clearly puts a strain on our factories. We must search new ways to improve our production of small arms through both design and manufacturing, without cutting corners."
FRA_cooperatives:0 "Cooperatives"
FRA_cooperatives_desc:0 "Daniel Guérin is the new economy minister of the Commune. An Anarchiste, he is a proponent of Cooperatives. The Commune's government is primarily here to serve its workers, and it must ensure the best working conditions for them. Letting them manage their own companies is a good way to start."
FRA_decentralized_industry:0 "Decentralised Industry"
FRA_decentralized_industry_desc:0 "Our industry is currently concentrated around Paris and major communes, but the people don't live only in Paris, Lille or Lyon but everywhere in France. We must put all efforts into developing all the regions of France so that our entire country prospers."
FRA_market_socialism:0 "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_desc:0 "The cooperatives we created must insert themselves in a new, equal socialist market. This market will make the economy more dynamic and allow everyone to pursue their own goals and share their industrial wealth in the respect of the ideals of socialism, without the predatory behaviours of the capitalist market economy."
FRA_ruralism:0 "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_desc:0 "The life of the peasant is the best life known to man, but the need for an industrial economy made this life impossible for most of the French people. We can, however, still encourage this lifestyle by bringing their factories and workplaces to the countryside, ending the tyranny of mass urbanisation."

FRA_communal_army:0 "The Communal Army"
FRA_communal_army_desc:0 "The French nation has an army, but it is an army that still does not have a unifying direction. Some still propose the same army of the Weltkrieg with High Command. Others want more initiative to NCOs. Others still desire a motorised and mobile army. Finally, there is also the idea of mass conscription. Once we dissolve the military trade unions, we must follow with an unified vision."
FRA_principe_concentration:0 "Principe de Concentration"
FRA_principe_concentration_desc:0 "As the butcher of the Weltkieg showed, there is nothing to be won with evenly spreading our troops across the entire front, taking only metres that we lose the next day to artillery barrages. By making local breakthroughs and investing into them, we can literally shatter the entire enemy front with a few good battles."
FRA_tank_research:0 "Tank Research Grants"
FRA_tank_research_desc:0 "Tanks are not new to us, nor to the world, but they are still a relatively new component of warfare. Improvements have been brisk in tank construction during the interwar, and it seems the true potential of armour is starting to reveal itself. Let us invest generously into the future of warfare."
FRA_fast_army:0 "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_desc:0 "Motorisation is more than the future of cavalry. While the average truck will not last long under enemy fire, it allows us to get our troops to the very frontlines in incredible times. We must make speed the goal of all our tactics, all our training, all our equipment. Celerity is opportunity."
FRA_tank_assembly_line:0 "Tank Assembly Lines"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. By employing laxer standards, we can speed up production of armour and supply our tanks with large armoured divisions that will come down on the enemy like a brick."
FRA_tank_quality_line:0 "Quality Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. Regardless, if we prioritise quality, we ensure that our tanks are the best of the best. Thus, every tank we produce will easily crush the tin cans that our enemy desperately output to counter us."
FRA_centralized_hc:0 "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_desc:0 "We are aware that the unsavoury events of 1919 have put a deep mistrust of military High Command in the people of the Commune. Regardless, we will need to rehabilitate the concept of the High Command. The idea of the squad leader deciding combat tactics is glamorous, but who will care for logistics and strategic manoeuvres?"
FRA_analysing_wki:0 "Analysing the Weltkrieg"
FRA_analysing_wki_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg, a tragedy to us and our British comrades, is a painful topic to study, but it is one we must study regardless. From the successes and failures of this war, we will learn how the next must be fought. Those who think that new tactics and strategies will sprout out of nowhere as the conflict draws near are deluded."
FRA_war_experience:0 "War Experience"
FRA_war_experience_desc:0 "The French army has fought many wars, and will fight many more. Every time we must stop and reflect on these conflicts, and make an analysis as thorough as possible to find where our plans have went right or wrong. Just because they did not fight under the Commune's flag does not mean they died in vain."
FRA_military_academy:0 "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_desc:0 "War is a complex topic, one that must be studied to be fully understood. While we have found many talents during the 1919 Civil War, we must take the preliminary steps to train new officers. We can also study our whole doctrine and renew the training of our officer corps this way."
FRA_officers_initiative:0 "Officer's Initiative"
FRA_officers_initiative_desc:0 "How often during the Weltkrieg have breakthroughs been made but not exploited due to unresponsive officers? We must ensure this does not happen again, every regiment should be able to act independently, drawing up plans and acting on them as they see fit. This is the reality of modern warfare, Napoleonic columns are history."
FRA_mission_type:0 "Mission Type Tactics"
FRA_mission_type_desc:0 "Our plans are not meant to be tasklists, else our troops are paralysed once the unexpected happens. Our plans must always be built with one specific goal in mind. This is the only rigid part of the plan, all else is left to squads to figure out. This way, we will always be ready to adapt our plans as the situation on the field develops."
FRA_flexible_support:0 "Flexible Support"
FRA_flexible_support_desc:0 "To ensure the efficiency of our squads, we must ensure they are served by artillery and support regiments in a flexible manner. This means that at any time artillery must be ready to fire on the orders of any squad linked to it, and support companies must be ready to intervene when called for help on the front."
FRA_empower_rifleman:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_desc:0 "Eventually, we can draft all the plans in the world and stack as many artillery guns in the backline as we see fit, but the humble Rifleman is the one who will win the war. By ensuring that even them can independently take initiative, we subtly improve the efficiency of every squad and defeat those enemies who use terror to lead them."
FRA_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Conscription"
FRA_mass_conscription_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed without a doubt that modern wars now take absolutely insane scales, drafting millions to fight on every side. Every Frenchman must know that one day, he may be called to defend his beloved country against the Reactionaries. We will only be defeated when the last of us perish!"
FRA_improve_manufactures:0 "Improve the Manufactures"
FRA_improve_manufactures_desc:0 "War truly has taken a massive scale, and such a modern war will need an amount of equipment that we perhaps cannot even fathom yet. To the rifle and grenade is added the tank and plane, soon perhaps more. We must ensure our military industry is the best it can possibly be, we will never have one too many rifles!"
FRA_global_organization:0 "Global Organisation"
FRA_global_organization_desc:0 "A grand army needs a grand command. However, it is not the High Command of old, sitting in a war room in Paris, drawing arrows on a map. It is the officers of every squad, of every regiment, of every army and of every front. All together, they will lead our army, and ensure our eventual victory in such a large conflict."
FRA_mass_fire_support:0 "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_desc:0 "With such a big army comes a new idea for the old concept of support fire. For long it was thought that artillery alone could support a push, but we believe that it is the duty of every squad that is not attacking to provide covering fires for those who push forward. This way, our enemies will forever duck as we move forwards."
FRA_grand_army_reform:0 "Grand Army Reform"
FRA_grand_army_reform_desc:0 "Our army is now united in purpose and in doctrine. No more does anyone dare call them a militia or street rabble. This brings back to the imagery of the Grande Armée, and indeed it is a legacy we are proud of. Let us ensure our whole army organisation is geared towards handling this many soldiers and officers."

FRA_equipment_modern:0 "Modern Equipment"
FRA_equipment_modern_desc:0 "The tools of war are ever improving, more efficient, more deadly. To some, this is a tragedy, but it is clear that we cannot shun them. War is an ugly reality, and we must face it. By ensuring our equipment is always the best, we make conflicts deadlier, perhaps. But our enemies will not spare us the courtesy of using those weapons on us."
FRA_special_forces:0 "Alpine Forces"
FRA_special_forces_desc:0 "Mountains have always been a radically different environment to fight in, and most of our borders cross mountains. We must ensure that our training of mountain forces is spotless, and that every new piece of equipment we invent is adapted to mountain warfare. Mountain artillery exists, perhaps mountain tanks soon will?"
FRA_tank_division:0 "Tank Divisions"
FRA_tank_division_desc:0 "It has been obvious for a while, but tanks are here to stay. Their armour is impenetrable to small arms fire, and their mighty cannon destroys whatever it is aimed at. As years go own, their designs become heavier and more destructive. We must stay on the forefront of tank technology, so that we may dominate the battlefield."
FRA_road_to_war:0 "The Road to War"
FRA_road_to_war_desc:0 "The war with Germany is clearly inevitable, this nation holds hostage our brothers in Alsace and Lorraine, and with its many puppets in the Reichspakt it stands as the main counter-revolutionary power in Europe, if not the world, tyrant over hundreds of millions of people. This will stop, we will avenge them all."
FRA_renseignements_generaux:0 "The Renseignements Généraux"
FRA_renseignements_generaux_desc:0 "It has become clearly obvious that we cannot defend our country in a satisfactory manner without a modern, centralised intelligence agency. The taboos of old still hold against such centralised, unscrutinised authority, but it is a sacrifice we have to make. German spies laugh softly at our pitiful 'intelligence committees'."
FRA_military_buildup:0 "Military Build-up"
FRA_military_buildup_desc:0 "To prepare for the upcoming war, we will need to develop our war industry rapidly and efficiently. This may damage our short term economic growth, and this may not be popular for those in our populace who hope for peace and prosperity, but we sadly know better. The survival of the Revolution is at stake here!"
FRA_military_buildup_two:0 "Calibrating the Economy"
FRA_military_buildup_two_desc:0 "The capitalist world is still struggling with last year's shattering economic crisis whilst the righteousness of our own system continues to prove itself. It has been suggested that we utilise this industrial advantage to transform certain aspects of the economy exclusively towards military purposes."
FRA_socialist_education:0 "Socialist Education"
FRA_socialist_education_desc:0 "The education of the French Republic was in many ways excellent, allowing the average citizen to obtain a large knowledge in the sciences and arts. We seek to continue working on this legacy by ensuring that French schools always have learning and education as their primary goal, not hierarchy and discipline like in some reactionary countries."
FRA_Our_time_has_come:0 "Revanchist Propaganda"
FRA_Our_time_has_come_desc:0 "Our desire of revenge against Germany has been long coming. 1871 saw us lose Alsace-Lorraine, and the Republican schools rightfully taught their children that it was a French region soon to be seized back. Sadly, 1919 saw our defeat and the loss of Nancy. But we are not done, our rightful anger shall only end when France is whole again!"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals:0 "Department of Revolutionary Ideals"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals_desc:0 "While the empirical teachings prove themselves easily, the virtues of the Commune are harder to communicate to our population. While ominous sounding, we must create an institution ready to help us remind to our people the value of the Revolution and prevent reactionary influences from implanting themselves."
FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute:0 "Blanqui Research Institute"
FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute_desc:0 "While some nations resist the teachings of science, France endorses them without nuance. Let's support the establishment of a new research institute aimed at furthering our technological superiority. Where reactionaries doubt every discovery and stand wary of change, we embrace them and become stronger every year!"
FRA_military_buildup_three:0 "Further Military Development"
FRA_military_buildup_three_desc:0 "Our economy is now well developed and the Commune is ready for war, but we can always do better. By encouraging further industrial projects, the Commune shall not only be ready for war but will indisputably be superior in every way to any of our enemies. We will prove to the world that the Commune will not be defeated!"
FRA_military_science:0 "Military Science"
FRA_military_science_desc:0 "France is always working on improving its research networks, but theoretical sciences can only bring us so far. We will open a new wing in the Blanqui research institute dedicated to military science, allowing us to fund and develop new breakthroughs that will be immediately put to use by our army."
FRA_synthetic_refineries:0 "Synthetic Resources"
FRA_synthetic_refineries_desc:0 "France is great and resourceful, but it does not have everything. Oil, rubber, tungsten and chromium all lack, and we may not always rely on foreign exporters when conflict comes. We must research news ways to acquire these resources from what we already have. Some scientists even suggest we may be able to engineer those resources."
FRA_secret_weaponry:0 "Electric Machines"
FRA_secret_weaponry_desc:0 "While computing traces back to the tabulating machine, we have since made massive breakthroughs in the field of computing. Our mathematicians already assure use that those new machines are of a tremendous help for rapid and efficient calculus. Given some patronage and time, we can only imagine the possibilities of this new field."
FRA_damocles:0 "The Damocles Project"
FRA_damocles_desc:0 "Inspired by the Cambridge Conference during the Tenth  Internationale Congress, a reunion took place today at the University of Cambridge. A group of theoretical physicists from Britain and France are requesting funding for the establishment of the 'Damocles Project', a joint British-French committee for nuclear research."
FRA_nuclear_weapons:0 "Curie Project"
FRA_nuclear_weapons_desc:0 "While the Damocles Project held great promise, the refusal by the Union of Britain to take part crippled the cooperation between our scientists and theirs. Regardless, we must persevere and try to figure out what uses we can make of the atom. We will dedicate this project to the very woman who discovered Radium and set us on this path."
FRA_German_borders:0 "Fortify the German Border"
FRA_German_borders_desc:0 "We have already built a fairly impressive network of fortifications along the Meuse river and the border with Flanders-Wallonia. Regardless, we can improve it with new constructions and cutting-edge military installations like radio stations and modern artillery guns. Something the Republic would have never bothered to do, surely."
FRA_extend_line:0 "Extend the Line"
FRA_extend_line_desc:0 "While we have mostly focused our fortification efforts on those segments of the line that are the most defensible, it is quite obvious that Germany will target our weaker points instead. The solution is quite simple, we will not have weakpoints. Least they learn how to walk on water, good luck for them to cross this line!"
FRA_Demand_Romandy:0 "Demand Haute-Savoie"
FRA_Demand_Romandy_desc:0 "The illegal Swiss occupation of Haute-Savoie has gone on for far too long! The Swiss have shown themselves brutish tyrants and oppressors of our people on our own rightful land! No-one can have the audacity to persecute and hunt down Frenchmen and think they may get away with it, the perfidious Swiss have made their last mistake."
FRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine:0 "Demand Alsace-Lorraine"
FRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine_desc:0 "The French people shall wait no longer! The time has finally come for Germany to return the whole of Alsace-Lorraine or face the ultimate consequences!

FRA_war_with_spain:0 "Liberate Iberia"
FRA_war_with_spain_desc:0 "Right at our southern border, just across the Pyrenees, capitalism and imperialism still persists. With our efforts, we will achieve what no french imperialist could - total control of Iberia. But we are different. We do it for the common people, not imperial ambitions. Syndicalism will succeed in Iberia!"
FRA_War_with_germany:0 "Take Down Germany"
FRA_War_with_germany_desc:0 "Much to our surprise, the German reactionaries have ceded Alsace-Lorraine. But we never intended to just stop there!

They will just wish they had lost the first war, for we will stop at nothing until they are utterly destroyed!"
FRA_peace_with_germany:0 "Peaceful Coexistence"
FRA_peace_with_germany_desc:0 "Much to our surprise, the German reactionaries have ceded Alsace-Lorraine. With this being the case, many have called for us to end hostilies against the Reich. After all, if they handed us back our rightful lands, who's to say we can't get along? "
FRA_War_with_austria:0 "Turn the Danube Red"
FRA_War_with_austria_desc:0 "The Austrian peoples have proven their incapability to commence a successful socialist revolution in their country and liberate themselves from the Habsburg tyranny.

FRA_War_with_Netherlands:0 "Around Ludendorff"
FRA_War_with_Netherlands_desc:0 "Lowlands of Benelux are strategically vital to our war efforts. The Germans will not expect the attack from this side and if we succeed, we will cut Germany off from it's vital economic areas in the Rhineland. Germany will fall."
FRA_War_with_Britain:0 "Counter the Counter-Revolution"
FRA_War_with_Britain_desc:0 "The revolutionary government on the isle of Britain has fallen and has been replaced with one that is once again oppressing the British worker. We must liberate them from the chains of reactionary folly and restore freedom to their working class."
FRA_World_revolution:0 "World Revolution"
FRA_World_revolution_desc:0 "With the Revolution now well established in Europe, we can start to look outwards and launch a formidable plan to liberate the whole world from the reactionaries and imperialists.

FRA_european_revolution:0 "European Revolution"
FRA_european_revolution_desc:0 "While the idea of a World Revolution is noble, we have to stay realistic.

Vive la République Socialiste Européene!"
FRA_peaceful_revolution:0 "Peaceful Revolution"
FRA_peaceful_revolution_desc:0 "We hear those who claim that the Revolution cannot end, and it will not. However, we cannot afford to constantly wage war in all corners of the world without cause.

FRA_mission_bhartiya:0 "Mission to the Bharatiya Commune"
FRA_mission_bhartiya_desc:0 "The Bharatiya Commune asked for our support in their struggle against its neighbours, the Delhi imperialists and the Princely Federation reactionaries.

FRA_arab_committee:0 "Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee"
FRA_arab_committee_desc:0 "The traitors of the French people, bastard Petain and his clique of friends, use the native proletariat in efforts to return to the mainland.

FRA_working_women:0 "Working Women"
FRA_working_women_desc:0 "During the Congress, Helen Crawfurd took the stage with her flaming speech about the women's role in the World Revolution.

The reactionaries can gawk, we will surely have the last laugh."
FRA_avantgarde:0 "International Avant-Garde"
FRA_avantgarde_desc:0 "For too long have traditional arts and classical music dominated the entertainment of the masses. While Jazz is enjoyable and widely popular in our countries, one genre cannot fight against all others. We have to create new ones, we have to show the world, what the real entertainment is. And it will show to the world that we are the good force of this era!"
FRA_help_cnt:0 "Support the CNT"
FRA_help_cnt_desc:0 "Our comrades of the CNT are fighting against the Carlist and Bourbon reactionaries to liberate the whole of Spain, and probably soon the whole Iberian Peninsula, as we speak.

FRA_second_inter_congress:0 "The Tenth Internationale Congress"
FRA_second_inter_congress_desc:0 "With the Second  American Civil War raging on, as well as a number of other conflicts ready to break out at any time across the world, the Internationale has to consider its approach towards the Global Revolution. Since the Ninth Congress of the Internationale took place in France, the Tenth one will take place in Britain."
FRA_scientific_cooperation:0 "International Scientific Cooperation"
FRA_scientific_cooperation_desc:0 "It is clear that we cannot simply keep our own technological discoveries to ourselves. During a meeting at the old university of Cambridge, we decided to establish a worldwide plan to combine the technological advances of Socialist countries. Some however, call for a more ambitious plan, including industrial investment."
FRA_third_inter_congress:0 "The Victory Congress"
FRA_third_inter_congress_desc:0 "The responsibility of holding the Third Congress has once again fallen back to us, with the new site chosen for the task being the Palace Populaire, where the Louvre once stood full of the plunders of the French Empire. Fittingly, one of the topics at hand concerns finally liberating the African continent."
FRA_end_GEX:0 "The End of the Kaiser"
FRA_end_GEX_desc:0 "Africa has long suffered under tyranny and oppression.

FRA_armee_de_lair_desc:0 "Planes are a strange new aspect of warfare. These machines are quite complex to handle, and the punishment for failing to fly properly obvious. And yet, any able man can be a pilot. We must open the ranks of the air force to the conscripts, like the army and navy has. Our air force will have no shortage of pilots."
FRA_amateur_pilots:0 "Amateur Pilots"
FRA_amateur_pilots_desc:0 "No-one is born a pilot, and while some study to excel at air handling and combat and their efforts are admirable, we cannot expect every single pilot to be an ace.

FRA_st_exp_doctrine:0 "St-Exupéry Doctrine"
FRA_st_exp_doctrine_desc:0 "Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is a brilliant aviator, and he has much to teach us about this new, strange world of air warfare. While his words are no gospel, we heavily value his unique experience and aim to make his teachings the frame of future air doctrine. A start, certainly."
FRA_ecole_air:0 "Ecole de l'Air"
FRA_ecole_air_desc:0 "As our air doctrine rapidly expands and air fights go from disorganised brawls to carefully crafted engagements, we desperately begin to need trained pilots and trained officers who can plan air campaigns as they plan land or naval campaigns. Only our wits will work in this brand new field of warfare, and luckily we have some."
FRA_air_bases:0 "Establish More Air Bases"
FRA_air_bases_desc:0 "Planes require air bases to land, refuel, rearm, repair and take off, much like navies. But unlike navies, they cannot stay airborne for months, only hours. As such, we must ensure our air base coverage is excellent, and we must make sure we are always under capacity so that our air force is never crippled by lacking infrastructure."
FRA_fighters:0 "Fighter Focus"
FRA_fighters_desc:0 "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for our enemies, and as such it is a new angle of defence for us. Unlike on land, there are no forts, no cover, just one-on-one dogfights. If we invest in fighter production, we ensure no-one will freely navigate our air. Our fighters will always be upon them and ready to bring them back to the ground."
FRA_bombers:0 "Bomber Focus"
FRA_bombers_desc:0 "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for us, and it is one our enemies might not defend adequately against yet. Bombs present a single yet elegant way of transporting ordnance from the hangar to the target. We must invest in bombers to ensure that our enemies are assaulted from all sides, an advantage we cannot ignore."
FRA_strat_bombers:0 "Strategic Destruction Focus"
FRA_strat_bombers_desc:0 "If one bomb works well against an enemy, then ten bombs must only work better. Further development in bomber models have unveiled new air frames capable of carrying massive amounts of bombs, or a few devastatingly big bombs. Whatever the case, we may soon flatten entire cities or armies with a few waves of air attacks."
FRA_paratroopers:0 "Paratroopers Development"
FRA_paratroopers_desc:0 "Until now, we have always considered that the only way to transport troops are trucks and landing craft.

Doctor Joseph-Ignace Guillotin merely suggested the use of of what came to be known as the guillotine due to humanitarian concerns, for it was to be a more painless and less brutal method.

comfrance.1.d:0 "The Third Republic ended the way it began: defeated by German arms and facing socialist revolution at home. In the November of 1919, a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. The old order was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in subsequent months the French establishment was forced out of the mainland by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, the self-styled 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Bourse Générale du Travail. However, by 1936, the consensus that was reached in order to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is being deemed as increasingly outdated by many critics, and there are growing calls for more radical policies. France is increasingly confident in her security and in her mission, but the French revolutionary tradition is disparate, and it is unclear precisely which ideological strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

It would be obvious for Léon Jouhaux, one of the founding fathers of the Commune and the very first Chairman of the BGT, to return to this position. But Benoît Frachon denounced the periods of inequity in governance that France had undergone when Jouhaux was Chairman, and offered to assume the position himself, pointing to his many feats of arms during the Revolution. The respected unionist Jean Zyromski, one of the leading voices for the improvement of the CGT's internal democratic system, also put himself forward as a candidate, claiming to be able to preserve the organization's internal stability by appeasing the supporters of both Jouhaux and Frachon."

Louis Niel, the Bourse Générale du Travail Chairman, has announced that he and the Assembly would elect a new Chairman itself to lead a compromise cabinet, and also to avoid deeper internal struggles between Jacobins and Sorelians. The two most prominent candidates are Missak Manouchkian, who proposed creating a broad government based on compromise, with greater emphasis on direct democracy in the communes, and Marcel Cachin, an orthodox Communist who is a member of the Jacobins but has many connections in the CGT, and who wants to create a Communist-Unionist compromise. The Parti-Républicain Socialiste of the CFDT, led by the charismatic Joseph Paul-Boncour, tried to negotiate with the CFTC, a Christian union representing rural interests, and Gaston Vidal's veterans."

Every day more workers join the struggle of this frontline of imperialism, and if we are to believe our comrades the entire continent is one push away from Liberation. A packed audience listened eagerly to heroic tales of Patagonian revolutionaries, latest updates from the still fresh Nicaraguan revolution or stories from veterans of the Mexican Revolution, which inspired the whole of Latin America.

French and British governments held highly secretive talks, and slowly, but surely one realisation came to all: now might be the hour, now might be the moment, a tremendous effort must be undertaken. However, what exactly this tremendous effort would be proved controversial and when the Congress finally reassembled for a voting session, debates lasted well into the night, with positions ranging from issuing a mere condemnation to calls for immediate armed struggle.\n\nUltimately, it was decided that a framework for deeper international collaboration would soon be established under the auspices of the Third Internationale and socialist great powers. Help towards the development of socialist economies, greater economic integration, research and development programs, as well as permanent international cooperation councils would help the world’s free nations act as one to prepare for the final struggle. Simultaneously, initiatives to more concretely support socialist efforts in capitalist nations would be undertaken, both openly and covertly. Naturally, details would still be left for governments to fill in, but the proposal was approved almost unanimously. Only one thing was left to vote on, the name of this initiative. A French delegate proposed the 'Phalanstère', in homage to the harmonious and self-sustaining communities established by utopian socialist Charles Fourier, a proposal which proved instantly popular: by building this International Phalanstère, the workers of the world will soon conquer the utopia they have earned."

Many delegates came forward to deliver their final remarks and thank their comrades.\n\nWhen they come home, the delegates will have to grapple with the consequences of one of the greatest event since the revolutions, certainly an opportunity for decisive action. But before that, a ceremony was organised to properly send them off. On the Montmartre hill, birthplace of the 1871 Commune of Paris, a great performance open to the public was given, showcasing the best French artists, regional costumes and traditions, as well as athletic feats and technological innovations. It was followed by an immense banquet of dishes from all around the Commune for the many delegates, which lasted until well into the night.

This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities.\n\nFearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently, other than Blum himself, the still-respected general Maurice Gamelin."

The Paris Trial aims to prove that Blum and his associates have undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off.

Years and after years, intense mobilisation on this day led to more street confrontations, often more victims. On this International Workers' Day, soon known colloquially as Labour Day, proletarians refused to work, and marched for their rights, waving the red flag, singing the Internationale, wearing the red eglantine or the lily of the valley wrapped in scarlet cloth on their jackets in memory of the bloodshed. This commemorative, oppositional holiday, this day of freedom snatched from the jaws of Capital, rightfully shook the bourgeoisie.\n\nWith the Revolution, the First of May was declared a national holiday and quickly became a day of great official celebrations and commemorations, marches, popular events and dances. At home, a celebration of the Revolution and the liberated workers, abroad still a day of struggle, until one day the wind of revolutionary freedom blows on all corners of the Earth.

Legion outposts can be found across France and the Sorelian Red Eagle can be found flying high above well armed militants loyal to Valois. \n\nSince the victory of the Sorelians there has been suggestions to merge the Legion with the French Revolutionary Army, despite resistance from notable generals such as Maurice Gamelin, on this day the Legion will officially be incorporated into thr military under the command of General Marcel Bucard."

comfrance.903.t:0 "The Sorelian Movement"
comfrance.903.d:0 "The Sorelian movement was born from the participation and support of the think tank Cercle Proudhon led by Édouard Berth and George Valois for the Communard Revolution of 1919. This intellectual circle, originally composed of many members of the Action Française, was first dedicated to the study and discussion of the works of Georges Eugène Sorel and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, which resulted in the realization of a coherent and intellectual ideology rejecting the liberal poison and proposing a model of Decentralist and Nationalist Syndicalist society serving as a base for the development of the heroic and warrior individual, who would compose the organic vanguard of this new society, eternally devoted to the protection of his homeland, fellow workers and families, in the face of external threats such as the German menace or internal ones such as the vicious Jews. Following the revolution the group saw its members increase, counting certain 'right-wing socialists', members of organizations such as the SFIO, in its ranks.\n\nSo much so that this intellectual group became influential within the CGT, although it was not a union and thus did not have delegates in the Bourse Général du Travail, the Sorelian ideals had won over many unionists sitting in the BGT, among them Marcel Bucard. If Valois lead the organization and is considered its thinking head, Bucard represents the man of action who allowed it to find a certain popular support. Indeed, Bucard formed a troop of loyal legionnaires ready to defend France against any threat, and although many of them does not have the ideological finesse of Valois and Berth, they constitutes the armed wing of the Sorelian movement with a significant presence on the streets and not excluding violence as a mode of action, inspired by the Camelots du Roi of Action Française. With this growing intellectual influence within the CGT ensured by George Valoios combined with the popular spirit of Bucard's legionnaires, it would seem that the influence of the Sorelians is not to be underestimated and is growing day by day."

A motion of censure has been filed by Maurice Thorez against the Secretary-General of the Party Pierre Semard. In it Thorez denounces Semard's perceived inactivity and his inability to lead the Communist cause. Indeed, Pierre Semard, who became Secretary-General of the party in 1924, led a policy of integrating the PCF into the Communard Syndicalist system. Semard, himself a Communist trade-unionist known for his anarcho-syndicalist sympathies, succeeded thanks to a group of loyalists in transforming the party of dogmatic bureaucrats into a real political force of the Commune, the most important formation of the CGT-FO, representing the Leninist cause while respecting Communard democracy.\n\nHowever, the years of stagnation of the Syndicalist system weakened Semard's faction and gave voice to new radical groups. Maurice Thorez, nicknamed the Son of the People, quickly became the main figure of the internal opposition, advocating a return to 'Pure Marxism', demanding a dismantling of the current corrupt political system of the Commune, replacing it with a system of Democratic Centralism centered around the PCF, as well as a radical transition towards a true proletarian economy and the creation of a 'New Socialist Man', inspired by Marx, Engels and Lenin but also by currents of the French Revolution such as the Conspiracy of Equals of Gracchus Babeuf. Jacques Doriot, for his part, created a Communist and Nationalist movement that soon won over the Young Communists who gave him their support, demanding a radical revenge against Germany, while taking inspiration from Louis Auguste Blanqui and Revolutionary nationalism as it was practiced during the Revolution of 1789.\n\nThese two men have their differences but unite to propose this motion of censure, it succeeded with the support of 60% of the Party delegates. Put in the minority, Semard resigned and Thorez was quickly elected Secretary-General, despite this new leadership, now that they are no longer united against a common enemy, Thorez and Doriot seem to enter more and more into open conflict. In any case, this new leadership of the PCF will lead it into a policy of frontal opposition to the current political system, bringing a large part of the CGT-FO delegates with them."

Despite the obvious threat that holding a public funeral ceremony creates it was agreed by the Sorelian Council that they must not give into fear. Parisian police, a reserve infantry division and members of the Revolutionary Legion flooded the streets whilst the citizens of Paris flocked to pay their respects. The Red Eagle banner was hung from building to building, torches were carried by a parade of gloomy looking legionaries, an atmosphere of depression had engulfed the city. Valois’s body was preserved in a glass coffin surrounded by large golden eagles posing ominously. The chairman had only served for a short time however his impact on the Commune will last for an era..."

comfrance.904.t:0 "The Darkest of Days"
comfrance.904.d:0 "On this day the entire nation mourns the tragedy of our late Chairman. While Chairman Valois was giving a fiery speech to the enthusiastic public beneath the Arc de Triomphe three anarchist assassins managed to get past security and the crowd; one of them proclaimed Valois as a traitor to the revolution firing his pistol at a bewildered Valois whilst the other two threw homemade explosives at the stage. The resulting blast injured all three men on the stage, the latter two being Valois' right-hand man Jacques Arthuys and the economic mastermind and Revolutionary Syndicalist mystic Édouard Berth. All three were immediately driven to the nearest hospital whilst brave legionaries returned fire at the terrorist scum, two were shot dead whilst the last is in captivity. Thankfully camrades Arthuys and Berth survived the explosion with minor injuries however Valois did not, despite the hospital’s best efforts, the resulting blast and stray bullets where too much for the aging leader. Our dear Chairman was a true revolutionary and his ideals will not be forgotten nor will his death be in vain.\n\nThe difficult task of choosing a successor now falls upon the Sorelian high council. The fate of France has once again been radically altered."

comfrance.907.d:0 "Up until now the Armée Révolutionnaire Française has been composed of ideologically dedicated and loyal soldiers however is rife with disorganization, self-driven goals and lazy generals unable to efficiently communicate with each other. According official Sorelian reports that ends now, with General Marcel Bucard in control of military affairs, the armed forces can finally receive the modernisation it severely requires.\n\nOnly the most loyal generals will receive promotions directly from Chairman Valois, the differing militias will be organised into a unified standing army and the nation’s increased focus on industry will allow for the highest grade military weapons and gear to be provided to soldiers. These are the promises that Bucard has pledged and in return Valois has granted him unrestricted authority in military affairs, he now reports only to the Chairman himself."

comfrance.908.t:0 "An Overseen Decentralization"
comfrance.908.d:0 "With the election over and the Sorelians securing the majority vote, Chairman Valois sets out to accomplish his first order of business, decentralizing the government. For too long the French proletariat have been held back by the bureaucratic binds of the Syndicalistes. The Sorelians will not stand for this anymore, we must ensure that the libertine autonomous communes are transformed into true revolutionary provinces as envisioned by Sorel. Marcel Bucard has addressed the BGT on behalf of Valois asserting the legality of these changes in the name of protecting the Rejuvenation."

comfrance.909.d:0 "Within the Commune of France there are numerous unions vying for control of the country’s politics.These unions hold differing loyalties, some support the Anarchists, some the Syndicalistes and even a few loyal to the Jacobins. These ideological differences are unacceptable and stand in the way of true French unity. If we are to move forward with decentralizing the government, we need to unite the people under our political beliefs. Revolutionary Legion commander, Marcel Bucard, has launched coordinated raids on important union headquarters with hundreds of union leaders being arrested under the crime of disloyal ideals. Once again the Legion has succeeded in defending the revolution."
comfrance.909.a:0 "We shall bring the unions back into the fold, through negotiations or force."

comfrance.910.t:0 "Tensions Arise Within the Sorelians"
comfrance.910.d:0 "After the death of Georges Valois, the Sorelians have split between several factions inside the party. The largest and most influential one being the Revolutionary Francists led by Marcel Bucard. Despite many minor factions existing too, Bucard's men have been actively fighting to change that status and ensure their dominance over the party. Caught in between the crossfire is the newly inaugurated president of the Sorelian Council, Jacques Arthuys, who has forged close relations with many factions in an attempt to maintain some sort of stability."

comfrance.912.d:0 "Jacques Arthuys, current President of the Sorelian council which is acting as the interim government, has called for unity in the Sorelian party in response to the factional division. He has called for the minor factions and the Revolutionary Francists to make peace until the Black Guard insurgency is dealt with. In his most recent speech to the council he stated it would be useless to fight for dominance over the nation if the party cannot even assert dominance over its own internal affairs."

comfrance.913.t:0 "Rise of the Black Guard"
comfrance.913.d:0 "In direct response to the oppressive Sorelian rule over political opposition, anarchists have united under one movement. Named the ‘Black Guard’, its purpose is to destabilize France through bombings, assassinations and vandalisim. Inspired partially by the Illegalist movement, which has taken some power within the rebel circles. The Guard have made it clear they will stop at nothing to destroy the Revolutionary Syndicate. It’s rumoured that the main leader of the Black Guard is famed Ukrainian anarchist who was exiled to France, Nestor Makhno. The Sorelians, after hearing about these rumors, ordered a raid of Makhno’s residence. However, upon the initial raid Makhno was nowhere to be found further fueling these rumors. The underground movement has so far proved difficult to deal with due to its secretive nature and seemingly random attacks."

comfrance.914.d:0 "After the tense vocal altercations between Marcel Bucard and other minor figures which left the Sorelians fractured into multiple camps, our glorious defender of stability Jacques Arthuys has used his influence and respect to cool tensions. At the first Sorelian conference following Chairman Valois’ assassination both men stood on stage and expressed their newfound determination to maintin unity for the sake of avoiding anarchy. Despite these seemingly good news the forces of Socialists not allied with the Makhnovite movement have been uniting under the leadership of the Neo-Socialist Marcel Déat. What's worse is that no one knows what his current intentions are."

comfrance.915.d:0 "After the death of Georges Valois, the Sorelian factions have been rioting in the streets, fighting each other despite being inside the same party. This is, however, not the best position for any faction as Anarchists and Anarcho-Syndicalists are growing stronger, also with the remaining Socialists coalescing around the Neo-Socialist thinker Marcel Déat."

comfrance.917.t:0 "Sorelian Politicians Executed By Black Guard Militants!"
comfrance.917.d:0 "After a week of no response, the Black Guard militants have started executing Sorelian politicians held as hostages. The Black Guard generals have said that they will, again, not stop until their demands are fulfilled. Their demands are the replacement of current leadership with Black Guard leader Nestor Makhno, the permanent banning of Sorelians from office, and execution of Bucard and Arthuys. Until then, the march towards Paris continues."

comfrance.918.d:0 "The anarcho-syndicalist unions have declared loyalty to the Black Guard and their leader Nestor Makhno. While the collaboration of anarchists and Anarcho-Syndicalists has been noted, this development means that the Black Guard now has full leadership of the anarchist factions. This is a very threatening development to the Sorelians, as the Black Guard are currently stopped outside of Paris. They have 24 hours left to fulfill the demands..."

comfrance.921.d:0 "Following the execution, Black Guard leaders have been getting desperate; showing themselves in public and being either arrested or gunned down. Today was an especially productive day as a large number of Black Guard leaders have been rounded up and executed. This is no doubt thanks to the collaboration of the Sorelian factions and also thanks to the incredible efforts of brave Legionary commanders!"

comfrance.922.d:0 "Today, after a very bloody hour, the Revolutionary Legion has finally crushed the anarchist riots in Paris. This uprising was allegedly an attempted coup launched by Nestor Makhno and remaining Black Guard loyalists. Clearly overestimating their support the anarchists failed to rally the numbers they hoped, and thanks to our counter intelligence commanders was able to lead a successful counter force of Legionnaires that flushed these scum from the streets of Paris. This event seems to have worsened their public image with Parisian residents also taking up arms and aiding in the roundup of suspected anarchists."

Makhno, according to investigators, was already dead by the time he had been found as his body was entirely drained of blood and ice cold with the only notable features being two bullet wounds to the back of the head.

comfrance.926.d:0 "Now that the major threat has been dealt with, it’s time to get back on track and finish what was started before. The only major contender left is the Revolutionary Francist faction leader Marcel Bucard, who is very popular among the Revolutionary Legion. While the results were being counted a bomb suddenly went off, no doubt left by the last remaining Anarchsits in France. While members of the Revolutionary Legion started to recover from the blast and began looking for any culprit nearby a mass gathering has stormed the Council chamber! It was none other than Marcel Déat and his moderate allies, sick of the terror brought upon France by the Sorelians!"

comfrance.927.d:0 "Futurism is an artistic and social movement that has existed since the 20s however as of recently has emerged in French society as a popular force. Emphasising speed, technology, youth and violence, the Futurist movement wishes to abolish all elements of the past whilst it’s leaders, who comprise mostly of artists and poets, rally the youth towards autopia where man has triumphed over nature. The movement’s increasingly notable force in politics is credited to Marcel Bucard’s favourable opinion of Futurism, Revolutionary Francist Sorelianism has some striking similarities with the glorification of violence, rally of the youth and a rejection of bourgeoisie traditionalism being examples.\n\nIn return Futurists, Surrealists and other subsections of the growing Avant-Garde have lent their support to Bucard with many prominent figures, such as Félix Del Marle, meeting the Chief in Paris to discuss how best to abolish reactionary art."

Owing to the popularity of Déat's policies amongst the voting public, many of his allies within the right-wing of the SFIO, the Republican-Socialists and former Jacobins felt the pressure to submit to the authority of the PSdF. The new party shall now guide France toward's the vision that Neosocialism has laid out before the masses, and also ensure that republican authority shall never falter again and allow madmen like Bucard anywhere near the seat of power."

They advocate economic planning and the pursuit of technology in order to raise the efficiency of the nation, which makes them natural allies to the Neo-Socialist ministries established under Déat. While movements like theirs have been shunned by the CGT for supposed 'anti-syndicalist deviation', the implementation of Planisme has made many bright minds come out of the shadows, ready to serve our France. This has also resulted in many members of the Synarchist movement, long-believed to have been just a conspiracy theory by more paranoid communards, to approach Marcel Déat and offer their help and expertise in exchange for an official spot within our government, creating a new faction led by François Lehideux."

It is nescessary then, as a revolutionary Sorelian State, that we seek to estabilish at all costs a French society that is unlike the ones that preceded it in the last 1000 years - one of strength, vitality, and human perfection. The Frenchman must at all costs rival and go beyond the prowess of the German Ape-Man, who is such a brute that they lack even the most basic understanding of the world like we have. The Frenchman, unlike the German counterpart, has always had an underlying sense of vitality and strength, one that was beyond all his neighbors which were either falling asleep in their siestas or being so stupid that they can't change the oil on a lamp. It is nescessary then, to enact an enormous and violent purge of the weak which corrupt French society and have done so for the last thousand years, much like a class war which instead of involving the ruled and the ruler, it instead involves the weak and the strong. Therefore, the Revolutionary Legion has now made tremendous efforts to cleanse our lands of those considered feminine, weak, and frail, and raise up to the sky those who are strong, vital, and in unending militancy against the Ape-German and other reactionaries."

The Communist Revolution and its project were realized within the Proletarian Commune of France. The nation and the people can now fully enjoy a perfected strain of Marxism, one free from the taint that is Revisionism.

Chairman Doriot proclaimed that the victory of the Workers Force shows that the true Revolution has never been implemented, and that to save Socialism it must once again become French.\n\nThis new Commune, he says, must do away with the ideals of Faure, Sorel, and other fifth-columnists and realize the incredible and rich history of Revolution and revolt. France is undoubtedly a Nation born out of Revolution, a state that thrived thanks to it.

Despite, or perhaps because of the famous history of Catholic resistance to Revolutionary arms back during the Great French Revolution the villages and smaller towns of Vendée were left uncontested by the forces which overthrew the defeated Republic after the Weltkrieg. The people had to accept the reality of living within this new Commune and went back to their daily lives, still holding to their religious views as in many other rural regions of France. The CGT was, at least according to them, not foolish enough to try and uproot the faith dominant in the so-called 'Eldest Daughter of the Church'. There was, unfortunately for them, a change in Communard management recently.\n\nAt the wake of dawn Jacobin militants put the entire region of Vendée under siege as a show of their newly gained force. Carefully checked lists of priests according to their level of education were circulated amongst these forces, with a mission to capture the men of the cloth that could prove useful to scientific endeavours. All others, and the backwards peasantry that would dare to defend them, would be liquidated. This new 'Guerre de Vendée' was over in a matter of mere hours, the toll of blood no where near approaching the Great Revolution's era one for the Jacobins merely wanted to make this a symbol, not a massacre. In this new Revolutionary Republic all obsolete deities were to be discarded, the enemies of the Chairman broken, and those useful assigned to the great research work that would benefit France itself and not some illusionary entity.

Thus, the new policy was introduced as a means of slowly reducing Petit-Bourgeois Syndicalism by disbanding all dangerous and overly-powerful unions that have over 1,000,000 members, while keeping those that genuinely support the Worker."

Indeed following the collapse of the Marseillan municipal government, local anarchists were in the process of establishing a free commune when suddenly mafiosos led by Paul Carbone, the 'Emperor of Marseille', and the Guérini brothers, normally rivals but seeming to have allied themselves against us, began to violently shoot the revolutionary leaders present on the Vieux Port before announcing that the city was now theirs.\n\nIt seems that the mayor of the SFIO close to the Milieu, Gaston Defferre, delivered them weapons and secret plans of the city in exchange for safe conduct to Corsica, allowing the Mafia to easily take control of the city. The anarchists who survived the massacre returned to find the Black Guard at Aix-en-Provence, led by Mahkno himself, asking them to for help. With the Mafioso 'government' collapsing visibly while the Guérinis and Carbone engaged in open war, the Guard and the Marseillans Militias were able to take advantage of this situation to quickly regain control of the city. The free commune of Marseille was proclaimed and the Mafioso leaders judged, but despite our best efforts we were unable to find either the Guérini or Carbone, there is no doubt that the Mafia does not intend to stop its operations any time soon..."

However, we must admit that for the moment the use of currencies cannot be entirely eliminated, as a system of local currencies dependent on communes and regional congresses has developed in our Free Territory. Campaigns to redistribute goods previously monopolized are being organized across the four corners of France, which seem to be bearing fruit. Some of the members of the Black Guard have proposed the creation of a currency that could be used on the scale of the entire territory, nicknamed the 'Franc Makhnoviste', but it seems that for the majority of our organization and of the people of free territory, this system of local and spontaneous exchanges is the way to follow for the moment."

Whilst violence, pillaging and looting from reactionnary rebels or Sorelians holdouts still sometimes affects our territory, there has been the development of a new successful society. Indeed, the various communes have managed to organize themselves and cooperate, and a new Anarchist society is blossoming in what was once the hell of statist repression: the Sorelian regime. Thanks to Makhno and the Black Guards, the people were given the means to govern themselves, on the basis of consensus and direct democracy.

So far, Mahkno and our other comrades have been bent on putting an end to the Sorelian regime by any means necessary, but now that our primary task has been accomplished, it's high time to decide what form of anarchism the Guard's main line will be, although unlike the Leninists, genuine freedom will always exist within our organization.\n\nMakhno and Arshinov, for their part, assert that Anarcho-Communism, or Libertarian-Communism, is the form of Anarchism best suited to France, a position shared by the majority of our members. However, the Illegalists, led by Duvas, Jacob and the Bande à Bonnot in particular, grew in influence and popularity during the Revolution against the Sorelians, giving them many supporters.

Rejecting morality and legality, Illegalists saw crime as a pursuit of one’s own desires and individuality.\n\nWith the totalitarian regime of the Sorelians, this strand of anarchism that is seen as radical even by anarcho-syndicalists has resurfaced amongst workers wishing to rebel against the Revolutionary Syndicate. Notorious anarchist Nestor Makhno, himself has begun to slightly drift towards Illegalism. Witnessing the failures of his anarcho-communist comrades in Ukraine and the failure of anarcho-syndicalists in both the Syndicalistes and Anarchistes to prevent the rise of the Sorelains, the ideas of the complete abolition of hierarchy and use of crime has been seen by Makhno as nescessary to free France.

During this time, our people and our government began to adopt different facets and facades of our past in order to bolster our resolve and to shield us from the coming horrors, and one such facet taken was Didot. Named after the famous family of printers, punch-cutters, and publishers, the Didot typeface or font was used by our first revolutionary governments throughout these long many decades, even being using to print Voltaire’s masterworks like La Henriade in 1818, and once again has been adopted, unofficially, by most posts and printshops in our new Commune - though its history of use in other French governments in the past like under the Directory or Napoleon has begun to be quietly erased from the record books. Keen on making this official and spreading the true People’s Font to all in France and the wider Internationale, our administration has moved to enshrine ‘the Didot’ as the official typeface of the government, as well as the preferred typeface we shall push onto the wider nation and unions around us, all in order to create a more uniform revolutionary culture that is still in touch with our French roots, binding us all together closer than ever before. \n\nThis plan to make Didot the official typeface of the nation has been met with great adulation, with even the great Cassandre - also known as Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron, the Father of French Graphic Design and master painter, poster artist, and typeface designer - publicly voicing his support for the initiative alongside a whole league of other French artists like the Cubism-Orphism focused Section d’Or, the Modernists like Henri Matisse - though many of their Enlightenment-loving kind find more purchase in the Algiers Government, and the leading trio of French Surrealists André Robert Breton, Louis Aragon, Philippe Soupault and their Dadaist companions, along with many more minor voices like the young upstart and protégé to Cassandre one Pierre Faucheux.

comfrance.1011.d:0 "The color of syndicalism is traditionally red, coming from the red flag of the labor movement, but a particular group of syndicalists seem to prefer yellow. With their origins in the strikes at the Schneider factories in Le Creusot in 1899, the Syndicalistes Jaunes first distinguished themselves from the 'Reds' by their support for discussions with the employers class aimed at improving working conditions, while rejecting strikes as a means of action. Their ‘yellow’ name came from a meeting these unionists were holding in a Montceau-les-Mines café to plan their action plan, when red unionists came to throw stones through the windows at the yellows; who then covered up the holes in the windows with yellow paper. Similar unions were organized in many other mining and labor centers across France, and even federated into the Union Fédérative des Syndicats et Groupements Ouvriers Professionnels de France et des Colonies, usually called Fédération Nationale des Jaunes de France (National Federation of the Yellows of France in English), originally created by the Left Boulangist Paul Lanoir, known the father of the ‘Syndicalisme Jaune’, before Pierre Biètry took control and relegated Lanoir to a minor position. The movement gradually radicalized, adopting a strong French nationalism, major anti-Semitism and violent forms of action rivaling even those of the Camelots du Roi of Action Francaise, even dreaming of ‘nailing Jaurès' carrion alive against a door ‘, unlike the traditional Syndicalist and Marxist, they also supports a form of class collaboration, but still dominated by the proletariat.\n\nWhen the Revolution broke out, the ambitious Biétry preferred to remain neutral at first, before joining the Revolution, believing it to be the only way to save France from German aggression and the quickest way for his unions to gain strength and influence. Since then, the National Federation of the Yellows of France joined the democratic Communards system, although a minor union, the Federation can still find support in the more revanchist and nationalist layers of Communards society, and maintains links with the Sorelians. Internally, it is led with an iron fist by Pierre Biétry who intende to apply his nationalist principles, but is not opposed to Communard democracy as it exists now. However, within the Federation exists the Comité Central Socialiste Révolutionnaire (Socialist Revolutionary Central Committee) led by Lanoir. Affirming their left-wing Boulangist ideology, inspired mostly by Gabriel Terrail and Alfred Naquet, this committee disavows Communard democracy and wishes to replace it with a centralized system unified around a charismatic central figure, as General Boulanger was in the past, with the aim of guaranteeing the preservation of the nation and social rights for all.

Few of these brave men on the cause of peace are as prominent as René Cassin, a disabled war veteran from French Basque Country, who has worked tirelessly for those like him, men destroyed by the war physically. His organization, Union Fédérale des Associations Françaises d’Anciens Combattants et Victimes de Guerre, closely aligned with the UFAFC, has long championed for a solution to diplomatic disputes besides war.\n\nCassin speaks from experience, as he was gravely wounded during the Weltkrieg in 1916 while leading an unit, receiving hits to his hand, stomach and side. Crippled to the point of being unfit for service, he received a Croix de Guerre for his actions and was discharged of duty. Driven by the need to keep such a conflict from ever happening again, his organization has even covertly established connections with similar-minded German veterans, though how much these groups have managed to agree upon is unknown. As the Commune has exponentially geared towards a war with Germany, René Cassin has been at the forefront of criticizing this development, calling instead for the creation of an international organ that would promote peaceful solutions to disagreements between nations.

It has already been decided in advance that the leader of the Jacobins, Maurice Thorez, should be given a separate trial to personally decide his fate. It was also decided that the process for the other leaders should start as soon as possible."
comfrancegamelin.2.a:0 "Nobody is above the law!"

comfrancegamelin.3.t:0 "The Trials"
comfrancegamelin.3.d:0 "After a short preparation time, the day of the trial has arrived. There were over a dozen other defendants in the dock, along with well-known politicians and officers such as Jacques Duclos and Marcel Cachin, who were waiting for awaiting their verdict. The process spanned several days, filled with dramatic speeches by the defendants and courageous lectures by prosecutors. After all the defendants had finally been heard, the court withdrew for consultation for a further day after completion of the taking of evidence. The tension was virtually unbearable as the hour came for the verdict. The Supreme Judge began his speech to announce the verdict and it read ..."
comfrancegamelin.3.a:0 "...Hang those found most responsible, the rest shall be sentenced to life imprisonment."
comfrancegamelin.3.b:0 "...Lifelong imprisonment! Keep those traitors in chains forever!"

comfrancegamelin.4.t:0 "The Trial of Maurice Thorez"
comfrancegamelin.4.d:0 "A week ago, the other Jacobin leadership were sentenced by the court for their actions and now the head of this corrupt tyrannical clique will face an even worse fate. Maurice Thorez, chairman of the PCF and traitor to the commune, has now been brought to trial. The reading of all charges took more than two hours, and the subsequent trial took more than three days until the court closed the case and withdrew for the verdict. On the following day the verdict was finally announced. The court dismissed a life sentence because of the gravity of offenses and instead imposed the death sentence by firing squad. Throughout the trial,Thorez sat calmly without any emotion and did not say a word, and when he was given the final word after the sentence was pronounced, he said nothing and stared straight ahead. After that, the audience in the hall and the people in front of the courthouse broke out into thunderous jubilation.  Throughout France, citizens celebrated the end of the treacherous dictator. The following day at exactly six o'clock in the morning, the death sentence was carried out in public with Thorez blindfolded and tied to a post, whereupon cheers and applause broke out as the bullets lef the barrels of the firing squad. And so ended the failed Jacobin reign of terror in our nation."
comfrancegamelin.4.a:0 "Mort au traître! Vive la France!"

comfrancegamelin.5.t:0 "Declare Martial law!"
comfrancegamelin.5.d:0 "If we wish to restore order and stability our country, we have to declare martial law and expand the executive powers of the government. The Front Populaire will govern the nation and lead the reformation whilst the military under Maréchal Gamelin will assure the populace remains under control. While this will ensure that we have more room to act and that we can enforce our reforms, this won't be popular within the population which fears that we might become the very thing we swore to destroy..."
comfrancegamelin.5.a:0 "Do it! We have no other choice!"

comfrancegamelin.6.t:0 "Gamelin's Proclamation"
comfrancegamelin.6.d:0 "'My comrades! My friends! Today marks the day every Frenchman breaks the chains that have held him captive to this day! The traitorous machinations of the Jacobins were stopped and the syndicalist-democratic process in our country was restored! The heroes who willingly gave their lives for our freedom will never be forgotten and go down in history as heroes of the Syndicalist Revolution! But the smashing of the PCF alone is not enough to secure our country and the revolution, there is still much work to do! The reform plan that I and my government have prepared contains three core projects that we will implement in the coming years! 1. Strengthening the democratic process in the Commune through far-reaching reform of electoral law, the education system and the implementation of a large-scale anti-corruption campaign! 2. The consolidation of the Communard Spirit which forms the basis of our country, as well as the strengthening of the syndicalist way of life! And finally 3. The reform of the military and police forces to be able to better defend ourselves against internal dangers such as the PCF in the future, as well as against external threats such as our archenemy, the German Empire! Once this plan has been put into action, the commune will rise and shine in new splendor! Vive la révolution! Vive la Fédération des Communes de France!'"
comfrancegamelin.6.a:0 "On to a brighter future! Vive la France!"

comfrancegamelin.7.t:0 "Gamelin Reconstitutes the Garde Nationale"
comfrancegamelin.7.d:0 "Although the military are currently doing their best to restore order there simply is not enough soldiers to patrol the entire nation, therefore Gamelin has decided to establish a volunteer militia. The Garde Nationale, named after the organization de-established by the Third Republic following the events of the Paris Commune, are to be a gendarmerie tasked with combating any remaining Jacobin resistance, as well as any potential opposition from other problematic groups. Dressed in blue coats with a recognisable cap, they are to be armed and trained directly by the armed forces in order to act as a disciplined force."
comfrancegamelin.7.a:0 "Fitting indeed."

comfrancegamelin.8.t:0 "Léon Blum Appoints His Cabinet"
comfrancegamelin.8.d:0 "Prior to the Jacobin reign of terror, Léon Blum was not perceived by many as the future leader of anything within the Commune. After Louis Niel's investiture, the BGT seemed to regain some sort of unity, but it was not mean to last indefinitely as the battle between Léon Jouhaux and Benoît Frachon continued within the CGT, Blum on the other hand was a major figure within the SFIO yet a minor one in this clash for the BGT Chairmanship. However the Jacobin’s attempted purge of CGT politicians left many Syndicalistes to go into hiding, in a prison cell or dead, it was during this time of turmoil that Blum emerged. Uniting his comrades with the remnants of CGT, Republican-Socialists and Gamelin’s military friends he formed a united front to oppose Thorez.\n\nNow as head of government, serving as leader of the Commune under the protection of Maréchal Gamelin, he is tasked with forming a government to maintain the unity of the Front Populaire. Blum has already proven himself a successful man of action and capable of forming relations with political opponents, however without the threat of the Jacobins it will be a difficult task to keep the Front whole."

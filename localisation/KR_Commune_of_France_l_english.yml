### Leader Bios ###
## Commune of France ##
POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC:0 "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchiste to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Originally empowered to chairman in a compromise between the Travailleurs and Anarchistes, factionalism has grown considerably during his time in office, and the apparatus of the state has weakened. If any faction manages to gain a clear majority in the Comité de Salut Public and the Bourse Générale du Travail, Faure is likely to be ousted."
POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC:0 "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC:0 "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "General Maurice Gamelin has overthrown the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While his coup is an obvious affront to the already dubious Communard democratic process, many now regard Gamelin as the saviour of the Commune, and even syndicalism itself."
POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC:0 "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordiality with syndicalists and anarchists."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Georges Valois, an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian anarchist, fled his homeland for France following German intervention in the Russian Civil War. Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his French electoral victory. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future, but his support for decentralisation could forever transform the Commune."
POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC:0 "Jacques Doriot, veteran of the Weltkrieg, returned from captivity in Germany to find a France forever changed. His personal transformation from moderate socialist, to Leninist, and now national-syndicalist, has instilled in him an engrained proclivity for compromise."
POLITICS_VINCENT_AURIOL_DESC:0 "Vincent Auriol, long accused by hardline syndicalists of harbouring sympathies for the bourgeoisie, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. He advocates the gradual transition to a more democratic system of government in the Commune."
POLITICS_FELIX_GOUIN_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Born as Alfred-Georges Gressent, to a working-class peasant family in 1878, Georges was invested in politics from an early age. Becoming an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel whilst working as his secretary, however he was not always a man of the left. After publishing political thought directly inspired by his mentor, Sorel, he became an acquaintance of monarchist writer Charles Maurras. Joining Maurras’s movement, Action Française, he developed his ideology of fusing working-class based politics with monarchism. In 1911 he founded the Cercle Proudhon with fellow AF comrades, this group espoused national-syndicalism, integral nationalism and antisemitism whilst rejecting liberal and conservative democracy. Overtime as syndicalist movements evolved throughout France, the Cercle became overtly left-wing whilst maintaining an aggressively nationalist stance on world politics. When the French Civil War broke out, Valois took advantage of the crisis by turning his group into a fully fledged political movement. The Sorelians were born, disowning any previous reactionary views, Valois and his comrades took to streets of a broken France to demand the destruction of the French Third Republic.\n\n Now he has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny. He has also advocated for vengeance against Germany and the reclamation of lost French territory."
POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC:0 "Marcel Déat was born in 1894 to a modest family, in his youth he excelled at his studies and became involved in left-wing politics. A student of Radical politician Émile Chartier he joined the SFIO,  however this political stint came to end when the Weltkrieg broke out. A staunch patriot he enlisted in the French Army and saw active duty, earning the Legion of Honour and five bravery citations. The Weltkrieg shaped his political views, forging a deep hatred for Germany and the French elite who he saw as failing the nation. During the lead up the French Civil War, Déat has positioned himself to the right of the socialist movement, advocating for an authoritarian anti-capitalist state. His work was published by Valois who had taken interest in Déat and the two became fast allies, when the General Strike led to civil conflict Déat declared loyalty to the Sorelans.\n\nRepresenting the ‘Vanguardist’ faction of the Sorelians, Déat has proved himself to be an opportunist first, and ideologue second. Forging connections with former political enemies and taking action against fellow comrades, Déat has fought his way to the top of the Sorelian leadership. Now in control of the National Worker’s State, Chairman Déat can lead the authoritarian anti-capitalist regime he always envisioned."
POLITICS_MARCEL_BUCARD_DESC:0 "Many things Marcel Bucard has been called over the years. Syndicalist, Anti-semite, Nationalist, Worker. Beginning life as the son of a butcher in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Marcel Bucard initially studied to become a Catholic Priest. This all changed however with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg where he patriotically signed up to fight off the German horde in defense of the French nation rising through the ranks and winning admiration for fellow french patriots and friends in the trenches. No matter how hard he fought however the horrors of the war cemented his personal hatred for Germany and its mistreatment of the French people. Originally a reactionary, the Weltkrieg provided him with a deep hatred for the French upper-class who he saw as cowards for surrendering to the Germans. The revolutionary period that swept France saw the Bankers, Liberals, Capitalists, the exploiters of the French nation abandon it and flee with the riches of its people. Countering this was of the utmost personal importance to Bucard who joined Valois’s Sorelians, eventually taking leadership of his own faction, the ‘Ultranationalist-Syndicalists’. Giving speeches towards crowds of disenfranchised French patriots against 'Ruthless banking clans' and their 'Liberal lapdogs' he easily recruited among the galvanized Weltkrieg veterans.\n\nNow in control as the Chief of the National Worker’s State, Bucard sees the destruction of the German Empire as his main objective. To him, the superior French proletariat have smashed the chains of their masters and can no longer be defeated by any force!"
POLITICS_MAURICE_THOREZ_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez was born in Pas-de-Calais, France on the 28th of April, 1900. Becoming a coal miner at the young age of 12. He would go on to join the French Section of the Workers’ International at the age of 19. His time in the SFIO introduced him to Marxist thought, causing him to become enamored with the ideas of Communism and a very enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik uprising in Russia. The ultimate failure of the Bolsheviks led Thorez to conclude that they had not been pure or strong enough, that they had failed both Lenin, Marx, and Robespierre by their inability to take every measure necessary for the revolution. Thorez would take up arms in the Second French Revolution, declaring himself as a syndicalist to disguise his true communist nature. A charismatic leader, many flocked to him for his bold speeches and devotion to the Revolution. Once the Commune of France had been established, however, he revealed his true colors, declaring the Commune a bourgeois fourth republic, and converting his followers to the ways of communism. Now calling themselves the “Jacobins” after the radicals of Robespierre, Thorez and his followers became an immense thorn in the side of the CGT. Considering himself to be the successor to Robespierre and Lenin, Thorez would be dismissed as a political failure for his inability to win a seat in the CGT. But now with his rule secured by his astounding victory in the 1936 elections, the “political failure” is determined to live up to his predecessors and crush all who stand in his way of creating a true Communist French utopia."
POLITICS_FRENCH_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "With Chairman Valois now dead, power has been vested within the Sorelian Council. Valois never named his successor in the event of his death, therefore to avoid further conflict the Comité de Salut Public was formed. Chaired by Peirre Laval, the council lacks unity with it being split between two competing factions. Valois’s secretary, Marcel Déat leads the Vanguardists whilst commander of the Revolutionary Legion, Marcel Bucard, leads the Ultranational-Syndicalists. With the threat of anarchy looming, can the council unify behind a single leader or will it collapse..."
POLITICS_BLACK_GUARD_DESC:0 "Officially the ‘Free Territory of France’ has no leader, upon liberating towns Makhno’s men have announced their intention to leave all governing to the workers themselves. Laws and authority is enforced by fully autonomous communes which are usually commanded by a worker’s council. However despite this supposed unlimited freedom and abolition of all hierarchies, the most powerful man in the nation is undoubtedly Nestor Makhno. His role as the protector of anarchy allows him command large numbers of Black Guard soldiers who station themselves across the Free Territory. When his men require rest and food the citizens of communes oblige, Makhno chooses to not involve himself in the politics of anarchist communes however it would be unwise to challenge any decision he could make..."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "Born into a military family, 20 September 1872, Maurice Gustave Gamelin was always destined for military greatness. Entering into the Saint-Cyr Military Academy he graduated first in his class, going on to serve in Tunisia. Serving as attaché to future Marshal of France, General Joseph Joffre, this position provided Gamelin with a solid knowledge of strategic and tactical warfare. During the Weltkrieg he distinguished himself for helping plan the victory at the Battle of the Marne. Quickly being promoted all the way to Brigadier General however with the German offensive of 1918 pushing further and further into France, Gamelin was recalled to Paris. Leading a desperate defence of the capital he held the lines just long enough for a civilian extraction saving countless lives. After the war he maintained a high ranking position in the military, as civil tension escalated he refused to allow politics to sway his loyalty to France. When the syndicalist revolutionaries were successful, Gamelin offered his services to the government and was made Marshal of the Commune of France. This came to an end when the Jacobin regime was declared.\n\nAs the Jacobin rule of tyranny tore France apart, Gamelin realised that his backseat in politics must end. Forging an alliance Léon Blum, a Popular Front backed by the military, has overthrown Thorez’s dictatorship with Gamelin proclaimed as Maréchal. Many now regard Gamelin as the defender of Communard democracy, and saviour of France."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Born into a poor peasantry family in Ukraine, 26 October 1888, Nestor Ivanovych Makhno was forced to adapt quickly to a harsh life. Extreme poverty led to him finding work for himself, being employed at a local iron foundry he witnessed the rise of revolutionary anti-Tsarist politics. Having experienced the Tsarist Regime’s brutality himself he joined local anarchists and took part in robberies resulting in his imprisonment. When the Weltkrieg broke out he remained a prisoner, sentenced to death by hanging, this came to end with the Russian Revolution. Being freed he left for Ukraine, forming connections with anarchists he established the ‘Black Army’ to fight against both Ukrainian nationalists and the intervening German forces. When Germany secured its dominance of the nation he fled his homeland for France.\n\n Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his popularity and notability in French politics. Forming the ‘Black Guard’ terrorist organization which has now overthrown the Sorelian regime. With the failures of Ukraine and France, Makhno has been further radicalised by the Illegalists. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future. However his efforts to destroy any remnants of authority in the commune with the establishment of the ‘Free Territory of France’ have so far been successful. These successes may be in vain however, for his personal army of anarchists are the only thing that can prevent France’s neighbours from taking advantage of this chaos..."

### Ideas ###

THINT_exact_vengeance:0 "Desire for Revenge"

FRA_communard_spirit_idea:0 "Communard Spirit"
FRA_communard_spirit_idea_desc:0 "We are the legacy of the Paris Commune, the first socialist state ever created and then brutally repressed by the Republican reactionaries. In 1920, the workers finally got their revenge and overthrew the military junta of the 'Party of Order'. We, sons and daughters of Communards must protect our state and our spirit, we will not be commanded by tyrants anymore!"

FRA_bad_intel:0 "Inefficient Intelligence"
FRA_bad_intel_desc:0 "Ever since the Party of Order tried to stifle the worker's uprising in France, the idea of a centralised intelligence service is seen by many as a hallmark of the reactionary oppression of the post-Weltkrieg social movements. As a result, the Commune's intelligence services are limited to extremely scrutinised intelligence committees to prevent a repeat of this situation."

FRA_to_war_idea:0 "Revanchist Rearment"
FRA_to_war_idea_desc:0 "Our nation must rise again, if we want to defeat the Imperialists!"

#The three following ideas are extremely weird. Are they intended? Especially the third. Travailleurs and Sorelians both share it... I'm picking Travailleurs for now
FRA_economic_reforms_anar:0 "Economic Reforms"

FRA_economic_reforms_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

FRA_military_buildup_two_idea:0 "Calibrated Economy"
FRA_military_buildup_two_idea_desc:0 "As the world slowly approaches war again, we can rapidly capitalise on our healthy economy to rapidly switch parts of our economy to focus on military build-up. More factories are dedicated on arming our soldiers and building military structures, without any severe impact on our population."

FRA_ruralism_idea:0 "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_idea_desc:0 "The wide-reaching reforms to our industry and economy means than we no longer have massive industrial centres surrounding populous cities. This incidentally makes any attempt by enemy forces to cripple or even destroy our economy that much harder, with the biggest rural industrial centres far smaller and far more numerous than the great industry centres of Europe."

FRA_market_socialism_idea:0 "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_idea_desc:0 "Market Socialism is far more than a socialist interpretation of a market economy. By putting all the new worker cooperatives in a fair and equal competitive economy, we can make our civilian economy more dynamic and more efficient without having to directly intervene or go through slow, bloated unions in most cases."

FRA_mass_production_idea:0 "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_idea_desc:0 "Factories have always had a serious advantage over the artisan. By chaining production tasks, they can produce in a small frame of time infinitely more product without nearly equal quality. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent that process, let's improve on it. We seek absolute efficiency in production to beat the German capitalists."

FRA_modern_farms_idea:0 "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_idea_desc:0 "Farms are often seen as an old, quaint detail of the national economy, but we know better. By modernising and mechanising the Commune's farmlands, we can massively increase our agricultural output and both speed up and optimise harvest, production, refining and delivery. To our civilians, and to our troops."

FRA_war_eco_agri_idea:0 "War, Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Sorelian economy minister Jacques Doriot, the concept of War, Economy and Agriculture is an interesting one. Claiming that a war with Germany is not only inevitable but fast approaching, the Sorelians demand a rapid conversion to an economy whose industry can not only sustain a war, but whose agriculture can sustain its soldiers. In sum, a sort of total war economy."

FRA_inter_coop_idea:0 "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_idea_desc:0 "There is no shame in seeing what other countries are doing, and borrowing their new economic and industrial ideas to improve our own. Obviously, there are very few ideas we can seriously borrow from capitalist and reactionary societies, but our fellow Syndicalist brothers are fine examples at times."

FRA_dedication_idea:0 "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_idea_desc:0 "French workers work for more than their pay, and they certainly do not work at gunpoint. Every can they seal, every brick they lay, every rifle they assemble, every tank they weld together, is a service to their country and the spirit of the Commune at large."

FRA_industralization_idea:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_industralization_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Jacobin economy minister Jean Jérôme, Industrialisation is no strange concept to anyone in the Commune or abroad. This policy aims to rapidly increase the industrial capacity of France in order to catch up to our arch nemesis Germany. This is accompanied by a work culture and the creation of dedicated factory towns."

FRA_mass_fire_support_idea:0 "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_idea_desc:0 "Every man has his rifle and grenade, every squad has its machine gun. By organising our divisions to provide fire to each other, we can another a new layer of fire support. Every time a division advances, all the other divisions suppress the enemy. By doing this in waves, we can rapidly gain ground. Now to supply the equipment needed."

FRA_mass_conscription_idea:0 "Mass Conscription"
FRA_mass_conscription_idea_desc:0 "Whereas our enemies have trouble enlisting enough soldiers to fight their reactionary and imperialist wars, every man is ready to fight for the Commune. Let us mobilise as many as our economy can sustain, we will overwhelm the reactionaries with our ultimate dedication to the Commune."

FRA_empower_rifleman_idea:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_idea_desc:0 "The Rifleman is more than a soldier with a gun. For too long he has been seen as incapable of any higher thinking other than firing his rifle by monarchist officers, seeing the working man with disdain. We will not make this mistake, the Rifleman should decide local tactics, increasing his efficiency on the battlefield."

FRA_military_academy_idea:0 "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_idea_desc:0 "We have to face the harsh reality that the Weltkrieg led to the downfall of most of our prestigious, if reactionary, military academies. While some claim this to be an acceptable status quo, we know better. Let us invest in new military academies to train skilled officers, for the future of the Communal Army."

FRA_centralized_hc_idea:0 "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_idea_desc:0 "The new Communal Army was not built like the old French army, many Communards resenting the military administration that tried to stifle the Commune, but we cannot leave our Officer Corps shattered. Let us centralise our High Command again, to better organise things some people like to forget, like logistics."

FRA_tank_quality_line_idea:0 "Quality Tank Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_idea_desc:0 "What good is a tank if it doesn't perform as well as enemy tanks? We should not sacrifice on quality in favour of quantity, all this will lead to is more burning husks on the battlefield. Quality tanks, even if fewer in numbers, will take many times their numbers, making them a safe return on investment."

FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea:0 "Tank Assembly Line"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea_desc:0 "What good is a tank if the enemies have many more to throw against us? We cannot let perfectionists sabotage our assembly lines for minimal gains, or else we will be outnumbered. Quantity will allow us to overwhelm our enemies with entire divisions of cold hard steel, and many more shells flying at them."

FRA_fast_army_idea:0 "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_idea_desc:0 "Speed is more than a small advantage or a way to get to the next point faster. Speed is integral to warfare. Those who think that the next Weltkrieg will be fought in trenches are deluded at best, mobile warfare is the way of the future. We must capitalise on fast, motorised divisions, if not a motorised army."

FRA_Red_Army:0 "Red Grande Armee"
FRA_Red_Army_desc:0 "Our army is in better shape than ever to face the evils of this capitalist world."

Capital_Ship_Primacy:0 "Capital Ship Primacy"
Capital_Ship_Primacy_desc:0 "A grand navy will be crucial to defeat the Kaiserliche Marine and bring the pain to Germany's northern coast. And in that role, the grand Battleship still shines. Its naval artillery will flatten the reactionaries with rolling barrages of thunder and steel, and send their boats to the bottom of the sea."

Carrier_Primacy:0 "Carrier Primacy"
Carrier_Primacy_desc:0 "The future of naval warfare is not in big, clunky warships, but in a combined arms approach with another front of future warfare, air warfare. Let us ensure that every naval group has a Carrier. Its fighters will ensure global air dominance, its naval bombers will wreck enemy ships and harbours alike."

FRA_working_women_idea:0 "Working Women"
FRA_working_women_idea_desc:0 "For too long have women been suppressed by reactionary thinkers. Even under the French Republic, they selflessly supported the nation while our brothers were sent to the slaughter. It is time for us to recognise their contribution to society, and formalise the rights of the working woman, in peace and war."

FRA_bhartiya_support:0 "French Military Support"
FRA_bhartiya_support_desc:0 "We are receiving military support from our French allies. This selfless assistance will prove critical to defeating the reactionary Princely Federation and the imperialist Dominion of India. In time, we hope to repay France for their help, but for now we must focus on the task at hand."

FRA_amenagement_idea:0 "Aménagement of the Territory"
FRA_amenagement_idea_desc:0 "France has historically been a very centralised country, meaning that most of the development has been limited to industrial cities and population centres. We have funded large projects to ensure that all parts of our territory are developed to a satisfactory manner."

FRA_plan_prost_idea:0 "Plan Prost"
FRA_plan_prost_idea_desc:0 "Henri Prost's plans for highways linking the Paris suburbs has proved to be popular across the country. Many other municipalities like Lyon or Marseille have also signed up to the plan, and projects are already being drawn for a large highway network linking all of France's major cities together, from Lille to Toulouse."

FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes:0 "Paramilitary Gendarmes"
FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes_desc:0 "The Gendarmes are a fine organisation, a paramilitary police force capable of both civilian and military activities. While many have pushed to completely disband them, we will instead expand their activities to make them a parallel force to the French Communal Police."

FRA_secret_police:0 "Secret Police"
FRA_secret_police_desc:0 "There are still many enemies of the Commune inside the Commune, sometimes even inside positions of power or within the military. This push for transparency is dangerous, we must instead organise secret police operations to ensure the safety of the French people from internal influences."

FRA_demo_surete:0 "Sûreté Populaire Démocratique"
FRA_demo_surete_desc:0 "We cannot allow paranoia to lead to the destruction of the fine balance we achieved with the Sûreté Populaire. By democratising the organisation, we will ensure that the French respect the Police not by fear but by an understanding of their actions and goals, and by knowing that they serve them first and foremost."

FRA_hawkish_renseignements:0 "Revolutionary Renseignements"
FRA_hawkish_renseignements_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure our safety from reactionary enemies abroad. Simple counter-espionage is not adequate, we must be ready to spy on enemy countries and support Syndicalist movements across the world. A good offence is the best defence."

FRA_peace_renseignements:0 "Protective Renseignements"
FRA_peace_renseignements_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure the safety of our country above all else. Counter-espionage is the centrepiece of an effective national defence, and there are many enemies that wait for a moment of weakness to influence and rile up our population."

Union leaders and those in favour of central planning and agricultural collectivisation have been promoted by Déat to positions of power whilst the more staunch nationalist Sorelians who have pushed for direct war with Germany have been relegated.

To many, Bucard is seen as a reactionary who switched sides to save his own skin, however despite this the new chairman has confirmed his commitment to crushing the bourgeoisie nations. Supported by both the military and the Revolutionary Legion, Bucard has forged alliances with left-wing nationalists eager to fight the Germans, but also with groups sidelined by the CGT such as futurists and technocrats.

Their paramilitary, the Revolutionary Legion, march down the streets chanting loyalties to their leader, Georges Valois and demanding punishment for the degenerate bourgeois who they claim rule the Commune.\n\nEqually troublesome are the Jacobins, under the command of Maurice Thorez, a devout follower of the deceased Russian revolutionary, Vladimir Lenin. Declaring syndicalism to be an inferior system to their preferred communism, the Jacobins have become notorious for instigating strikes against unions associated with the Travailleurs.

We must encourage local initiatives and consider ambitious infrastructure projects to solve that problem on a local and national level."
FRA_hydroelectricity:0 "Hydroelectricity"

FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity:0 "Swiss Hydroelectricity"
FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Our recent conquest of Romandie has opened up several perfect spots for hydroelectricity as an extension of our existing network in the Alpes. Our leading engineers are certain that expanding our dams in the region would be greatly beneficial to our economy."
FRA_chemins_de_fer:0 "Office des Chemins de Fer"
FRA_chemins_de_fer_desc:0 "A Congress meeting over the status of France's infrastructure at the BGT showed the disorganisation of our rail system and how backwards it became. The Congress agreed on the need to create a new office specifically tasked with the development and maintenance of our railways to connect all the parts of France together."
FRA_mining_expansion:0 "Mining Expansion"
FRA_mining_expansion_desc:0 "The economic and infrastructural development of the regions of the Alpes and the Massif Central allows for a greater exploitation of the mineral resources available there. Our prospectors discovered new mineral deposits and we are now ready to start exploiting them on an industrial scale!"
FRA_plan_prost:0 "Plan Prost"
FRA_plan_prost_desc:0 "The engineer and urbanist Henri Prost came up with a plan to develop highways around the Parisian region to link the outlying suburbs. This idea is receiving widespread support and the BGT decided to fund new projects to expand highways through the Commune. The communes of Marseille and Lyon also asked him to draw highway plans for their cities."
FRA_autoroutes:0 "The Autoroutes"
FRA_autoroutes_desc:0 "The highways proved a massive boon to the economy and worker mobility in urban regions, now an ambitious plan has been put forward to expand them to the whole country! Linking every corner of our country will have a massive impact on our regional development and can only benefit the Revolution."

FRA_eco_direction:0 "Direction of the Economy"
FRA_eco_direction_desc:0 "Our economy is fairer to the workers and generally quite potent while reactionary economies live and die on the whims of capitalists, but internal conflicts have prevented us from steering our economy. It is time to call for a meeting of the BGT, so that these questions are once and for all settled by one the Commune's faction."
FRA_orth_syndicalism:0 "Orthodox Syndicalism"
FRA_orth_syndicalism_desc:0 "The course set since the revolution has been reaffirmed. This orthodoxy has proven effective, and with a bit of fine-tuning can be even more so."
FRA_reduce_unemploy:0 "Reducing Unemployment"
FRA_reduce_unemploy_desc:0 "Beyond the Rhine, unemployment is at an all-time high, we must ensure that the French worker will always have a job to feed his family. In this simple task of providing our people with the fruit of their sustenance, we prove our inherent superiority to the capitalist economies and their constant crises."
FRA_work_design_coop:0 "Worker-Designer Cooperation"
FRA_work_design_coop_desc:0 "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques. This also allows us to quickly train and educate our workforce to new techniques, by letting the designers directly teach the workers about them."
FRA_improve_manage:0 "Improve Management of Unions"
FRA_improve_manage_desc:0 "The Unions have for long been directing the economy, but they have some gaps and loopholes in their rules that can be exploited, leading to disastrous results for our economy. However, we will not question the place of the unions in our country. Instead, we will tighten management and rewrite some work codes."
FRA_dedication:0 "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_desc:0 "The worker has to realise that he is working for the greater good of the Commune and the French people as a whole. He must feel invested in his work at all times, and it is this way that we will improve our national spirit and our productivity. No need for whips or oppressive business owners."
FRA_fac_towns:0 "Factory Towns"
FRA_fac_towns_desc:0 "Our plan to rapidly expand the Commune's industrial base can be supported by the establishment of new factory towns, cities specially designed to provide housing and modern commodities to them and their families, while making sure they live close to their workplaces."
FRA_Industrialisation:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_Industrialisation_desc:0 "Jean Jérôme is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Jacobin, he is a proponent of Communal Industrialisation. While our country has always been one of the modern economies of Europe, we cannot yet compare to the Ruhr Valley. Only by ambitious industrial base expansion can we hope to measure to Germany."
FRA_inter_coop:0 "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_desc:0 "While our technical expertise is one of the best in the world, it is too easy to ignore any breakthroughs that are made in friendly countries on a false pretence of superiority. From new production techniques to management theories, we must stay observant and borrow anything that could benefit our own economy."
FRA_war_eco_agri:0 "War Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_desc:0 "Jacques Doriot is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Sorelian, he is a proponent of his 'War, Economy and Agriculture' theory, calling for a rapid conversion to a war economy along with an ambitious development of the agriculture. Should the German reactionaries attack, we will certainly have a use for the rifles and the bread."
FRA_modern_farms:0 "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_desc:0 "Farming has been a staple of civilisation since ancient times, and yet it has profoundly changed in just one century. Recent tools like tractors allow a single farmer to harvest fields in a single day that would have required dozens of farmers and a week in the past. Let's mechanise our farms, to put more food in our platters and our rations."
FRA_war_industry:0 "A War Industry"
FRA_war_industry_desc:0 "Despite rising animosity from Germany, our economy is still mostly dedicated to the production of civilian goods and is not suited for a major war. We need to develop our production of arms and equipment if we are to defend the Commune against external threats efficiently."
FRA_mass_production:0 "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_desc:0 "Our enemies are many, and our army is quite large as a result. This army needs a lot of equipment, and this clearly puts a strain on our factories. We must search new ways to improve our production of small arms through both design and manufacturing, without cutting corners."
FRA_cooperatives:0 "Cooperatives"
FRA_cooperatives_desc:0 "Daniel Guérin is the new economy minister of the Commune. An Anarchiste, he is a proponent of Cooperatives. The Commune's government is primarily here to serve its workers, and it must ensure the best working conditions for them. Letting them manage their own companies is a good way to start."
FRA_decentralized_industry:0 "Decentralised Industry"
FRA_decentralized_industry_desc:0 "Our industry is currently concentrated around Paris and major communes, but the people don't live only in Paris, Lille or Lyon but everywhere in France. We must put all efforts into developing all the regions of France so that our entire country prospers."
FRA_market_socialism:0 "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_desc:0 "The cooperatives we created must insert themselves in a new, equal socialist market. This market will make the economy more dynamic and allow everyone to pursue their own goals and share their industrial wealth in the respect of the ideals of socialism, without the predatory behaviours of the capitalist market economy."
FRA_ruralism:0 "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_desc:0 "The life of the peasant is the best life known to man, but the need for an industrial economy made this life impossible for most of the French people. We can, however, still encourage this lifestyle by bringing their factories and workplaces to the countryside, ending the tyranny of mass urbanisation."

FRA_communal_army:0 "The Communal Army"
FRA_communal_army_desc:0 "The French nation has an army, but it is an army that still does not have a unifying direction. Some still propose the same army of the Weltkrieg with High Command. Others want more initiative to NCOs. Others still desire a motorised and mobile army. Finally, there is also the idea of mass conscription. Once we dissolve the military trade unions, we must follow with an unified vision."
FRA_principe_concentration:0 "Principe de Concentration"
FRA_principe_concentration_desc:0 "As the butcher of the Weltkieg showed, there is nothing to be won with evenly spreading our troops across the entire front, taking only metres that we lose the next day to artillery barrages. By making local breakthroughs and investing into them, we can literally shatter the entire enemy front with a few good battles."
FRA_tank_research:0 "Tank Research Grants"
FRA_tank_research_desc:0 "Tanks are not new to us, nor to the world, but they are still a relatively new component of warfare. Improvements have been brisk in tank construction during the interwar, and it seems the true potential of armour is starting to reveal itself. Let us invest generously into the future of warfare."
FRA_fast_army:0 "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_desc:0 "Motorisation is more than the future of cavalry. While the average truck will not last long under enemy fire, it allows us to get our troops to the very frontlines in incredible times. We must make speed the goal of all our tactics, all our training, all our equipment. Celerity is opportunity."
FRA_tank_assembly_line:0 "Tank Assembly Lines"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. By creating baseline quality standards, we can speed up production of armour and supply our tanks with large armoured divisions that will come down on the enemy like a brick."
FRA_tank_quality_line:0 "Quality Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. Regardless, if we prioritise quality, we ensure that our tanks are the best of the best. Thus, every tank we produce will easily crush the tin cans that our enemy desperately output to counter us."
FRA_centralized_hc:0 "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_desc:0 "We are aware that the unsavoury events of 1919 have put a deep mistrust of military High Command in the people of the Commune. Regardless, we will need to rehabilitate the concept of the High Command. The idea of the squad leader deciding combat tactics is glamorous, but who will care for logistics and strategic manoeuvres?"

FRA_analysing_wki_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg, a tragedy to us and our British comrades, is a painful topic to study, but it is one we must study regardless. From the successes and failures of this war, we will learn how the next must be fought. Those who think that new tactics and strategies will sprout out of nowhere as the conflict draws near are deluded."
FRA_war_experience:0 "War Experience"
FRA_war_experience_desc:0 "The French army has fought many wars, and will fight many more. Every time we must stop and reflect on these conflicts, and make an analysis as thorough as possible to find where our plans have went right or wrong. Just because they did not fight under the Commune's flag does not mean they died in vain."
FRA_military_academy:0 "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_desc:0 "War is a complex topic, one that must be studied to be fully understood. While we have found many talents during the 1919 Civil War, we must take the preliminary steps to train new officers. We can also study our whole doctrine and renew the training of our officer corps this way."
FRA_officers_initiative:0 "Officer's Initiative"
FRA_officers_initiative_desc:0 "How often during the Weltkrieg have breakthroughs been made but not exploited due to unresponsive officers? We must ensure this does not happen again, every regiment should be able to act independently, drawing up plans and acting on them as they see fit. This is the reality of modern warfare, Napoleonic columns are history."
FRA_mission_type:0 "Mission Type Tactics"
FRA_mission_type_desc:0 "Our plans are not meant to be tasklists, else our troops are paralysed once the unexpected happens. Our plans must always be built with one specific goal in mind. This is the only rigid part of the plan, all else is left to squads to figure out. This way, we will always be ready to adapt our plans as the situation on the field develops."
FRA_flexible_support:0 "Flexible Support"
FRA_flexible_support_desc:0 "To ensure the efficiency of our squads, we must ensure they are served by artillery and support regiments in a flexible manner. This means that at any time artillery must be ready to fire on the orders of any squad linked to it, and support companies must be ready to intervene when called for help on the front."
FRA_empower_rifleman:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_desc:0 "Eventually, we can draft all the plans in the world and stack as many artillery guns in the backline as we see fit, but the humble Rifleman is the one who will win the war. By ensuring that even them can independently take initiative, we subtly improve the efficiency of every squad and defeat those enemies who use terror to lead them."
FRA_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Conscription"
FRA_mass_conscription_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed without a doubt that modern wars now take absolutely insane scales, drafting millions to fight on every side.

FRA_improve_manufactures:0 "Improve the Manufactures"
FRA_improve_manufactures_desc:0 "War truly has taken a massive scale, and such a modern war will need an amount of equipment that we perhaps cannot even fathom yet.

FRA_global_organization:0 "Global Organisation"
FRA_global_organization_desc:0 "A grand army needs a grand command. However, it is not the High Command of old, sitting in a war room in Paris, drawing arrows on a map.

FRA_mass_fire_support:0 "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_desc:0 "With such a big army comes a new idea for the old concept of support fire. For long it was thought that artillery alone could support a push, but we believe that it is the duty of every squad that is not attacking to provide covering fires for those who push forward. This way, our enemies will forever duck as we move forwards."
FRA_grand_army_reform:0 "Grand Army Reform"
FRA_grand_army_reform_desc:0 "Our army is now united in purpose and in doctrine. No more does anyone dare call them a militia or street rabble.

But our enemies will not spare us the courtesy of using those weapons on us."
FRA_special_forces:0 "Alpine Forces"
FRA_special_forces_desc:0 "Mountains have always been a radically different environment to fight in, and most of our borders cross mountains.

FRA_tank_division_desc:0 "It has been obvious for a while, but tanks are here to stay. Their armour is impenetrable to small arms fire, and their mighty cannon destroys whatever it is aimed at.

FRA_military_buildup:0 "Military Build-up"
FRA_military_buildup_desc:0 "To prepare for the upcoming war, we will need to develop our war industry rapidly and efficiently.

FRA_Our_time_has_come:0 "Revanchist Propaganda"

FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals:0 "Department of Revolutionary Ideals"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals_desc:0 "While the empirical teachings prove themselves easily, the virtues of the Commune are harder to communicate to our population.

We will prove to the world that the Commune will not be defeated!"
FRA_military_science:0 "Military Science"
FRA_military_science_desc:0 "France is always working on improving its research networks, but theoretical sciences can only bring us so far.

FRA_synthetic_refineries:0 "Synthetic Resources"
FRA_synthetic_refineries_desc:0 "France is great and resourceful, but it does not have everything.

Some scientists even suggest we may be able to engineer those resources."

Something the Republic would have never bothered to do, surely."

FRA_armee_de_lair_desc:0 "Planes are a strange new aspect of warfare. These machines are quite complex to handle, and the punishment for failing to fly properly obvious.

FRA_amateur_pilots:0 "Amateur Pilots"
FRA_amateur_pilots_desc:0 "No-one is born a pilot, and while some study to excel at air handling and combat and their efforts are admirable, we cannot expect every single pilot to be an ace.

Only our wits will work in this brand new field of warfare, and luckily we have some."
FRA_air_bases:0 "Establish More Air Bases"
FRA_air_bases_desc:0 "Planes require air bases to land, refuel, rearm, repair and take off, much like navies. But unlike navies, they cannot stay airborne for months, only hours. As such, we must ensure our air base coverage is excellent, and we must make sure we are always under capacity so that our air force is never crippled by lacking infrastructure."
FRA_fighters:0 "Fighter Focus"
FRA_fighters_desc:0 "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for our enemies, and as such it is a new angle of defence for us. Unlike on land, there are no forts, no cover, just one-on-one dogfights.

FRA_bombers:0 "Bomber Focus"
FRA_bombers_desc:0 "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for us, and it is one our enemies might not defend adequately against yet.

FRA_strat_bombers:0 "Strategic Destruction Focus"
FRA_strat_bombers_desc:0 "If one bomb works well against an enemy, then ten bombs must only work better.

In the November of 1919, a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. 'The Party of Order' was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in subsequent months the French Establishment was forced out of France by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, the self-styled 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936, the consensus that was reached in order to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is being deemed as increasingly outdated by many critics, and there are growing calls for more radical policies.

The past weeks have seen dissenting opposition crushed and prominent non-Sorelians dearly gripping onto power post-election isolated or found dead under suspicious circumstances. Valois has ordered that all references to Faure’s chairmanship are to be heavily criticised by the new regime whilst the man himself has been put under house arrest under fears that he may rally the Travailleurs and Anarchistes against Valois.

According to the document, we would be obliged to aid the Kaiser, should Germany be attacked by the Commune of France, and vice versa. This is an excellent chance to break our international isolation, as well as secure our western flank until our army is rebuilt."

comfrance.127.t:0 "The Phalanstère International Research Organisation"
comfrance.127.d:0 "As time has passed it has quickly become apparent that the global revolution requires far more than just devotion to the cause. With France and Britain being the only highly-developed socialist countries in the world, it has become widely accepted that they should launch a long-term research aid programme for other countries. And thus has begun the so-called 'Phalanstère International Research Organisation', a branch of the 'Phalanstère International' programme aimed at providing technological support for socialist countries all over the world. The question now is whether we should join in with this endeavour."
comfrance.127.a:0 "Participation sounds good."

comfrance.128.t:0 "The Phalanstère International Industrial Programme"
comfrance.128.d:0 "It has become apparent to many in the Internationale that it is the responsibility of all sufficiently-developed syndicalist nations to provide industrial support to those nations that are less able to provide for themselves. The choice is now upon us to decide whether we should stand in solidarity with workers around the world by helping implement a massive programme of industrial aid alongside our French brothers-in-arms."

comfrance.130.t:0 "A Jacobin Reformation?"
comfrance.130.d:0 "Having at long last taken control of the Commune, the Jacobin led Comité de Salut Public is in the position to begin a complete conversion of the governmental system from failing Syndicalism to glorious Leninism. Hardline comrades are demanding that the Syndicalist structures be completely abolished, all replaced by the Parti Communiste Français in a Bolshevik-Leninist state. However despite Chairman Thorez's support for this initiative, this is likely to viciously divide France and as such many more moderate party officials are suggesting that the Jacobins continue to operate within the established Syndicalist structures of the BGT and CSP while gradually reforming the state along 'true' Marxist lines. Whatever the outcome is it shall surely cause more division"
comfrance.130.a:0 "Moderates are just Social-Reactionaries! Let us build a new system!"

comfrance.131.t:0 "Restructuring of the BGT and CSP"
comfrance.131.d:0 "The Syndicalist structures of post-revolution France are being transformed so as to better comply with true Marxism as laid out by the Parti Communiste Français. The Bourse Générale du Travail has been reformed as the Congrès des Députés du Peuple while the Comité de Salut Public has been replaced by the Conseil des Commissaires du Peuple."

comfrance.132.t:0 "Dissolution of the CGT"
comfrance.132.d:0 "Now we turn on the last pillar of Syndicalism in France, the Confederation General du Travail - the dominant Syndicate which long kept us from taking power in the Commune. We can finally break their power, so as to prevent our rival from further resisting our Communist doctrine."

comfrance.134.d:0 "Leading Travailleur figure, Léon Blum, along with respected war hero Maurice Gamelin, have begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities.\n\nFearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently, other than Blum himself, the still-respected general Maurice Gamelin."

comfrance.135.t:0 "The Paris Trial"
comfrance.135.d:0 "The various leading figures of the Front Populaire, as well as other prominent potential allies of theirs, such as Maurice Gamelin, have been arrested and are being tried for treason. The Paris Trial aims to prove that Blum and his associates have undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."

comfrance.138.t:0 "The Front Populaire Restores Order"
comfrance.138.d:0 "The Front Populaire has seized Paris and have begun purging the Jacobins from the city. Communes throughout France have taken this opportunity to liquidate their own branches of the Communist Party. Gamelin and Blum have restored the formerly abolished Syndicalist institutions, the CGT and BGT, and in emergency elections Gamelin has been elected as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail with Blum appointed Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public. Now that this grand alliance of Syndicalists, Social Democrats and Socialists have seized power, they hope to undo the totalitarian oppression emposed on the French citizens by the Jacobins"

The traitor general Maurice Gamelin failed to overthrow the Communists with his first attempt at a march on Paris and was forced to retreat south. Now we have received word via secret channels that Gamelin is willing to recognise a Republican restoration in return for aid in defeating the Jacobins.\n\nAlthough considered one of the worst traitors France has ever seen for leading the reds in the first civil war which saw us reduced to our exile in Algiers, this could be our best chance to return home and drive out the craven Communards that stole it from us."

comfrance.142.d:0 "The arch-traitor Gamelin has declared for the Fourth Republic! His soldiers are advancing on Marseille, surely to pave the way for the Nationalist forces that are even now readying to invade our homeland. Although this shows that he has abandoned his erstwhile allies in the Front Populaire, the syndicalists have taken this opportunity to redouble their efforts, launching uprisings across France."

Legion outposts can be found across France and the Sorelian Red Eagle can be found flying high above well armed militants loyal to Valois. \n\nSince the victory of the Sorelians there has been suggestions to merge the Legion with the French Revolutionary Armed Forces, despite resistance from notable generals such as Maurice Gamelin, on this day the Legion will officially be incorporated into thr military under the command of General Marcel Bucard."

comfrance.903.t:0 "Rise of the Sorelians"
comfrance.903.d:0 "The Sorelians emerged during the French Civil War as violent, revolutionary and staunchly anti-reactionary movement when Georges Valois, Hubert Lagardelle and Jacques Arthuys decided that the time was right to turn their underground political group, Cercle Proudhon, into a fully fledged political movement. These three men observed the Weltkrieg as the beginning of a new age, one where capitalism and traditionalism would be replaced by syndicalism and nationalism. Despite being former associates of Action Française the three launched a scathing campaign against social conservatives, monarchists and all who stood against the revolution. \n\nAdopting the red eagle as their symbol the Sorelians have quickly gained popularity amongst the working-class who saw their organised marches, uniformed militia and violent altercations with reactionaries as a form of expressing their outrage to the establishment. When the Civil War ended and the anarcho-syndicalists took the seat of power in Paris the Sorelians changed their rhetoric anti-reactionary to anti-anarchy. \n\n Up until now the Travailleur's have used the Sorelians as a bulwark against reactionaries however now are terrified that these radicals may at long last turn on them in the upcoming elections. Demanding; centralization, revanchism against Germany and a restoration of French nationalism the Sorelians now poses a major threat to the Anarcho-Syndicalist Commune with it’s paramilitary, the Revolutionary Legion, engaging in street fights and the intimidation of political opponents. Will the Sorelians bring France into disarray once more or shall they lead the glorious charge of National-Syndicalism?"

comfrance.930.d:0 "Clenching the red flag of socialism in one hand and a copy of the Communist Manifesto in the other, the Jacobins have taken Commune politics by storm through their undying dedication to Marxism. Inspired by both Lenin’s failed Bolshevik Revolution and French revolutionary history they seek to bring an end to Syndicalism, citing it as a failed ideology manipulated by ‘Social-Reactionaries’ to further control the proletariat. Led by revolutionary hero, Maurice Thorez, a man who has now forsaken his former Syndicalist loyalties and pledged allegiance to the international communist revolution. Thorez has stated his conversion to what many perceive as an obsolete ideology, is a direct response to the growing bureaucracy and corruption in CGT. \n\nTaking their name from the violent revolutionary movement under the leadership of Maximilien Robespierre, the Jacobins see themselves a vanguard against anarchists and social-reactionaries who are more than willing to use violence to spread the word of Marx. Currently they are engaged in a bitter rivalry with the Sorelians that has escalated into large scale street fights between the Revolutionary Legion and Jacobin militants. However, despite the use of violence and a previously complete rejection of the CGT’s authority, Thorez has announced his intention for the Jacobins to stand in the upcoming elections. It is to be seen how receptive the greater populace are to Thorez’s idealistic communist state, will they embrace the legacy of Lenin or loyally defend Syndicalism?"

The Red Eagle banner was hung from building to building, torches were carried by a parade of gloomy looking legionaries, an atmosphere of depression had engulfed the city.

The resulting blast injured all three men on the stage, the latter two being cabinet member Marcel Déat and Director of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux, Pierre Laval. All three were immediately driven to the nearest hospital whilst brave legionaries returned fire at the terrorist scum, two were shot dead whilst the last is in captivity. Thankfully camrades Déat and Laval survived the explosion with minor injuries however Valois did not, despite the hospital’s best efforts, the resulting blast and stray bullets where too much for the aging leader. Our dear Chairman was a true revolutionary and his ideals will not be forgotten nor will his death be in vain.\n\nThe difficult task of choosing a successor now falls upon the Sorelian high council, in the meantime a recovering Laval has been instated as the temporary head of government until a successor is chosen.

If we are to move forward with centralizing the government, we need to unite the people under our political beliefs.

Both of the factions  have been actively fighting for dominance over the party, and absorbing the smaller factions in an attempt to rival each other. The Vanguardists have the most influence over the Sorleian aligned unions and the old guard, members who were involved in the founding of the Sorelians, whilst the Ultranational-Syndicalists have the loyalty of the Revolutionary Legion.

It’s rumoured that the main leader of the Black Guard is famed Ukrainian anarchist who was exiled to France, Nestor Makhno. The Sorelians, after hearing about these rumors, ordered a raid of Makhno’s residence. However, upon the initial raid Makhno was nowhere to be found further fueling these rumors.

The Frenchman must at all costs rival and go beyond the prowess of the German Ape-Man, who is such a brute that they lack even the most basic understanding of the world like we have. The Frenchman, unlike the German counterpart, has always had an underlying sense of vitality and strength, one that was beyond all his neighbors which were either falling asleep in their siestas or being so stupid that they can't change the oil on a lamp. It is nescessary then, to enact an enormous and violent purge of the weak which corrupt French society and have done so for the last thousand years, much like a class war which instead of involving the ruled and the ruler, it instead involves the weak and the strong. Therefore, the Revolutionary Legion has now made tremendous efforts to cleanse our lands of those considered feminine, weak, and frail, and raise up to the sky those who are strong, vital, and in unending militancy against the Ape-German and other reactionaries.\n\nMarc Augier has also begun extremely extensive efforts to create the perfect Frenchman; one that has been dispelled of all elements of Royal frailness, of the uneducation of the masses, that is both intelligent and built like a tank - this search has made us go through hundreds of Frenchmen, to find the perfect specimen.

We need, as a State, to protect the youth from reactionary ideals and give them the light of our vanguard, to give them the light of violence, of militancy, of power and unending restlessness. Therefore, Chairman Déat has created the Déat Jeunesse, a paramilitary organization that seeks to train young boys into becoming militant and extremely loyal beacons of the Revolution through rigorous training, education, and camraderie.

He screamed in adoration to the Commune, to the Revolution, proclaiming in profound militancy, that it was time to create a 'Communism with French Characteristics'.\n\nThis new Communism, he says, must do away with the ideals of Faure, Sorel, and other fifth-columnists and realize that France has an incredible and rich history of revolution and revolt. It is undoubtedly a Nation born out of revolution, a Nation that grew out of revolution, and a Nation that lives now in Revolution. It is clear to everyone, that France must follow her own way in Communism, to ensure a future in socialist society where the Commune lives and breathes independently, with profound power that shall eventually wipe the world from reactionary forces and bring about a new age of French Communism."

She shall transfer the Revolution to the whole world, in the ideals of Leninism and Marxism, the correct line of communism.

Our great Comrade, Marcel Déat, has declared then, that some factories must be directed towards book-making of a specific, single book, engineered to be the most perfect expression of the French Sorelian Revolution; Quotations from Chairman Déat. This book was created by Déat himself, of course, and edited by himself, published by the State, which of course, is an extension of Déat's benevolent and fierce hand against the reactionaries, and printed by state-owned companies. The only remaining part is distribution - which part of the French State is needing to be directed politically to the correct line of syndicalism? Of course, it's the Army! Tens of thousands of copies of the book have been distributed across the army to every single batallion, ensuring that each of them has a commander which will read every little part of this wonderful book for them, to educate them further into the light of Sorel's legacy.

The Jacobins and Anarchistes have already been declared enemies of the state due to their destructive beliefs. However there are those within the Travailleurs who could be swayed. Camrade Marcel Déat has proposed the idea of approaching certain Travailleurs who hold influence over the unions, by providing them with minimal powers we could better position ourselves as the legitimate representation of the workers. However, camrade Marcel Bucard has reputed this plan and demanded that all political rivals should be removed from power, stating their previous hostility to the Sorelians.\n\nWhich comrade should we listen to?"

For tens of thousands of years, Humanity sat upon the dark cave of unknowingness, of fear and of ignorance, believing in magical fairytales about gods up in the sky, about gods of the Sun, about gods of the Earth, about gods of the Ocean. No longer - we, as the vanguard of humanity as a whole proclaims in one sole breath that Religion is done away with, it is no longer nescessary, and will never again be a valid form of thought. The reactionary forces that plagued mankind's brain for thousands of years has just been completely removed in the land of the Commune, and our comrade Marcel Cachin has just recently stated that he himself will ensure that the immense effort nescessary to finally wipe religion from even the most private of gatherings, from the most reactionary minds that permeate our lands, to even upper rankings in the Party which for some bizarre reason still hold on to this reactionary concept. No more. We are done with religion for-ever, and we shall ensure that the rest of the world will follow suit. What is next for our Commune? Of course, I understand, and the Party understands that the people need a cult, some form of myth to believe in - so, I have proclaimed the Cult of the Supreme Being, just like the one from the old French Revolution - and in it, a great myth of socialist realism will be put forward, one of reality, one of facts, and one of progressivism. One will believe now, profoundly, in their heart, in the ideals of the Revolution, not in the Church.'\n\nThe crowds of course, fiercely applauded, as comrades across the Commune rose in positive demonstrations to show their support for the PCF's decision."

He had decided, in an order which rang across the world, that Terror was the Order of the Day.\n\nImmediately hundreds of mid and high-level Communard Anarchists, Sorelians, Syndicalists, and others were rushedly taken from their homes, put in a guillotine, and in front of everyone, killed like cattle, one after the other, becoming hunks of meat in the floor, losing every inch of their life, and so just like that, the Commune has slowly been draining itself of political expertise, scientists, members of the political scene, and more, with the strike of a guillotine.\n\nMuch like Robespierre, Thorez himself believed this wasn't enough. More blood had to be spilled for the beloved Commune to be cleansed of corruption. So, he smiled. In a field of sorrow, screams, and agony, he smiled."

His ideals were unparallaled in knowledge and understanding of the correct line of Marxism, and it is with our profound belief that Marxism-Leninism is the future of the Commune. It has been an incredible, unprecedented corruption and rottenness that has taken over the European continent and beyond with Syndicalism, being a force that destroys the creative force of socialism and Lenin's ideals. Therefore, to show that the great legacy of our comrade Lenin did not fall in deaf ears, we shall construct a great statue of the man, made with great care in every aspect about his figure, from his forehead to his shoes. This statue, a grand expression of Socialism in the heart of our beautiful Commune, shall be the expression of creative socialism that the world needs in order to save it from Syndicalist corruption. It shall be made in the center of Paris, and through the great labour of our workers, it shall be done in just a few months."

It is then, that when a medium-level Anarchist, a bastard son of Makhno, began organizing a "protracted people's war" against the State, it became clear that it was nescessary to wipe him like a bug which sat on the window. As Marion fiercely kept attacking, going to every corner of street he could find which had even the tracest amount of Anarchist activity, and arrest those there without trial, silently removing them from the public eye, he also put curfews up, with an increased level of harshness against all enemies of the State.\n\nEventually, after two weeks of looking for this nameless, meaningless medium-level Anarchist which kept attacking our good orderly policemen and ruining our infrastructure, we found him, hiding in the home of a family in Bordeaux. Of course, we arrested all of them and did away with their records, ensuring they were never found again. Even if we all lose and fall to reactionary forces, at least the vile enemies of our people will never have existed."

Therefore recent reports have provided us with an excellent excuse to dispose of them...\n\nLoyal camarade, Jean Fontenoy, has provided Bucard with a detailed report on his belief that it was in fact Déat who was responsible for the attacks. The day of the assassination suspicious acitivites were conducted, legionaries were pulled to one said and diverted from their patrols, armed terrorists were allowed to slip threw the crowd with little resistance and most shockingly despite the close proximity Déat and Laval were miraculously left with minor injuries.

However, as with all things, a transition had to be put into place as not to put too much strain on the gentle proletariat as the transition was made. Thus, the Nouvelle Politique Économique, or NPE, was introduced as a means of slowly reducing Petit-Bourgeois Syndicalism by disbanding all dangerous and overly-powerful unions that have over 1,000,000 members, while keeping those that genuinely support the Worker."

The Black Guard has violently purged and dissolved the Government, burning down the CGT building and demanding that the people reign supreme. As they violently purged the remaining holdouts, chaos was caused around Paris and in the countryside, Anarchist elements across the country backed by Makhno slowly began consolidating control, as paramilitaries fought with the remaining Black Guard Elements. The provisional Anarchist State collapsed in of itself, resulting in a complete vaccum of power. Riots rise up across France, resulting in pockets of complete lawlessness across the countryside and in extremely small areas the size of a neighborhood in the cities - as Makhno and his gang carefully diffuse the situation, saying that this is a true symbol of veritatious Anarchy; full of vitality, destruction, and explosions of creation and annihilation. Of course, none of this was planned, the chaos only took hold due to wide-scale resistance from former communards and Sorelians. As this happens, reporters around the world are horrified of the developments in France and look around at the situation in hiding, knowing they'd be killed or worse if they were to appear openly. Surrealists like André Breton and Antonin Artaud also openly endorse the chaos, seeing it as an extreme form of surreal theatrical expression in France, with Bréton saying: 'This is the absolute state of existence - this is total surreal automatism, beyond reason and beyond facts.

Subsquently, elements of the Black Guard which controlled Paris brought Makhno to a podium and stated the following:\n\n'Comrades! It has been an excellent day - for the longstanding institution of currency which opressed our dear Anarchy has been wiped out! Banks across our Commune which were for far too long functioning - decades ago at the hands of capitalists, and then at the hands of Sorelians - both reactionaries of course, were destroyed and turned into complete piles of dirt and ash! This fire represents a cleansing, one which the world hasn't seen since the Free Territory, and now we have liberated ourselves completely from every element of statist society. Freedom is at your hands!'\n\nThousands began clapping and cheering, mixed with rioting from other forces, and just after those few minutes of quiet and profound observation and listening, it appears the Anarchy has returned back to it's normal state."

The Black Guard have finally achieved this goal, liberation from the state, liberation from slavery.

Whilst violence, pillaging and looting from rebels, holdouts and occasionally Black Guard militants still ravage the lands there has been development of a new society. When not firing on Sorelain bastards or themselves, communes trade and barter, a small step for any other society however with the collapse of all defining features of a nation this last remaining aspect of modern humanity continues. The only laws enforced are that of the Black Guard, although officially possessing no power, Nestor Makhno serves as the military defender of the Free Territory.

In response to this military loyalists attempted to garrison themselves in strongholds and resist the Black guard, a fruitless endeavour when their own soldiers turned their rifles towards each other. The engulfing chaos seems to have taken hold over even the most loyal soldiers, when responsibility for actions is removed people will quickly lose their sense of duty and unleash their true natural being.\n\nThe military of France is now composed of Black Guard militants under the command of prominent anarchist figures, with no official officers. These officers are democratically elected and have been provided with the freedom to act as they wish however they remain loyal to Makhno’s orders.

However some, mostly Makhno loyalists, have proposed proclaiming Makhno the symbolic military defender of anarchy, a position that would lack any political authority however would acknowledge a form of hierarchy, even if such a position is only one of military necessity. A stance seen as hypocritical by some. It should be noted that even if we choose to have no leader, Makhno is still a beloved figure amongst the public and the most powerful man in France, his military might and political influence would certainly not disappear..."

Rejecting morality and legality, Illegalists saw crime as a pursuit of one’s own desires and individuality.\n\nWith the totalitarian regime of the Sorelians, this strand of anarchism that is seen as radical even by anarcho-syndicalists has resurfaced amongst workers wishing to rebel against the National Workers State. Notorious anarchist Nestor Makhno, himself has begun to slightly drift towards Illegalism. Witnessing the failures of his anarcho-communist comrades in Ukraine and the failure of anarcho-syndicalists in both the Travailleurs and Anarchistes to prevent the rise of the Sorelains, the ideas of the complete abolition of hierarchy and use of crime has been seen by Makhno as nescessary to free France.

But the smashing of the PCF alone is not enough to secure our country and the revolution, there is still much work to do! The reform plan that I and my government have prepared contains three core projects that we will implement in the coming years! 1. Strengthening the democratic process in the Commune through far-reaching reform of electoral law, the education system and the implementation of a large-scale anti-corruption campaign! 2. The consolidation of the Communard Spirit which forms the basis of our country, as well as the strengthening of the syndicalist way of life! And finally 3. The reform of the military and police forces to be able to better defend ourselves against internal dangers such as the PCF in the future, as well as against external threats such as our archenemy, the German Empire! Once this plan has been put into action, the commune will rise and shine in new splendor! Vive la révolution! Vive la Fédération des Communes de France!'"

comfrancegamelin.7.t:0 "Gamelin Establishes the Milice française"
comfrancegamelin.7.d:0 "Although the military are currently doing their best to restore order there simply is not enough soldiers to patrol the entire nation, therefore Gamelin has decided to establish a volunteer militia. The Milice française, or just simply ‘Milice’, are to be a paramilitary tasked with combating any remaining Jacobin resistance, as well as any potential opposition from other problematic groups. Dressed in blue paramilitary uniforms with a recognisable beret, they are to be armed and trained directly by the armed forces in order to act as a disciplined force. The Greek letter, gamma, has been chosen for its symbolism representing rejuvenation and energy. A fitting logo for a force that will aid Gamelin in re-energising the Commune."
comfrancegamelin.7.a:0 "Fitting indeed."

comfrancegamelin.8.t:0 "Léon Blum Appoints His Cabinet"
comfrancegamelin.8.d:0 "Prior to the Jacobin reign of terror, Léon Blum was not perceived by many as the future leader of the Travailleurs. As Faure’s health declined a battle arose between Léon Jouhaux and Benoît Frachon, Blum on the other hand was a minor figure in this clash for leadership. However the Jacobin’s attempted purge of CGT politicians left many Travailleurs to go into hiding, in a prison cell or dead, it was during this time of turmoil that Blum emerged. Uniting his comrades with the Anarchistes, Sociaux-Démocrates and Gamelin’s syndicalist aligned military he formed a united front to oppose Thorez.\n\nNow as head of government, serving as leader of the Commune under the protection of Maréchal Gamelin, he is tasked with forming a government to maintain the unity of the Front Populaire. Blum has already proven himself a successful man of action and capable of forming relations with political opponents, however without the threat of the Jacobins it will be a difficult task to keep the Front whole."
comfrancegamelin.8.a:0 "Camarade Blum will heal the wounds of the nation!"

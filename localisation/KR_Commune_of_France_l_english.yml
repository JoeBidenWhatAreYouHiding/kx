### Ideas ###

THINT_exact_vengeance:0 "Desire for Revenge"

FRA_communard_spirit_idea:0 "Communard Spirit"
FRA_communard_spirit_idea_desc:0 "We are the legacy of the Paris Commune, the first socialist state ever created and then brutally repressed by the Republican reactionaries. In 1920, the workers finally got their revenge and overthrew the military junta of the 'Party of Order'. We, sons and daughters of Communards must protect our state and our spirit, we will not be commanded by tyrants anymore!"

FRA_bad_intel:0 "Inefficient Intelligence"
FRA_bad_intel_desc:0 "Ever since the Party of Order tried to stifle the worker's uprising in France, the idea of a centralised intelligence service is seen by many as a hallmark of the reactionary oppression of the post-Weltkrieg social movements. As a result, the Commune's intelligence services are limited to extremely scrutinised intelligence committees to prevent a repeat of this situation."

FRA_to_war_idea:0 "Revanchist Rearment"
FRA_to_war_idea_desc:0 "Our nation must rise again, if we want to defeat the Imperialists!"

#The three following ideas are extremely weird. Are they intended? Especially the third. Travailleurs and Sorelians both share it... I'm picking Travailleurs for now
FRA_economic_reforms_anar:0 "Economic Reforms"
FRA_economic_reforms_anar_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

FRA_economic_reforms_jaco:0 "Economic Reforms"
FRA_economic_reforms_jaco_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

FRA_economic_reforms:0 "Economic Reforms"
FRA_economic_reforms_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

FRA_military_buildup_two_idea:0 "Calibrated Economy"
FRA_military_buildup_two_idea_desc:0 "As the world slowly approaches war again, we can rapidly capitalise on our healthy economy to rapidly switch parts of our economy to focus on military build-up. More factories are dedicated on arming our soldiers and building military structures, without any severe impact on our population."

FRA_ruralism_idea:0 "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_idea_desc:0 "The wide-reaching reforms to our industry and economy means than we no longer have massive industrial centres surrounding populous cities. This incidentally makes any attempt by enemy forces to cripple or even destroy our economy that much harder, with the biggest rural industrial centres far smaller and far more numerous than the great industry centres of Europe."

FRA_market_socialism_idea:0 "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_idea_desc:0 "Market Socialism is far more than a socialist interpretation of a market economy. By putting all the new worker cooperatives in a fair and equal competitive economy, we can make our civilian economy more dynamic and more efficient without having to directly intervene or go through slow, bloated unions in most cases."

FRA_mass_production_idea:0 "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_idea_desc:0 "Factories have always had a serious advantage over the artisan. By chaining production tasks, they can produce in a small frame of time infinitely more product without nearly equal quality. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent that process, let's improve on it. We seek absolute efficiency in production to beat the German capitalists."

FRA_modern_farms_idea:0 "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_idea_desc:0 "Farms are often seen as an old, quaint detail of the national economy, but we know better. By modernising and mechanising the Commune's farmlands, we can massively increase our agricultural output and both speed up and optimise harvest, production, refining and delivery. To our civilians, and to our troops."

FRA_war_eco_agri_idea:0 "War, Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Sorelian economy minister Jacques Doriot, the concept of War, Economy and Agriculture is an interesting one. Claiming that a war with Germany is not only inevitable but fast approaching, the Sorelians demand a rapid conversion to an economy whose industry can not only sustain a war, but whose agriculture can sustain its soldiers. In sum, a sort of total war economy."

FRA_inter_coop_idea:0 "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_idea_desc:0 "There is no shame in seeing what other countries are doing, and borrowing their new economic and industrial ideas to improve our own. Obviously, there are very few ideas we can seriously borrow from capitalist and reactionary societies, but our fellow Syndicalist brothers are fine examples at times."

FRA_dedication_idea:0 "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_idea_desc:0 "French workers work for more than their pay, and they certainly do not work at gunpoint. Every can they seal, every brick they lay, every rifle they assemble, every tank they weld together, is a service to their country and the spirit of the Commune at large."

FRA_industralization_idea:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_industralization_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Jacobin economy minister Jean Jérôme, Industrialisation is no strange concept to anyone in the Commune or abroad. This policy aims to rapidly increase the industrial capacity of France in order to catch up to our arch nemesis Germany. This is accompanied by a work culture and the creation of dedicated factory towns."

FRA_mass_fire_support_idea:0 "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_idea_desc:0 "Every man has his rifle and grenade, every squad has its machine gun. By organising our divisions to provide fire to each other, we can another a new layer of fire support. Every time a division advances, all the other divisions suppress the enemy. By doing this in waves, we can rapidly gain ground. Now to supply the equipment needed."

FRA_mass_conscription_idea:0 "Mass Conscription"
FRA_mass_conscription_idea_desc:0 "Whereas our enemies have trouble enlisting enough soldiers to fight their reactionary and imperialist wars, every man is ready to fight for the Commune. Let us mobilise as many as our economy can sustain, we will overwhelm the reactionaries with our ultimate dedication to the Commune."

FRA_empower_rifleman_idea:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_idea_desc:0 "The Rifleman is more than a soldier with a gun. For too long he has been seen as incapable of any higher thinking other than firing his rifle by monarchist officers, seeing the working man with disdain. We will not make this mistake, the Rifleman should decide local tactics, increasing his efficiency on the battlefield."

FRA_military_academy_idea:0 "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_idea_desc:0 "We have to face the harsh reality that the Weltkrieg led to the downfall of most of our prestigious, if reactionary, military academies. While some claim this to be an acceptable status quo, we know better. Let us invest in new military academies to train skilled officers, for the future of the Communal Army."

FRA_centralized_hc_idea:0 "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_idea_desc:0 "The new Communal Army was not built like the old French army, many Communards resenting the military administration that tried to stifle the Commune, but we cannot leave our Officer Corps shattered. Let us centralise our High Command again, to better organise things some people like to forget, like logistics."

FRA_tank_quality_line_idea:0 "Quality Tank Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_idea_desc:0 "What good is a tank if it doesn't perform as well as enemy tanks? We should not sacrifice on quality in favour of quantity, all this will lead to is more burning husks on the battlefield. Quality tanks, even if fewer in numbers, will take many times their numbers, making them a safe return on investment."

FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea:0 "Tank Assembly Line"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea_desc:0 "What good is a tank if the enemies have many more to throw against us? We cannot let perfectionists sabotage our assembly lines for minimal gains, or else we will be outnumbered. Quantity will allow us to overwhelm our enemies with entire divisions of cold hard steel, and many more shells flying at them."

FRA_fast_army_idea:0 "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_idea_desc:0 "Speed is more than a small advantage or a way to get to the next point faster. Speed is integral to warfare. Those who think that the next Weltkrieg will be fought in trenches are deluded at best, mobile warfare is the way of the future. We must capitalise on fast, motorised divisions, if not a motorised army."

FRA_Red_Army:0 "Red Grande Armee"
FRA_Red_Army_desc:0 "Our army is in better shape than ever to face the evils of this capitalist world."

Capital_Ship_Primacy:0 "Capital Ship Primacy"
Capital_Ship_Primacy_desc:0 "A grand navy will be crucial to defeat the Kaiserliche Marine and bring the pain to Germany's northern coast. And in that role, the grand Battleship still shines. Its naval artillery will flatten the reactionaries with rolling barrages of thunder and steel, and send their boats to the bottom of the sea."

Carrier_Primacy:0 "Carrier Primacy"
Carrier_Primacy_desc:0 "The future of naval warfare is not in big, clunky warships, but in a combined arms approach with another front of future warfare, air warfare. Let us ensure that every naval group has a Carrier. Its fighters will ensure global air dominance, its naval bombers will wreck enemy ships and harbours alike."

FRA_working_women_idea:0 "Working Women"
FRA_working_women_idea_desc:0 "For too long have women been suppressed by reactionary thinkers. Even under the French Republic, they selflessly supported the nation while our brothers were sent to the slaughter. It is time for us to recognise their contribution to society, and formalise the rights of the working woman, in peace and war."

FRA_bhartiya_support:0 "French Military Support"
FRA_bhartiya_support_desc:0 "We are receiving military support from our French allies. This selfless assistance will prove critical to defeating the reactionary Princely Federation and the imperialist Dominion of India. In time, we hope to repay France for their help, but for now we must focus on the task at hand."

FRA_amenagement_idea:0 "Aménagement of the Territory"
FRA_amenagement_idea_desc:0 "France has historically been a very centralised country, meaning that most of the development has been limited to industrial cities and population centres. We have funded large projects to ensure that all parts of our territory are developed to a satisfactory manner."

FRA_plan_prost_idea:0 "Plan Prost"
FRA_plan_prost_idea_desc:0 "Henri Prost's plans for highways linking the Paris suburbs has proved to be popular across the country. Many other municipalities like Lyon or Marseille have also signed up to the plan, and projects are already being drawn for a large highway network linking all of France's major cities together, from Lille to Toulouse."

FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes:0 "Paramilitary Gendarmes"
FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes_desc:0 "The Gendarmes are a fine organisation, a paramilitary police force capable of both civilian and military activities. While many have pushed to completely disband them, we will instead expand their activities to make them a parallel force to the French Communal Police."

FRA_secret_police:0 "Secret Police"
FRA_secret_police_desc:0 "There are still many enemies of the Commune inside the Commune, sometimes even inside positions of power or within the military. This push for transparency is dangerous, we must instead organise secret police operations to ensure the safety of the French people from internal influences."

FRA_demo_surete:0 "Sûreté Populaire Démocratique"
FRA_demo_surete_desc:0 "We cannot allow paranoia to lead to the destruction of the fine balance we achieved with the Sûreté Populaire. By democratising the organisation, we will ensure that the French respect the Police not by fear but by an understanding of their actions and goals, and by knowing that they serve them first and foremost."

FRA_hawkish_renseignements:0 "Revolutionary Renseignements"
FRA_hawkish_renseignements_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure our safety from reactionary enemies abroad. Simple counter-espionage is not adequate, we must be ready to spy on enemy countries and support Syndicalist movements across the world. A good offence is the best defence."

FRA_peace_renseignements:0 "Protective Renseignements"
FRA_peace_renseignements_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure the safety of our country above all else. Counter-espionage is the centrepiece of an effective national defence, and there are many enemies that wait for a moment of weakness to influence and rile up our population."

FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea:0 "Peaceful Revolution"
FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea_desc:0 "The International Syndicalist Revolution will come, but it will be civilised. With the main reactionary powers in Europe finally shattered and their workers liberated, we aim to encourage further uprisings by merely proving the superiority of Syndicalism to the whole world."

FRA_amateur_pilots_idea:0 "Amateur Pilots"
FRA_amateur_pilots_idea_desc:0 "There are many in our country that have taken up flying as a hobby or a vocation, but not all of them pursue careers in the Air Force. They should preferably be drafted to our air force, where their skills will increase our chances of finding the new Aces of the Air."

FRA_ecole_air_idea:0 "Ecole de l'Air"
FRA_ecole_air_idea_desc:0 "Flying is a skill by itself, and flying well in combat conditions is something that you can't just learn overnight. We won't repeat the mistakes of the Weltkrieg and its butcher of novice pilots, we need a large roster of well trained air pilots, and competent officers to lead them."

FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_idea:0 "Waves of Syndicalism"
FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_idea_desc:0 "The Commune's navy is mighty, and its reach is as far as we desire it to be. While we might lack the plentiful, worldwide ports of the French Empire of old, we still aim to have a navy that can intervene to any corner of the world at any time."

FRA_cut_off_capitalists_idea:0 "Cut off the Capitalists"
FRA_cut_off_capitalists_idea_desc:0 "The capitalists still pride themselves of their colonial territories. The fruit of their plunders still flow freely across the high seas. But if we have a say about it, we will ensure the stolen properties of the African, Asian and American workers will not enrich them."

French_Revanchism_idea:0 "French Revanchism"
French_Revanchism_idea_desc:0 "We have long prepared ourselves for this inevitable war. We have long cast away Pétain and his creed, but this does not mean we will forget what our brothers died for in the Ardennes, in Verdun, in the Chemin des Dames. We will avenge them, and once and for all regain what we deserved for our struggle."

French_Revanchism_idea2:0 "Social Patriotism"
French_Revanchism_idea2_desc:0 "It is not reactionary to be a patriot! To love the progress and equality granted by the nation, and to wish to defend said progress from imperialistic nations such as Germany. Viva la France!"


Revolutionary_spirit:0 "Revolutionary Spirit"
Revolutionary_spirit_desc:0 "The survival and prosperity of the Syndicalist world will only be ensured when the last reactionary bastion is terminated. We must stand ready to mobilise and shatter every reactionary government across the world. One day, the Internationale will extend across all seas and continents!"

FRA_socialist_education_idea:0 "Socialist Education"
FRA_socialist_education_idea_desc:0 "The education of the youth is one of the greatest goals that a country like the Commune may face. Luckily, the old education system of the Republic was already revolutionary for its day, giving us a good basis for the new one. A socialist education system, focused on the sciences and arts."

FRA_phalanstere_NOR:0 "Aid to Norway"
FRA_phalanstere_NOR_desc:0 "We are currently providing industrial aid to our Norwegian brothers."

FRA_avantgarde_idea:0 "International Avant-Garde"
FRA_avantgarde_idea_desc:0 "A united socialist artstyle, from art to music, could be a powerful tool that will help masses in the non-syndicalist world get interested in our ideals - through entertainment."
FRA_sorelians_supreme_idea:0 "Sorelians Rule Supreme"
FRA_sorelians_supreme_idea_desc:0 "Goerges Valois’s victory has secured Sorelian power over France, already Legionaries have been stationed in key government buildings whilst the Red Eagle of Sorel is plastered over existing Syndicalist symbols. Valois’s calls for patriotism, militarism and strong statism have been met with thunderous applause of the French workers prepared for a new Commune. Viva la France, camarades!"

FRA_corporate_syndie_idea:0 "Corporate Syndicalism"
FRA_corporate_syndie_idea_desc:0 "The attempts made by Chairman Valois to centralise the economy through establishing corporates relevant to areas of expertise have so far resulted in greater political representation of workers and an increase in production output. This is surely the future of syndicalism!"

FRA_black_guard_insurgency_idea:0 "Black Guard Insurgency"
FRA_black_guard_insurgency_idea_desc:0 "The assassination of Chairman Valois, committed by anarchist terrorists, has emboldened the Black Guard to come out of hiding and increase their attacks. Due to the increase in bombings and general disruption of every day life the nation's industrial output has been affected."
FRA_vanguards_in_power:0 "Vanguardist Sorelians In Power"
FRA_vanguards_in_power_desc:0 "Marcel Déat and his vanguardist allies have seized control of the Sorelian Council, ousting Bucard’s clique. Déat has proved himself to be a pragmatic opportunist, in the past he has forged alliances with unlikely figures and this newfound power will be no exception. Union leaders and those in favour of central planning and agricultural collectivisation have been promoted by Déat to positions of power whilst the more staunch nationalist Sorelians who have pushed for direct war with Germany have been relegated. There are even whispers of former Jacobins being accepted in Déat’s ranks. With the Vanguardists in full control France can be transformed into a true worker’s state."
FRA_ultranat:0 "Ultranational-Syndicalist Sorelians In Power"
FRA_ultranat_desc:0 "Marcel Bucard and his Ultranational-syndicalist allies have seized control of the Sorelian Council, ousting Déat’s clique. To many, Bucard is seen as a reactionary who switched sides to save his own skin, however despite this the new chairman has confirmed his commitment to crushing the bourgeoisie nations. Supported by both the military and the Revolutionary Legion, Bucard has forged alliances with left-wing nationalists eager to fight the Germans, but also with groups sidelined by the CGT such as futurists and technocrats. With the Ultranational-syndicalists in full control, France can continue its transformation into a strong nation state."
FRA_Sorelian_Division:0 "Sorelian Division"
FRA_Sorelian_Division_desc:0 "It seems that Valois's unquestioned authority and respect is what held the Sorelains together, with his passing the movement has crashed into chaos thanks to conflicting factions. The future of France depends on if these factions can cooperate."

Two revolutionary factions once allied together for the common cause of destroying the decayed Third Republic are now at each other's throats. The Sorelians, national-syndicalists who follow the ideals of Georges Sorel, have begun orchestrating mass organised rallies. Their paramilitary, the Revolutionary Legion, march down the streets chanting loyalties to their leader, Georges Valois and demanding punishment for the degenerate bourgeois who they claim rule the Commune.\n\nEqually troublesome are the Jacobins, under the command of Maurice Thorez, a devout follower of the deceased Russian revolutionary, Vladimir Lenin. Declaring syndicalism to be an inferior system to their preferred communism, the Jacobins have become notorious for instigating strikes against unions associated with the Travailleurs. Not only do both these groups attack the government, but also each other. Street battles have become common, this chaotic situation must be dealt with one way or another..."

### Focuses ###

FRA_amenagement:0 "Aménagement du Territoire"
FRA_amenagement_desc:0 "Our territory is vast and inequally developed, some rural regions having been left behind while others prosper and grow at spectacular rates. We must encourage local initiatives and consider ambitious infrastructure projects to solve that problem on a local and national level."
FRA_hydroelectricity:0 "Hydroelectricity"
FRA_hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Our mountainous regions in the Alpes and the Massif Central have plenty of high flow rivers, a perfect environment to install a clean and lasting source of energy and revitalise the backwards, rural mountainous regions of the Commune."
FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity:0 "Swiss Hydroelectricity"
FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Our recent conquest of Romandie has opened up several perfect spots for hydroelectricity as an extension of our existing network in the Alpes. Our leading engineers are certain that expanding our dams in the region would be greatly beneficial to our economy."
FRA_chemins_de_fer:0 "Office des Chemins de Fer"
FRA_chemins_de_fer_desc:0 "A Congress meeting over the status of France's infrastructure at the BGT showed the disorganisation of our rail system and how backwards it became. The Congress agreed on the need to create a new office specifically tasked with the development and maintenance of our railways to connect all the parts of France together."
FRA_mining_expansion:0 "Mining Expansion"
FRA_mining_expansion_desc:0 "The economic and infrastructural development of the regions of the Alpes and the Massif Central allows for a greater exploitation of the mineral resources available there. Our prospectors discovered new mineral deposits and we are now ready to start exploiting them on an industrial scale!"
FRA_plan_prost:0 "Plan Prost"
FRA_plan_prost_desc:0 "The engineer and urbanist Henri Prost came up with a plan to develop highways around the Parisian region to link the outlying suburbs. This idea is receiving widespread support and the BGT decided to fund new projects to expand highways through the Commune. The communes of Marseille and Lyon also asked him to draw highway plans for their cities."
FRA_autoroutes:0 "The Autoroutes"
FRA_autoroutes_desc:0 "The highways proved a massive boon to the economy and worker mobility in urban regions, now an ambitious plan has been put forward to expand them to the whole country! Linking every corner of our country will have a massive impact on our regional development and can only benefit the Revolution."

FRA_eco_direction:0 "Direction of the Economy"
FRA_eco_direction_desc:0 "Our economy is fairer to the workers and generally quite potent while reactionary economies live and die on the whims of capitalists, but internal conflicts have prevented us from steering our economy. It is time to call for a meeting of the BGT, so that these questions are once and for all settled by one the Commune's faction."
FRA_orth_syndicalism:0 "Orthodox Syndicalism"
FRA_orth_syndicalism_desc:0 "The course set since the revolution has been reaffirmed. This orthodoxy has proven effective, and with a bit of fine-tuning can be even more so."
FRA_reduce_unemploy:0 "Reducing Unemployment"
FRA_reduce_unemploy_desc:0 "Beyond the Rhine, unemployment is at an all-time high, we must ensure that the French worker will always have a job to feed his family. In this simple task of providing our people with the fruit of their sustenance, we prove our inherent superiority to the capitalist economies and their constant crises."
FRA_work_design_coop:0 "Worker-Designer Cooperation"
FRA_work_design_coop_desc:0 "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques. This also allows us to quickly train and educate our workforce to new techniques, by letting the designers directly teach the workers about them."
FRA_improve_manage:0 "Improve Management of Unions"
FRA_improve_manage_desc:0 "The Unions have for long been directing the economy, but they have some gaps and loopholes in their rules that can be exploited, leading to disastrous results for our economy. However, we will not question the place of the unions in our country. Instead, we will tighten management and rewrite some work codes."
FRA_dedication:0 "Sense of Dedication"
FRA_dedication_desc:0 "The worker has to realise that he is working for the greater good of the Commune and the French people as a whole. He must feel invested in his work at all times, and it is this way that we will improve our national spirit and our productivity. No need for whips or oppressive business owners."
FRA_fac_towns:0 "Factory Towns"
FRA_fac_towns_desc:0 "Our plan to rapidly expand the Commune's industrial base can be supported by the establishment of new factory towns, cities specially designed to provide housing and modern commodities to them and their families, while making sure they live close to their workplaces."
FRA_Industrialisation:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
FRA_Industrialisation_desc:0 "Jean Jérôme is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Jacobin, he is a proponent of Communal Industrialisation. While our country has always been one of the modern economies of Europe, we cannot yet compare to the Ruhr Valley. Only by ambitious industrial base expansion can we hope to measure to Germany."
FRA_inter_coop:0 "International Cooperation"
FRA_inter_coop_desc:0 "While our technical expertise is one of the best in the world, it is too easy to ignore any breakthroughs that are made in friendly countries on a false pretence of superiority. From new production techniques to management theories, we must stay observant and borrow anything that could benefit our own economy."
FRA_war_eco_agri:0 "War Economy and Agriculture"
FRA_war_eco_agri_desc:0 "Jacques Doriot is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Sorelian, he is a proponent of his 'War, Economy and Agriculture' theory, calling for a rapid conversion to a war economy along with an ambitious development of the agriculture. Should the German reactionaries attack, we will certainly have a use for the rifles and the bread."
FRA_modern_farms:0 "Modern Farms"
FRA_modern_farms_desc:0 "Farming has been a staple of civilisation since ancient times, and yet it has profoundly changed in just one century. Recent tools like tractors allow a single farmer to harvest fields in a single day that would have required dozens of farmers and a week in the past. Let's mechanise our farms, to put more food in our platters and our rations."
FRA_war_industry:0 "A War Industry"
FRA_war_industry_desc:0 "Despite rising animosity from Germany, our economy is still mostly dedicated to the production of civilian goods and is not suited for a major war. We need to develop our production of arms and equipment if we are to defend the Commune against external threats efficiently."
FRA_mass_production:0 "Mass Production"
FRA_mass_production_desc:0 "Our enemies are many, and our army is quite large as a result. This army needs a lot of equipment, and this clearly puts a strain on our factories. We must search new ways to improve our production of small arms through both design and manufacturing, without cutting corners."
FRA_cooperatives:0 "Cooperatives"
FRA_cooperatives_desc:0 "Daniel Guérin is the new economy minister of the Commune. An Anarchiste, he is a proponent of Cooperatives. The Commune's government is primarily here to serve its workers, and it must ensure the best working conditions for them. Letting them manage their own companies is a good way to start."
FRA_decentralized_industry:0 "Decentralised Industry"
FRA_decentralized_industry_desc:0 "Our industry is currently concentrated around Paris and major communes, but the people don't live only in Paris, Lille or Lyon but everywhere in France. We must put all efforts into developing all the regions of France so that our entire country prospers."
FRA_market_socialism:0 "Market Socialism"
FRA_market_socialism_desc:0 "The cooperatives we created must insert themselves in a new, equal socialist market. This market will make the economy more dynamic and allow everyone to pursue their own goals and share their industrial wealth in the respect of the ideals of socialism, without the predatory behaviours of the capitalist market economy."
FRA_ruralism:0 "Ruralism"
FRA_ruralism_desc:0 "The life of the peasant is the best life known to man, but the need for an industrial economy made this life impossible for most of the French people. We can, however, still encourage this lifestyle by bringing their factories and workplaces to the countryside, ending the tyranny of mass urbanisation."

FRA_communal_army:0 "The Communal Army"
FRA_communal_army_desc:0 "The French nation has an army, but it is an army that still does not have a unifying direction. Some still propose the same army of the Weltkrieg with High Command. Others want more initiative to NCOs. Others still desire a motorised and mobile army. Finally, there is also the idea of mass conscription. Once we dissolve the military trade unions, we must follow with an unified vision."
FRA_principe_concentration:0 "Principe de Concentration"
FRA_principe_concentration_desc:0 "As the butcher of the Weltkieg showed, there is nothing to be won with evenly spreading our troops across the entire front, taking only metres that we lose the next day to artillery barrages. By making local breakthroughs and investing into them, we can literally shatter the entire enemy front with a few good battles."
FRA_tank_research:0 "Tank Research Grants"
FRA_tank_research_desc:0 "Tanks are not new to us, nor to the world, but they are still a relatively new component of warfare. Improvements have been brisk in tank construction during the interwar, and it seems the true potential of armour is starting to reveal itself. Let us invest generously into the future of warfare."
FRA_fast_army:0 "Speed Cult"
FRA_fast_army_desc:0 "Motorisation is more than the future of cavalry. While the average truck will not last long under enemy fire, it allows us to get our troops to the very frontlines in incredible times. We must make speed the goal of all our tactics, all our training, all our equipment. Celerity is opportunity."
FRA_tank_assembly_line:0 "Tank Assembly Lines"
FRA_tank_assembly_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. By creating baseline quality standards, we can speed up production of armour and supply our tanks with large armoured divisions that will come down on the enemy like a brick."
FRA_tank_quality_line:0 "Quality Production"
FRA_tank_quality_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. Regardless, if we prioritise quality, we ensure that our tanks are the best of the best. Thus, every tank we produce will easily crush the tin cans that our enemy desperately output to counter us."
FRA_centralized_hc:0 "Centralised High Command"
FRA_centralized_hc_desc:0 "We are aware that the unsavoury events of 1919 have put a deep mistrust of military High Command in the people of the Commune. Regardless, we will need to rehabilitate the concept of the High Command. The idea of the squad leader deciding combat tactics is glamorous, but who will care for logistics and strategic manoeuvres?"
FRA_analysing_wki:0 "Analysing the Weltkrieg"
FRA_analysing_wki_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg, a tragedy to us and our British comrades, is a painful topic to study, but it is one we must study regardless. From the successes and failures of this war, we will learn how the next must be fought. Those who think that new tactics and strategies will sprout out of nowhere as the conflict draws near are deluded."
FRA_war_experience:0 "War Experience"
FRA_war_experience_desc:0 "The French army has fought many wars, and will fight many more. Every time we must stop and reflect on these conflicts, and make an analysis as thorough as possible to find where our plans have went right or wrong. Just because they did not fight under the Commune's flag does not mean they died in vain."
FRA_military_academy:0 "Military Academy"
FRA_military_academy_desc:0 "War is a complex topic, one that must be studied to be fully understood. While we have found many talents during the 1919 Civil War, we must take the preliminary steps to train new officers. We can also study our whole doctrine and renew the training of our officer corps this way."
FRA_officers_initiative:0 "Officer's Initiative"
FRA_officers_initiative_desc:0 "How often during the Weltkrieg have breakthroughs been made but not exploited due to unresponsive officers? We must ensure this does not happen again, every regiment should be able to act independently, drawing up plans and acting on them as they see fit. This is the reality of modern warfare, Napoleonic columns are history."
FRA_mission_type:0 "Mission Type Tactics"
FRA_mission_type_desc:0 "Our plans are not meant to be tasklists, else our troops are paralysed once the unexpected happens. Our plans must always be built with one specific goal in mind. This is the only rigid part of the plan, all else is left to squads to figure out. This way, we will always be ready to adapt our plans as the situation on the field develops."
FRA_flexible_support:0 "Flexible Support"
FRA_flexible_support_desc:0 "To ensure the efficiency of our squads, we must ensure they are served by artillery and support regiments in a flexible manner. This means that at any time artillery must be ready to fire on the orders of any squad linked to it, and support companies must be ready to intervene when called for help on the front."
FRA_empower_rifleman:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
FRA_empower_rifleman_desc:0 "Eventually, we can draft all the plans in the world and stack as many artillery guns in the backline as we see fit, but the humble Rifleman is the one who will win the war. By ensuring that even them can independently take initiative, we subtly improve the efficiency of every squad and defeat those enemies who use terror to lead them."
FRA_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Conscription"
FRA_mass_conscription_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed without a doubt that modern wars now take absolutely insane scales, drafting millions to fight on every side. Every Frenchman must know that one day, he may be called to defend his beloved country against the Reactionaries. We will only be defeated when the last of us perish!"
FRA_improve_manufactures:0 "Improve the Manufactures"
FRA_improve_manufactures_desc:0 "War truly has taken a massive scale, and such a modern war will need an amount of equipment that we perhaps cannot even fathom yet. To the rifle and grenade is added the tank and plane, soon perhaps more. We must ensure our military industry is the best it can possibly be, we will never have one too many rifles!"
FRA_global_organization:0 "Global Organisation"
FRA_global_organization_desc:0 "A grand army needs a grand command. However, it is not the High Command of old, sitting in a war room in Paris, drawing arrows on a map. It is the officers of every squad, of every regiment, of every army and of every front. All together, they will lead our army, and ensure our eventual victory in such a large conflict."
FRA_mass_fire_support:0 "Mass Fire Support"
FRA_mass_fire_support_desc:0 "With such a big army comes a new idea for the old concept of support fire. For long it was thought that artillery alone could support a push, but we believe that it is the duty of every squad that is not attacking to provide covering fires for those who push forward. This way, our enemies will forever duck as we move forwards."
FRA_grand_army_reform:0 "Grand Army Reform"
FRA_grand_army_reform_desc:0 "Our army is now united in purpose and in doctrine. No more does anyone dare call them a militia or street rabble. This brings back to the imagery of the Grande Armée, and indeed it is a legacy we are proud of. Let us ensure our whole army organisation is geared towards handling this many soldiers and officers."

FRA_equipment_modern:0 "Modern Equipment"
FRA_equipment_modern_desc:0 "The tools of war are ever improving, more efficient, more deadly. To some, this is a tragedy, but it is clear that we cannot shun them. War is an ugly reality, and we must face it. By ensuring our equipment is always the best, we make conflicts deadlier, perhaps. But our enemies will not spare us the courtesy of using those weapons on us."
FRA_special_forces:0 "Alpine Forces"
FRA_special_forces_desc:0 "Mountains have always been a radically different environment to fight in, and most of our borders cross mountains. We must ensure that our training of mountain forces is spotless, and that every new piece of equipment we invent is adapted to mountain warfare. Mountain artillery exists, perhaps mountain tanks soon will?"
FRA_tank_division:0 "Tank Divisions"
FRA_tank_division_desc:0 "It has been obvious for a while, but tanks are here to stay. Their armour is impenetrable to small arms fire, and their mighty cannon destroys whatever it is aimed at. As years go own, their designs become heavier and more destructive. We must stay on the forefront of tank technology, so that we may dominate the battlefield."
FRA_road_to_war:0 "The Road to War"
FRA_road_to_war_desc:0 "The war with Germany is clearly inevitable, this nation holds hostage our brothers in Alsace and Lorraine, and with its many puppets in the Reichspakt it stands as the main counter-revolutionary power in Europe, if not the world, tyrant over hundreds of millions of people. This will stop, we will avenge them all. The first Weltkrieg was not the last."
FRA_renseignements_generaux:0 "The Renseignements Généraux"
FRA_renseignements_generaux_desc:0 "It has become clearly obvious that we cannot defend our country in a satisfactory manner without a modern, centralised intelligence agency. The taboos of old still hold against such centralised, unscrutinised authority, but it is a sacrifice we have to make. German spies laugh softly at our pitiful 'intelligence committees'."
FRA_military_buildup:0 "Military Build-up"
FRA_military_buildup_desc:0 "To prepare for the upcoming war, we will need to develop our war industry rapidly and efficiently. This may damage our short term economic growth, and this may not be popular for those in our populace who hope for peace and prosperity, but we sadly know better. The survival of the Revolution is at stake here!"
FRA_military_buildup_two:0 "Calibrating the Economy"
FRA_military_buildup_two_desc:0 "The capitalist world is still struggling with last year's shattering economic crisis whilst the righteousness of our own system continues to prove itself. It has been suggested that we utilise this industrial advantage to transform certain aspects of the economy exclusively towards military purposes."
FRA_socialist_education:0 "Socialist Education"
FRA_socialist_education_desc:0 "The education of the French Republic was in many ways excellent, allowing the average citizen to obtain a large knowledge in the sciences and arts. We seek to continue working on this legacy by ensuring that French schools always have learning and education as their primary goal, not hierarchy and discipline like in some reactionary countries."
FRA_Our_time_has_come:0 "Revanchist Propaganda"
FRA_Our_time_has_come_desc:0 "Our desire of revenge against Germany has been long coming. 1871 saw us lose Alsace-Lorraine, and the Republican schools rightfully taught their children that it was a French region soon to be seized back. Sadly, 1919 saw our defeat and the loss of Nancy. But we are not done, our rightful anger shall only end when France is whole again!"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals:0 "Department of Revolutionary Ideals"
FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals_desc:0 "While the empirical teachings prove themselves easily, the virtues of the Commune are harder to communicate to our population. While ominous sounding, we must create an institution ready to help us remind to our people the value of the Revolution and prevent reactionary influences from implanting themselves."
FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute:0 "Blanqui Research Institute"
FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute_desc:0 "While some nations resist the teachings of science, France endorses them without nuance. Let's support the establishment of a new research institute aimed at furthering our technological superiority. Where reactionaries doubt every discovery and stand wary of change, we embrace them and become stronger every year!"
FRA_military_buildup_three:0 "Further Military Development"
FRA_military_buildup_three_desc:0 "Our economy is now well developed and the Commune is ready for war, but we can always do better. By encouraging further industrial projects, the Commune shall not only be ready for war but will indisputably be superior in every way to any of our enemies. We will prove to the world that the Commune will not be defeated!"
FRA_military_science:0 "Military Science"
FRA_military_science_desc:0 "France is always working on improving its research networks, but theoretical sciences can only bring us so far. We will open a new wing in the Blanqui research institute dedicated to military science, allowing us to fund and develop new breakthroughs that will be immediately put to use by our army."
FRA_synthetic_refineries:0 "Synthetic Resources"
FRA_synthetic_refineries_desc:0 "France is great and resourceful, but it does not have everything. Oil, rubber, tungsten and chromium all lack, and we may not always rely on foreign exporters when conflict comes. We must research news ways to acquire these resources from what we already have. Some scientists even suggest we may be able to engineer those resources."
FRA_secret_weaponry:0 "Electric Machines"
FRA_secret_weaponry_desc:0 "While computing traces back to the tabulating machine, we have since made massive breakthroughs in the field of computing. Our mathematicians already assure use that those new machines are of a tremendous help for rapid and efficient calculus. Given some patronage and time, we can only imagine the possibilities of this new field."
FRA_damocles:0 "The Damocles Project"
FRA_damocles_desc:0 "Inspired by the Cambridge Conference during the Second Internationale Congress, a reunion took place today at the University of Cambridge. A group of theoretical physicists from Britain and France are requesting funding for the establishment of the 'Damocles Project', a joint British-French committee for nuclear research."
FRA_nuclear_weapons:0 "Curie Project"
FRA_nuclear_weapons_desc:0 "While the Damocles Project held great promise, the refusal by the Union of Britain to take part crippled the cooperation between our scientists and theirs. Regardless, we must persevere and try to figure out what uses we can make of the atom. We will dedicate this project to the very woman who discovered Radium and set us on this path."
FRA_German_borders:0 "Fortify the German Border"
FRA_German_borders_desc:0 "We have already built a fairly impressive network of fortifications along the Meuse river and the border with Flanders-Wallonia. Regardless, we can improve it with new constructions and cutting-edge military installations like radio stations and modern artillery guns. Something the Republic would have never bothered to do, surely."
FRA_extend_line:0 "Extend the Line"
FRA_extend_line_desc:0 "While we have mostly focused our fortification efforts on those segments of the line that are the most defensible, it is quite obvious that Germany will target our weaker points instead. The solution is quite simple, we will not have weakpoints. Least they learn how to walk on water, good luck for them to cross this line!"
FRA_Demand_Romandy:0 "Demand Haute-Savoie"
FRA_Demand_Romandy_desc:0 "The illegal Swiss occupation of Haute-Savoie has gone on for far too long! The Swiss have shown themselves brutish tyrants and oppressors of our people on our own rightful land! No-one can have the audacity to persecute and hunt down Frenchmen and think they may get away with it, the perfidious Swiss have made their last mistake."
FRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine:0 "Demand Alsace-Lorraine"
FRA_Demand_Alsace_Lorraine_desc:0 "The French people shall wait no longer! The time has finally come for Germany to return the whole of Alsace-Lorraine or face the ultimate consequences!

FRA_armee_de_lair_desc:0 "Planes are a strange new aspect of warfare. These machines are quite complex to handle, and the punishment for failing to fly properly obvious.

Only our wits will work in this brand new field of warfare, and luckily we have some."
FRA_air_bases:0 "Establish More Air Bases"
FRA_air_bases_desc:0 "Planes require air bases to land, refuel, rearm, repair and take off, much like navies. But unlike navies, they cannot stay airborne for months, only hours.

FRA_bombers:0 "Bomber Focus"
FRA_bombers_desc:0 "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for us, and it is one our enemies might not defend adequately against yet.

FRA_strat_bombers:0 "Strategic Destruction Focus"
FRA_strat_bombers_desc:0 "If one bomb works well against an enemy, then ten bombs must only work better.

FRA_paratroopers:0 "Paratroopers Development"
FRA_paratroopers_desc:0 "Until now, we have always considered that the only way to transport troops are trucks and landing craft.

FRA_new_doctrine:0 "The New Doctrine"
FRA_new_doctrine_desc:0 "Our navy is a tool, to be applied carefully when the situation calls for it.

FRA_submarines_desc:0 "As modern war takes to the air, it also goes under the seas. Submarines provide a new, revolutionary change to naval warfare.

FRA_cut_off_capitalists:0 "Cut off the Capitalists"

FRA_naval_bombers:0 "Develop Naval Bombers"
FRA_naval_bombers_desc:0 "The air can well pair with the sea.

comfrance.1.d:0 "The Third Republic ended the way it began: defeated by German arms and facing communist revolution at home. In the November of 1919, a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. 'The Party of Order' was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in subsequent months the French Establishment was forced out of France by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, the self-styled 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936, the consensus that was reached in order to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is being deemed as increasingly outdated by many critics, and there are growing calls for more radical policies. France is increasingly confident in her security and in her mission, but the French revolutionary tradition is disparate, and it is unclear precisely which ideological strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

comfrance.127.t:0 "The Phalanstère International Research Organisation"
comfrance.127.d:0 "As time has passed it has quickly become apparent that the global revolution requires far more than just devotion to the cause. With France and Britain being the only highly-developed socialist countries in the world, it has become widely accepted that they should launch a long-term research aid programme for other countries. And thus has begun the so-called 'Phalanstère International Research Organisation', a branch of the 'Phalanstère International' programme aimed at providing technological support for socialist countries all over the world. The question now is whether we should join in with this endeavour."
comfrance.127.a:0 "Participation sounds good."

comfrance.130.d:0 "Having at long last taken control of the Commune, the Jacobin led Comité de Salut Public is in the position to begin a complete conversion of the governmental system from failing Syndicalism to glorious Leninism. Hardline comrades are demanding that the Syndicalist structures be completely abolished, all replaced by the Parti Communiste Français in a Bolshevik-Leninist state. However despite Chairman Thorez's support for this initiative, this is likely to viciously divide France and as such many more moderate party officials are suggesting that the Jacobins continue to operate within the established Syndicalist structures of the BGT and CSP while gradually reforming the state along 'true' Marxist lines. Whatever the outcome is it shall surely cause more division"

comfrance.134.d:0 "Leading Travailleur figure, Léon Blum, along with respected war hero Maurice Gamelin, have begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities.\n\nFearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently, other than Blum himself, the still-respected general Maurice Gamelin."

The Paris Trial aims to prove that Blum and his associates have undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."

Gamelin and Blum have restored the formerly abolished Syndicalist institutions, the CGT and BGT, and in emergency elections Gamelin has been elected as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail with Blum appointed Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public.

The traitor general Maurice Gamelin failed to overthrow the Communists with his first attempt at a march on Paris and was forced to retreat south. Now we have received word via secret channels that Gamelin is willing to recognise a Republican restoration in return for aid in defeating the Jacobins.\n\nAlthough considered one of the worst traitors France has ever seen for leading the reds in the first civil war which saw us reduced to our exile in Algiers, this could be our best chance to return home and drive out the craven Communards that stole it from us."

His soldiers are advancing on Marseille, surely to pave the way for the Nationalist forces that are even now readying to invade our homeland.

Legion outposts can be found across France and the Sorelian Red Eagle can be found flying high above well armed militants loyal to Valois. \n\nSince the victory of the Sorelians there has been suggestions to merge the Legion with the French Revolutionary Armed Forces, despite resistance from notable generals such as Maurice Gamelin, on this day the Legion will officially be incorporated into thr military under the command of General Marcel Bucard."

comfrance.903.d:0 "The Sorelians emerged during the French Civil War as violent, revolutionary and staunchly anti-reactionary movement when Georges Valois, Hubert Lagardelle and Jacques Arthuys decided that the time was right to turn their underground political group, Cercle Proudhon, into a fully fledged political movement. These three men observed the Weltkrieg as the beginning of a new age, one where capitalism and traditionalism would be replaced by syndicalism and nationalism. Despite being former associates of Action Française the three launched a scathing campaign against social conservatives, monarchists and all who stood against the revolution. \n\nAdopting the red eagle as their symbol the Sorelians have quickly gained popularity amongst the working-class who saw their organised marches, uniformed militia and violent altercations with reactionaries as a form of expressing their outrage to the establishment. When the Civil War ended and the anarcho-syndicalists took the seat of power in Paris the Sorelians changed their rhetoric anti-reactionary to anti-anarchy. \n\n Up until now the Travailleur's have used the Sorelians as a bulwark against reactionaries however now are terrified that these radicals may at long last turn on them in the upcoming elections. Demanding; centralization, revanchism against Germany and a restoration of French nationalism the Sorelians now poses a major threat to the Anarcho-Syndicalist Commune with it’s paramilitary, the Revolutionary Legion, engaging in street fights and the intimidation of political opponents.

Inspired by both Lenin’s failed Bolshevik Revolution and French revolutionary history they seek to bring an end to Syndicalism, citing it as a failed ideology manipulated by ‘Social-Reactionaries’ to further control the proletariat. Led by revolutionary hero, Maurice Thorez, a man who has now forsaken his former Syndicalist loyalties and pledged allegiance to the international communist revolution. Thorez has stated his conversion to what many perceive as an obsolete ideology, is a direct response to the growing bureaucracy and corruption in CGT. \n\nTaking their name from the violent revolutionary movement under the leadership of Maximilien Robespierre, the Jacobins see themselves a vanguard against anarchists and social-reactionaries who are more than willing to use violence to spread the word of Marx. Currently they are engaged in a bitter rivalry with the Sorelians that has escalated into large scale street fights between the Revolutionary Legion and Jacobin militants. However, despite the use of violence and a previously complete rejection of the CGT’s authority, Thorez has announced his intention for the Jacobins to stand in the upcoming elections. It is to be seen how receptive the greater populace are to Thorez’s idealistic communist state, will they embrace the legacy of Lenin or loyally defend Syndicalism?"

The resulting blast injured all three men on the stage, the latter two being cabinet member Marcel Déat and Director of the Comité de Renseignements Généraux, Pierre Laval. All three were immediately driven to the nearest hospital whilst brave legionaries returned fire at the terrorist scum, two were shot dead whilst the last is in captivity. Thankfully camrades Déat and Laval survived the explosion with minor injuries however Valois did not, despite the hospital’s best efforts, the resulting blast and stray bullets where too much for the aging leader. Our dear Chairman was a true revolutionary and his ideals will not be forgotten nor will his death be in vain.\n\nThe difficult task of choosing a successor now falls upon the Sorelian high council, in the meantime a recovering Laval has been instated as the temporary head of government until a successor is chosen.

If we are to move forward with centralizing the government, we need to unite the people under our political beliefs. Revolutionary Legion commander, Marcel Bucard, has launched coordinated raids on important union headquarters with hundreds of union leaders being arrested under the crime of disloyal ideals.

comfrance.910.d:0 "After the death of Georges Valois, the Sorelians have split between several factions inside the party. The largest and most influential ones being the Vanguardists led by Marcel Déat, and the Ultranational-Syndicalists led by Marcel Bucard. Both of the factions  have been actively fighting for dominance over the party, and absorbing the smaller factions in an attempt to rival each other. The Vanguardists have the most influence over the Sorleian aligned unions and the old guard, members who were involved in the founding of the Sorelians, whilst the Ultranational-Syndicalists have the loyalty of the Revolutionary Legion. Caught in between the crossfire is the newly inaugurated president of the Sorelian Council, Pierre Laval, who has forged close relations with both factions in an attempt to maintain some sort of stability."

Named the ‘Black Guard’, its purpose is to destabilize France through bombings, assassinations and vandalisim. Inspired partially by the Illegalist movement, which has taken some power within the rebel circles. The Guard have made it clear they will stop at nothing to destroy the National Workers State. It’s rumoured that the main leader of the Black Guard is famed Ukrainian anarchist who was exiled to France, Nestor Makhno. The Sorelians, after hearing about these rumors, ordered a raid of Makhno’s residence. However, upon the initial raid Makhno was nowhere to be found further fueling these rumors.

The Sorelians have begun targeting Jews, they accuse them of profiteering off France’s instability and sowing division amongst citizens. Sorelian propaganda has launched scathing attacks and the Revolutionary Legion have begun rounding up Jewish intellectuals, bankers, businessmen and rabbis to be sent to unknown locations.\n\nWhilst Bucard struggles to maintian power of the nation and deals with lingering anarchist terrorism it is undoubtable that this persecutation is purerly done to distract the French people from the nation’s unsure future..."

The next step of this plan is to unite all loyal unions under one state sponsored labour organisation.

It is nescessary then, as a revolutionary Sorelian State, that we seek to estabilish at all costs a French society that is unlike the ones that preceded it in the last 1000 years - one of strength, vitality, and human perfection. The Frenchman must at all costs rival and go beyond the prowess of the German Ape-Man, who is such a brute that they lack even the most basic understanding of the world like we have. The Frenchman, unlike the German counterpart, has always had an underlying sense of vitality and strength, one that was beyond all his neighbors which were either falling asleep in their siestas or being so stupid that they can't change the oil on a lamp. It is nescessary then, to enact an enormous and violent purge of the weak which corrupt French society and have done so for the last thousand years, much like a class war which instead of involving the ruled and the ruler, it instead involves the weak and the strong. Therefore, the Revolutionary Legion has now made tremendous efforts to cleanse our lands of those considered feminine, weak, and frail, and raise up to the sky those who are strong, vital, and in unending militancy against the Ape-German and other reactionaries.\n\nMarc Augier has also begun extremely extensive efforts to create the perfect Frenchman; one that has been dispelled of all elements of Royal frailness, of the uneducation of the masses, that is both intelligent and built like a tank - this search has made us go through hundreds of Frenchmen, to find the perfect specimen.

Therefore, Chairman Déat has created the Déat Jeunesse, a paramilitary organization that seeks to train young boys into becoming militant and extremely loyal beacons of the Revolution through rigorous training, education, and camraderie.

Red Brigades have long since been banned with the Travailleurs opposing their brutal methods forcing these exiles to once again go into hiding. That has changed, the Jacobin regime being openly Leninist unsurprisingly hailing these exiles as revolutionary heroes allowing for Russian militant groups to once again operate publicly. Their brutality is not only endorsed by aided with the help of Jacobin commissars organising Russian exiles.\n\n One figure rumoured to be associated with the Red Brigades is Lev Davidovich Bronstein, more commonly known as Leon Trotsky. After the civil war the famed revolutionary seemingly disappeared; rumours and speculation told of his secret execution, suicide upon defeat or his constant travelling across the world surrounded by mystery and false identities. Yet these were all false for in reality Bronstein was living in a lavish apartment kept secret by the few governmental figures privy to his life whilst leading an underground network of Russian exiles. With close ally, Thorez, in control Bronstein has once again been brought into the fray.

It is undoubtedly a Nation born out of revolution, a Nation that grew out of revolution, and a Nation that lives now in Revolution.

This book was created by Déat himself, of course, and edited by himself, published by the State, which of course, is an extension of Déat's benevolent and fierce hand against the reactionaries, and printed by state-owned companies. The only remaining part is distribution - which part of the French State is needing to be directed politically to the correct line of syndicalism? Of course, it's the Army! Tens of thousands of copies of the book have been distributed across the army to every single batallion, ensuring that each of them has a commander which will read every little part of this wonderful book for them, to educate them further into the light of Sorel's legacy.

For tens of thousands of years, Humanity sat upon the dark cave of unknowingness, of fear and of ignorance, believing in magical fairytales about gods up in the sky, about gods of the Sun, about gods of the Earth, about gods of the Ocean. No longer - we, as the vanguard of humanity as a whole proclaims in one sole breath that Religion is done away with, it is no longer nescessary, and will never again be a valid form of thought. The reactionary forces that plagued mankind's brain for thousands of years has just been completely removed in the land of the Commune, and our comrade Marcel Cachin has just recently stated that he himself will ensure that the immense effort nescessary to finally wipe religion from even the most private of gatherings, from the most reactionary minds that permeate our lands, to even upper rankings in the Party which for some bizarre reason still hold on to this reactionary concept. No more. We are done with religion for-ever, and we shall ensure that the rest of the world will follow suit. What is next for our Commune? Of course, I understand, and the Party understands that the people need a cult, some form of myth to believe in - so, I have proclaimed the Cult of the Supreme Being, just like the one from the old French Revolution - and in it, a great myth of socialist realism will be put forward, one of reality, one of facts, and one of progressivism. One will believe now, profoundly, in their heart, in the ideals of the Revolution, not in the Church.'\n\nThe crowds of course, fiercely applauded, as comrades across the Commune rose in positive demonstrations to show their support for the PCF's decision."

comfrance.953.t:0 "Second Reign of Terror Proclaimed"
comfrance.953.d:0 "'Desperately, thousands of Communards have realized that this might be their end, knowing that Thorez came upon the Commune Square, a newly formed square in the center of Paris, and proclaimed a Total War against reactionaries across the board, proclaiming that "The greatest war, most importantly before any great war against an outside, reactionary power, is that of an internal war, one which puts a great terror on the enemies of the people.' He had decided, in an order which rang across the world, that Terror was the Order of the Day.\n\nImmediately hundreds of mid and high-level Communard Anarchists, Sorelians, Syndicalists, and others were rushedly taken from their homes, put in a guillotine, and in front of everyone, killed like cattle, one after the other, becoming hunks of meat in the floor, losing every inch of their life, and so just like that, the Commune has slowly been draining itself of political expertise, scientists, members of the political scene, and more, with the strike of a guillotine.\n\nMuch like Robespierre, Thorez himself believed this wasn't enough. More blood had to be spilled for the beloved Commune to be cleansed of corruption. So, he smiled. In a field of sorrow, screams, and agony, he smiled."

comfrance.954.t:0 "The Great Lenin Guides Us"
comfrance.954.d:0 "It has been a great sorrow, nay, the greatest sorrow of the early 20th Century, that the great Lenin himself was brought down by reactionary forces in Russia. His ideals were unparallaled in knowledge and understanding of the correct line of Marxism, and it is with our profound belief that Marxism-Leninism is the future of the Commune. It has been an incredible, unprecedented corruption and rottenness that has taken over the European continent and beyond with Syndicalism, being a force that destroys the creative force of socialism and Lenin's ideals. Therefore, to show that the great legacy of our comrade Lenin did not fall in deaf ears, we shall construct a great statue of the man, made with great care in every aspect about his figure, from his forehead to his shoes. This statue, a grand expression of Socialism in the heart of our beautiful Commune, shall be the expression of creative socialism that the world needs in order to save it from Syndicalist corruption. It shall be made in the center of Paris, and through the great labour of our workers, it shall be done in just a few months."
comfrance.954.a:0 "Long live the creative socialist mindset of our comrade Lenin!"

comfrance.955.t:0 "The Hunt For The Anarchist"
comfrance.955.d:0 "The old Commune is dead, destroyed by anarcho-syndicalism, and so shall be her children, which spread across our beloved France like a cancer which needs to be cut out at all costs if the National State is to thrive.\n\nPaul Marion was anxious, looking through papers, contacting spies via telegram and encrypted telephone signals, wanting blood to feed his beloved State which demanded at all costs total loyalty and militant socialist belief. It is then, that when a medium-level Anarchist, a bastard son of Makhno, began organizing a "protracted people's war" against the State, it became clear that it was nescessary to wipe him like a bug which sat on the window. As Marion fiercely kept attacking, going to every corner of street he could find which had even the tracest amount of Anarchist activity, and arrest those there without trial, silently removing them from the public eye, he also put curfews up, with an increased level of harshness against all enemies of the State.\n\nEventually, after two weeks of looking for this nameless, meaningless medium-level Anarchist which kept attacking our good orderly policemen and ruining our infrastructure, we found him, hiding in the home of a family in Bordeaux. Of course, we arrested all of them and did away with their records, ensuring they were never found again. Even if we all lose and fall to reactionary forces, at least the vile enemies of our people will never have existed."

comfrance.956.d:0 "Whilst we are still recovering from the aftershocks of the Black Guard insurgency we also must deal with the issue of the Vanguardists. Whilst they may be Sorelian camarades they are no friends to Chief Bucard. Since losing the power struggle, Marcel Déat has scuttled off with his cowardly clique of sycophants to lick their wounds, we must not underestimate their villainy. Therefore recent reports have provided us with an excellent excuse to dispose of them...\n\nLoyal camarade, Jean Fontenoy, has provided Bucard with a detailed report on his belief that it was in fact Déat who was responsible for the attacks. The day of the assassination suspicious acitivites were conducted, legionaries were pulled to one said and diverted from their patrols, armed terrorists were allowed to slip threw the crowd with little resistance and most shockingly despite the close proximity Déat and Laval were miraculously left with minor injuries. Although we have no solid proof, this report is all we need to justify the removal of the Vanguardists."

comfrance.958.t:0 "Nouvelle Politique Économique"
comfrance.958.d:0 "After the Leninist takeover by the Jacobins, an effort was put into place to transition the economy from one based on Petit-Bourgeois concepts such as management and salary differentiation, to one based on focusing solely on the Communist future, and focusing only on making French society ready for that future. However, as with all things, a transition had to be put into place as not to put too much strain on the gentle proletariat as the transition was made. Thus, the Nouvelle Politique Économique, or NPE, was introduced as a means of slowly reducing Petit-Bourgeois Syndicalism by disbanding all dangerous and overly-powerful unions that have over 1,000,000 members, while keeping those that genuinely support the Worker."

comfrance.959.t:0 "The Liberty of Voilence"
comfrance.959.d:0 "In a quiet summer evening in Paris, as people sat and drank coffee along with some croissants, it appears chaos has reigned supreme. The Black Guard has violently purged and dissolved the Government, burning down the CGT building and demanding that the people reign supreme. As they violently purged the remaining holdouts, chaos was caused around Paris and in the countryside, Anarchist elements across the country backed by Makhno slowly began consolidating control, as paramilitaries fought with the remaining Black Guard Elements. The provisional Anarchist State collapsed in of itself, resulting in a complete vaccum of power. Riots rise up across France, resulting in pockets of complete lawlessness across the countryside and in extremely small areas the size of a neighborhood in the cities - as Makhno and his gang carefully diffuse the situation, saying that this is a true symbol of veritatious Anarchy; full of vitality, destruction, and explosions of creation and annihilation. Of course, none of this was planned, the chaos only took hold due to wide-scale resistance from former communards and Sorelians. As this happens, reporters around the world are horrified of the developments in France and look around at the situation in hiding, knowing they'd be killed or worse if they were to appear openly. Surrealists like André Breton and Antonin Artaud also openly endorse the chaos, seeing it as an extreme form of surreal theatrical expression in France, with Bréton saying: 'This is the absolute state of existence - this is total surreal automatism, beyond reason and beyond facts. We have liberated ourselves from the State...'"
comfrance.959.a:0 "...Now we must liberate ourselves from Reality?"

comfrance.960.t:0 "Black Guard Target the Banks"
comfrance.960.d:0 "In the streets of cities like Marseille and Paris, Calais and Dunkerque, fire rose up through the skies and burned marble buildings - as bombs and artillery fired against the preciously delicate buildings which represented capitalism for far too long and subsequently the reactionary and totalitarian forces of the Totalist Charter, and with it millions of dollars worth of property were wiped out and turned into ash that flew into the sky, making the sky gray and foggy. Subsquently, elements of the Black Guard which controlled Paris brought Makhno to a podium and stated the following:\n\n'Comrades! It has been an excellent day - for the longstanding institution of currency which opressed our dear Anarchy has been wiped out! Banks across our Commune which were for far too long functioning - decades ago at the hands of capitalists, and then at the hands of Sorelians - both reactionaries of course, were destroyed and turned into complete piles of dirt and ash! This fire represents a cleansing, one which the world hasn't seen since the Free Territory, and now we have liberated ourselves completely from every element of statist society. Freedom is at your hands!'\n\nThousands began clapping and cheering, mixed with rioting from other forces, and just after those few minutes of quiet and profound observation and listening, it appears the Anarchy has returned back to it's normal state."

comfrance.957.t:0 "The Black Mark of Europe"
comfrance.957.d:0 "The so called syndicalist ‘revolutions’ were nothing more than a power swap, from tyrannical capitalist bankers to tyrannical union bosses. The regimes of France, Britain and Socialist Italy are no better than the Kaiser, for at least the Kaiser is honest about his all-powerful position. Syndicalist ''democracy'' has been a misleading tool used to fool the workers of the world into locking their own chains, true freedom requires the abolishment of any power hierarchy. The Black Guard have finally achieved this goal, liberation from the state, liberation from slavery. Upon seizing Paris, the Black Guard denounced their former allies in Britain and Italy, declaring the Free Territory of France the enemy of all nations who enslave their broken populace. This zone of anarchy is now detached from the rest of the world..."

comfrance.961.d:0 "With their leadership collapsed, the remaining Sorelian loyalists had no chance of launching a successful counter attack. The assassination of Valois was already a deadly strike at the heart of the Sorelian machine, the later bombings and killings only sealed their fate. Makhno’s fiery speeches had galvanised the working class into revolting against their masters, and no only few remain. Locked in chains as a symbol of their tools being used against them, the remaining Sorelian militant leaders break as they witness their regime crumble knowing their time has come.\n\nWith these last Sorelian leaders rounded up we must make the decision of how best to execute them, do we go for an efficient method or something more...explosive? After all the people are demanding a show..."

comfrance.962.d:0 "A creation like no other, the Free Territory of France or as it’s more commonly referred to, ‘Makhnovia’, against all odds still remains. Functioning not as a nation but a collection of fully autonomous communes and soviets united under the protection of the highly decentralised Black Guard. Whilst violence, pillaging and looting from rebels, holdouts and occasionally Black Guard militants still ravage the lands there has been development of a new society. When not firing on Sorelain bastards or themselves, communes trade and barter, a small step for any other society however with the collapse of all defining features of a nation this last remaining aspect of modern humanity continues. The only laws enforced are that of the Black Guard, although officially possessing no power, Nestor Makhno serves as the military defender of the Free Territory. His army is the only thing preventing other nations from taking advantage of the chaos and invading and whilst he rejects any title of leader he has become the national father of this new endeavour. As anarchy reigns so does Makhno."

comfrance.963.t:0 "Black Guard Disband The National Worker's State Military"
comfrance.963.d:0 "With the Sorelian governmental structure torn apart, the Black Guard have now focused their attention towards the military. Officially disbanding the Revolutionary National Worker’s Armed Forces and replacing it with the Black Guard, all field marshals and generals have either been forcefully removed from their position or shot. In response to this military loyalists attempted to garrison themselves in strongholds and resist the Black guard, a fruitless endeavour when their own soldiers turned their rifles towards each other. The engulfing chaos seems to have taken hold over even the most loyal soldiers, when responsibility for actions is removed people will quickly lose their sense of duty and unleash their true natural being.\n\nThe military of France is now composed of Black Guard militants under the command of prominent anarchist figures, with no official officers. These officers are democratically elected and have been provided with the freedom to act as they wish however they remain loyal to Makhno’s orders. When the time is necessary and Makhno must call upon his comrades to defend the workers of France, these warriors will rally behind the black flag!"

comfrance.964.t:0 "A Leader?"
comfrance.964.d:0 "One of the most important decisions we must first make is the position of ‘leadership’, we have already declared the Free Territory to be a leaderless anarchist society. We could fully commit to this and announce that officially there is no representative leader for the French people, this decision is supported by the prominent Illegalists within the Black Guard. However some, mostly Makhno loyalists, have proposed proclaiming Makhno the symbolic military defender of anarchy, a position that would lack any political authority however would acknowledge a form of hierarchy, even if such a position is only one of military necessity. A stance seen as hypocritical by some. It should be noted that even if we choose to have no leader, Makhno is still a beloved figure amongst the public and the most powerful man in France, his military might and political influence would certainly not disappear..."
comfrance.964.a:0 "No masters!"

comfrance.965.t:0 "Return of the Illegalists..."
comfrance.965.d:0 "The Illegalists were a faction of anarchists prominent in France and Italy during the early 1900s, staunchly devoted to complete individualism. Inspired by both the theories of Max Stirner and militarism of anarchists like Albert Libertad and Ravachol. The movement would engage in criminal activities justified as individual rebellions against the state. Rejecting morality and legality, Illegalists saw crime as a pursuit of one’s own desires and individuality.\n\nWith the totalitarian regime of the Sorelians, this strand of anarchism that is seen as radical even by anarcho-syndicalists has resurfaced amongst workers wishing to rebel against the National Workers State. Notorious anarchist Nestor Makhno, himself has begun to slightly drift towards Illegalism. Witnessing the failures of his anarcho-communist comrades in Ukraine and the failure of anarcho-syndicalists in both the Travailleurs and Anarchistes to prevent the rise of the Sorelains, the ideas of the complete abolition of hierarchy and use of crime has been seen by Makhno as nescessary to free France. There are even rumours that members of the notorious Bonnot Gang not only survived their infamous shoot-out, but have been advising Makhno as prominent Black Guard lieutenants..."

However in recent times the status-quo of Syndicalism has led to weakness, with Valois now in control the revolution can be continued! The Commune will be reborn as the French National Worker’s State, a nation that values strength and labour, a nation that can reclaim the glories that we lost after the Weltkrieg.\n\nOne of the first changes we must make is the new flag, shall we raise the Sorelian inspired Commune flag or the banner of the Revolutionary Legion..."

The Front Populaire, in consultation with the Supreme Court, has issued summonses for all prominent Jacobin politicians to attend a large-scale trial that seeks to determine the punishment for their betrayal. It has already been decided in advance that the leader of the Jacobins, Maurice Thorez, should be given a separate trial to personally decide his fate.

The process spanned several days, filled with dramatic speeches by the defendants and courageous lectures by prosecutors. After all the defendants had finally been heard, the court withdrew for consultation for a further day after completion of the taking of evidence.

Maurice Thorez, chairman of the PCF and traitor to the commune, has now been brought to trial. The reading of all charges took more than two hours, and the subsequent trial took more than three days until the court closed the case and withdrew for the verdict. On the following day the verdict was finally announced. The court dismissed a life sentence because of the gravity of offenses and instead imposed the death sentence by firing squad. Throughout the trial,Thorez sat calmly without any emotion and did not say a word, and when he was given the final word after the sentence was pronounced, he said nothing and stared straight ahead. After that, the audience in the hall and the people in front of the courthouse broke out into thunderous jubilation.  Throughout France, citizens celebrated the end of the treacherous dictator. The following day at exactly six o'clock in the morning, the death sentence was carried out in public with Thorez blindfolded and tied to a post, whereupon cheers and applause broke out as the bullets lef the barrels of the firing squad. And so ended the failed Jacobin reign of terror in our nation."

The consolidation of the Communard Spirit which forms the basis of our country, as well as the strengthening of the syndicalist way of life! And finally 3. The reform of the military and police forces to be able to better defend ourselves against internal dangers such as the PCF in the future, as well as against external threats such as our archenemy, the German Empire!

Dressed in blue paramilitary uniforms with a recognisable beret, they are to be armed and trained directly by the armed forces in order to act as a disciplined force.

However the Jacobin’s attempted purge of CGT politicians left many Travailleurs to go into hiding, in a prison cell or dead, it was during this time of turmoil that Blum emerged. Uniting his comrades with the Anarchistes, Sociaux-Démocrates and Gamelin’s syndicalist aligned military he formed a united front to oppose Thorez.\n\nNow as head of government, serving as leader of the Commune under the protection of Maréchal Gamelin, he is tasked with forming a government to maintain the unity of the Front Populaire. Blum has already proven himself a successful man of action and capable of forming relations with political opponents, however without the threat of the Jacobins it will be a difficult task to keep the Front whole."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_LOUIS_BOBOZO_DESC:0 "The last thing young Gonzague imagined in his career as a German Askari is to be leading one of the biggest states in the now-free Africa. Born in the later years of the Belgian Congo and then Mittelafrika - he was enthralled by the discipline and exploits of the Askari. He signed up in 1933 and quickly rose through the ranks through his great leadership skills after squashing several revolts and guerrilla groups on behalf of his Hunnic masters. However his true loyalty was always with his people. When the Governor of the Congo ordered his division to pacify Kivu and his home state of the northwest with senselessly brutality, he decided to stand up for his people by organizing a mutiny. Despite his really young age, he rallied most of the Congo's African-majority armies under his banner and overthrew their German masters. Now young Gonzague stands at a crossroads - his fledgling clique is surrounded on all sides by enemies, and his government is rife with incompetence due to his lack of political experience from his young age. Will the Kivu Clique lead the Congo to it's deserved glory, or will it fall to the other warlords and tribes vying for the same level of power?"

### Ideas ###

KIV_native_support:0 "Support from the Congolese"
KIV_native_support_desc:0 "Both the urban sprawls and primordial wilds of the Congo are home to millions of people, many of whom revile the colonial system as much as we do. Though they may not throw in with us politically, or in any official capacity, these masses are still allies to the cause and true Congolese patriots. Their aid, whether in the form of guerilla attacks or simple donations of weapons or supplies, goes a long way in helping the war effort."

KIV_inexperience:0 "Inexperienced in Statecraft"
KIV_inexperience_desc:0 "We are a newly birthed nation in an ever expanding sea of chaos and war. Our forces and infantile government have no experience when it comes to running a state, and as such, the process of laying our initial national foundations has been a painful and slow process. We must adapt quickly to this new situation, lest our independence be lost before it has even been truly earned."

KIV_inexperience2:0 "Inexperienced in Statecraft"
KIV_inexperience2_desc:0 "We are a newly birthed nation in an ever expanding sea of chaos and war. Our forces and infantile government have no experience when it comes to running a state, and as such, the process of laying our initial national foundations has been a painful and slow process. We must adapt quickly to this new situation, lest our independence be lost before it has even been truly earned."

KIV_push_idea:0 "Final Push"
KIV_push_idea_desc:0 "The Askari and native kingdoms and tribes have been rallied and roused while our forces pour into the Congo’s various thickets and estuaries, cutting down mercenaries and settlers alike in their quest to rid the Congo of the Imperialist’s taint once and for all. The final moment is upon us, for it is now or never. We shall either die a fiery and glorious death in the service of our people or we shall finally stand free and victorious over a sovereign Congo. Destiny awaits us in the final battle, so let us charge and meet fate head on!"

KIV_masters_of_the_jungle_idea:0 "Masters of the Jungle"
KIV_masters_of_the_jungle_idea_desc:0 "The jungles and thickets of the Congo are some of the oldest and densest on Earth, and no one knows these lands quite like we do. Drawing upon the vast wealth of knowledge the many native Bantu peoples have of these virgin wilds and incorporating this into our tactics as codified doctrine will allow us to teach these tips and tricks of jungle warfare to new recruits for generations to come. We are one with the jungle, and we shall use this fact to rein hellfire down upon our foes as they struggle to cross the mires and pitfalls of this primordial eden."

KIV_masters_of_the_jungle_idea2:0 "Masters of the Jungle"
KIV_masters_of_the_jungle_idea2_desc:0 "The jungles and thickets of the Congo are some of the oldest and densest on Earth, and no one knows these lands quite like we do. Drawing upon the vast wealth of knowledge the many native Bantu peoples have of these virgin wilds and incorporating this into our tactics as codified doctrine will allow us to teach these tips and tricks of jungle warfare to new recruits for generations to come. We are one with the jungle, and we shall use this fact to rein hellfire down upon our foes as they struggle to cross the mires and pitfalls of this primordial eden."

KIV_aksari_dominance:0 "Askari Dominance"
KIV_aksari_dominance_desc:0 "Our war for independence may have been fought with the masses of tribal and village conscripts requisitioned from the many kingdoms and ethnic groups within the Congo, the war was won by the Askari. Their dominance and skill is unmatched in the region, and they shall be given sweeping benefits and powers to thank them for their service, for the Congolese owe these men their lives and freedom, and they will be rewarded for it."

KIV_officer_rule:0 "Rule of the Officer Committee"
KIV_officer_rule_desc:0 "An oversight committee of loyal Askari officers and strategists shall be established in order to serve as the main bureaucracy of our state. This thinktank of stern, stalwart military minds shall lead the Congo as they endeavor to usher in a newfound era of stability and unity. Our administration shall be free from corruption and greed as the principles of stratocracy and our soldiers’ fine training and sense of duty guide our way into the future."

KIV_officer_rule2:0 "Rule of the Officer Committee"
KIV_officer_rule2_desc:0 "An oversight committee of loyal Askari officers and strategists shall be established in order to serve as the main bureaucracy of our state. This thinktank of stern, stalwart military minds shall lead the Congo as they endeavor to usher in a newfound era of stability and unity. Our administration shall be free from corruption and greed as the principles of stratocracy and our soldiers’ fine training and sense of duty guide our way into the future."

KIV_no_corruption:0 "Purge of the Corrupt"
KIV_no_corruption_desc:0 "Corruption is a cancer that has long infected Congolese administrations from the rule of King Leopold to the fall of the Vrijstaat, ever spreading like a cancerous mass seeking to swallow any notion of good governance in Congo before it can even begin. We must cut away and remove any and all sources of corruption and decay using whatever means the Young General and his forces deem necessary. Congo will be cleansed of this plague once and for all."

KIV_colonial_purge:0 "Authenticité Program"
KIV_colonial_purge_desc:0 "The newly christened Gonzague Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga has decreed a ‘return to authenticity’ to wash over all of the Congo. Seeking to eliminate any and all traces of colonial influence, Gonzague has decreed that things like western religions, dress, naming conventions, pronoun usage, and more are all dated and tainted vestiges of an imperialist-dominated past. All of these sins and more shall be washed away in this process of ‘Nzerianisation’, for the Congo is for Africans, and no one else!"

KIV_retirement_fund:0 "Askari Retirement Fund"
KIV_retirement_fund_desc:0 "It was on the backs and with the blood of the Askari that Congo’s independence was won. Without these veterans, our shining republic would have been but a mere distant dream in the minds of servants, slaves, and deadmen. Despite many of them serving under the regime of the imperialists before the Collapse, these men have proven that they are true sons of the Congo. Pensions, housing-assistance, jobs, and more will be provided to these heroes, and the people they saved shall pay for it."

KIV_solid_government:0 "Stable Bureaucracy"
KIV_solid_government_desc:0 "Our new republic needs a strong bureaucracy if our government is to adequately meet the needs of the Congolese people in an efficient and orderly fashion. Long dead must be the days of chaos and misinformation that once infested every inch of our Congo under the Vrijstaat."

KIV_ethnic_federalism2:0 "A Federation of Ethnic Equals..."
KIV_ethnic_federalism2_desc:0 "The new Congolese republic must embrace its unique constituent identities and ethnicities and not hide behind the facade of a central and unified ‘nationality.’ Sure we all live in the Congo, but we are not all just Congolese; we are Zande, Songye, Luba, Kundu, Mbole, Hamba, Komo, Ngata, and so many more. Together, but unique, shall be the way forward for the Congo and all its people..."

KIV_regionalism:0 "Congolese Regionalism"
KIV_regionalism_desc:0 "The unique identities that have formed in the various regions of the Congo from the unique local mixture of ethnicities and tribes is truly one-of-a-kind on this planet. We should embrace this regional identity and set up regional administration to govern each cohesive regional unit, for the leading party already does with their beloved Katanga."

KIV_private_investment:0 "Privatization of Colonial-Era Companies"
KIV_private_investment_desc:0 "The Tshombe regime has decided to privatize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, bursting open the floodgates for thousands of our people to jump at the chance to own their own business and companies. Though most will be bought up by the small minority of established, wealthy Évolués, the mere opportunity being available has been enough to stimulate our economy. Our profit margins soar ever higher as we build a true entrepreneurial class for our republic."

KIV_national_investment:0 "Nationalization of Colonial-Era Companies"
KIV_national_investment_desc:0 "The Tshombe regime has decided to nationalize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, massively inflating the resources at the government’s disposal and the responsibilities they must now be accountable for. President Tshombe himself is delighted, able to siphon off as much money from this ever-growing pot as he pleases as he uses the rest to drag the Congo into a modern and westernized future."

KIV_western_investment:0 "Western Investment"
KIV_western_investment_desc:0 "The Union Minière du Haut-Katanga is the largest company in the Congo, accounting for nearly 70% of our national economy. Any party willing to get anything done in this nation has to go through them, but Tshombe has long held friendly ties and business relations with this industrial conglomerate. By allowing the Union Minière free reign within our economy, the Congo as a whole and Tshombe himself will be rewarded handsomely as the economy is revolutionized, westernized, and modernized on a national scale. However, much of the profits will still be going into the pockets of these former imperialists."

KIV_uplifting_the_congolese_worker:0 "Uplifting the Worker"
KIV_uplifting_the_congolese_worker_desc:0 "The Congo is rather unique as far as colonial holdings in Africa go, for it has seen industrialization on a scale not witnessed elsewhere on this continent save for a few other regions such as within South Africa or Kenya-Uganda. This industrialization has allowed a true industrial working class to develop here - each soul of which is subjected to the same rigors and predators of the industrial world as in Europe or the Americas. We must not repeat the errors of our former masters, and move to uplift the downtrodden labourers of our nation. They are the backbone of our new modern economy and the ticket to a glorious and prosperous future, and they must be treated as such."

KIV_no_regionalism:0 "Unitary Congo"
KIV_no_regionalism_desc:0 "Factionalism, regional divisions, tribalism, and other petty social hierarchies and organizational failures have long wracked the Congo, tearing this massive paradise apart from the inside as these sickening ideas infected the minds of our varied peoples and drove them apart as the colonials moved in to pick up the pieces. We must galvanize a new national sense of unity and forge a united Congolese identity to serve as a bulwark against the corruptive and divisive forces that seek to undermine our new republic."

KIV_simba_revolt_idea:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_revolt_idea_desc:0 "Our righteous revolution has just begun, and already our forces are on the backfoot. The governmental forces of Kivu and the ANC have quickly mobilized against our ragtag group of rebels, and now our issues are as glaring as ever. We suffer from a lack of manpower and weaponry, and currently only our large base of popular support is keeping us in the fight. We must muster the strength and arms needed to beat back this foe and truly free the Congo and its peoples!"
KIV_simba_revolt_idea2:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_revolt_idea2_desc:0 "After cutting our teeth against our enemy in harsh jungle warfare, taking on numerous casualties due to our troops’ inexperience and outdated equipment, we have somehow begun to claw ourselves out of the dangerous corner our revolution started in. Though we are far from even the glimmer of victory, we have begun to taste it. If we continue to sow discord through their ranks and keep up our violent guerilla campaign, there just may be a path to victory."
KIV_simba_revolt_idea3:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_revolt_idea3_desc:0 "As our young soldiers slowly turn into veterans as they diligently fight their way through the Congo, our forces have begun to make major ground. No longer confined to only the jungles, our forces have created a unified frontline against the ANC. Now, with numerous urban centers and military depots under our control, victory in this war has begun to be expected by many of our more optimistic Simbas. Though victory is still not a certainty, our revolution now stands a real shot at overthrowing [KIV.getleader]’s regime."
KIV_simba_revolt_idea4:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_revolt_idea4_desc:0 "Against all odds and expectations, the forces of the Simba revolt have begun to occupy nearly every major city in the Congo, as well as maintaining their control over massive swathes of scattered Congolese wilderness. Using guerilla tactics and asymmetrical warfare to devastating effect, the ANC has been largely routed and the days are numbered for Kivu’s failing regime. Unless the reactionaries can pull off a miracle, it is only a matter of time before the Congo is swept under the Red tide."

KIV_simba_government_idea:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_government_idea_desc:0 "The vile Simbas have stoked the fires of rebellion for far too long, and now have risen up in arms to topple our state. Even now, the loyal and well-trained soldiers of the ANC are mobilizing en masse, making their way to the largest hotspots of this uprising. We must strike now and crush these Simbas before they gain any traction, while we have the upper hand. If we push hard, victory is all but assured."
KIV_simba_government_idea2:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_government_idea2_desc:0 "Though our initial contact with the Simba forces have proven to be bloody affairs for our own troops, we are still a much larger and more organized force. By utilizing our tactics and keeping our wits about us, we still stand a good chance of annihilating these Socialists before their taint permanently damages the Congo."
KIV_simba_government_idea3:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_government_idea3_desc:0 "After a harsh war against the Simbas and their cowardly guerilla tactics, the effects of these hit-and-run tactics have begun to show their effects. The ANC’s forces are haggard and undersupplied, with desertion being common, forcing the government to rely increasingly on mercenaries. Loyalty within their ranks is at an all time low, and if they don’t start seeing successes in battle soon, the Kivu Clique could stand on the brink of collapse."
KIV_simba_government_idea4:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_government_idea4_desc:0 "Chaos and turmoil have spread across the Congo on the back of the vile Simbas. These foul revolutionaries have beaten us back at every turn, waging their brutal guerilla war against the ANC to great effect. Now, their forces control most major cities in the Congo, and the writing on the wall for our regime couldn’t be clearer. Our backs are to the walls and unless something changes soon, the Congo will be lost to these Reds."

KIV_cohesive_socialist_democracy2:0 "A ‘Cohesive’ Socialist Democracy"
KIV_cohesive_socialist_democracy2_desc:0 "With the errors of the previous regime rectified and our struggle proving triumphant against the reactionary forces of the Congo, we are now free to fully establish our dream of a true Congolese democracy. However, the various parties not currently a part of the MNC’s broad tent have proven themselves to be nothing more than traitors and colonial sympathizers. We shall do to them what they tried to do to us, and ban them all from political activity. Our democracy shall be pure, fair, and free, guided strictly by Socialist principles, and only those who proved themselves loyal in the fires of the Simba Revolt shall be allowed to participate in our democratic dream."

KIV_civc_nationalism_idea:0 "Congolese Civic Nationalism"
KIV_civc_nationalism_idea_desc:0 "Nationalism has long been an integral part of the Congolese independence movement, but it has also been a plague that has invited radicals into our ranks and extremism into our hearts. We must cut away the dangerous ills of nationalist thought and embrace the idea of Civic Nationalism, or nationalism for the state and for liberal values over ethnic or racial heritage. Under this new breed of nationalist thought, we shall unify the people of the Congo and commit them to the ideas of our new Syndicalist republic while stamping out any dangerous ideas that try to sprout up and corrupt our people and our identity."

KIV_vent_frustrations_idea:0 "Taming the Congo with Bureaucracy"
KIV_vent_frustrations_idea_desc:0 "The Congo is still a largely disconnected and wild place, with our centers of power only truly existing in the largest cities that dot the dark expanse of these jungles like distant stars in the night sky. A massive, overarching, and constantly managed bureaucratic administrative system must be created to link the disparate communities of the Congo as we attempt to build a modern, cohesive nation state."

KIV_ensure_constant_electoral_sucsess_idea:0 "Ensuring Constant Electoral Success"
KIV_ensure_constant_electoral_sucsess_idea_desc:0 "Democracy is a fickle thing, and it must be overseen and administered in a way that achieves the most desired results, for the collective judgement of the masses is not so often of sound logic. To alleviate this inherent issue of democracy, Prime Minister Iléo seeks to secretly shackle the democratic process to his whims, ensuring that he and his supporters win election after election and are able to pass their own legislation without issue while hampering the ambitions of any political rival."

KIV_emmulate_fp_idea:0 "Emulating the Force Publique"
KIV_emmulate_fp_idea_desc:0 "Though the FP was a dastardly organization complicit in crimes on humanity against our people, they were damn effective at doing so. We shall adapt their strategies and tactics to our own forces to become the foundation of our new doctrine. With European weapons and ideas, we shall crush the disorganized rabble of wider Africa."

KIV_emmulate_the_anc_idea:0 "Emulating the ANC"
KIV_emmulate_the_anc_idea_desc:0 "Though the Young General Gonzague Bobozo may hold many strange ideas and notable flaws, he was a genius when it came to military command. We must emulate his ideas and his model - the fallen Armée Nationale Congolaise - and by their example, we shall organize the rowdy masses of Simbas and militias at our command."

With their greed and ambition consuming them, the Mittelafrikan monstrosity has collapsed and with it, so too has the Vrijstaat and this unholy trinity. We now stand free of the vile ‘politique indigène’ that oppressed our people for centuries, but we are not safe yet.

Hardened and more radical since his time peacefully advocating for Congolese socialism before the Simba Revolt, Kalonji still stands as an ardent defender of democracy and as a devout Protestant. Though under his rule only Leftist parties shall be allowed to run in this newly purified Red Republic, free democracy and piety without favoritism shall still be the basis of his platform, or so he says. The nation now watches to see if this priest turned war hero turned Prime Minister can truly save the idea of a fair Congolese democracy."

Monopolies, trusts, and other monumental colonial companies are nothing but predators to the average Congolese citizen, and none have been more damaging than the UMHK. We shall hunt these beasts and rout them from the Congo, shattering their hold on our economy and opening it up for fair civilian enterprise. The excess funds the state takes in from tearing down these monopolistic structures will also be redistributed to the people of the Congo, who have so desperately needed this aid to start building their lives in our newly independent workers republic."

However, the various parties not currently a part of the MNC’s broad tent have proven themselves to be nothing more than traitors and colonial sympathizers. We shall do to them what they tried to do to us, and ban them all from political activity. Our democracy shall be pure, fair, and free, guided strictly by Socialist principles, and only those who proved themselves loyal in the fires of the Simba Revolt shall be allowed to participate in our democratic dream."

Though most within the MNC and its splinter parties are ardent nationalists in one form or another, the degree to which they adhere to these beliefs and how radical, and potentially dangerous, they are varies wildly.

With his power secured following the Simba Revolt, Kalonji is in a far more commanding position, and as such has begun to use his exorbitant pull on the government to further our regime’s ties to the various churches.

By rectifying the differences between these two groups, the Lulua and Baluba peoples, Kalonji hopes to mend the divisions that have long plagued his kin while uplifting them in this new, rapidly modernizing state. If this plan succeeds, and Kalonji is able to mend the schisms between these two groups, he hopes to expand these ideas to the wider Congo in an effort to break down tribal divisions and unite the people of Congo without homogenizing their cultures."

Pulling from ideologies like Christian Distributism, Mutualism, and Market Socialism - ideas pulled from his American and French influences - Kalonji seeks to create a fair common market for all Congolese, and eventually all Africans, to participate in; a grand unified market where our people can be safe from predatory capitalism as they seek to earn themselves and honest living in our budding Socialist utopia."

The most European-influenced of his colleagues, many fear that Adoula may simply become a puppet of the Internationale, but his allies know that Adoula is no fan of radicals or the former colonizers, whatever their new governments may claim to be. Prime Minister Adoula shall push for fair and democratic trade unionism while toying with our new allies, playing our new regime off as more radical and committed to the Internationale cause than we truly are in order to curry their favor, and more importantly, empty their coffers."

We must build up our newly independent nation as if it were developing in a bubble, no matter how painful it may be, creating a closed and self-sustaining system using entirely domestic means.

Publicly advocating for the creation of a fair Socialist democracy like his old teacher, behind closed doors the young Prime Minister has different plans. Seeking to subvert this infantile democracy before it is even born to cement his authority, Iléo seeks to draw together the aspects of Congo society he deems unique to our righteous peoples, and forge a new unitary Congolese republic that emphasizes Nationalism, Socialism, and the Christian Faith."

Our revolt against the Kaiser’s collapsing colonial regime has been successful, and now we have control over the Congo in its entirety after viscously and heroically fighting a guerilla war against the various factions that wished to continue to keep us under the colonial boot.

With the bulk of this coalition being made up of various democratic elements and disgruntled Askari veterans and auxiliaries, these camps have come to dominate the clique. Leading this ragtag group is ‘General’ Louis de Gonzague Bobozo, a young firebrand who has been chosen by the Askari old guard and his peers to be the face of this resistance movement. Under this young General, the Kivu Clique has risen up in the Central African Lakes region of the Congo’s easternmost provinces, seeking to throw off the yoke of colonialism once and for all. Though their union may seem united and secure on the surface, tensions have risen internally over disagreements between the various constituent factions and the future is uncertain for this young native-rule movement. Regardless of their composition or cohesion, the Kivu Clique is dead-set on earning their sovereignty at all costs."

Their rule brought us stability and eventual victory, but now that the guns have grown silent, the people of the Congo finally wish to be heard. \n\nHowever, Gonzague also has recognized that his people may not be truly ready to lead themselves, for they have long languished under colonial rule and been forced to fall behind and become naive to the ins and outs of experienced statecraft. The Young General, however, has earned his experience firsthand in the fires of our revolution, and as such has earned the right to guide his fellow Congolese into their shared future more than any other man in this primordial jungle. \n\nThe Young General must his decision, and make it carefully, for his choice here shall cast the die for millions as he lays the foundations for the first independent state in the Congo in nearly a century."

Besides these outcasts, ABAKO, CONAKAT, and the PUC all stand great chances at winning, each led by a titan of the Congolese independence movement.

Seeking cooperation and consolidation of the various movements pushing for native rule in this Congo Crisis, Kimbangu has offered to join forces with our Clique.

Kivu rides towards the colonials and mercs on their own, but there is no guarantee they will leave us in peace when all is said and done, and so we must make a choice.

kivu.9.d:0 "A most peculiar offer has come in from Leopoldville, or what is now being called Kinshasa or even New Jerusalem by its new occupants. These ‘Ngunzists’ have sent a diplomatic offer from their Ngunza, or prophet, Simon Kimbangu. Once held in prison by colonial officials within our own borders in Elisabethville, Kimbangu has since escaped and used his tremendous influence and mass of followers to topple the Force Publique’s control over the old colonial capital. Now, this Holy Man who thinks he is the Holy Spirit incarnate seeks to reach a new arrangement between our two parties so that both can continue existence in the newly forming Congo without resorting to bloodshed. Offering to allow the UMHK full access to the Congo’s new economy in exchange for implementing new worker’s protections and other pro-worker legislations, Kimbangu seeks to peacefully conjoin our two states so that he may focus on the larger issues at hand to the North. We could easily accept his proposal, for we would still make a fortune and then some in this new Congo he is creating, but we could also try our luck and gamble for it all by denying this madman.

Katanga and the UMHK sit atop the most resource rich and industrialized area of our colony, save the capital itself, and without them or their infrastructure, our fledgling economy will surely crumble.

The MNC, or Mouvement Nationale Congolais, is currently the largest unified party within the Kivu Clique and the wider Congo for that matter, with its support base including much of the non-Évolué population. Though many prominent politicians have been able to carve out a strong political base beneath the shadow of the MNC, like Kasa-Vubu or Bolikango, the MNC and its leader Isaac Kalonji loom over Congolese politics like a specter. Preaching nationalist and socialist rhetoric from across the spectrum, the MNC is a mixed bag, but all expect this monopoly of political power to win near any election for the foreseeable future. \n\nHowever, the Young General Gonzague, in his stipulations for stepping down and allowing elections to be organized, demanded that the Socialist elements of the MNC be banned and not allowed to run in the first elections for the Congo. Now, we are left with a dilemma; a daunting choice of choosing electoral fairness and true democracy to ring true, or to let the military get its way to ensure the security of the state. Many in the MNC are known radicals, and many fear that if they are not allowed to run in the coming elections at all, the Congo could be heading down the path of civil war once again. However, if the MNC is allowed to operate, the Congo may be subjecting itself to Socialist rule before even the first vote is cast. What shall be our final decision?"

Though the honorable Jean Bolikango tried to work towards a peaceful solution with his old friends that headed the MNC like Isaac Kalonji and Cyrille Adoula, the damage was already done, and so the Simbas under Kalonji have taken up arms against the government. \n\nNow, with the fate of Africa’s Darkest Heart now at stake, superstitious revolutionaries shall combat the professionally trained ANC, or Armée Nationale Congolaise, in a duel of fates with the very future of Africa’s largest former colony and the lives of millions of people hang in the balance."

However, the MNC is a massive big-tent coalition, and already the cracks have begun to show. With the eve of the first Worker’s Congress of the Congo nearing, the MNC has completely shattered into 4 main parties vying for the Prime Minister chair and to fill the seats with the new legislative body.

Though he claims to be doing this entirely for his people and for the good of all Katangans, many feel as though this is just the latest attempt from the infamous Tshombe to earn another quick buck and carve out his own economic fiefdom in the wake of the post-colonial chaos.

Under his watch, our forces in the ANC beat back the vile colonials and mercenaries that beset us as we struggled for our sovereignty. With the victories achieved under his command, the very nation we now call home was birthed. \n\nHowever, the Young General’s regime now stands at a crossroads, for he has consolidated all he can without choosing a distinct path for the nation to take. Before Bobozo lies two distinct paths, influenced by his interests, experiences, and beliefs formulated over his brief but fiery military career. The most obvious path would be for the Young General to fully embrace his martial talents and deep ties within the ANC by transitioning the Congo into an Askari-led stratocratic meritocracy. In this Congolese State, the military and its leaders would be paramount within the nation as the Congo is further consumed by the might of the ANC and the Young General’s ambitions. \n\nAlternatively, Bobozo could take a different path entirely, pulling on his Pan-Afrikan and Nationalist sympathies he has begun to pick up, especially influenced by the likes of Marcus Garvey, George Padmore, François Duvalier, Stanley Mathenge, Nnamdi Azikiwe, and many other titans of the Pan-Afrikan movement. Drawing on the Congo’s storied and diverse past and rich, uniquely-African cultures, Bobozo hopes to forge a new and united Congolese identity while deeply instilling a newfound sense of African nationalism within every Congolese citizen - all of whom are loyal to him and their newly transformed and de-colonialized Congo. This radical leap has shown to be popular with many of the other young officers and veterans within the ANC, as well as many other politicians within the shackled Congolese parliament from a wide variety of political stances and backgrounds. Regardless of the Young Generals decision, the Congo will never be the same again, and the era of colonial influences is assuredly dead."

A region long choked by seperatist tensions, whether they be from Mwami agitators, CONAKAT politicians, or the goons of the UMHK, Katanga and its people now exist at the mercy of their new ‘President.’ Already has Tshombe pushed to consolidate his hold over the region, but as to how far he should go is now up for debate. \n\nThe young President must now decide how best to establish his ruling government, with two main options at his disposal. Tshombe could buckle to the whispers of his long-time partner and ally Godefroid Munongo and organize Katanga along more blatantly autocratic lines. Under this plan, Tshombe and Munongo shall push to fully consolidate power over every aspect of Katanga into the hands of Tshombe, who along with his staunch allies in the UMHK and in ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare, shall create a totalitarian state perfectly poised to generate nothing but profit for the parties involved. However, such a plan has two glaring flaws, in that doing so would only increase Munongo’s power, who circles Tshombe’s position like an envious vulture, while also increasing tensions between the ethnic groups and political factions within this wild frontier. \n\nTo alleviate these concerns, Tshombe and some of his less radical allies within Hoare’s mercenary group, the Mwami’s camp, and within the UMHK have all pooled resources and ideas to draft a plan for a parliamentary facade to protect this new Katanga state from unrest and criticism. By maintaining a token puppet legislature that tacitly listens to the wider concerns of the masses of Katanga could buy our new regime some much needed legitimacy while also holding the wolves like Munongo at bay. Regardless of Tshombe’s final decision, he shall still be the de-facto ruler over all of Katanga, and now only formalities and policy decisions keep him from raking in the mountains of profit and prestige his new venture shall finally give him and his allies."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_LOUIS_BOBOZO_DESC:0 "The last thing young Bobozo imagined in his career as a German Askari is to be leading one of the biggest states in the now-free Africa. Born in the later years of the Belgian Congo and then Mittelafrika - he was enthralled by the discipline and exploits of the Askari. He signed up in 1933 and quickly rose through the ranks through his great leadership skills after squashing several revolts and guerrilla groups on behalf of his Hunnic masters. However his true loyalty was always with his people. When the Governor of the Congo ordered his division to pacify Kivu and his home state of the northwest with senselessly brutality, he decided to stand up for his people by organizing a mutiny. Despite his really young age, he rallied most of the Congo's African-majority armies under his banner and overthrew their German masters. Now young Bobozo stands at a crossroads - his fledgling clique is surrounded on all sides by enemies, and his government is rife with incompetence due to his lack of political experience from his young age. Will the Kivu Clique lead the Congo to it's deserved glory, or will it fall to the other warlords and tribes vying for the same level of power?"
POLITICS_JEAN_BOLIKANGO_DESC:0 "One of the only established and prominent figures within the Congolese national scene before the Congo Crisis kicked off, Jean Bolikango has been both affectionately and antagonistically nicknamed ‘The Elder Statesman’ by his peers, for although he was only born in 1909, he is still one of the oldest figures in the Congolese nationalist and republican movements. A member of the Bangala people of the Équateur province and born into an Évolué family, Bolikango understood his privilege over his fellow Congolese early. Instead of living lavishly and flaunting his status, Bolikango instead devoted himself to Catholic ethics and pursued education from a young age, seeking to better himself and his fellow man. After graduating early due to his advanced aptitude, he became a teacher, teaching many of his fellow independence figures such as Cyrille Adoula and Joseph Iléo. \n\nIt was during this teaching career that Bolikango began to develop his own brand of Chrisitan republicanism as he and his people languished in the shadow of colonialism. It was also in this career that the Congo Crisis erupted, sundering the nation and plunging it into chaos. Showcasing himself during the conflict as an apt leader and commander, Bolikango had risen to become the single most respected man in the Congo save for maybe the Young General Gonzague Bobozo himself. \n\nNow, with Bobozo no longer in power and with the declaration of the first Congolese republic, Jean Bolikango has found himself as Prime Minister. With the Elder Statesman at the helm, the Congo shall strive for piety, equality, and good ethics as Bolikango steers us into our bright new future."
POLITICS_MOISE_TSHOMBE_DESC:0 "Moïse Kapend Tshombe has chased fame and fortune all his young life, both to enrich his own Lunda people of Katanga as well as, and perhaps more urgently, himself. Born in 1919, Tshombe skipped out on higher education and pursued an entrepreneurial lifestyle from the beginning. Running street hustles and small pop-up shops as a child in an emulation of his father, a successful salesman and business executive, Tshombe pursued money and power all over his home city of Musumba. Taken under his fathers wing who has risen to become a prominent figure in Katanga as a friend to the Mwami and an enemy to the colonial regime, Tshombe’s father was killed shortly after the Congo Crisis began, leaving the young but ambitious boy with his father’s legacy and prestige. \n\nFilling in these footsteps, Tshombe rose to prominence as a rebel commander and financier of the ANC during the conflict. Through sharp wit, sound tactics, and lots and lots of money, Tshombe clawed himself to the upper hierarchy of the independence scene, cementing his position as one of the founding fathers of our new republic. Despite his notorious greed and ambition, Tshombe cares deeply for his people, though many argue he only cares for his own Lunda people and the wider people of Katanga. Despite his detractors, Tshombe has risen to become the Prime Minister of our ner republic. Though he holds dubious ties with the colonials through his inherited businesses, Tshombe is expected to still run the Congo for the people, and with his business acumen being what they are, many expect the Congo to be more profitable than ever."
POLITICS_KASU_VUBU_DESC:0 "Born around 1915 in the Mayombe district to the Yombe people, Joseph Kasa-Vubu takes as much pride in being Prime Minister as he does in being a member of the proud Kongo people. His legacy started as the son of a successful farmer and merchant who was run out of Cabinda for unlawful land settlement, the then Vubu family’s patriarch, Joseph’s father, earned back the trust of his people by taking the ‘poison test.’ By drinking the toxic sap of the kasa tree, his father redeemed his familial line and earned the Vubu family the additive title of the same name as the tree that earned their redemption. Despite his father surviving the ordeal and winning the family's honor back, Joseph took this brush with dishonor to heart, and endeavored to be a true man to his people like none other. \n\nUpon becoming a man, Kasa-Vubu was baptised and took his Christian name Joseph before enrolling in higher education at a seminary, where he both showcased his intelligence and ferocity, as well as his desire for Congo to become independent as he began to interact with the colonials more regularly. Finding interest and solidarity with his ancestors’ past as noble subjects within the Kongo Kingdom, the young Kasa-Vubu began to cultivate this interest amongst his fellow students at the seminary, rising to prominence both among his fellow Kongo as well as the locals of Bas-Congo and Leopoldville. With this prominence, and sensing the imminent demise of the Vrijstaat before the Collapse, Kasa-Vubu cultivated a following in his home region, and when the Vrijstaat finally died, he fled to Kivu to aid the Young General in the fight for independence. \n\nNow with Bobozo out of power and the first Congolese republic proclaimed, Kasa-Vubu has found himself as Prime Minister of the Congo. Under his rule, the Congo shall be modernized and true federalism shall be established, though he shall always have a soft spot for his own people in Bas-Congo."
POLITICS_KALONJI_DESC:0 "Abandoned by his Muluba and Lulua parents shortly after his birth in 1914, Isaac Kalonji was adopted by American Baptist missionaries as a child, and raised by these preachers until they returned to the United States when he was 9. This pious upbringing in which he was saved by children of God instilled a deep religious fervour into the young Kalonji. Entering higher education as soon as he was of age, Kalonji quickly graduated early after serving top marks and became a teacher upon graduation. Picking up radical literature while in school and during his teaching career, Kalonji began to drift to the Left without losing his faith in God or his belief that every child of God has a voice, slowly creating the syncretic ideology he champions today. With the outbreak of the Congo Crisis, Kalonji found himself as one the prominent figures of his local region around Lusambo due to his charismatic preaching and his reputation as one of the most respected teachers in the region. Serving admiral in the conflict and rising to become one of the faces of the resistance as well as one of its best military commanders, Kalonji solidified himself within the hierarchy of founding fathers of our new republic, and as the glue that holds together the mighty MNC. \n\nNow, with the Young General no longer in control and with the first republic declared, Isaac Kalonji has found himself as Prime Minister of the Congo. Seeking to implement his unique fusion of directly democratic principles with Market Socialist and Distributist economics while maintaining the grand coalition that is the MNC, Kalonji shall bring the Congo together under the light of God and under his guidance."
POLITICS_KALONJI_SIMBA_DESC:0 "Abandoned by his Muluba and Lulua parents shortly after his birth in 1914, Isaac Kalonji was adopted by American Baptist missionaries as a child, and raised by these preachers until they returned to the United States when he was 9. This pious upbringing in which he was saved by children of God instilled a deep religious fervour into the young Kalonji. Entering higher education as soon as he was of age, Kalonji quickly graduated early after serving top marks and became a teacher upon graduation.

With the outbreak of the Congo Crisis, Kalonji found himself as one the prominent figures of his local region around Lusambo due to his charismatic preaching and his reputation as one of the most respected teachers in the region. Serving admiral in the conflict and rising to become one of the faces of the resistance as well as one of its best military commanders, Kalonji solidified himself within the hierarchy of founding fathers of our new republic. \n\nNow, in the wake of Gonzague’s treachery and the foolishness of our fellow democratic parties, the Simba revolt has both burned true Congolese democracy to ash and has turned Kalonji bitter and steeled as his beloved coalition within the MNC burned before him. Calling for a true democracy, free of reactionary taint and fully bathed in the light of God, Prime Minister Kalonji shall ensure that Congolese democracy never falls victim to traitors and autocrats ever again."
POLITICS_BOBOZO_SESE_SEKO_DESC:0 "With Nzere proclaimed and his new name adorned, Bobozo Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, or ‘Bobozo the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake’, is the sole and undisputed leader of the Congo. Both the national father of an independent Congo and its savior in countless conflicts, Bobozo Sese Seko has led the Congo to greatness, touting piety, Afro-nationalism, populism, and cooperation without bias among our brothers and sisters of this vast continent. On his unrelenting crusade to rid the Congo of colonial influence while truly taking care of the one, united Congolese people, he has shed his past Christian-given name and with it has shed colonial influence from both himself and this paradise. A champion of Pan-Africanism and drawing from numerous influences, Bobozo Sese Seko is an ideological chameleon, bending his ideas to fit the needs of his people above all other pursuits. Despite his lavish tastes and violent means to combat the colonial remnants, all true Congolese know that only under his watch can Nzere be both safe and the beacon of Africa’s new destiny."
POLITICS_ILLEO_DESC:0 "The youngest of the Simba Revolt’s chief leaders and of our new republic’s founding fathers, Joseph Iléo was born in 1921 in Leopoldville, now Kinshasa, but was orphaned at a young age after his parents were killed in a Force Publique raid. Being picked up by a local rebellious paramount chief and used as a Kadogo - the Swahili term for child soldiers meaning ‘little one’ - Iléo would have been destined for a likely quick death on some God-forsaken battlefield, but it seems as though destiny had other plans. With his commanding officer and slave-driver being killed in a firefight with the Force Publique, Iléo took the opportunity to run, and found himself back in Leopoldville where he became a beggar before being found and taken in by Isaac Kalonji. Under the father of the MNC’s wing, Iléo was introduced to Kalonji’s unique syncretic ideology that mixes Market Socialist and Christian Democratic Socialist ideas. Taking it as his own, breaking from his old mentor, and morphing it by emphasizing nationalism, Kimbanguism, and anti-tribalism while taking a far more vehement anti-colonial stance in reaction to the disdain he garnered against colonials and tribals due to his time as a Kadogo, Iléo’s new Chritian Social Nationalist ideology was formed and it spoke to the masses. Winning the first elections of our People’s Republic, Prime Minister Iléo shall now lead the Congo towards its pious, Africanized, and syncretic new dawn."
POLITICS_ADOULA_DESC:0 "Despite his young age Cyrille Adoula has proven himself as a true hero to the Congolese people. Born in 1921 just days before his contemporary and rival Joseph Iléo, Adoula may just be one of the youngest national leaders in the world. A member of a prestigious Bangala Évolué family from Leopoldville, Adoula attended Catholic primary school but never closely adhered to the faith. Instead, he got into Socialism, and more specifically the Orthodox Syndialism of France, due to his father’s affiliations with the infantile MNC that formed underground within the Vrijstaat as well as his ties with the Belgian Syndicalist Party based in Brussels. Taking these foreign ideas to heart, Adoula truly believes that Syndicalism is the one and only way to bring true equality and property to every soul in the Congo. As the Simba Revolt dawned, both he and his father took up arms in defence of Congolese Socialism, but tragically his father was slain. Carrying on his legacy and earning a name for himself as a brilliant, albeit young, commander, Adoula rose to become one of our founding fathers. Seeking complete separation of Church and State, viewing the Churches as nothing but a tool of the colonial powers, Adoula is one of the few non-religious leaders in the Congo, and this along with his extremely close ties to the Internationale have caused many to view him as an outsider and a foreign puppet. Despite this reputation, Adoula has been elected as the Prime Minister of our People’s Republic. Planning to slowly bring Syndicalism to the Congo at a very gradual rate while fully preserving our African traditions so as to not disrupt our society too much, sending us back into war and chaos, Prime Minister Adoula shall be the beacon of red light that will guide us to utopia."
POLITICS_KASONGO_DESC:0 "Refusing to bend to foreign powers as he helped lead the Simba Revolt to victory, Joseph-Georges Kasongo has triumphed over all, being elected as the new Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of the Congo. Sidestepping his many rivals that betrayed the Congo by bending to the Internationale, Kasongo has sought to carry on the true essence of the MNC - combining both Socialist and Nationalist ideas into one coherent ideology that truly puts the interests of the Congolese above all while still supporting our fellow Africans. Born in 1919, Kasongo quickly took to schooling, and entered law school just a few years before the Congo Crisis began. Picking up on radical literature while in school, Kasongo began to read the ideas of Browder, Mosely, Mussolini, Bucard, Sorel, Deat, and Thorez, who he has come to idolize, incorporating some of their less severe ideas into practice here in the Congo while fusing them with his own Pan-African ideology that pulls from ideas of Nkrumah, Azikiwe, Obama, and Mathenge. When the Collapse finally came, Kasongo took up arms immediately as a volunteer, and once again took up arms during the Simba revolt as one of its chief idealogues and leaders. With their victory, our People’s Republic was founded and the Congolese people finally freed. Fiercely and violently anti-colonial without the attached racial theory that our oppressors once used against us, Kasongo has come to view nearly all Western influence with disdain, aside from the ideas of his favorite Totalist thinkers. This vast pool of influences have torn Kasongo in all directions, but in the end he seeks to only better the lives of all true Congolese and all true Africans. Under his watch, the Congo shall be freed from the vestiges of colonialism, given true Totalist democracy, be wrapped in comforting bureaucracy, and fully brought into its uniquely Africanized and Totalized future."
POLITICS_MOBUTU_SESE_SEKO_DESC:0 "Starting his life as Joseph-Désiré Mobutu and born in 1930, Mobutu Sese Seko was swept into service as one of the thousands of Kadogos, or ‘little ones’, in the Congo Crisis. During this time as a child soldier serving under a local paramount chief turned rebel warlord, the young Mobutu became a honed soldier before falling in battle and being left for dead. Rescued by our national father Bobozo Sese Seko, the young Mobutu was adopted by our Marshal and raised as his son. In the years since, Mobutu has grown into a capable, if ruthless, leader that is wholly dedicated to the ideas of ‘Authenticité.’ Though rumors circulate that he had his adoptive father killed, Mobutu is respected, and feared, by all in Nzere and now serves as Bobozo’s successor, taking on his honorific name. Under his watch, Nzere shall endure."

KIV_private_investment:0 "Privatization of Colonial-Era Companies"
KIV_private_investment_desc:0 "The Tshombe regime has decided to privatize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, bursting open the floodgates for thousands of our people to jump at the chance to own their own business and companies.

KIV_national_investment:0 "Nationalization of Colonial-Era Companies"
KIV_national_investment_desc:0 "The Tshombe regime has decided to nationalize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, massively inflating the resources at the government’s disposal and the responsibilities they must now be accountable for.

Any party willing to get anything done in this nation has to go through them, but Tshombe has long held friendly ties and business relations with this industrial conglomerate. By allowing the Union Minière free reign within our economy, the Congo as a whole and Tshombe himself will be rewarded handsomely as the economy is revolutionized, westernized, and modernized on a national scale. However, much of the profits will still be going into the pockets of these former imperialists."

KIV_uplifting_the_congolese_worker:0 "Uplifting the Worker"
KIV_uplifting_the_congolese_worker_desc:0 "The Congo is rather unique as far as colonial holdings in Africa go, for it has seen industrialization on a scale not witnessed elsewhere on this continent save for a few other regions such as within South Africa or Kenya-Uganda. This industrialization has allowed a true industrial working class to develop here - each soul of which is subjected to the same rigors and predators of the industrial world as in Europe or the Americas. We must not repeat the errors of our former masters, and move to uplift the downtrodden labourers of our nation. They are the backbone of our new modern economy and the ticket to a glorious and prosperous future, and they must be treated as such."

KIV_no_regionalism:0 "Unitary Congo"
KIV_no_regionalism_desc:0 "Factionalism, regional divisions, tribalism, and other petty social hierarchies and organizational failures have long wracked the Congo, tearing this massive paradise apart from the inside as these sickening ideas infected the minds of our varied peoples and drove them apart as the colonials moved in to pick up the pieces.

KIV_simba_government_idea_desc:0 "Our righteous revolution has just begun, and already our forces are on the backfoot. The governmental forces of Kivu and the ANC have quickly mobilized against our ragtag group of rebels, and now our issues are as glaring as ever. We suffer from a lack of manpower and weaponry, and currently only our large base of popular support is keeping us in the fight. We must muster the strength and arms needed to beat back this foe and truly free the Congo and its peoples!"

KIV_simba_government_idea2_desc:0 "After cutting our teeth against our enemy in harsh jungle warfare, taking on numerous casualties due to our troops’ inexperience and outdated equipment, we have somehow begun to claw ourselves out of the dangerous corner our revolution started in. Though we are far from even the glimmer of victory, we have begun to taste it. If we continue to sow discord through their ranks and keep up our violent guerilla campaign, there just may be a path to victory."
KIV_simba_government_idea3:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_government_idea3_desc:0 "As our young soldiers slowly turn into veterans as they diligently fight their way through the Congo, our forces have begun to make major ground. No longer confined to only the jungles, our forces have created a unified frontline against the ANC. Now, with numerous urban centers and military depots under our control, victory in this war has begun to be expected by many of our more optimistic Simbas. Though victory is still not a certainty, our revolution now stands a real shot at overthrowing the Kinshasa regime."
KIV_simba_government_idea4:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_government_idea4_desc:0 "Against all odds and expectations, the forces of the Simba revolt have begun to occupy nearly every major city in the Congo, as well as maintaining their control over massive swathes of scattered Congolese wilderness. Using guerilla tactics and asymmetrical warfare to devastating effect, the ANC has been largely routed and the days are numbered for Kivu’s failing regime. Unless the reactionaries can pull off a miracle, it is only a matter of time before the Congo is swept under the Red tide."

KIV_simba_revolt_idea_desc:0 "Chaos and turmoil have spread across the Congo on the back of the vile Simbas. These foul revolutionaries have beaten us back at every turn, waging their brutal guerilla war against the ANC to great effect. Now, their forces control most major cities in the Congo, and the writing on the wall for our regime couldn’t be clearer. Our backs are to the walls and unless something changes soon, the Congo will be lost to these Reds."

KIV_simba_revolt_idea3_desc:0 "After a harsh war against the Simbas and their cowardly guerilla tactics, the effects of these hit-and-run tactics have begun to show their effects. The Simba’s forces are haggard and undersupplied, with desertion being common, forcing the rebels to rely increasingly on mercenaries. Loyalty within their ranks is at an all time low, and if they don’t start seeing successes in battle soon, the Simbas could stand on the brink of collapse."

Even now, the loyal and well-trained soldiers of the ANC are mobilizing en masse, making their way to the largest hotspots of this uprising. We must strike now and crush these Simbas before they gain any traction, while we have the upper hand. If we push hard, victory is all but assured."

However, the various parties not currently a part of the MNC’s broad tent have proven themselves to be nothing more than traitors and colonial sympathizers. We shall do to them what they tried to do to us, and ban them all from political activity. Our democracy shall be pure, fair, and free, guided strictly by Socialist principles, and only those who proved themselves loyal in the fires of the Simba Revolt shall be allowed to participate in our democratic dream."

We must cut away the dangerous ills of nationalist thought and embrace the idea of Civic Nationalism, or nationalism for the state and for liberal values over ethnic or racial heritage. Under this new breed of nationalist thought, we shall unify the people of the Congo and commit them to the ideas of our new Syndicalist republic while stamping out any dangerous ideas that try to sprout up and corrupt our people and our identity."

Though many prominent politicians have been able to carve out a strong political base beneath the shadow of the MNC, like Kasa-Vubu or Bolikango, the MNC and its leader Isaac Kalonji loom over Congolese politics like a specter. Preaching nationalist and socialist rhetoric from across the spectrum, the MNC is a mixed bag, but all expect this monopoly of political power to win near any election for the foreseeable future. \n\nHowever, the Young General Bobozo, in his stipulations for stepping down and allowing elections to be organized, demanded that the Socialist elements of the MNC be banned and not allowed to run in the first elections for the Congo. Now, we are left with a dilemma; a daunting choice of choosing electoral fairness and true democracy to ring true, or to let the military get its way to ensure the security of the state. Many in the MNC are known radicals, and many fear that if they are not allowed to run in the coming elections at all, the Congo could be heading down the path of civil war once again.

Though the honorable Jean Bolikango tried to work towards a peaceful solution with his old friends that headed the MNC like Isaac Kalonji and Cyrille Adoula, the damage was already done, and so the Simbas under Kalonji have taken up arms against the government. \n\nNow, with the fate of Africa’s Darkest Heart now at stake, superstitious revolutionaries shall combat the professionally trained ANC, or Armée Nationale Congolaise, in a duel of fates with the very future of Africa’s largest former colony and the lives of millions of people hang in the balance."

Under his watch, our forces in the ANC beat back the vile colonials and mercenaries that beset us as we struggled for our sovereignty. With the victories achieved under his command, the very nation we now call home was birthed. \n\nHowever, the Young General’s regime now stands at a crossroads, for he has consolidated all he can without choosing a distinct path for the nation to take. Before Bobozo lies two distinct paths, influenced by his interests, experiences, and beliefs formulated over his brief but fiery military career. The most obvious path would be for the Young General to fully embrace his martial talents and deep ties within the ANC by transitioning the Congo into an Askari-led stratocratic meritocracy. In this Congolese State, the military and its leaders would be paramount within the nation as the Congo is further consumed by the might of the ANC and the Young General’s ambitions. \n\nAlternatively, Bobozo could take a different path entirely, pulling on his Pan-Afrikan and Nationalist sympathies he has begun to pick up, especially influenced by the likes of Marcus Garvey, George Padmore, François Duvalier, Stanley Mathenge, Nnamdi Azikiwe, and many other titans of the Pan-Afrikan movement. Drawing on the Congo’s storied and diverse past and rich, uniquely-African cultures, Bobozo hopes to forge a new and united Congolese identity while deeply instilling a newfound sense of African nationalism within every Congolese citizen - all of whom are loyal to him and their newly transformed and de-colonialized Congo. This radical leap has shown to be popular with many of the other young officers and veterans within the ANC, as well as many other politicians within the shackled Congolese parliament from a wide variety of political stances and backgrounds. Regardless of the Young Generals decision, the Congo will never be the same again, and the era of colonial influences is assuredly dead."

kivu.19.d:0 "With the upset elections in Kivu serving as the perfect excuse to lash out at his long-treasured prize, Moïse Tshombe has seized on the atmosphere of chaos and unrest, and now leads a newly sovereign breakaway state in the Congo’s southernmost province of Katanga. A region long choked by seperatist tensions, whether they be from Mwami agitators, CONAKAT politicians, or the goons of the UMHK, Katanga and its people now exist at the mercy of their new ‘President.’ Already has Tshombe pushed to consolidate his hold over the region, but as to how far he should go is now up for debate. \n\nThe young President must now decide how best to establish his ruling government, with two main options at his disposal. Tshombe could buckle to the whispers of his long-time partner and ally Godefroid Munongo and organize Katanga along more blatantly autocratic lines. Under this plan, Tshombe and Munongo shall push to fully consolidate power over every aspect of Katanga into the hands of Tshombe, who along with his staunch allies in the UMHK and in ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare, shall create a totalitarian state perfectly poised to generate nothing but profit for the parties involved. However, such a plan has two glaring flaws, in that doing so would only increase Munongo’s power, who circles Tshombe’s position like an envious vulture, while also increasing tensions between the ethnic groups and political factions within this wild frontier. \n\nTo alleviate these concerns, Tshombe and some of his less radical allies within Hoare’s mercenary group, the Mwami’s camp, and within the UMHK have all pooled resources and ideas to draft a plan for a parliamentary facade to protect this new Katanga state from unrest and criticism. By maintaining a token puppet legislature that tacitly listens to the wider concerns of the masses of Katanga could buy our new regime some much needed legitimacy while also holding the wolves like Munongo at bay. Regardless of Tshombe’s final decision, he shall still be the de-facto ruler over all of Katanga, and now only formalities and policy decisions keep him from raking in the mountains of profit and prestige his new venture shall finally give him and his allies."

With each win, our independence is slowly being assured, largely thanks to the infantile yet effective ANC and its charismatic leader, Louis de Gonzague Bobozo. \n\nYoung for someone in command of so much responsibility and with an entire nation’s destiny on his shoulders, the Young General - as he has become known to both his enemies who seek to mock his age and his allies who seek to emphasize how a man of his age commands with such success - is all that stands between us and destruction. Without him and the ANC, Kivu would surely collapse and fold back under colonial rule, dashing any hope at independence and freedom that we have.

I stand before you now, not as your commanding officer and not as the national father of our nearly-born nation, but as a fellow child of the Congo on this eve of our final victory. Just miles away lies the last main pockets of resistance, populated by vile colonials who have spat on our customs, who have raped and murdered our families, who have set aflame our very cultures and identities in a cruel attempt to wipe out what truly makes our paradise unique and glorious. We must steel ourselves and wipe out the last of these parasites, for though the war shall soon be over, the fight for a perfect and free Congo shall not end.

Together, as one people, we must bring peace and stability to our war-ravaged homes so that we may end this war and begin the hard labour of reconstruction and national creation, but together, as a new and united Congolese people, I know that we can do it...' \n\nThe Young General would continue for quite awhile longer, stirring up a frenzy among his men as they prepared for the final battle ahead.

Instead, a stratocratic regime where martial law reigns permanently and where the primacy of the Askaris is well established is the best way to serve the people of the Congo, the entire political apparatus of the country and its wealth being controlled by the ANC.

Beneath him, his loyal officers, veterans, and other military staff shall help him transform the Congo into a stable, regimented, and prosperous new state capable of defending itself from any threat, foreign or domestic, as the ANC and the government become one in the same. As such, the ANC shall be the main priority of the nation as well, for without it our Congo would collapse. Everything shall go to the ANC, and in return, the ANC shall give the Congo everything it needs to flourish. Corruption shall be stamped out at any turn and all citizens shall be taken care of by our army, for it is the ANC’s duty now to not only protect them from enemy combatants, but also from the regular tribulations of life.

Knowing this too well, the Young General Gonzague Bobozo has gone to great lengths to tie this new Congolese identity directly to the military, holding up the ANC as the champion of Congolese nationalism. Stripping away much of the dangerous ideas fueled by the many radical nationalists and socialists that still haunt the Congo’s darkest recesses, the Young General has gone to great lengths to defang and shackle this nationalist fervour for his own use and for the use of the state. Transforming what it means to be a Congolese nationalist, Gonzague Bobozo has slowly spread the idea that only through direct and total loyalty to the ANC and to the state can one be truly Congolese. Of course, this has been met with some pushback from the various radical cells across the Congo, these small guerilla groups shall be easily erased by the ever-growing might of the ANC, and soon loyalty to the military and patriotism shall become one in the same."

kivu.25.d:0 "Seeking to remove all colonial, regional, and tribalist influences that have long hampered the creation of a unique and unified Congolese identity, Louis de Gonzague Bobozo has called for a ‘Retour à l’Authenticité’ to cleanse the Congo of its past sins. This ‘Authenticité’ drive is poised at creating a new nationalist, pan-Congolese identity to support the nation and serve as a bulwark against outside forces. \n\nTo this end, Gonzague Bobozo has begun to radically alter Congolese society to fit this new Africanized direction. Western-style suits and clothing are to be abandoned in favour of what he calls the ‘abacost’ - a simple, lightweight suit worn without a tie influenced by the wear of certain L-KMT officials the Young General has drawn influences from such as the infamous Dai Li, and taking its name from the French phrase ‘à bas le costume’, meaning down with the suit. So committed to this idea, Bobozo has even called for mass suit-burning gatherings to be held around the nation, burning Western-style clothing and other European-influenced paraphernalia. City and place names across the Congo are to be ‘de-colonialized’, instead renamed to more suiting African names, such as Stanley Falls becoming Boyoma Falls, Leopoldville into Kinshasa, Katanga into Shaba, and so many more. The colonial churches have been banned from practice and Christian-derived names have been banned in favour of authentic ‘Nzereian’ names. Simple titles like Mister and Misses have been dropped, with all Congolese now forced to call each other ‘citoyen’ to do away with the colonial-imposed social hierarchy. Visiting dignitaries and send-off salutes using the 21-guns have been replaced by Congolese choirs and drumlines that herald the arrival of any new ally or the departure of any true hero of the Congo. The ‘Three Ns’ have become the new motto of this movement - each standing for Nzere, as in Nzere the nation, Nzere our river, and Nzere our new national currency coined by the state to do away with colonial currencies and barter systems. \n\nThe Young General has defended these radical actions as a painful necessity to rid ourselves of the past divisions that split our people apart, citing that ‘in our African tradition there are never two chiefs. That is why we Congolese, in the desire to conform to the traditions of our continent, have resolved to group all the energies of the citizens of our country under the banner of a single national movement.’ Though this ‘Return to Authenticity’ has been met with mixed receptions and mixed results, nothing can stop it now, for Nzere has risen under the Young General, and there's no going back, for the Congo must be free of all non-Congolese taint."

However, the corruption of African culture is much more deeply rooted in the heart of Africa, not only in the colonies, but also in the so-called free countries that continue to live in the European way, rejecting their African heritage. Not in Nzere, formerly named Congo by the colonizers, thanks to the valiant efforts of Bobozo Sese Seko and his program of Retour à l’Authenticité all traces of European influence will be erased forever with numerous measures such as the Africanization of names, whether of people or cities, the banning of the wearing of the suit and tie replaced by the abacost and a purely African economy fed by great programs of nationalization and the numerous wealth of the country, although some whisper that Bobozo took advantage of it to enrich his already colossal personal fortune. Nzere is now a shining example of the expression of African culture without harmful interference, General Bobozo as a hopeful pan-African dreams that one day all of Africa will be truly free with him to lead it."

Forcing his cabinet and all those close to him to do the same, our national father shall soon be adorned with his new Nzereian name, showing the nation and the wider world that the old colonial order is fully and finally dead. With the names of cities, towns, neighborhoods, natural formations, and anything else being renamed, it was now time for the Young General to take his new name as well, for if he did not commit to his new policies, no one would. Taking a name from Ngbandi legend, Louis de Gonzague Bobozo is no more, for our leader sheds this Christian-influenced name for something far more authentic and pure. Translating as ‘Bobozo the all-powerful warrior, who because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake’, the name Louis has been shed for his new name - Bobozo Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga! With the ceremony continuing after his new name had been declared, each member of Bobozo’s cabinet were persuaded to take new names as well, each shedding their colonial names in favor for something far more Congolese. With the ceremony finishing, the newly christened Sese Seko announced to the nation over radio broadcasts that all within the Congo must soon do the same, for the influence of colonialism must be eradicated for the good of all Congolese."

Instead, only the Catholic Church in Congo, the Orthodox Church of the Congo, the Church of Christ in Congo, and - Sese Seko’s personal favorite - the Kimbanguist Church shall be allowed to operate. Native Congolese religions and spiritual forms have been allowed to stay in practice, but Sese Seko’s regime has pushed heavily for the practitioners of these faiths to join the Kimbanguist Church instead, for its syncretic mix of African religions and Christian doctrine has enamored the Young General, who has grown to be a close friend of Papa Kimbangu himself as well as his three sons. All other churches within the Congo are to be suppressed, slowly strangled and choked out until only the four accepted faiths remain. Under Bobozo’s watch, not even faith in God shall rise above his influence and power, for the Lord is not in command of the Congo - Bobozo Sese Seko is."

kivu.28.d:0 "Pan-Afrikanism comes in many forms, but two main strains of it exist currently that dominate all others. The first form, championed by the likes of Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore, and others calls for complete political unity between African states as quickly as possible, creating a cohesive Pan-Afrikan identity. In direct opposition to this is the type of Pan-Africanism preached by Nnmadi Azikiwe, Marcus Garvey, and other prominent nationalists. These thinkers instead call for a looser union, primarily economic in form that would still allow individual African national identities to exist and flourish, with political unity being a far off goal that likely may never come. It is this second camp that Bobozo Sese Seko finds himself more in-tune with, and to this end, has created the Organisation de l'Unité Africaine. This new Organization of African Unity seeks to function as a Pan-Afrikan military and economic alliance, forming a unified front against any outside influences or aggressors. Inviting nearly every post-colonial state in Africa, Bobozo Sese Seko hopes to not only be the national father of the Congo, but the supra-national father of Africa as a whole, serving as its new champion against colonial and Western influences. \n\nTo formalize this new organization, Bobozo has invited his favorite ideological thinkers and African leaders, including Azikiwe, Duvalier, Mathenge, Kimathi, Nkrumah, Sun Ra, Padmore, and so many more to Kinshasa to hammer out a new arrangement that would benefit all children of Africa without wiping away what makes each of us and our peoples unique."

Loyal squads of the ANC patrol the Congo endlessly, looking through its great cities and pristine jungles in search for pockets of colonial remnants or holdouts from the democratic clique that once tried to seize power from our national father. Among the already captured and executed have been the likes of Moïse Tshombe, Daniel Kanza, and Isaac Kalonji - all traitors or colonial sycophants in their own right - as well as famed colonial villains such as Émille Janssens and Pierre Ryckmans. Others have been far more lucky, or shown mercy if they were not specific perpetrators of colonial oppression, with these souls being allowed to leave our nation in peace, forever exiled from our primordial paradise.

However, despite his many influences, Bobozo seems himself as above ideology as an idea, reviling the notion that any one man can follow any one ideology or doctrine to the exact letter. Instead, Bobozo has taken influences and policy ideas from each and every one of his idols, from Nkrumah and Azikiwe to Chiang Kai-Shek and Georges Sorel. With this great fluidity has come great prosperity to our nation, as pragmatic choices in what policies best improve the life of our citizens are always made over the blind dogma seen in so many idealogues. However, a certain path must be emphasized to give Nzere a clear and defined direction and goal, especially should anything happen to our national father and we be left without his guidance. Before Bobozo Sese Seko and Nzere as a whole lies two paths. He could either fully double-down on Congolese and African nationalism, forging Nzere into the very embodiment of ‘African-ness’, at the cost of putting the needs of the ANC and the state above the needs of the people. Alternatively, nationalism could take a still prominent but secondary seat to the goals of populism, furthering Nzere’s path as a caretaker state that puts the needs of its people - all of its people - before the needs of Bobozo or his beloved ANC. Regardless of his choice, Nzere shall remain a beacon of Pan-African thought to the wider world, standing as the prime example of a post-colonial state finally free of Western influence."

However, despite this fancy living, Bobozo is far from the standard dictator who uses national funds only for his own gain. \n\nThe palace he constructed also doubles as a shelter for the downtrodden, poor, and beaten of the Congo who have nowhere else to go, with the palace holding hundreds of homeless men and battered women at any one time, giving them around-the-clock care and support as they try to get their lives back on track. Corruption, once so rife and widespread in both the Vrijstaat and Kivu, now has been nearly eradicated over fear of death at the hands of the ANC, for stealing funds meant for the Congolese people has become a capital crime. Poverty levels across the Congo have been lowered to historic levels, with Bobozo using his fleet of lavish vehicles to run supplies and aid workers across the nation when he isn’t using them to enjoy his newfound prestige and power. Though he may be a dictator in the eyes of many outside our paradise, all within Nzere know the truth - Bobozo Sese Seko is the hero of the Congo, our national father, and our greatest leader. No one cares for the people of our nation like he does, and under his rule, the people of the Congo have never been taken care of better or more thoroughly. Needs and wants are a thing of the past, for there is enough to go around under Sese Seko. Without him, we would surely perish under the weight of self-rule, or fall prey to colonialism once more."

This young man, a Ngbandi boy from Lisala known as Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, was born in 1930, and grew up as one of the thousands of ‘kadogos’ - a swahili term meaning ‘little ones’ who were effectively child soldiers.

Dividing the nation into constituent states along pre-colonial ethno-linguistic lines, a federalist system modeled on the United States and other major federal republics has been created here in the Congo. With each state having their own rights and ability to dictate their own local policies, the Congo shall be far more stable and less prone to civil strife, or so is the theory, since all states are free to govern themselves how they see fit, within reason as dictated by the federal government. However, not all states shall be equal, for Kasa-Vubu has declared that Bas-Kongo and the capital district of Kinshasa shall be given more representatives in the national parliament, with the Prime Minister citing the populations and importance of these states, with Kinshasa being the capital and Bas-Congo holding our only seaport. However, more shrewd members of our nation have noted that this act is just clear favoritism to Kasa-Vubu's own people, the Kongo and Kikongo, who reside in this coastal region. Regardless of this bias, a Congolese federal republic has been born, and now Prime Minister Kasa-Vubu shall guid it into a brighter future for all Congolese citizens - just some will reap the benefits of this new future than others."

Promoting tribalism, especially in regards to his own Yombe tribe within the wider Kongo ethnic group, Kasa-Vube has used this legacy as an excuse for him to practically pretend to be a new Manikongo. Decorating the parliamentary building in tribal decoration customary to the natives of Bas-Congo and promoting more traditional dress, Kasa-Vubu has even begun to adorn a new outfit that could be described as a mix between traditional Kongo monarchy robes and military outfit, drawing looks of both respect and mockery from his colleagues. Despite this weird fascination, Kasa-Vubu has still maintained his sanity at least, and has proven to be an effective, if biased, Prime Minister.

Though they still shall be allowed to own property, a limit has been placed on their estate size, with any property going over the size owned by a White person having its excess land seized by the state to either be sold back to the Congolese people or used for development by the state.

Although the president praises the positive effects of his policies, such as the rapid industrialization, westernization and modernization that the country is experiencing, these changes are hardly visible in the daily life of the average Congolese worker, and many do not see any difference between this new life and the one under the colonial administration, many fought for the Kivu Clique during the war and wonder today what good it did. There is still no Congolese middle class, only an oligarchic ruling caste composed of Evolués and European exploiters who represent only a minority of the population, the rest serving only as laborers for wealthy industrialists, taking advantage of Congolese wealth without any opposition from the president who invites them to continue and even to intensify their activities.

This policy of regionalism has had mixed results. While some welcome the decentralization process as a step toward a more local democracy that better represents the different peoples of the Congo while preserving local cultures and traditions, others criticize the policy as dividing the people and preventing the creation of a common Congolese identity, pointing to the recent increase in ethnic violence. \n\nNevertheless, Tshombe does not intend to abandon this policy any time soon."

Tshombe, who had been waiting for this offer since the beginning of the visit, accepted without a second's hesitation, thinking of all the profit he could make. Of course, as usual, some opposition politicians accused him of shaking hands with former imperialists and that the Congo would soon be nothing more than a Belgian colony. Tshombe knows about these kinds of criticisms and how to get rid of them, labeling his opponents as socialists should be reason enough to arrest them. \n\nThe three economists left the country after a few days' stay, thanking the president for his hospitality and looking forward to future beneficial investment opportunities."

Earning the moniker ‘The Elder Statesman’, in reference to his influence and his slightly advanced age when compared to his fellow independence-era politicians, who are all quite young for men of their stature and positions, Bolikango has risen to become a hero in the eyes of many, commanding the admiration and respect of millions across the Congo. \n\n Noted for his ability to work across the aisle without bias, our Prime Minister even before taking his new post has held a knack for non-partisan negotiation, and has endeavored to make a united, strong, and stable Congo regardless of who he has had to work with to get there. From his good friend Isaac Kalonji to his tumultuous relationship with the Young General Gonzague Bobozo, none in the Congo are too far distinct in their political beliefs to be considered anything but an ally and a fellow Congolese to Bolikango.

This day of memorial is to be held every year as a way for our nation to collectively come together so that they may remember their loved ones lost and so that they may grieve, and eventually heal, together. In addition to this new holiday, Bolikango has given a speech over radio to the nation, in which he has pleaded with the people of the Congo to come together to aid in this national renewal so that we may all heal as one. New war memorials have been created to aid the commemoration, and two new national cemeteries have been created - one outside Kinshasa and one near Boyoma Falls - so that we may lay the heroes slain in the Congo Crisis to a final, well-earned rest.

Nascent industry has been built up using the remnants of the old colonial order, while funding and investment has come from entirely within the Congo, drawing from the fortunes of the tribal kings and the Évolués, with even Prime Minister Bolikango, an Évolué himself, putting forth funding to build up our new republic.

Hailing from Katanga, Kasai, and Maniema, the Baluba, these peoples form a large minority within the Congo’s diverse landscape of different tribes and ethno-linguistic groups. Following the duty given to any Baluba man, Kalonji has begun to secretly send funds and supplies to the tribes of his people while granting them better deals and more lucrative incentives - all under the table to not arouse suspicion or jealousy. Furthermore, Kalonji has also begun to publicly endorse the traditional religious beliefs of the Baluba, angering many of his Christian allies but giving him far more support among the conservative tribes that still fill the Congo. If these dealings were to ever come out however, it could spell doom for Kalonji’s regime, and as such it has been kept quiet at all costs, even when it required Kalonji getting his own hands dirty."

A jumble of ideas barely made cohesive by its creator, this turbulent ideology could only have been made by such a turbulent and unsure mind as our young Prime Minister’s. Drawing from all corners of the former MNC coalition, Iléo has been influenced by everyone from Adoula to Bobozo to the Internationale’s Totalists. Now only time will tell if such a Frankenstein's monster of ideologies sewn together can truly fit the Congo’s unique needs."

In the chaos of the first few months, very few in government have had time for little else then complete focus on governmental matters, to the chagrin of both families and perhaps most importantly, God. The Prime Minster does consider himself a very devout man, but during the revolt and now in the reconstruction in it's aftermath, he has had little to no time for anything more then a small prayer here and there. This being the case, and with the most pressing issues of reconstruction now well behind us, Prime Minster Iléo has deemed it time to reconcile himself before God and Man, bringing him much needed spiritual conclusion. To this end, Iléo  undertook a pilgrimage to New Jerusalem, headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ on Earth and home to Simon Kimbangu, the Holy Spirit taken flesh. Due to the proximity of New Jerusalem to the capital, the journey was not more then a day. Upon arriving in New Jerusalem, the Prime Minster joined hundreds of others on the doorstep of the great church, the centerpiece of New Jerusalem, confessing his sins publicly. Holding nothing back, Iléo confessed everything from horrors committed during the revolt to cases of pride and lust. Upon completing his confession, the Prime Minster was escorted to see the Prophet himself. What the two disscused is unknown, but it is clear that the short conversion had a profound impact on Iléo. Regardless, the Prime Minster has made his peace with God, and now can hopefully lead the nation into the future, with a clear conscious to boot."

Now, with the coalition shattered, these groups have coalesced into their own parties and factions, ranging from massive wings such as the camps of Kasongo and Kalonji, to tiny cliques of fringe idealogues too weak and unconnected to ever win an election. However, seeing opportunity right in front of him, Prime Minister Iléo has tried to present himself as a bridge between these two camps, seeking to bring closer cooperation between the disparate camps while drawing them into his own faction. Here, Iléo can lord over them and keep them in check while using their influence and abilities to further create a Socialist, Nationalist Congo.

Through Iléo, these two powerful figures have found a new avenue to impose their will on the Congo, as the rest of the Congo and the post-coalition parliament can only sit by and watch as radical nationalist and militarist attitudes become far more commonplace in our Congo. Denying their cries that this is a dangerous direction, Iléo has fully embraced these new ideas, for he truly believes that this is the only way to a truly safe, strong, and secure Congo."

To ease the worries of his comrades in the wider post-coalition government, this TUC, though technically a replacement for the old parliament, functions largely the same as its predecessor, with any and all Socialist parties within the Congo being allowed to participate, regardless of whether or not they are Syndicalist or trade union members. This open-door policy has done wonders to ease the concern for much of the Congo’s populace, and this new TUC is eager to prove to its constituents that true democracy still exists in the Congo, and has only taken another form. Sitting down to discuss the matters at hand and to set a course for the nation, the new delegates and representatives have take a seat in the congress chamber, kickstarting the Congo’s gradual dive into Syndicalism."

Limiting his legislation as much as possible and introducing new policy only after each new drastic change has been implemented, and the issues said implementation may cause has been quashed, the journey to a truly Syndicalist Congo has been reduced to a crawl. Angering his benefactors and allies in the Internationale, this slow pace has only had the opposite effect on much of the Congo, who applaud their Prime Minister's respect to their traditions and his patience in achieving his desired dream, which is admittedly at odds with much of the Congo’s cultures and past regime. With the Congo supporting him now more than ever, Adoula has realized that he must walk before he can run, but once he can, he shall carry the Congo into a bright, Syndicalist future."

However, these Western ideas are not inherently popular in our nation, especially with rumors circulating about that Adoula is merely a puppet of the Internationale. Whether these accusations are true or not, they have greatly harmed the image of the infantile Adoula regime, and as such Prime Minister Adoula must go to great lengths to make this new ideology acceptable in the eyes of the Congolese. Pushing for a more democratic and less strict form of Syndicalism that still allows non-Syndicalists to participate in the government, Adoula seeks to win over the hearts of the Congolese people before slowly pushing for more orthodox policies so that he may further emulate the powers of the Internationale. Unions shall be made voluntary, and union membership shall not be required to participate in elections or in the new TUC, but union membership shall grant certain economic and political incentives to encourage membership anyway. With these tweaks to mainline Syndicalist thought along with thorough ‘Africanization’ campaigns to prove to the people that he is not some European puppet, Adoula hopes to slowly make Syndicalism appealing to all the Congo’s peoples."

Our people are a hardy people, forged in the fires of war and total collapse; they will survive this no matter the hardship. The Prime Minister and his leading allies in the party have moved to create an economic plan to outline the needed development milestones we must achieve, setting quotas and deadlines on a yearly basis for the next five years to keep pace.

kivu.58.t:0 "A Necessary Lie"
kivu.58.d:0 "As the rebellion of the Simbas carries on their fight to liberate the desperate people of the Congo, it is becoming clearer with every passing day the inadequacies of the average warrior. Due to a number of factors, be it the lack of combat veterans(most of whom have sided with the government due to the influence of the Young General), the general lack of weapons more advanced than stolen or salvaged service rifles and revolvers, spears and bows, and whatever homemade firearms we can scrape together, or the overwhelming lack of any kind of industry, it's no shock why the revolt is mainly centered in the dense jungles of the east, which give us the homefield advantage in our guerilla war while allowing us to force the enemy into close quarters combat where our weapons and tactics are more effective. These problems and inflexabilities in avaliable tools and strategies have not gone unnoticed by the leadership of the revolt, the MNC. The MNC, an ostensibly nationalist and vaguely left-wing political party, has decided, in the name of the people and in hopes of gaining some semblance of victory, to start playing up their "Socialist" leanings to gain the attention of the Internationale.\n\n By no means is the MNC a truly socialist organization, besides perhaps a few fringe well read members or its blossoming but tiny trade unionist movement. Indeed, the party's most left-wing policies would be considered by no means truly socialist in the eyes of most other Leftist regimes, even by the most liberal of definitions. However the world at large is ignorant of this. Due to the party's newness and the general chaos that is post-collapse Africa, the world considers, if it considers it at all, the MNC a socialist organization, and this suits the Simba leadership just fine. Already, the Internationale has been in talks with the MNC regarding aid, which they have been all too happy to accept, regardless of the cost. Included in the aid was to be a joint military mission and form of lend-lease program, all aimed to help supply and train the Simbas as they are whipped into fighting shape. The head of this foreign military mission is rumored to be T.E Lawrence, famed general and hero of the Weltkerig who lead Arab tribes in revolt against the Ottoman Empire and later helped carry the British Revolution to victory, while other notable members of the mission are said to be the Italian revolutionary, flying ace, and militant Futurist League leader Italo Balbo, and Nestor Makhno, exiled Ukrainian revolutionary anarchist and famed leader of the Makhnovshchina and its radical wave of revolutionary terror before fleeing in exile to France.\n\nWhile the aid of the Internationale, both material and the military mission, are a great help to the Simba cause and vital to keeping the revolution burning bright, they are not free nor permanent. Indeed, the price demanded by the Internationale is a large one. In exchange for aid, the MNC is to hand roughly 35% of all mineral extracts in the Congo over to the Internationale, along with adoption of a permanent advisor position, to be staffed by loyalist, pre-screened candidates of the Internationale's choosing. While some have called this deal soul-sucking and government forces have had a field day with so-called, "Red Imperialism", the MNC's leadership view this as the only way for the Congo to ever truly be free."

In the short time they've been in the Congo, the state of the average Simba fighter, or perhaps better said as warrior, has caused not a small amount of stress on the mission's leadership. While they expected primitive fighters, they could not have expected just how bad things were. While abroad, the Simbas are depicted as brave guerrilla fighters, boasting old weapons from the Weltkrieg. In the minds of the advisors, they expected an army vaguely resembling the guerrillas of Indochina, or the Left KMT. The reality, however, is quite the opposite.\n\nWhile the Simbas do indeed make use of a few firearms from about the time of the Weltkrieg, the vast majority do not, and those that hold these already old weapons consider them almost nothing more then trophies. Indeed, the majority of the Simba fighters make use of much more antiqued weaponry, spears being the most commonly used weapon. If their weapon of choice wasn't shocking enough, many if also not the majority of the fighters adorn themselves with tribal face paint and offer sacrifice and pray to strange and ancient deities for protection and victory. This religiosity in the face of war is also expressed in another, much more esoteric way, magic. Coming in many forms, this supposed "magic" of the tribal witch doctors is said to do everything, from stopping bullets to making a warrior unkillable. One of the most popular and wide spread of these magics is known as a dawa blessing. While coming in many shapes and sizes, and even changing depending on tribe or witch doctor, broadly the blessing involves the pouring of a mixture of herbs and plants only the witch doctor knows onto a warrior, along with a small mystic drawing of carbon made upon his forehead. If this is done correctly, and the warrior does not steal, touch a woman, look back or feel fear, they become immune to bullets. If a man who was blessed with a dawa blessing does die, he simply felt fear, or so the doctors claim. Even with this magic, many of the Simbas are indeed simply tribal warriors, pressed into combat by their chiefs, who were either bribed, threatened or promised concessions by the MNC to get their cooperation. \n\nThe state of the Simbas being what they are, many within the mission could not believe their eyes, and have already booked planes for home, believing there to be no hope for these primitives. T.E Lawerence, de facto head of the mission, has condemned these men has turn coats. Taking his experience from Arabia,"Lawrence of the Congo" has he has begin to be known as, has taken it upon himself to create a training program that incorporates the best of the existing Simba style, to create a uniquely Congolese combat system. While obviously this will take time, already Simba fighters are preforming much more organized then only three weeks before, when the Mission first arrived."

After a long bout with ‘prostate cancer’, our national father passed away this past weekend, leaving a hole in the heart of every true child of the Congo. However, despite this cause of death that has been told to the public, a darker and more sinister truth lurks beneath the surface. Only known to a few souls within the Congo, Bobozo did not succumb to cancer, but was instead assassinated by his young protege. Lured out to the Zambezi rapids on safari, Bobozo’s adopted son Mobutu shot him in the leg as they were isolated deep within the jungle. Leaving him bleeding out, Mobutu doused him with big cat scent, attracting a jet-black leopard to the scene who devoured the wounded Bobozo after biting him in the throat as his son watched - a fitting end for the famed ‘Leopard of Nzere.’ \n\nWith this reality unknown to most, a lavish funeral being held for this demigod, it is planned for Bobozo Sese Seko to be entombed in the capital in his own special mausoleum that is to be constructed in an exaggerated style mimicking the burial mounds of the great Kongo kings. Inside this structure, a glass sarcophagus shall encase our beloved patriarch, where he shall be embalmed and mummified so that generations and generations for years to come can witness the glory of the Father of Nzere. \n\n With his death, many feared that our nation would fall into chaos, but luckily for the people of Nzere, Bobozo has trained a successor. The young Kadogo he had rescued years ago had grown into a fitting heir to the seat of Marshal of Nzere, and this young Mobutu was not set to take his adoptive father’s place. Dropping his original Nzereized name of Mobutu Salelo Ndembo Adurama, Mobutu has taken the same title as our patriarch, carrying on the legacy of Bobozo in a weird reflection of a pseudo-monarchy. Now, the nation shall bow to its new national father, for the reign of Mobutu Sese Seko has begun."

Rising through the ranks from practically enslaved child soldier to competent veteran warrior as the fires of the Congo Crisis raged around him, Lumumba eventually found himself freed from his former kidnapper and instead under the far more respectable command of Isaac Kalonji, Joseph Okito, and Joseph Kasongo - three heroes of our people’s republic in their own right. However, the young Lumumba would only find brief respite after the civil war finally ended, for it was soon after that the Simba Revolt sparked to life. \n\nStill just a teen - and one already radicalized due to his exposure to Pan-Afrikan and Socialist ideas from his time spent within Kalonji, Okito, and Kasongo’s unit within the ANC, the young Lumumba stayed with his now rebel commanders in the newly formed APL, and stuck by their side as one of the Simbas’ elite squad leaders and NCOs, while slowly developing into a Pan-African theorist and Socialist ideological thinker in his own right. With our revolution victorious and our people’s republic now proclaimed, Lumbumba has risen to become one of the once-child soldiers who now has begun to be trained as a new officer within the APL, and has been helped along in no small part by his commanding officers who now lead the Congo, for these titans of Congolese Socialism seem to be eyeing Lumumba up as a possible protégé.

kivu.68.d:0 "It is done. Brussels burns and the rest of Belgium smolders with it. The proud and heroic armies of our Congo march down the decadent and gothic streets of old Belgium, and the homeland of our former oppressors now turns to ash - a final revenge for the ash and horror they brought to our jungle eden. A new Free State shall rise under the direction of the ingenious general and surgeon Victor Lundula, a.k.a Lundula Okoko Ta Mongo, along with the help of young upstart officer Antoine Gizenga, but our brave and chosen people shall not be the ones to lose their hands to barbarity this time. We will pay back the ‘kindness’ these former slavers and colonizers showed to our own people. They shall know the pain of imperialism as we bring true, righteous civilization to these savage animals, for we have taken their burden, and it is ours to shoulder now."

kivu.69.d:0 "Though many fought hard to lead the Simbas to greatness, such as the popular Kalonji or the veterans Adoula and Kasongo, few have done more to aid the revolution than Joseph Okito. Leader of men and machine during the Simba Revolt, Okito racked up win after win using experimental tactics and Internationale-supplied weapons and vehicles of war, aiding the nation and the People in our struggle for sovereignty. Not only a sound military tactician, Okito has proven to be a capable teacher as well, raising a new generation of Congolese officers to help protect and serve the nation, including veterans like Gaston Soumialot and Nicholas Olenga, who now lead their fellow Congolese in the defense of our nation. \n\nThough he has shown military talent, Okito’s true skill and passion are on full display when his sharp mind is put to the task of administration and governance as he continues to prove to be one of the most sound and capable politicians and governors we have, well-liked by the masses due to his moderate Market Socialist stances, pragmatic attitude, and with a fierce but non-radical devotion to Congolese nationalism and to the Congolese people. This eldar statesman of the Congolese Left has done all this without asking for much, refusing power and direct leadership time and time again, always preferring to take a less primary role as to improve the Congo from the shadows. However, despite this apprehension, many still call for Okito - perhaps the oldest, wisest, and most skilled Congolese Socialist of our age - to be the one, true face of the nation. Should [root.getleader] move to take a secondary position to the great Okito? Though he would still retain all his powers and responsibilities, he would do so from the shadowy and less stressful position that Okito once occupied as the titan himself rises to be the new face of the Congo."

kivu.71.d:0 "As our Central African people's federation rises, [root.getleader] has furthered the Pan-African dream than any thought possible, for now millions of peoples across hundreds of ethnic and cultural groups now stand united by the might of the Congolese. However, to the West, our fellow Bantu brethren call to us as they languish under faltering colonialism or opportunistic and naive locals. Should we continue our march and spread our federation towards Westafrika, or should we stay put here and focus on expanding our eden to all of Central Africa alone?"

kivu.72.t:0 "The Rising Red Star Shoots His Shot"
kivu.72.d:0 "The people breathe calm and free, for the Simbas under [root.getleader] have brought porgressive idealism, Socialist egalitarianism, and populist paradise to our jungle eden. However, doing so has been no small task, and our proud leader grows tired of the rigors of national rule. Seeking to keep the ideas of anti-authoritarianism alive, many have proposed for a replacement to rise and take the place of [root.getleader] at the helm of the nation. Though our national father shall always have a place in our government and a say in our future, it may be time for another to steer the ship. Though many jockey for the position, all are plagued by previous loyalties or party affiliations, but there stands one unbiased and widely loved figure that could perhaps take the stand. \n\nFormer kadogos during the Congo Crisis and the Simba Revolt turned general and Pan-African theorist Patrice Émery Lumumba has long been an understudy and protégé of [root.getleader] due to his time serving under our Prime Minister in the wars of our nation’s birth. Though young, he has been forged by chaotic times into an ingenious man of action and grand design, and due to his charisma, pragmatism, warm personality, and ability to compromise and be charmingly diplomatic, the young Lumumba has been able to make friends with all ideological corners of the fractured MNC. If one man could rally the factions of our government like [root.getleader] could, it would be his very own student and surrogate son. However, despite all that is going for him, many still revile the idea of letting one so young lead our nation and dictate our future. Perhaps it would be best to just soldier on and continue this ever-lengthening term instead."

kivu.73.t:0 "Sweet Revenge"
kivu.73.d:0 "Though largely defeated numerous times in the past both by our own forces and by the colonials that preceded us, the rebellious Garanganze of the fallen Yeke Kingdom still continue to prowl the jungles of Katanga and Kasai. Led by the usurper and tyrant Godefroid Munongo, these tribalist guerillas have long prodded at our frontier, but recently became emboldened due to funding from the infamous Moïse Tshombe, and have moved to occupy an important uranium mine at Shinkolobwe. \n\nTaking matters into his own hands as usual, dusting off the combat skills honed and forged in the fires of the Congo Crisis and the Simba Revolt, Patrice Lumumba and his squad of Congolese veterans personally drove in a convoy towards Shinkolobwe, with his squadmates and subordinates Antoine Gizenga, Nicholas Olenga, Gaston Soumialot, Ildéphonse Massengo, and the young kasogos duo Maurice Mpolo and Christophe Gbenye in tow. Arriving at the compound under the cover of night, this band of brothers moved quickly and quietly through the occupied mine, eliminating sleeping guards and distracted rebels with hushed blades and muffled shots. \n\nBefore an alarm could be sounded or reinforcements could be called, Lumumba and his men made their way to the heart of the refinery complex where they found the tyrant Munongo trying to escape through a window, alerted by the few guards to witness and survive the meticulously orchestrated stealth hit. Panicked by his attackers and with nowhere to go, Munongo jumped from the ledge seeking freedom, only to find himself cascading down towards a drum of refinery acid. As cries of agony and pleas for help escaped liquefying lips and lungs, what once was Munongo was slowly reduced to a whimpering, hissing horror as the pretender Mwami seared, bubbled, and popped in his caustic coffin - a fitting end for the Terror of Katanga and instigator of the Kasaian Genocide. \n\nReturning to Kinshasa victorious, Lumumba and his team were paraded around the city by the masses, raised up in opulent chairs as the people chanted their names. The terrorists were slain, the people were safe, the mine was secured, and the Congo was free to prosper uninhibited once again, all thanks to Lumumba."

kivu.74.t:0 "Cracks Within ABAKO Begin to Show"
kivu.74.d:0 "As President Kasa-Vubu continues to build his ‘federation of ethnic equals’, the cracks within the Party have begun to grow more visible as Kasa-Vubu’s proclivity to favor his own Kongo, or Bakongo, people has begun to cause outrage to spread throughout the wider nation. Congo is home to hundreds of different ethnic groups, and to favor only one has angered the millions of fellow Congolese sons and daughters that struggled alongside us for independence from the colonial dogs, and Kasa-Vubu’s increasingly concerning ‘appreciation’ for the aesthetic, history, culture, and policy of the old Kongo Kingdom have only made matters worse as he props himself up as a modern manikongo hiding in the skin of a democratic politician. Fearing the rise of authoritarianism and dangerous nationalism, the first Black governor of Kinshasa under the old colonial regime and original founder of ABAKO - Edmond Nzeza-Nlandu - has begun to campaign against his former ally and friend, propping himself up as the truly unbiased and democratic hero of the Congolese people in opposition to Kasa-Vubu’s growing authoritarian ways and growing addiction to ethnic favoritism. As these two titans and fellow co-founders of ABAKO now duke it out, the rest of the nation must sit back and watch as the fate of democracy in Congo hangs in the balance."
kivu.74.a:0 "Kasa-Vubu is the true father of a free Congo. We shall never turn our backs on him!"

kivu.75.d:0 "During the Great War, 32 native Congolese Force Publique soldiers were honored with being the first Black volunteer officers in Belgium’s forces, serving through the nerve-wracking Holy Wait and into the true fires of war as the Battle of Yser and beyond, and although the Entente might have lost the war, we shall honor these true heroes of the Congo just the same. Joseph Adipanga, Pierre Alomon, Jean Balamba, Paul Bayon, Antoine Boïmbo, Édouard Bolia, Camille Bolofo, Antoine Bomjo, Eugène Bonkakou, Pius Bouclou, Léon De Cassa, Joseph Droeven, Honoré Fataki, Jean Jacob Ilanga, Jean-Baptiste Jessy, Albert Kudjabo, Honoré Kulu, Simon Lisasi, Michel Longo, Joseph Lopiko, François Mabilla, Antoine Manglunki, Pierre M’Bimba, Jacques M’Bondo, Jules Moké, Antoine Mona, Paul Panda Farnana, Pierre Sangwali, Thomas Seres, Sébastien Simba, Pierre Soumbou and Antoine Yoka. Each and every one of these men are true champions of the Congolese people, fighting for the Belgian colonials in hopes of earning better conditions back home as our people languished under imperialism. With many of these men still serving in our armed forces, they shall all be given the most honorable of posts and positions within our command so that we can learn from their expertise and wisdom, while those that have retired or sadly perished shall be remembered by the state as their families are taken care of and provided for. Going so far as to make a national holiday for them on the anniversary of the day the Great War ended, heroes like Adipanga and Kudjabo shall become household names in no time."

kivu.76.t:0 "Fate of Our National Ambitions Under the Young General"
kivu.76.d:0 "The Young General Louis de Bobozo Gonzague currently rules over our unified Congolese state with an apolitical and unbiased hand as he has transformed the nation into an orderly and lawful paradise under his former-Askari and former-Force Publique allies within his Armée Nationale Congolaise, supported by notions of secularity, nationalist populism, stratocratic statism, and republican reformism. However, Gonzague may have abandoned his interests in politics and radicalism in order to build the ultimate stratocratic state to unify the Congo, but he has long sought to take this idea further in order to create a true Sovereign Commandery that stretches across the entire Congo Basin and beyond, uniting our fellow former Askari and other veterans that served dutifully under the failed colonial regimes that once infected our entire continent who got nothing in return for their brave service aside from oppression and a life as second-class citizen compared to the invading White menace! Should the Young General work to liberate his fellow Askari and other African kin across the lands of old Mittelafrika, or should we continue to build our militarist paradise solely for the Congolese people within our Congo alone?"

kivu.77.d:0 "Taking the nation by storm, much to the chagrin of the Armée Nationale Congolaise and its more conservative leading members like Joseph Adipanga, Albert Kudjabo, Daniel Kanza, and many other remnants of the Black officers that dominated the old Force Publique, President Gonzague Bobozo has moved to announce the creation of his own special defense force - the Division Spéciale Présidentielle aka the Special Presidential Division. Initially starting out as a secretive brigade largely kept hidden from the public and the current hierarchy or chain of command within the ‘compromised’ ANC, this newly enlarged division shall serve as the Young General’s personal bodyguards, hit squad, secret police, and paramilitary, ensuring that the word of our beloved President Louis de Gonzague Bobozo is forever obeyed and protected as he creates this new paradise for the Congolese people. Trained by experts in guerilla warfare sent by new allies across Africa and in Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas, our President spared no expense in their training and outfitting, with them being one of the only divisions in our army fully equipped with state-of-the-art artillery purchased abroad, and as such he has begun to utilize them in any way he can, even getting DSP servicemen to help our administration in more lucrative, less legal activities as well such as our massive copper and cobalt smuggling operation. Hated by most of their fellow servicemen, largely over their brutish and overly-violent tactics, their innately corrupt nature sitting in the pocket of the President, and their reality as one of the the only military units in Congo that is adequately and regularly paid their owed salary, the DSP may be despised by many, but their power is near absolute, for the only authority they answer to is the word of the Young General, for better or for worse."
kivu.77.a:0 "By the honor of the Young General, the Special Presidential Brigade shall defend our Congo."

kivu.78.t:0 "The Final Fate of Colonial Enterprise Under the Young General"
kivu.78.d:0 "Long living in the pocket of the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga as many corrupt administrators of the Congo have before his triumphant ascendence to the halls of true power, the Young General and the father of our free, independent Congo - the great Louis de Gonzague Bobozo - now must decide to do with these remaining, yet useful, colonial stooges. Standing as the richest company in Africa, one of the most profitable ventures on the planet, and already controlling many profitable mineral deposits - including some the most prized copper, uranium, zinc, gold, diamond, silver, tin, and cobalt pits on Earth - the UMHK is a capitalistic and corporationist behemoth, and one such behemoth we could feasibly tap into or even completely control thanks to our newfound control. Should we continue to sell out and maintain this kleptocratic and corrupt relationship with privately-owned UMHK for the sake of national and economic stability, even if it means we must still work with our former colonial enemies just to get a cut of the profits from our own mineral wealth? Alternatively, we could just ignore the UMHK and their massive operations the best we can as we work to build up our own domestic mining industries in the few pits and veins not already claimed by these colonial parasites. Finally, the most radical solution proposed is for Bobozo to follow through on his ultimate dream of nationalizing the UMHK’s operations entirely, shifting all control to our government’s hands to be planned at national level by the Young General and his brightest, most loyal minds in a new mining conglomerate and commodity trader called La Générale des Carrières et des Mines - or Gécamines for short, all supposedly for the good of the Congolese masses and surely without any corrupt undertones...or so he claims. What shall be the final fate of the UMHK under the Young General?"
kivu.78.a:0 "Let the UMHK continue private operations under our bribed supervision."

More of a Social Capitalist than a true Socialist by any stretch, being among the pseudo-Leftists that play up their ‘Redness’ in order to garner more support from the Third Internationale, Joseph Iléo’s beliefs are rooted in Market Socialism, Left Kimbanguism, Popular Patriotism, Radical Progressivism based on Christian and Federalist principles, and of course Socialist Nationalism like all other former MNC members.

One of the more dedicated Leftists of his ilk like Cyrille Adoula, Isaac Kalonji’s beliefs are rooted in Democratic Socialism, Christian Socialism, Market Socialism, Tribal Communitarianism linked to his Baluba favoritism, and of course Socialist Nationalism like all other former MNC members. All he must do now is choose a subset to focus on as we dive into the nitty-gritty of building a new system from scratch."

Named after anti-colonial intellectual Isaac Kalonji, leader of the Congo’s burgeoning semi-socialist and highly nationalist independence movement, the MNC or  Mouvement National Congolais, the new university’s inaugural class has been filled by hundreds of future academics from not just our new friends of the Congo, but also from similar strata across the developing world currently under the clutches of foreign imperialism. By funding the education of these desperate and oppressed thinkers and future leaders, we shall ensure that the next generation knows the Revolutionary truth when they return back home while expanding our diplomatic and ideological network across the globe, undermining counterrevolutionary forces all along the way. And who knows, if Communard and Congolese relations keep growing closer as the years go on and if this first international university is a success, maybe other Congolese patriots serving alongside Kalonji will get their own places of interest and renown named after them here in the future as well."

kivu.82.t:0 "A Crossroads for Congolese Syndicalism"
kivu.82.d:0 "Although he has led the Congo admirably since first holding our inaugural elections in the wake of the Simba’s final victory, Cyrille Adoula is still a young man with little experience for leading a mass movement outside of his time working in the unions or within the old colonial regime. This inexperience has led to the creation of a rival clique within the RDSC wing of the former MNC Grande Union, led by the strike leader Léonard Mpoyi. A veteran of resisting the old colonial regime during his time both passively and actively resisting the UMHK as a mining team leader, Mpoyi is one of the most respected men in the Congo, even ignoring his key role in co-leading the Simba Revolt to success. Not only a folk hero to much of Katanga and wider Congo, Mpoyi is also committed to the Syndicalist cause, though he is not nearly as ideologically inclined or as well read on theory as Adoula or other theoreticians of the MNC’s doctrine. Instead, Léonard Mpoyi proved his devotion out in the field, orchestrating mass action against the former colonial regime’s abhorrent mistreatment of Congolese workers both Black and White, with his most famous demonstrations rising up at the uranium mines of Shinkolobwe or the copper pits outside Elizabethville and Jadotville where he led a mass of thousands of miners and other industrial laborers in a general strike that crippled the Katanga province for weeks in the mayhem leading up to the Congo Crisis. However, some young firebrands that remain loyal to Adoula have attempted to slander Mpoyi as a colonial puppet that remains untrustable, largely due to his soft and inclusive stance towards former colonial citizens and the wider White population left in Congo, while many moderates also continue to support Adoula solely due to him winning our first fair and free election, not willing to betray the trust of the people by replacing our democratically elected leader with an appointed military figure no matter how pure Mpoyi’s intentions truly are. \n\nShould the party push for Cyrille Adoula to step down from his position as our head of state to a secondary position beneath the respected front of General Léonard Mpoyi in order to bolster wider confidence in the RDSC’s Syndicalist efforts, or should we keep our faith in he who the people elected to carry us towards prosperity instead, instead giving Mpoyi an advisory position within our democratic cabinet?"

kivu.83.d:0 "Himself an avid and highly skilled footballer from his days at university or as a boy at the local dirt pitch, Cyrille Adoula has announced the continuation of Congo’s national soccer league following its collapse during the civil war. However, no longer shall this league be a colonial construct, and no longer shall African talent be forced to play second fiddle to European privilege and wealth, at least here at home. Though it is unknown if our professional teams will be instantly allowed to compete at the Spartakiade or the World Cup is not immediately known, but we shall prepare anyway as new teams are founded and old teams re-organize to join the new league. Curiously, Adoula has also announced his intentions to play for one of these newly created professional teams himself - specifically for CS Imana of Kinshasa, of which Adoula co-owns and co-leads with his old friend and college teammate Álvaro Holden Roberto, who is known back in his native home of Angola as a burgeoning socialist academic and one hell of a striker in his own right. Expected to stimulate not only our economy but the morale and wider support from the masses despite Adoula’s apparent grab at the national spotlight, most in the nation have applauded this move while Adoula denies any ego while stating his motives are only a love for the game. Regardless, let a new season of Congolese football finally commence!"

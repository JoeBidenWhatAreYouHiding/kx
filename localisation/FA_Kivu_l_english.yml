### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_LOUIS_BOBOZO_DESC:0 "The last thing young Gonzague imagined in his career as a German Askari is to be leading one of the biggest states in the now-free Africa. Born in the later years of the Belgian Congo and then Mittelafrika - he was enthralled by the discipline and exploits of the Askari. He signed up in 1933 and quickly rose through the ranks through his great leadership skills after squashing several revolts and guerrilla groups on behalf of his Hunnic masters. However his true loyalty was always with his people. When the Governor of the Congo ordered his division to pacify Kivu and his home state of the northwest with senselessly brutality, he decided to stand up for his people by organizing a mutiny. Despite his really young age, he rallied most of the Congo's African-majority armies under his banner and overthrew their German masters. Now young Gonzague stands at a crossroads - his fledgling clique is surrounded on all sides by enemies, and his government is rife with incompetence due to his lack of political experience from his young age. Will the Kivu Clique lead the Congo to it's deserved glory, or will it fall to the other warlords and tribes vying for the same level of power?"

### Ideas ###

KIV_native_support:0 "Support from the Congolese"
KIV_native_support_desc:0 "Both the urban sprawls and primordial wilds of the Congo are home to millions of people, many of whom revile the colonial system as much as we do. Though they may not throw in with us politically, or in any official capacity, these masses are still allies to the cause and true Congolese patriots. Their aid, whether in the form of guerilla attacks or simple donations of weapons or supplies, goes a long way in helping the war effort."

KIV_inexperience:0 "Inexperienced in Statecraft"
KIV_inexperience_desc:0 "We are a newly birthed nation in an ever expanding sea of chaos and war. Our forces and infantile government have no experience when it comes to running a state, and as such, the process of laying our initial national foundations has been a painful and slow process. We must adapt quickly to this new situation, lest our independence be lost before it has even been truly earned."

KIV_inexperience2:0 "Inexperienced in Statecraft"
KIV_inexperience2_desc:0 "We are a newly birthed nation in an ever expanding sea of chaos and war. Our forces and infantile government have no experience when it comes to running a state, and as such, the process of laying our initial national foundations has been a painful and slow process. We must adapt quickly to this new situation, lest our independence be lost before it has even been truly earned."

KIV_push_idea:0 "Final Push"
KIV_push_idea_desc:0 "The Askari and native kingdoms and tribes have been rallied and roused while our forces pour into the Congo’s various thickets and estuaries, cutting down mercenaries and settlers alike in their quest to rid the Congo of the Imperialist’s taint once and for all. The final moment is upon us, for it is now or never. We shall either die a fiery and glorious death in the service of our people or we shall finally stand free and victorious over a sovereign Congo. Destiny awaits us in the final battle, so let us charge and meet fate head on!"

KIV_masters_of_the_jungle_idea:0 "Masters of the Jungle"
KIV_masters_of_the_jungle_idea_desc:0 "The jungles and thickets of the Congo are some of the oldest and densest on Earth, and no one knows these lands quite like we do. Drawing upon the vast wealth of knowledge the many native Bantu peoples have of these virgin wilds and incorporating this into our tactics as codified doctrine will allow us to teach these tips and tricks of jungle warfare to new recruits for generations to come. We are one with the jungle, and we shall use this fact to rein hellfire down upon our foes as they struggle to cross the mires and pitfalls of this primordial eden."

KIV_masters_of_the_jungle_idea2:0 "Masters of the Jungle"
KIV_masters_of_the_jungle_idea2_desc:0 "The jungles and thickets of the Congo are some of the oldest and densest on Earth, and no one knows these lands quite like we do. Drawing upon the vast wealth of knowledge the many native Bantu peoples have of these virgin wilds and incorporating this into our tactics as codified doctrine will allow us to teach these tips and tricks of jungle warfare to new recruits for generations to come. We are one with the jungle, and we shall use this fact to rein hellfire down upon our foes as they struggle to cross the mires and pitfalls of this primordial eden."

KIV_aksari_dominance:0 "Askari Dominance"
KIV_aksari_dominance_desc:0 "Our war for independence may have been fought with the masses of tribal and village conscripts requisitioned from the many kingdoms and ethnic groups within the Congo, the war was won by the Askari. Their dominance and skill is unmatched in the region, and they shall be given sweeping benefits and powers to thank them for their service, for the Congolese owe these men their lives and freedom, and they will be rewarded for it."

KIV_officer_rule:0 "Rule of the Officer Committee"
KIV_officer_rule_desc:0 "An oversight committee of loyal Askari officers and strategists shall be established in order to serve as the main bureaucracy of our state. This thinktank of stern, stalwart military minds shall lead the Congo as they endeavor to usher in a newfound era of stability and unity. Our administration shall be free from corruption and greed as the principles of stratocracy and our soldiers’ fine training and sense of duty guide our way into the future."

KIV_officer_rule2:0 "Rule of the Officer Committee"
KIV_officer_rule2_desc:0 "An oversight committee of loyal Askari officers and strategists shall be established in order to serve as the main bureaucracy of our state. This thinktank of stern, stalwart military minds shall lead the Congo as they endeavor to usher in a newfound era of stability and unity. Our administration shall be free from corruption and greed as the principles of stratocracy and our soldiers’ fine training and sense of duty guide our way into the future."

KIV_no_corruption:0 "Purge of the Corrupt"
KIV_no_corruption_desc:0 "Corruption is a cancer that has long infected Congolese administrations from the rule of King Leopold to the fall of the Vrijstaat, ever spreading like a cancerous mass seeking to swallow any notion of good governance in Congo before it can even begin. We must cut away and remove any and all sources of corruption and decay using whatever means the Young General and his forces deem necessary. Congo will be cleansed of this plague once and for all."

KIV_colonial_purge:0 "Authenticité Program"
KIV_colonial_purge_desc:0 "The newly christened Gonzague Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga has decreed a ‘return to authenticity’ to wash over all of the Congo. Seeking to eliminate any and all traces of colonial influence, Gonzague has decreed that things like western religions, dress, naming conventions, pronoun usage, and more are all dated and tainted vestiges of an imperialist-dominated past. All of these sins and more shall be washed away in this process of ‘Nzerianisation’, for the Congo is for Africans, and no one else!"

KIV_retirement_fund:0 "Askari Retirement Fund"
KIV_retirement_fund_desc:0 "It was on the backs and with the blood of the Askari that Congo’s independence was won. Without these veterans, our shining republic would have been but a mere distant dream in the minds of servants, slaves, and deadmen. Despite many of them serving under the regime of the imperialists before the Collapse, these men have proven that they are true sons of the Congo. Pensions, housing-assistance, jobs, and more will be provided to these heroes, and the people they saved shall pay for it."

KIV_solid_government:0 "Stable Bureaucracy"
KIV_solid_government_desc:0 "Our new republic needs a strong bureaucracy if our government is to adequately meet the needs of the Congolese people in an efficient and orderly fashion. Long dead must be the days of chaos and misinformation that once infested every inch of our Congo under the Vrijstaat."

KIV_ethnic_federalism2:0 "A Federation of Ethnic Equals..."
KIV_ethnic_federalism2_desc:0 "The new Congolese republic must embrace its unique constituent identities and ethnicities and not hide behind the facade of a central and unified ‘nationality.’ Sure we all live in the Congo, but we are not all just Congolese; we are Zande, Songye, Luba, Kundu, Mbole, Hamba, Komo, Ngata, and so many more. Together, but unique, shall be the way forward for the Congo and all its people..."

KIV_regionalism:0 "Congolese Regionalism"
KIV_regionalism_desc:0 "The unique identities that have formed in the various regions of the Congo from the unique local mixture of ethnicities and tribes is truly one-of-a-kind on this planet. We should embrace this regional identity and set up regional administration to govern each cohesive regional unit, for the leading party already does with their beloved Katanga."

KIV_private_investment:0 "Privatization of Colonial-Era Companies"
KIV_private_investment_desc:0 "The Tshombe regime has decided to privatize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, bursting open the floodgates for thousands of our people to jump at the chance to own their own business and companies. Though most will be bought up by the small minority of established, wealthy Évolués, the mere opportunity being available has been enough to stimulate our economy. Our profit margins soar ever higher as we build a true entrepreneurial class for our republic."

KIV_national_investment:0 "Nationalization of Colonial-Era Companies"
KIV_national_investment_desc:0 "The Tshombe regime has decided to nationalize all former colonial companies within the Congo’s borders, massively inflating the resources at the government’s disposal and the responsibilities they must now be accountable for. President Tshombe himself is delighted, able to siphon off as much money from this ever-growing pot as he pleases as he uses the rest to drag the Congo into a modern and westernized future."

KIV_western_investment:0 "Western Investment"
KIV_western_investment_desc:0 "The Union Minière du Haut-Katanga is the largest company in the Congo, accounting for nearly 70% of our national economy. Any party willing to get anything done in this nation has to go through them, but Tshombe has long held friendly ties and business relations with this industrial conglomerate. By allowing the Union Minière free reign within our economy, the Congo as a whole and Tshombe himself will be rewarded handsomely as the economy is revolutionized, westernized, and modernized on a national scale. However, much of the profits will still be going into the pockets of these former imperialists."

KIV_uplifting_the_congolese_worker:0 "Uplifting the Worker"
KIV_uplifting_the_congolese_worker_desc:0 "The Congo is rather unique as far as colonial holdings in Africa go, for it has seen industrialization on a scale not witnessed elsewhere on this continent save for a few other regions such as within South Africa or Kenya-Uganda. This industrialization has allowed a true industrial working class to develop here - each soul of which is subjected to the same rigors and predators of the industrial world as in Europe or the Americas. We must not repeat the errors of our former masters, and move to uplift the downtrodden labourers of our nation. They are the backbone of our new modern economy and the ticket to a glorious and prosperous future, and they must be treated as such."

KIV_no_regionalism:0 "Unitary Congo"
KIV_no_regionalism_desc:0 "Factionalism, regional divisions, tribalism, and other petty social hierarchies and organizational failures have long wracked the Congo, tearing this massive paradise apart from the inside as these sickening ideas infected the minds of our varied peoples and drove them apart as the colonials moved in to pick up the pieces. We must galvanize a new national sense of unity and forge a united Congolese identity to serve as a bulwark against the corruptive and divisive forces that seek to undermine our new republic."

KIV_simba_revolt_idea:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_revolt_idea_desc:0 "Our righteous revolution has just begun, and already our forces are on the backfoot. The governmental forces of Kivu and the ANC have quickly mobilized against our ragtag group of rebels, and now our issues are as glaring as ever. We suffer from a lack of manpower and weaponry, and currently only our large base of popular support is keeping us in the fight. We must muster the strength and arms needed to beat back this foe and truly free the Congo and its peoples!"
KIV_simba_revolt_idea2:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_revolt_idea2_desc:0 "After cutting our teeth against our enemy in harsh jungle warfare, taking on numerous casualties due to our troops’ inexperience and outdated equipment, we have somehow begun to claw ourselves out of the dangerous corner our revolution started in. Though we are far from even the glimmer of victory, we have begun to taste it. If we continue to sow discord through their ranks and keep up our violent guerilla campaign, there just may be a path to victory."
KIV_simba_revolt_idea3:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_revolt_idea3_desc:0 "As our young soldiers slowly turn into veterans as they diligently fight their way through the Congo, our forces have begun to make major ground. No longer confined to only the jungles, our forces have created a unified frontline against the ANC. Now, with numerous urban centers and military depots under our control, victory in this war has begun to be expected by many of our more optimistic Simbas. Though victory is still not a certainty, our revolution now stands a real shot at overthrowing [KIV.getleader]’s regime."
KIV_simba_revolt_idea4:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_revolt_idea4_desc:0 "Against all odds and expectations, the forces of the Simba revolt have begun to occupy nearly every major city in the Congo, as well as maintaining their control over massive swathes of scattered Congolese wilderness. Using guerilla tactics and asymmetrical warfare to devastating effect, the ANC has been largely routed and the days are numbered for Kivu’s failing regime. Unless the reactionaries can pull off a miracle, it is only a matter of time before the Congo is swept under the Red tide."

KIV_simba_government_idea:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_government_idea_desc:0 "The vile Simbas have stoked the fires of rebellion for far too long, and now have risen up in arms to topple our state. Even now, the loyal and well-trained soldiers of the ANC are mobilizing en masse, making their way to the largest hotspots of this uprising. We must strike now and crush these Simbas before they gain any traction, while we have the upper hand. If we push hard, victory is all but assured."
KIV_simba_government_idea2:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_government_idea2_desc:0 "Though our initial contact with the Simba forces have proven to be bloody affairs for our own troops, we are still a much larger and more organized force. By utilizing our tactics and keeping our wits about us, we still stand a good chance of annihilating these Socialists before their taint permanently damages the Congo."
KIV_simba_government_idea3:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_government_idea3_desc:0 "After a harsh war against the Simbas and their cowardly guerilla tactics, the effects of these hit-and-run tactics have begun to show their effects. The ANC’s forces are haggard and undersupplied, with desertion being common, forcing the government to rely increasingly on mercenaries. Loyalty within their ranks is at an all time low, and if they don’t start seeing successes in battle soon, the Kivu Clique could stand on the brink of collapse."
KIV_simba_government_idea4:0 "The Simba Revolt"
KIV_simba_government_idea4_desc:0 "Chaos and turmoil have spread across the Congo on the back of the vile Simbas. These foul revolutionaries have beaten us back at every turn, waging their brutal guerilla war against the ANC to great effect. Now, their forces control most major cities in the Congo, and the writing on the wall for our regime couldn’t be clearer. Our backs are to the walls and unless something changes soon, the Congo will be lost to these Reds."

KIV_cohesive_socialist_democracy2:0 "A ‘Cohesive’ Socialist Democracy"
KIV_cohesive_socialist_democracy2_desc:0 "With the errors of the previous regime rectified and our struggle proving triumphant against the reactionary forces of the Congo, we are now free to fully establish our dream of a true Congolese democracy. However, the various parties not currently a part of the MNC’s broad tent have proven themselves to be nothing more than traitors and colonial sympathizers. We shall do to them what they tried to do to us, and ban them all from political activity. Our democracy shall be pure, fair, and free, guided strictly by Socialist principles, and only those who proved themselves loyal in the fires of the Simba Revolt shall be allowed to participate in our democratic dream."

KIV_civc_nationalism_idea:0 "Congolese Civic Nationalism"
KIV_civc_nationalism_idea_desc:0 "Nationalism has long been an integral part of the Congolese independence movement, but it has also been a plague that has invited radicals into our ranks and extremism into our hearts. We must cut away the dangerous ills of nationalist thought and embrace the idea of Civic Nationalism, or nationalism for the state and for liberal values over ethnic or racial heritage. Under this new breed of nationalist thought, we shall unify the people of the Congo and commit them to the ideas of our new Syndicalist republic while stamping out any dangerous ideas that try to sprout up and corrupt our people and our identity."

KIV_vent_frustrations_idea:0 "Taming the Congo with Bureaucracy"
KIV_vent_frustrations_idea_desc:0 "The Congo is still a largely disconnected and wild place, with our centers of power only truly existing in the largest cities that dot the dark expanse of these jungles like distant stars in the night sky. A massive, overarching, and constantly managed bureaucratic administrative system must be created to link the disparate communities of the Congo as we attempt to build a modern, cohesive nation state."

KIV_ensure_constant_electoral_sucsess_idea:0 "Ensuring Constant Electoral Success"
KIV_ensure_constant_electoral_sucsess_idea_desc:0 "Democracy is a fickle thing, and it must be overseen and administered in a way that achieves the most desired results, for the collective judgement of the masses is not so often of sound logic. To alleviate this inherent issue of democracy, Prime Minister Iléo seeks to secretly shackle the democratic process to his whims, ensuring that he and his supporters win election after election and are able to pass their own legislation without issue while hampering the ambitions of any political rival."

KIV_emmulate_fp_idea:0 "Emulating the Force Publique"
KIV_emmulate_fp_idea_desc:0 "Though the FP was a dastardly organization complicit in crimes on humanity against our people, they were damn effective at doing so. We shall adapt their strategies and tactics to our own forces to become the foundation of our new doctrine. With European weapons and ideas, we shall crush the disorganized rabble of wider Africa."

KIV_emmulate_the_anc_idea:0 "Emulating the ANC"
KIV_emmulate_the_anc_idea_desc:0 "Though the Young General Gonzague Bobozo may hold many strange ideas and notable flaws, he was a genius when it came to military command. We must emulate his ideas and his model - the fallen Armée Nationale Congolaise - and by their example, we shall organize the rowdy masses of Simbas and militias at our command."

KIV_take_back_equatorial_congo_desc:0 "With large cities like Gbadolite and Bumba along with important riverside settlements like Mbandaka, the Eqauteur region boasts a large section of our urban population outside Kinshasa, and with it a large part of the educated proletariat and their connections, whether they be political, academic, or within the military.

KIV_take_back_katanga:0 "March on Katanga"
KIV_take_back_katanga_desc:0 "If Kinshasa is the Pearl of the Congo, then Katanga is the Gem, for no region in the entire colony holds more material and mineral wealth. Katanga is one of the most resource-rich regions on the planet, and due to being the home of the UMHK, nearly all of our nation’s economic power and raw materials come from Katanga. There is no region in the Congo more important than Katanga, save maybe Kinshasa, and so we must march into Lubumbashi and seize this Gem for ourselves!"


KIV_gonzague_coup:0 "The ANC Intervention" 
KIV_gonzague_coup_desc:0 "As we battle the Simbas, we must be cautious of yet another threat to our new democracy.

KIV_emergency_conscription_desc:0 "Though the ANC is quite the impressive force, we still lost most of our men in the last civil war and now to the Simbas’ call to arms.

With the bulk of this coalition being made up of various democratic elements and disgruntled Askari veterans and auxiliaries, these camps have come to dominate the clique. Leading this ragtag group is ‘General’ Louis de Gonzague Bobozo, a young firebrand who has been chosen by the Askari old guard and his peers to be the face of this resistance movement. Under this young General, the Kivu Clique has risen up in the Central African Lakes region of the Congo’s easternmost provinces, seeking to throw off the yoke of colonialism once and for all. Though their union may seem united and secure on the surface, tensions have risen internally over disagreements between the various constituent factions and the future is uncertain for this young native-rule movement.

Their rule brought us stability and eventual victory, but now that the guns have grown silent, the people of the Congo finally wish to be heard. \n\nHowever, Gonzague also has recognized that his people may not be truly ready to lead themselves, for they have long languished under colonial rule and been forced to fall behind and become naive to the ins and outs of experienced statecraft. The Young General, however, has earned his experience firsthand in the fires of our revolution, and as such has earned the right to guide his fellow Congolese into their shared future more than any other man in this primordial jungle. \n\nThe Young General must his decision, and make it carefully, for his choice here shall cast the die for millions as he lays the foundations for the first independent state in the Congo in nearly a century."

Once held in prison by colonial officials within our own borders in Elisabethville, Kimbangu has since escaped and used his tremendous influence and mass of followers to topple the Force Publique’s control over the old colonial capital. Now, this Holy Man who thinks he is the Holy Spirit incarnate seeks to reach a new arrangement between our two parties so that both can continue existence in the newly forming Congo without resorting to bloodshed. Offering to allow the UMHK full access to the Congo’s new economy in exchange for implementing new worker’s protections and other pro-worker legislations, Kimbangu seeks to peacefully conjoin our two states so that he may focus on the larger issues at hand to the North. We could easily accept his proposal, for we would still make a fortune and then some in this new Congo he is creating, but we could also try our luck and gamble for it all by denying this madman.

Though many prominent politicians have been able to carve out a strong political base beneath the shadow of the MNC, like Kasa-Vubu or Bolikango, the MNC and its leader Isaac Kalonji loom over Congolese politics like a specter. Preaching nationalist and socialist rhetoric from across the spectrum, the MNC is a mixed bag, but all expect this monopoly of political power to win near any election for the foreseeable future. \n\nHowever, the Young General Gonzague, in his stipulations for stepping down and allowing elections to be organized, demanded that the Socialist elements of the MNC be banned and not allowed to run in the first elections for the Congo. Now, we are left with a dilemma; a daunting choice of choosing electoral fairness and true democracy to ring true, or to let the military get its way to ensure the security of the state. Many in the MNC are known radicals, and many fear that if they are not allowed to run in the coming elections at all, the Congo could be heading down the path of civil war once again. However, if the MNC is allowed to operate, the Congo may be subjecting itself to Socialist rule before even the first vote is cast. What shall be our final decision?"

Though the honorable Jean Bolikango tried to work towards a peaceful solution with his old friends that headed the MNC like Isaac Kalonji and Cyrille Adoula, the damage was already done, and so the Simbas under Kalonji have taken up arms against the government. \n\nNow, with the fate of Africa’s Darkest Heart now at stake, superstitious revolutionaries shall combat the professionally trained ANC, or Armée Nationale Congolaise, in a duel of fates with the very future of Africa’s largest former colony and the lives of millions of people hang in the balance."

Under his watch, our forces in the ANC beat back the vile colonials and mercenaries that beset us as we struggled for our sovereignty. With the victories achieved under his command, the very nation we now call home was birthed. \n\nHowever, the Young General’s regime now stands at a crossroads, for he has consolidated all he can without choosing a distinct path for the nation to take. Before Bobozo lies two distinct paths, influenced by his interests, experiences, and beliefs formulated over his brief but fiery military career. The most obvious path would be for the Young General to fully embrace his martial talents and deep ties within the ANC by transitioning the Congo into an Askari-led stratocratic meritocracy. In this Congolese State, the military and its leaders would be paramount within the nation as the Congo is further consumed by the might of the ANC and the Young General’s ambitions. \n\nAlternatively, Bobozo could take a different path entirely, pulling on his Pan-Afrikan and Nationalist sympathies he has begun to pick up, especially influenced by the likes of Marcus Garvey, George Padmore, François Duvalier, Stanley Mathenge, Nnamdi Azikiwe, and many other titans of the Pan-Afrikan movement. Drawing on the Congo’s storied and diverse past and rich, uniquely-African cultures, Bobozo hopes to forge a new and united Congolese identity while deeply instilling a newfound sense of African nationalism within every Congolese citizen - all of whom are loyal to him and their newly transformed and de-colonialized Congo. This radical leap has shown to be popular with many of the other young officers and veterans within the ANC, as well as many other politicians within the shackled Congolese parliament from a wide variety of political stances and backgrounds. Regardless of the Young Generals decision, the Congo will never be the same again, and the era of colonial influences is assuredly dead."

kivu.19.d:0 "With the upset elections in Kivu serving as the perfect excuse to lash out at his long-treasured prize, Moïse Tshombe has seized on the atmosphere of chaos and unrest, and now leads a newly sovereign breakaway state in the Congo’s southernmost province of Katanga. A region long choked by seperatist tensions, whether they be from Mwami agitators, CONAKAT politicians, or the goons of the UMHK, Katanga and its people now exist at the mercy of their new ‘President.’ Already has Tshombe pushed to consolidate his hold over the region, but as to how far he should go is now up for debate. \n\nThe young President must now decide how best to establish his ruling government, with two main options at his disposal. Tshombe could buckle to the whispers of his long-time partner and ally Godefroid Munongo and organize Katanga along more blatantly autocratic lines. Under this plan, Tshombe and Munongo shall push to fully consolidate power over every aspect of Katanga into the hands of Tshombe, who along with his staunch allies in the UMHK and in ‘Mad’ Mike Hoare, shall create a totalitarian state perfectly poised to generate nothing but profit for the parties involved. However, such a plan has two glaring flaws, in that doing so would only increase Munongo’s power, who circles Tshombe’s position like an envious vulture, while also increasing tensions between the ethnic groups and political factions within this wild frontier. \n\nTo alleviate these concerns, Tshombe and some of his less radical allies within Hoare’s mercenary group, the Mwami’s camp, and within the UMHK have all pooled resources and ideas to draft a plan for a parliamentary facade to protect this new Katanga state from unrest and criticism. By maintaining a token puppet legislature that tacitly listens to the wider concerns of the masses of Katanga could buy our new regime some much needed legitimacy while also holding the wolves like Munongo at bay. Regardless of Tshombe’s final decision, he shall still be the de-facto ruler over all of Katanga, and now only formalities and policy decisions keep him from raking in the mountains of profit and prestige his new venture shall finally give him and his allies."

However, many within our party find the idea of working with any European power so directly to be incredibly distasteful. If we were to follow their ideas, we could pursue our own destiny here in Africa, creating our own Socialst and uniquely African alliance.

However, despite all this death and destruction, we have held strong, fighting back mercenaries, colonials, business conglomerates, and the remnants for the Force Publique. With each win, our independence is slowly being assured, largely thanks to the infantile yet effective ANC and its charismatic leader, Louis de Gonzague Bobozo. \n\nYoung for someone in command of so much responsibility and with an entire nation’s destiny on his shoulders, the Young General - as he has become known to both his enemies who seek to mock his age and his allies who seek to emphasize how a man of his age commands with such success - is all that stands between us and destruction. Without him and the ANC, Kivu would surely collapse and fold back under colonial rule, dashing any hope at independence and freedom that we have. The nation watches our new national father in awe, and though we still have much of this war left to fight, we all believe in the Young General’s ability to bring true liberty and freedom to the Congo."

I stand before you now, not as your commanding officer and not as the national father of our nearly-born nation, but as a fellow child of the Congo on this eve of our final victory. Just miles away lies the last main pockets of resistance, populated by vile colonials who have spat on our customs, who have raped and murdered our families, who have set aflame our very cultures and identities in a cruel attempt to wipe out what truly makes our paradise unique and glorious. We must steel ourselves and wipe out the last of these parasites, for though the war shall soon be over, the fight for a perfect and free Congo shall not end. As our enemies fall, new ones shall rise as governments must be decided and as our path to our new future must be thoroughly planned. Together, as one people, we must bring peace and stability to our war-ravaged homes so that we may end this war and begin the hard labour of reconstruction and national creation, but together, as a new and united Congolese people, I know that we can do it...' \n\nThe Young General would continue for quite awhile longer, stirring up a frenzy among his men as they prepared for the final battle ahead. He would allow them to celebrate, drink, and be merry tonight, for tomorrow, this Hell would resume, until the job is done."

It is indeed far too early to establish a civil democracy in a country that has never known it in its history, the people not yet being ready. Instead, a stratocratic regime where martial law reigns permanently and where the primacy of the Askaris is well established is the best way to serve the people of the Congo, the entire political apparatus of the country and its wealth being controlled by the ANC. Thanks to its experience during the colonial period in military matters and its new skills in state-building obtained during the period of reconstruction following the war, the ANC led by Gonzague now ensure that the Congo will develop free of any European interference."

With Gonzague Bobozo’s decision to ignore his varied political influences, he has instead chosen to embrace his war-forged life and career, moving to establish a true stratocracy here in our paradise. The loyal Askari and ANC veterans that have served under the Young General have become the Congo’s new elite and ruling class, replacing the Évolués and colonials as the new masters of these lands. The military will come to control all aspects of government as the Young General rises as the sole head of authority in the nation. Beneath him, his loyal officers, veterans, and other military staff shall help him transform the Congo into a stable, regimented, and prosperous new state capable of defending itself from any threat, foreign or domestic, as the ANC and the government become one in the same. As such, the ANC shall be the main priority of the nation as well, for without it our Congo would collapse. Everything shall go to the ANC, and in return, the ANC shall give the Congo everything it needs to flourish. Corruption shall be stamped out at any turn and all citizens shall be taken care of by our army, for it is the ANC’s duty now to not only protect them from enemy combatants, but also from the regular tribulations of life. Under this populist stratocracy, democratic freedoms shall be curtailed, for they are just an illusion spread by silver-tongued and corrupt politicians, and as such will have no place in our new nation, for only the Young General and his ANC knows what is truly best for the Congo and her people."

A useful as it is dangerous idea, nationalism could very well prove to be the undoing of our new stratocracy should it be left unchecked and uncontrolled. Knowing this too well, the Young General Gonzague Bobozo has gone to great lengths to tie this new Congolese identity directly to the military, holding up the ANC as the champion of Congolese nationalism. Stripping away much of the dangerous ideas fueled by the many radical nationalists and socialists that still haunt the Congo’s darkest recesses, the Young General has gone to great lengths to defang and shackle this nationalist fervour for his own use and for the use of the state. Transforming what it means to be a Congolese nationalist, Gonzague Bobozo has slowly spread the idea that only through direct and total loyalty to the ANC and to the state can one be truly Congolese. Of course, this has been met with some pushback from the various radical cells across the Congo, these small guerilla groups shall be easily erased by the ever-growing might of the ANC, and soon loyalty to the military and patriotism shall become one in the same."

The size of the ANC has swelled considerably with new recruits signing up by the day, mainly because of the great incentives and protections being in the military now brings. Towns once left in smouldering shambles in the aftermath of our wars for independence have been rebuilt and made better thanks to the labours of our valued soldiers, who when not off fighting or defending our lands are instead put to work nurturing and rebuilding our primordial paradise. Our borders are protected day and night as our brave borderguard endlessly patrol the expanses of the Congo, rooting out separatists, criminals, mercenaries, and any other threat to our nation and our people. The ANC has come to dominate the nation in every aspect, both for better and for worse, creating a true soldier’s paradise here in the Congo - one that not only benefits the brave men of the ANC, but also every single Congolese soul in our new state. Though much uncertainty lies ahead, we have steeled ourselves to face any threat that comes at us, and we shall not falter as long as the Young General, our national father and hero, is here to guide us through."

kivu.25.t:0 "A Return to Authenticity"
kivu.25.d:0 "Seeking to remove all colonial, regional, and tribalist influences that have long hampered the creation of a unique and unified Congolese identity, Louis de Gonzague Bobozo has called for a ‘Retour à l’Authenticité’ to cleanse the Congo of its past sins. This ‘Authenticité’ drive is poised at creating a new nationalist, pan-Congolese identity to support the nation and serve as a bulwark against outside forces. \n\nTo this end, Gonzague Bobozo has begun to radically alter Congolese society to fit this new Africanized direction. Western-style suits and clothing are to be abandoned in favour of what he calls the ‘abascot’ - a simple, lightweight suit worn without a tie influenced by the wear of certain L-KMT officials the Young General has drawn influences from such as the infamous Dai Li, and taking its name from the French phrase ‘à bas le costume’, meaning down with the suit. City and place names across the Congo are to be ‘de-colonialized’, instead renamed to more suiting African names, such as Stanley Falls becoming Boyoma Falls, Leopoldville into Kinshasa, Katanga into Shaba, and so many more. The colonial churches have been banned from practice and Christian-derived names have been banned in favour of authentic ‘Nzereian’ names. Simple titles like Mister and Misses have been dropped, with all Congolese now forced to call each other ‘citoyen’ to do away with the colonial-imposed social hierarchy. Visiting dignitaries and send-off salutes using the 21-guns have been replaced by Congolese choirs and drumlines that herald the arrival of any new ally or the departure of any true hero of the Congo. The ‘Three Ns’ have become the new motto of this movement - each standing for Nzere, as in Nzere the nation, Nzere our river, and Nzere our new national currency coined by the state to do away with colonial currencies and barter systems. \n\nThe Young General has defended these radical actions as a painful necessity to rid ourselves of the past divisions that split our people apart, citing that ‘in our African tradition there are never two chiefs. That is why we Congolese, in the desire to conform to the traditions of our continent, have resolved to group all the energies of the citizens of our country under the banner of a single national movement.’ Though this ‘Return to Authenticity’ has been met with mixed receptions and mixed results, nothing can stop it now, for Nzere has risen under the Young General, and there's no going back, for the Congo must be free of all non-Congolese taint."

However, the corruption of African culture is much more deeply rooted in the heart of Africa, not only in the colonies, but also in the so-called free countries that continue to live in the European way, rejecting their African heritage. Not in Nzere, formerly named Congo by the colonizers, thanks to the valiant efforts of Gonzague Sese Seko and his program of Retour à l’Authenticité all traces of European influence will be erased forever with numerous measures such as the Africanization of names, whether of people or cities, the banning of the wearing of the suit and tie replaced by the abacost and a purely African economy fed by great programs of nationalization and the numerous wealth of the country, although some whisper that Gonzague took advantage of it to enrich his already colossal personal fortune.

Forcing his cabinet and all those close to him to do the same, our national father shall soon be adorned with his new Nzereian name, showing the nation and the wider world that the old colonial order is fully and finally dead. With the names of cities, towns, neighborhoods, natural formations, and anything else being renamed, it was now time for the Young General to take his new name as well, for if he did not commit to his new policies, no one would. Taking a name from Ngbandi legend, Louis de Gonzague Bobozo is no more, for our leader sheds this Christian-influenced name for something far more authentic and pure. Translating as ‘Gonzague the all-powerful warrior, who because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake’, the name Louis has been shed for his new name - Gonzague Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga! With the ceremony continuing after his new name had been declared, each member of Gonzague’s cabinet were persuaded to take new names as well, each shedding their colonial names in favor for something far more Congolese. With the ceremony finishing, the newly christened Sese Seko announced to the nation over radio broadcasts that all within the Congo must soon do the same, for the influence of colonialism must be eradicated for the good of all Congolese."

Instead, only the Catholic Church in Congo, the Orthodox Church of the Congo, the Church of Christ in Congo, and - Sese Seko’s personal favorite - the Kimbanguist Church shall be allowed to operate. Native Congolese religions and spiritual forms have been allowed to stay in practice, but Sese Seko’s regime has pushed heavily for the practitioners of these faiths to join the Kimbanguist Church instead, for its syncretic mix of African religions and Christian doctrine has enamored the Young General, who has grown to be a close friend of Papa Kimbangu himself as well as his three sons. All other churches within the Congo are to be suppressed, slowly strangled and choked out until only the four accepted faiths remain. Under Gonzague’s watch, not even faith in God shall rise above his influence and power, for the Lord is not in command of the Congo - Gonzague Sese Seko is."

The first form, championed by the likes of Kwame Nkrumah, George Padmore, and others calls for complete political unity between African states as quickly as possible, creating a cohesive Pan-Afrikan identity. In direct opposition to this is the type of Pan-Africanism preached by Nnmadi Azikiwe, Marcus Garvey, and other prominent nationalists. These thinkers instead call for a looser union, primarily economic in form that would still allow individual African national identities to exist and flourish, with political unity being a far off goal that likely may never come. It is this second camp that Sese Seko Gonzague finds himself more in-tune with, and to this end, has created the Organisation de l'Unité Africaine. This new Organization of African Unity seeks to function as a Pan-Afrikan military and economic alliance, forming a unified front against any outside influences or aggressors. Inviting nearly every post-colonial state in Africa, Gonzague Sese Seko hopes to not only be the national father of the Congo, but the supra-national father of Africa as a whole, serving as its new champion against colonial and Western influences. \n\nTo formalize this new organization, Gonzague has invited his favorite ideological thinkers and African leaders, including Azikiwe, Duvalier, Mathenge, Kimathi, Nkrumah, Padmore, and so many more to Kinshasa to hammer out a new arrangement that would benefit all children of Africa without wiping away what makes each of us and our peoples unique."

Loyal squads of the ANC patrol the Congo endlessly, looking through its great cities and pristine jungles in search for pockets of colonial remnants or holdouts from the democratic clique that once tried to seize power from our national father. Among the already captured and executed have been the likes of Moïse Tshombe, Daniel Kanza, and Isaac Kalonji - all traitors or colonial sycophants in their own right - as well as famed colonial villains such as Émille Janssens and Pierre Ryckmans. Others have been far more lucky, or shown mercy if they were not specific perpetrators of colonial oppression, with these souls being allowed to leave our nation in peace, forever exiled from our primordial paradise. Our new Congo, our new Nzere, is for the Congolese only, and Africa is only for Africans.

However, despite his many influences, Gonzague seems himself as above ideology as an idea, reviling the notion that any one man can follow any one ideology or doctrine to the exact letter. Instead, Gonzague has taken influences and policy ideas from each and every one of his idols, from Nkrumah and Azikiwe to Chiang Kai-Shek and Georges Sorel. With this great fluidity has come great prosperity to our nation, as pragmatic choices in what policies best improve the life of our citizens are always made over the blind dogma seen in so many idealogues. However, a certain path must be emphasized to give Nzere a clear and defined direction and goal, especially should anything happen to our national father and we be left without his guidance. Before Gonzague Sese Seko and Nzere as a whole lies two paths. He could either fully double-down on Congolese and African nationalism, forging Nzere into the very embodiment of ‘African-ness’, at the cost of putting the needs of the ANC and the state above the needs of the people. Alternatively, nationalism could take a still prominent but secondary seat to the goals of populism, furthering Nzere’s path as a caretaker state that puts the needs of its people - all of its people - before the needs of Gonzague or his beloved ANC. Regardless of his choice, Nzere shall remain a beacon of Pan-African thought to the wider world, standing as the prime example of a post-colonial state finally free of Western influence."

However, despite this fancy living, Gonzague is far from the standard dictator who uses national funds only for his own gain. \n\nThe palace he constructed also doubles as a shelter for the downtrodden, poor, and beaten of the Congo who have nowhere else to go, with the palace holding hundreds of homeless men and battered women at any one time, giving them around-the-clock care and support as they try to get their lives back on track. Corruption, once so rife and widespread in both the Vrijstaat and Kivu, now has been nearly eradicated over fear of death at the hands of the ANC, for stealing funds meant for the Congolese people has become a capital crime. Poverty levels across the Congo have been lowered to historic levels, with Gonzague using his fleet of lavish vehicles to run supplies and aid workers across the nation when he isn’t using them to enjoy his newfound prestige and power. Though he may be a dictator in the eyes of many outside our paradise, all within Nzere know the truth - Gonzague Sese Seko is the hero of the Congo, our national father, and our greatest leader. No one cares for the people of our nation like he does, and under his rule, the people of the Congo have never been taken care of better or more thoroughly. Needs and wants are a thing of the past, for there is enough to go around under Sese Seko. Without him, we would surely perish under the weight of self-rule, or fall prey to colonialism once more."

Although the president praises the positive effects of his policies, such as the rapid industrialization, westernization and modernization that the country is experiencing, these changes are hardly visible in the daily life of the average Congolese worker, and many do not see any difference between this new life and the one under the colonial administration, many fought for the Kivu Clique during the war and wonder today what good it did. There is still no Congolese middle class, only an oligarchic ruling caste composed of Evolués and European exploiters who represent only a minority of the population, the rest serving only as laborers for wealthy industrialists, taking advantage of Congolese wealth without any opposition from the president who invites them to continue and even to intensify their activities.

kivu.60.d:0 "The Simba Revolt has torn at the fabric of our infantile democracy for far too long, and with the failures of the nascent republican government on full display, it was obvious to most within the Congo that a change in leadership was needed to crush these vile Red Lions. Taking matters into his own hands, the Young General Louis de Gonzague Bobozo marched on the capital with a mass of his own loyal ANC troops, toppling the ineffectual democratic regime and seizing the power of the executive for himself. With this sudden powershift, our government has been thrown into disarray, but our military has never been more emboldened. Taking this dramatic shift with gusto, the loyal men of the ANC have resolved themselves under the Young General to rush these Simba revolutionaries once and for all!"

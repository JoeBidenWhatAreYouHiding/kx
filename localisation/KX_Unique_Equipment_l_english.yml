jezail_equipment_0_desc:0 "Jezails are generally handmade weapons, and are consequently widely varied in their construction. Jezails are seen as very personal weapons, and unlike most military weapons which are plain and utilitarian, jezails tend to be well-crafted and intricately decorated. The jezail is a muzzle-loading long arm that typically has a smooth bore and its firing mechanism is usually either a matchlock or a flintlock. The Jezail is an archaic weapon in this day and age."

railguns_0_desc:0 "Based on experimental and prototype designs stolen from Louis Octave Fauchon-Villeplee, A. L. Korol’kov, and the Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte, these state-of-the-art artillery pieces utilize electromagnetic propulsion via a pair of charged parallel bus bars that connect to the wings of the launching projectile, creating a new form of weaponry that relies not on the chemical energy of gunpowder, but the electrical energy of the modern age. Requiring ludicrous amounts of power and being highly immobile due to relying on mass towing or railroad to move, they can only be powered by our biggest hydroelectric dams and experimental nuclear reactors, but what they lack in reliability and mobility is more than compensated for in their raw destructive potential."

From autogyros, gyroplanes, and gyrocopters like those designed by Juan de la Cierva, Raúl Pateras Pescara, and Harold Pitcairn, to more modern true helicopters designed by the likes of Engelbert Zaschka and Igor Sikorsky, these new VTOL aircraft will allow us to operate in airspaces once thought far too cramped and hazardous for traditional aeronautical infrastructure. Multipurpose in nature, designed to aid in a variety of applications from recon and transport to bombing and ground support, these new helicopters will bring our military to new heights!."

REDAlaska.1.t:0 "A White Devil snakes through the grass"
REDAlaska.1.d:0 "Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner stood at the podium, orating a fiery and impassioned speech to a massive crowd of his followers and countrymen. The great chief talked of the dangers of our foes, the White Man, and of our destiny to reach out into the world and save our downtrodden brethren across this continent. As Towner carried on, his voice growing more bombastic and unwavering as the speech continued, a venomous snake began to sneak through the crowd. This treacherous serpent was one of the White Men to survive a recent raid on the White settlement in what was once Nome, and he had come to this great gathering for blood. As this daemon stalked the crowd, drawing ever closer to the podium at which Chief Towner stood, he began to reach inside his jacket, preparing himself for his dark deed. Chief Towner was mid sentence when a thunderous crack sounded; the White Devil had pulled a gun and fired a shot at our dear leader! Before he could fire off another, the fool was mobbed by the crowd, who began to beat the man mercilessly with anything they could find, bringing swift justice to this attempted-murderer. While this commotion continued, aides and guards rushed to the Chief, fearing the worst for the great unifier of the First Peoples. Among these guards rushing the stage was none other than Thomas ‘New Moon’ Dixon, paramilitary leader and Towner’s closest confidant. As the crowd finished their mob justice and looked back towards the stage, they waited with baited breath to see the outcome of this horrific turn of events..."

REDAlaska.2.t:0 "The Great Chief of the New Moon"
REDAlaska.2.d:0 "Thomas Dixon, now Chief New Moon, was one of the late Chief Red Clouds’ closest compatriots and fiercest allies. A member of the Cherokee tribe by partial bloodline, Thomas Dixon came to Beringia like so many others of his fellow Indian, fleeing the fires of the Second American Civil War. Upon his arrival, he integrated into Towner’s administration, proving himself to be a fiery orator and tactfully-minded politician with a fanatical dedication to the Townerite cause. He served Chief Red Cloud valiantly as a leader of the various paramilitary groups that fought to exterminate the White Man, with his time in combat further radicalizing his views. When not waging war, the zealous man would spend hours reading old political theory of strange and esoteric ideologies from throughout history and of the myths of the First Peoples’ ancestors, fueling his spiral away from the Townerite way of thought into his own weird blend of Native mythologies and populist, race-based agenda. This blend of weird interests and influences would synthesize themselves into New Moon’s unique, home brewed ideology and helped him catapult himself to the center of the late Chief Towner’s inner-circle, despite their heterodoxical differences in much of their ideological schools of thought. Though both men agreed on much, such as the expulsion and punishment of the White Men and the upliftment of the Red Race, the two men also held numerous differences in opinion on how these should be carried out. New Moon, with his influences from the Mau-Mau in Kenya and of the oral tradition of his people shining bright, felt that not under nationalist furor but under the red light of Totalist thought would our great people march into the future. Now that the great Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner has been slain, and New Moon now rules, he can finally make his dreams a reality. Under his command, Beringia will be transformed into a new Red Man’s state, one not just Red in race, but Red in ideals and ideology as well. Only Totalism, only Chief New Moon can lead the Red Man to greatness!"
REDAlaska.2.a:0 "He shall blaze a new path for the Red Man, under the red light of Totalism"

REDAlaska.3.t:0 "The Moon’s Warrior Bands" 
REDAlaska.3.d:0 "With his ascension to Chief of Beringia, Chief Thomas ‘New Moon’ Dixon has moved to make his various paramilitary groups into official arms of the state. These Braves now act as extensions of Chief New Moon’s own will, carrying out his orders across Beringia and deep into enemy territory. Giving them an open-mark on how to achieve his own goals, his now fully state-backed militias and warrior parties stalk the wilds of Beringia and the suburbs of the decadent white settlements, handing out justice as they see fit. Chief New Moon knows that the only way that we will ever be free of the White Man’s influence is to be fully free of the White Man themselves, and the easy way to free ourselves from these beasts is with blood."
REDAlaska.3.a:0 "These Red-blooded braves do our nation and peoples proud"

REDAlaska.4.t:0 "Red Man’s Internationale"
REDAlaska.4.d:0 "Chief Thomas ‘New Moon’ Dixon has called a meeting in Dzántik'i Héeni, or what was once Juneau, to congregate with his fellow Totalist natives from across the New World. Among the most prominent of  the groups to make an appearance were the Totalist Peruvians, who claim to be descended from the great Inca, as well as various smaller groups from Hawai’i, the Yucatan, and Patagonia, among others. This great Pow-Wow of true Red Men has allowed us to foster close ties with these familiar and similar movements across this great continent as we all seek to cast off the yoke of the imperialist dogs. Though the meeting contained little substance and was mostly for show, it has still cemented our legitimacy as a true Totalist state in the world, greatly improving our international legitimacy."
REDAlaska.4.a:0 "We have held our own opulent meeting, proving to other "reds" of the world that we too are dedicated to the Totalist cause"

REDAlaska.5.t:0 "Amerindian Totalism"
REDAlaska.5.d:0 "The specific blend of "leftist" thought Chief Thomas ‘New Moon’ Dixon adheres to is one entirely of his own making, very much similar to the infamous Mzee Hussein Obama of the Mau-Mau. Formed in neither classrooms nor governmental halls, but instead forged inside the Red, beating heart of the Red Race itself and the struggles it must bear along the road of life. New Moon’s Totalism is not about economics or political debate; it is instead the ultimate and climactic build up of centuries worth of oppression and abuse, neglect and disgrace that the First People’s have been forced to feel without remorse nor reprieve. It is the manifestation of the sheer, overwhelming anger that comes with 400 years of being under the boot or on the run from the White Devils that stole the lands of our kin and slaughtered our families without second thought. Racially-motivated Totalism taken to the extreme, it offers utopia, pure and simply in all its bliss, for all those of the Red Race while promising nothing but merciless retribution for all those that share the genetic stock of the ones who have sought to crush us at every turn: the White Man who infest our great continent. Chief Thomas ‘New Moon’ Dixon is the Blood Moon that will soon rise across these lands, bathing it in the blood of our enemies and the light of Totalism."

REDAlaska.7.t:0 "The Marks of a True Warrior"
REDAlaska.7.d:0 "The young warrior stalked through the dense conifer-brush, bow in hand, looking for his prey. Out on a hunting trip for his local village, the boy was tracking the trail a large buck had left behind when a crack of a twig snapping under footfall caught his attention. Instantly dropping low into the brush, the keen-eyed hunter narrowed his vision towards the source of the noise. From across the clearing, a disheveled Canadian soldier emerged from the treeline, clearly lost as he strained to look at his map in the pale light of this early dawn. Stowing his bow, the young Red-blooded hunter drew his tomahawk, hoping to complete the necessary feat for becoming a man in the eyes of the Beringian culture. As the Canuck waltzed past him, completely unaware of his presence, the young hunter waiting on held breath for the perfect moment to strike. As the lost soldier stopped to take a sip from his canteen, an ear-piercing warcry froze him in fear as the native boy lept towards him, hatchet in hand. In a flurry of blood and gore, the soldier’s scalp was severed from his skull as he cried out in horror and agony. His attacker let out one last shrill cry before running off into the wilds, scalp in hand, as the lost warrior collapsed to the ground as he passed out from the pain. Hours later, the native boy had returned to his village, hefting his trophy high above his head. His kin and fellow villagers flocked to him as they congratulated him on his deed as the village chief began to perform the rites of manhood upon the brave hunter. He was now a man in the eyes of the Red Man."

REDAlaska.9.t:0 "The Great Raid"
REDAlaska.9.d:0 "We have spent months preparing for this final fight; this final great raid into the heart of the White Man’s den. We move to strike the black heart of these imperialist dogs, to remove them once and for all from our sacred continent! Stealing and siphoning arms from international shipping lanes, buying black market weapons of war from famous gun-runners like the Senussi or the Indochinese, and even accepting the aid from our Totalist "brothers" overseas, we have fully prepared our troops for the coming storm. The drums of war shall beat one last time across the great state of Beringia as we move to annihilate these pestilent insects and remove them from our ancestral lands! We shall avenge the dead, the downtrodden, the forgotten. We shall seek retribution for all those of Red skin and Red blood who have shamelessly had their lives stolen from them by these White Devils. We will march into their opulent city on the hill and cut each and every one of them down for daring to ever raise arms against our creed. We shall be victorious like our ancestors at the Battle of Little Bighorn, and avenge the losses of our heroes such as Tecumseh or Chief Red Cloud. The time of reckoning is upon us, the time of Custer’s Nightmare!"
REDAlaska.9.a:0 "We march into the den of the beast, and we shall not return until our final task is finished. We will have our revenge!"

We have returned to the ways of old, fusing them with our new modern ideals for the betterment of the Red Race. The Red Man has never seen such jubilation and happiness since the first white-capped ships landed on our eastern shores all those years ago.

Massive fortifications and walls have been erected to keep the savages out as the remaining White invaders devolve farther and farther into animalistic behavior, becoming the very savages they claim us to be. Our brave soldiers patrol the perimeter, putting any White Dog down as they see fit, with frequent raiding parties being launched into the wilds to strip these former-imperialists of what little dignity and supplies they have left. We are not the White Man; we will not feign the possibility of civilizing these beasts. They are animals and monsters, and nothing more, and they will be treated as such. Inside our walls lies heaven, a new promised land for the Red Race, and for the Red Race only. Outside these walls are none of our concern. They exist now only to serve or amuse us, the true inheritors of this great Khéya Wíta."

REDAlaska.6.t:0 "The Killing Fields"
REDAlaska.6.d:0 "Many hopeful families took advantage of Chief New Moon’s generous homesteading act. Of these brave families, the Walks-With-Horses family would not be as lucky as many of their fellow farmers. The family was given a 20-acre plot on the outskirts of Tanan, or what was once Fairbanks in the White Man’s tongue. The young family worked the land tirelessly for months, tilling the fertile soil and sowing the seeds of both the crops and their futures in the unusually fecund fields. During the wet months, after weeks of harsh rains and hailstorms barraged the topsoil, the fields had become muddy and eroded. During one of the brief reliefs in the stormy weather, the youngest son of this bright-eyed family was out playing in the fields of lettuce and beetroots. As he frolicked in ignorant glee, he suddenly tripped over an odd protuberance jutting from the muck. The boy’s eyes locked on the cause of his fall, looking on in horror as he screamed at the severed, desiccated human arm that was sticking from the soil. Crying out in fear, his parents rushed to the scene, taking in the horrific sight as they approached their whimpering child. At once, the father ran to the phone to call the local administration to report this horrific sight, and within the hour, six armed men dressed in black rode in on black mustangs. As the men dismounted their beasts, two of the them worked to reburry the detached limb, while three others scoured the fields for any sign of other *fertilizers* threatening to break through the top-soil. While the underlings worked, the sixth man sat down with the family behind closed doors, ensuring that the bewildered civilians would not speak a word of this to anyone. The lead official paid them off with a large sum and added a few additional acres to their property on the deed as compensation for their ordeal. The terrified family were made to understand that this was the only good use for the White Man, and with it, their futures would be secure, but only if they kept their mouths shut..."

REDAlaska.101.t:0 "An iron fist, or a steel boot?"
REDAlaska.101.d:0 "The banner of Beringia flies high across the True North and beyond, from Kikhtak to Shawmut, as the hallowed lands of our slain ancestors have been restored to the hands of the Red Man. As we integrate the lands once stolen by the White Devils back into the embrace of the First People’s, we must decide what to do with the millions of Whites that plague our lands. We could simply subjugate these people to our rule, creating a caste-based system in which the White Man lives as second-class citizens to the true and pure Red Race. In this system, the Whites would be subjected to restrictive policies such as harsher policing, higher taxes, a ban from government aid and special programs such as the homesteading system, as well as a myriad of other penalties. Drawing the most ire are the new bans on race-mixing and the removal of the White Man’s ability to vote. Though some in our camp see this as overly harsh, they are a small minority, and it pales in comparison to the alternative the hardliners are calling for. On top of the restrictive race-based caste system, which harkens back to the European colonial race-based caste systems such as the sistema de casta of New Spain, these zealots wish to fully revive the reservation system of Canada and the United States, this time reversing it and imprisoning the White Man on small parcels of land while the Red Man roams free. Under oppressive, biased laws and policies designed to oppress them at every turn, the White Man would also be seperated, being forced into reservations in or near their largest cities while others would be shipped far into the unclaimed wildernesses or frozen wastelands that not even the First People call home. As we divide and conquer this inferior race, they too will finally feel the pain of being ripped from their land and forced to live as prisoners for life, stripped of all dignity and respect. To ease tensions between their vile races, we would grant both the Anglos and French their own separate reservations, under our ever-vigilant watch of course. Whatever Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner decides, the spirit of these White Dogs will be crushed regardless."

With this new system, the Europeans have been forced into predetermined parcels of land across their designated regions. Their administrations merely deal with local issues and are entirely integrated and subservient to the Beringian government. In these reservations, the White Man is forced to live under destitute conditions with a meager sense of autonomy and freedom, finally feeling the sting of shame and indignity that comes with reservation life. They will work and live in squalor, with their children being ‘saved’ by our teachers to learn the ways of the Red Man at our newly established Native American Residential Schools. Their old lands of leisure and public relaxation shall be stripped away from them, and their old homes will be demolished or renovated for our uses. We will erase their identity and culture from every inch of this land as they once tried to our ancestors and our peoples. The last vestiges of their dying society will remain on their small allotments and plots, and there it will slowly corrupt and die as the renaissance of the Red Man dawns just outside their walls."

A proud and noble people, the Haudenosaunee have fared far better in the face of the imperialists crusade than most other native groups. This has led to them having a large population and a strong, cohesive culture and language. To alleviate the possibility of future tensions of trying to integrate them directly into the Confederation under the sole flag of Beringia, Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner has wisely decided to grant the Haudenosaunee considerable autonomy within the Confederation, allowing them to have a strong local government, direct control of their own armed forces, and the allowance to keep their current language while also being forced to accept the new Beringian native-blend tongue as a co-primary language. With these incentives, Towner hopes to have avoided any possible confrontation with the Six Nations, but their British-ties still hold strong from the era of the Revolution and the Thirteen Colonies, and some in our cabinet fear that this anglophilia may be a source of future tensions. Despite these fears, people across our great state celebrate as the Iroquois Confederacy rises once more as a constituent, yet sovereign and proud nation once more!"

After crushing lapdogs in New England and their masters in Ottawa, the flag of Beringia now flies triumphantly over these lands which long laid in the greedy grasp of the White Man. Now restored to its rightful owners, Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner has moved to return the land and ingeniously decided to grant considerable autonomy to the Wabanaki and their sister tribes of the Northeast of the Atlantic Coast. After taking into account their unified language system, strong culture, and history of nation-building and statecraft, our brave leader came to the conclusion the trying to assimilate the Eastern and Western Algonquins would not only be far too difficult to be worth it, but also an affront to their culture and a bastardization of what Beringia stands for itself. To decimate a culture that has weathered the abrasive storm of the White Man’s  imperialism would fly in the face of our very founding mission. Instead, Chief Towner has declared that the Wabanaki Confederacy, historic union of the Mi’kmaq and their related tribes, shall rise again as a subservient, yet highly autonomous state under the wider Beringian Confederation. The Dawnland shall rise again Maine to Nova Scotia, promoting both the new Beringian language and the traditional language of Wabanaki, as the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaqaudoy, Penobscot, Pennacook, Abenaki, Sokoki, and Missisquoi once again feel the pride of self-determination. Free to raise their own armies and pursue their own foreign policy, the Wabanaki now bask in the prideful glow of redemption and sovereignty and look forward to a glorious future. Despite the joyous occasion, some in our administration still whisper and bemoan about their worries on this move. These critics note that the People of the Dawn not only hold strong pro-german ties, but also harbor many religious zealots that proselytize a strange fusion of native spiritualism and French-aligned Catholicism. Our administration should keep an eye on these radicals and European sympathizers if we hope to maintain order in our new state. We mustn’t let the White Devils infect us from within."

The young Duke-to-be was raised in London before being ferried to the New World during the fires of the British Revolution while he was still too young to grasp the gravity of the chaos that had transpired around him. Growing up with the Exiles in Canada, Alastair's life grew more miserable and dark as the post-Weltkrieg era dragged on. With the rise of Elwood Towner and the destruction of the Canadian government of days now long passed, Alastair found himself kidnapped in one of the Red Man’s raids. Recognizing their prize, the indigenous administration decided to keep the young noble under house-arrest, hoping to find a use for him one day fitting of his station. With the creation of the White Man Reservations, Chief Towner found the perfect place for Alastair: as the face of the Anglophone administration in the Huron peninsula. A prisoner to the Red Man in all but name, the disgraced noble now serves as a figurehead and unifying figure of the Anglos of the Beringia, stripped of his birthright and royal titles, epitomizing the White Man’s humiliation at the hands of the Red Man"

Now, centuries later, this previously defunct ruling body now stands once more, dusting off the cobwebs of history as it steps into the light of the modern day. First established under King Louis XIV in 1663, the council was once the preeminent authority in New France, and with Chief Towner’s new reservation system, it has returned to this position of existence and prominence once more. However, the counsel now limps by as a shadow of its former self under the thumb of the Red Man as the French of Quebec feel the oppression they once wrought upon the First Peoples. Though it tries to hearken back to a time of glory, the current situation could not be further from that ideal and the Conseil Souverain is merely a puppet institution under the Native Americans; their only purpose is to keep the French Canadians under control and on their leash."

Born in 1848, the now haggard and elderly Sir Alonzo C. Mather has found himself as the head of the new White Man Reservation centered around the old city of Boston, now known by its indignous name of Chickatawbut, primarily being chosen for the role given his stature as a successful businessman in the region and his hereditary ties to the great Purtian Cotton Mathers. Merely a puppet ruler under Elwood Towner to quell the White Man’s pleas for self-determination, Sir Alonzo Mather spends most of his time retired to his study. In his few mandated interactions with the public, Sir Mather has even been forced to masquerade as a Puritan zealot like his ancestors in a desperate attempt from Towner and the AIF to pander to the few remaining New Englanders willing to listen to the Red Man and their policies. Aside from that, the decrepit old ghost leaves the day-to-day administration of the United Colonies to his underlings while he slips further into the ignorant bliss of old age."

Radicalizing over time away from Towner following the creation of Beringia due to his interest in Totalist views and esoteric mythologies, Dixon’s ideas evolved away from Towner’s Native nationalism and towards a more ethnically-based Totalist wave, drawing influence heavily from Mzee Obama of the Mau-Mau. New Moon only seeks one thing: the total expulsion or subjugation of all White Devils in the New World so that the Red Man may finally have peace, and he will usher in this new age as the ‘Red Moon’ of the Red Race."

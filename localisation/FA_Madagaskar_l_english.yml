POLITICS_HEYDRICH_MAG_DESC:0 "Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich was born into an illustrious and high-profile life from the start. Born in 1904 in Halle an der Salle, his father was famous composer Richard Bruno Heydrich, founder of the Halle Conservatory for Music. Due to his socialite parents and substantial wealth, Heydrich got used to high ambitions at a young age. He excelled at fencing, the sciences, and swimming as a young man, forming his love for learning and athletic pursuits. This along with his father’s deep nationalistic leanings greatly influenced the young Heydrich to pursue a career in the military of the Kaiserreich. Joining the Navy in 1922, he was a cadet at Germany's largest port in Kiel, and once reaching high enough station, he was shipped to the Afrikan colonies to further his career. Honing his skill hunting down pirate fleets and maintaining order in unruly German holdings, Heydrich would eventually earn the rank of Admiral, particularly showing gallantry in the wake of the collapse of the British Empire as the Kaiserreich seized British Africa. Now, after over a decade of sound service, Heydrich has been given reign over the colony of Madagaskar in order to transform it into the center for the Imperial German Navy in the region. Nicknamed ‘The Beast’ by the local Malagasy and French populations, Heydrich’s grand ambition is to see his greatest project come true. Under his steely gaze and iron clad rule, the island colony shall be transformed into a floating naval fortress of the Kaiserliche Marine, projecting the Kaiser’s will far out into the Indian and Southern Oceans. His ambition knows no limits, but he must temper himself lest he fly too close to the sun..."
POLITICS_MAURICE_DESC:0 "How does someone like Emil Maurice end up in control of somewhere such as Madagascar? Born in the winter of 1879 in Westermoor, Emil's early life was uneventful and up until recently, that had been the case for most of his life, that was until he decided to emigrate to Madagascar. Emil's reasons for emigrating were not because he was persecuted despite his mixed German-Jewish Ancestry, but because he wanted a change, he wanted to see the world and he thought his best chance was to board a ship heading straight for a tropical island. Though Maurice was supposed to spend the rest of his days lounging about on Madagascar's sunny beaches and continue his Watchmaking hobby, fate would not see this through. As Maurice set foot on those docks, it just so happened that Reinhard Heydrich set his eyes upon him and decided to strike up a conversation. Heydrich was quick to assume that this unassuming and modest man was seeking Asylum, which Maurice didn't get the chance to deny. The two quickly became friends on that dock and Heydrich offered a job to Maurice as his personal chauffeur, which he accepted reluctantly due to Heydrich constantly pestering him to accept. The more time they spent together made them grow closer as friends and things seemed to finally calm down for Maurice, that was until Heydrich left Madagascar. After a long series of events, Emil Maurice became the leader of Madagascar, despite reluctantly wanting the position, he has proven himself to be a competent statesman. The people of Madagascar hope that his happy-go-lucky attitude is a sign of more stable times on the horizon, but that remains to be seen."

Maurice became one of the island’s highest-ranking figures despite his utter inexperience in leadership and governance. This, of course, was intentional as Heydrich needed a useful idiot to run the colony’s bureaucracy while not knowing or caring about the dark truths under him. The Nightmare of Mittelafrika’s collapse, the chaos in the government, and the revelation of Heydrich’s horror show all took a significant toll on the once jolly Maurice, who now vows to bring justice to those who died under Heydrich’s regime, even if he has to march into Dar Es-Salaam and take out Heydrich’s fat friend too.

MAG_themodelcolony:0 "A Paradise on the Surface"
MAG_themodelcolony_desc:0 "Madagaskar has existed as a model colony for some years. Admiral Heydrich has successfully pacified the Island and turned it into the hub of the German Navy in Afrika, at a great cost. As long as Heydrich is here, the colony is bound to be stable."
MAG_thegeneralgouverneurdeparts:0 "The General-Gouverneur Departs"
MAG_thegeneralgouverneurdeparts_desc:0 "The fall of the Mark has led to the Colony falling into chaos. Unwilling to deal with the mess that Mittelafrika's Collapse has caused, Heydrich has departed from command in Madagaskar. With Heydrich gone, command of Madagaskar is expected to be taken over by Emil Maurice."
MAG_thefuturefrozen:0 "Our Future Frozen"
MAG_thefuturefrozen_desc:0 "Maurice was never supposed to lead the Colony, he was nothing but a lone chauffeur... But fate has propelled this unremarkable man into Madagaskar’s highest position. If the stress of leading the colony in the face of Mittelafrika’s collapse wasn’t enough, Maurice has just learned the true scale of his predecessor’s horrific atrocities. Madagascar’s future now lies in the hand of one man who wants nothing to do with the nightmare he finds himself in, and as of now Madagascar’s future lies utterly frozen."


MAG_thesolutionofaron:0 "Schrameck's Stabilization"
MAG_thesolutionofaron_desc:0 "The collapse of order in the colony has led to Abraham Schrameck, the former governor of Madagascar under the French Republic, taking power in the absence of a strong leader. While not a Zionist or a Territorialist, Schrameck is of Jewish origin and has had to defend himself against attacks from the nationalist parts of the French administration and even Charles Maurras, leader of AF himself. With the absence of any other responsible government, again-governor Schrameck shall set out on a mission to gather the settlers to establish a safe homeland in Madagaskar."

MAG_unitethesettlers:0 "Unite the Settlers"
MAG_unitethesettlers_desc:0 "Ever since Jews began emigrating to Madagascar, the Settlers have been disunited, with no central unity between the Jews of this island. It is time to unite the Settlers, with them united the Jews that fled to Madagascar will never face oppression again."

MAG_theauspiceofrabearivelo:0 "Rabearivelo's Auspice"
MAG_theauspiceofrabearivelo_desc:0 "Maurice’s final mistake was doing nothing to prevent the collapse of the Colony, with him and the Germans gone, the natives of the Island rule Madagascar once more besides the French."
MAG_unitethenatives:0 "Unite the Natives"
MAG_unitethenatives_desc:0 "We can no longer afford to be divided; the Natives of this island must be united to face off against any outside threats. It is time to put aside petty squabbles, Madagascar will be united once more."
MAG_makecontactsinalgiers:0 "Make Contacts in Algiers"

MAG_thepanicofmaurice:0 "Maurice’s Panic"
MAG_thepanicofmaurice_desc:0 "Emil Maurice is many things, a watchmaker, a chauffeur, a former friend of the infamous Reinhard Heydrich. What he never has been was a leader; until now. With a new resolve born out of revelation of his old boss’s crimes, Emile Maurice has vowed to make the Blonde Beast pay for his crimes, bring his cadre of criminal loyalists to justice, and do right by the men and women who perished under Heydrich’s Regime, and Maurice’s watch."
MAG_oheydrichwhereartthou:0 "Heydrich Where Art Thou!"
MAG_oheydrichwhereartthou_desc:0 " While Heydrich hides behind his fat friend, many within Maurice's inner circle propose a way to make Heydrich pay for his crimes in advance, before our armies venture into the Heart of Darkness. A quick assassination, while less than what this monster deserves, will make sure that the Blonde Beast's life ends in agony. May this Butcher meet his maker, and may the dead finally have justice for Heydrich's horrific deeds. All we need to do is find the bastard..."
MAG_unitetheschutztruppen:0 "Unite the Schutztruppen"
MAG_unitetheschutztruppen_desc:0 "With Heydrich gone, the Schutztruppen has begun to fall apart. Different splinter factions are emerging, each disloyal to Governor Maurice. If we are to make it out of this crisis intact, we must unite the Schutztruppen."
MAG_approachallparties:0 "Approach All Parties"
MAG_approachallparties_desc:0 "Even though Maurice has taken his position as leader with more stride than he did when he was first thrust into the position, he still isn’t eager to lead Madagascar through the turmoil that will inevitably follow once Heydrich has been brought to justice. To remedy this, Maurice has set up a commission to decide the fate of the Island once Maurice has finished his mission, and all parties, from Monarchists, to Settlers to Socialists to the French are invited to participate."

MAG_thestrengthofdelarocque:0 "Cayla's Strength"
MAG_thestrengthofdelarocque_desc:0 "With Heydrich in Mittelafrika and Maurice gone, Cayla and the ORA were free to take power. With him in charge, the ORA will be supreme in Madagascar."
MAG_unitetheright:0 "Unite the Administration"
MAG_unitetheright_desc:0 "With Heydrich out of the picture and Cayla as the rightful custodian of the Island, the French administration needs a new figure to rally around. All government officials will submit to Cayla's rule as he implements Pétain's 'National Revolution' here in Madagascar."
MAG_neutralisethenatives:0 "Ally Corporations and Native Elites"
MAG_neutralisethenatives_desc:0 "If there are two groups that have been alienated by Reinhard Heydrich's policies, they are the native elite and the captains of industry, the former enraged at the sight of their expropriated land and the latter gnashing their teeth at the sight of all their profit going into the pockets of the Germans and their economic freedom being suppressed in favor of centralizing, costly and catastrophic economic plans. We are a responsible colonial administration, unlike the Blonde Beast, we will ally ourselves with these two groups, ceding them the governance of part of Madagascar, while taking inspiration from the policies led by the central government of Algiers."
MAG_lacroixdefeu:0 "Organisation de Résistance de l'Armée"
MAG_lacroixdefeu_desc:0 "The ORA is now the supreme authority in Madagascar. Any threats to Cayla’s rule have been disposed of, the Germans have been done away with and the French reign supreme."

MAG_reign_of_heydrich:0 "The Reign of Heydrich"
MAG_reign_of_heydrich_desc:0 "Reinhard Heydrich was given unimaginable powers to order every single being, animate or inanimate, in Madagascar. With a vision reaching far into the future, and a lack of any ridiculous doubts over if his mission is necessary for the Fatherland to thrive, Governor Heydrich shall transform the Island from a jungle fraught with danger into a shining beacon for every flotilla in the Reichspakt."
MAG_fleet_hub:0 "The Very Heart of Afrika's Kaiserliche Marine"
MAG_fleet_hub_desc:0 "Allowed to command one of the most important naval positions across the entire Weltreich, Heydrich knew from the very beginning of his rule as the Governor that the Island was destined to serve as the true hub for the Imperial Navy's African sections. Let us ensure that the bases in Madagascar are nothing short of a proud example of the entire German sea-faring tradition."
MAG_at_any_cost:0 "No Cost is Too High!"
MAG_at_any_cost_desc:0 "Under budget, understaffed, with no clear schedule. The future of Madagascar as a floating fortress, as well as the perfect leisure destination for the German people, may seem awfully dire. The Governor is well aware of that, and to him no cost to remedy such a situation is too high. No matter if some bleeding hearts in the Reich may complain and send 'strongly worded letters warning the Kaiser of your conduct', fools."
MAG_aquire_funds:0 "Göring's 'Entrepreneurship' Lessons"
MAG_aquire_funds_desc:0 "We may have somewhat underestimated how much the Five Year Plan would cost, no doubt due to the fault books provided by the hostile French bureaucracy. The Empire is stretched as is, which means there is no possibility to ask Berlin for additional funds large enough to cover the rest of our projects. But our old friend Göring knows certain methods and 'creative opportunities' allow a government in need to acquire wealth beyond measure."
MAG_enforce_german_beuracracy:0 "Punish Seditious French Bureaucrats"
MAG_enforce_german_beuracracy_desc:0 "Deutsch-Französische Kolonialgesellschaft, what a lofty name for what essentially boils down to a rubber stamp, a rubber stamp that has been growing increasingly uncooperative. After the acquisition of Madagascar from French hands the existing administrative structures were allowed to stay, on the condition that they would dutifully as most loyal subjects of the Kaiser and his chosen Governor. Sadly, in recent years the perfidious Frenchmen have done nothing but obstructed every plan Heydrich set in motion, they must pay for their insolence."
MAG_relocate_the_natives:0 "Redraw Habitation Zones"
MAG_relocate_the_natives_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact that the great realm envisioned by Heydrich had to, so far, contend with less than cooperative native populations. Yet with the removal of the old French bureaucracy from certain parts of the administration we can now 'redraw' how the colony is to be organized, granting us complete control over the expulsion of natives from zones immediately next to the sites of future projects."
MAG_work_harder:0 "Sacrifice Through Labor"
MAG_work_harder_desc:0 "Nothing shall be ever accomplished if the workers assigned to the undertaking outlined by Heydrich, be they native, invited settlers, criminals, or even willing Germans, continue to be worthless layabouts. The time has come to make sure that anyone working on the Island is aware that their hard work must exceed any other nation in the world, it must be a daily sacrifice, risking all to build the future."
MAG_the_beast_of_madagascar:0 "The Shadow Over Madagaskar"
MAG_the_beast_of_madagascar_desc:0 "A powerless sense of dread and fear, such could be the description of the mood prevalent among everyone in Madagascar outside the German colonial administration. With countless men thrown at the altar of the ambitious vision of the Governor, no one can be sure what awaits them the very moment they wake up. But despite that, the regime of the so unfairly maligned 'Blonde Beast' has been nothing short of the very model of order and efficiency. In the end, the Fatherland shall judge Heydrich on his results, not on the methods."
MAG_wir_lagen_vor_madagascar:0 "Wir Lagen vor Madagaskar"
MAG_wir_lagen_vor_madagascar_desc:0 "Despite numerous odds stacked against him, against the promise of a glorious future for the Kaiser's favourite part of the military, Reinhard Heydrich has accomplished what the fools both in Berlin and Dar-es-Salaam thought impossible. Freistaat Madakagsar is progressing towards the final completion of the ambitious projects outlined in the Five Year Plan. No power in this world shall stop Heydrich from achieving his dream of a true floating fortress, a global naval hub to outshine Britain, Japan, America, and even the Fatherland."
MAG_penal_labour:0 "A Penal Colony to Mend the Chains"
MAG_penal_labour_desc:0 "Ever since the November traitors dared to raise their hand against the Fatherland, combined with the successive revolutions in France and Britain, our homeland has been swamped by dissident scum blindly following the supposedly 'righteous' doctrines of revolutionary syndicalism. Many of them ended up in prisons, wasting the tax resources of hard working and patriotic Germans. Perhaps Berlin would not mind 'lending' us some of the prisoners, for if they love the workers' states so much they can utilize the productive efforts here."
MAG_put_the_settlers_to_work:0 "Let Them Build Their Paradise"
MAG_put_the_settlers_to_work_desc:0 "Enticed by the promise of a new homeland away from their desired land administrated by the hostile Arab administration, the Jewish settlers emigrating to Madagascar have been met with what they often describe as 'a waking nightmare'. Living conditions below the standards they have expected, yet is their paradise not supposed to be built through the hard labor of their people? So let them tire under the scorching African sun, they have sat idle for far too long."
MAG_one_giant_base:0 "One Giant Naval Base"
MAG_one_giant_base_desc:0 "The plan for the future of the Island is simple yet brilliant. Madagascar will be rebuilt from the waterbound ground up to serve three valuable purposes. The first is to house Heydrich's personal retinue and allow for his vision to be made manifest in steel and concrete. The second is to be the pride of the Kaiserliche Marine and its Afrikan heart. The last one, not only will the ports of Madagascar serve military matters, but also allow for our prized possession to become the global hub of commercial exchange."
MAG_cater_to_saliors:0 "Cater to Sailors & Families Alike"
MAG_cater_to_saliors_desc:0 "To some, Madagascar is a place of torment where the tolls run high and the ruthless ambition of one man is the law. The critics of our Governor's regime may talk a lot, but the people on the outside don’t need to know that. They should only concern themselves with the fact that Madagascar is one of the Reich’s most favourable postings. Not only rich in culture and varied entertainment perfect for sailors to spend their off-time and bonus cheques on, the newly built luxury neighbourhoods are tailor-made for great German families to move into. After all, is the Fatherland not too small for some?"
MAG_5_year_plan:0 "Heydrich's Five Year Plan"
MAG_5_year_plan_desc:0 "While the Island serves as a personal project for Governor Heydrich, he is also the local representative of the Neue Kolonialgruppe together with all the plans the clique has outlined for the wider Mittelafrikan project. As part of such preparations we have to begin an ambitious, some even say overly so, plan to industrialize Madagascar in five years, merely one more than Arthur Zimmerman's Four Year Plan."
MAG_turn_watchdogs_away:0 "Turn Away Watchdogs"
MAG_turn_watchdogs_away_desc:0 "What gall do some people have, to discredit the entire glorious project we have so far carried out due to certain 'horrific violations', supposed by people unaware of the true situation on the Island. While the administration loyal to the Governor is well aware of the unproven nature of such lies, ever since the downfall of the Ludendorff Dictatorship the public opinion in Germany has held much sway over the Reichskanzlers' decisions. It would be wise to ensure that there is nothing to see for international observers."

MAG_Military:0 "A Navy with a Colony"
MAG_Military_desc:0 "The rule of Reinhard Heydrich has turned Madagascar into a glorified Naval Fleet dock. The navy reigns supreme while all other branches of the armed forces are ignored."
MAG_navy:0 "The Pride of the Fleet"
MAG_navy_desc:0 "Heydrich’s Section of the fleet is the Fatherland’s pride, and Afrika’s most powerful flotilla. Stationed in Madagascar, they will ensure that the waters of Afrika are free from enemies."
MAG_independent_fleet_arm:0 "Expand our Fleet"
MAG_independent_fleet_arm_desc:0 "Madagaskar’s Fleet may be impressive, but Heydrich wants it grander than before, Heydrich’s Flotilla will be expanded to include terrifying new ships that will send our enemies running with their tails in between their legs!"
MAG_local_production:0 "Local Ship Production"
MAG_local_production_desc:0 "Most of our ships are ordered and built in the Vaterland, however in Heydrich’s vision Madagaskar will be a naval powerhouse capable of producing ships without Berlin’s assistance."
MAG_naval_research:0 "Naval Research Department"
MAG_naval_research_desc:0 "To better fight our battles on the sea, Governor Heydrich has ordered the creation of a Naval Research Department which will find the best way to conduct naval warfare in a way that has adapted to an ever-changing world of war."
MAG_army:0 "The Navy on the Ground"
MAG_army_desc:0 "While not our main area of focus, a Land Army is essential for Madagascar to survive as a colony. The strength of the Schutztruppen will help secure our island against any foe that would dare to invade."
MAG_conscript_settlers:0 "Conscript the Settlers"
MAG_conscript_settlers_desc:0 "The Jewish Settlers that have moved to Madagascar moved here mainly because of the large amount of incentives Heydrich gave. Now that they are here, they must serve their duty; we have already given them plenty, homes, jobs, and a duty to the Fatherland."
MAG_cheap_guns:0 "Get Cheap Guns"
MAG_cheap_guns_desc:0 "Madagascar’s Budget has not been kind to the army, with most of our funds being set aside for the navy. To account, we must get cheaper guns to replace the aging rifles our ground troops still carry."
MAG_madagaskar_garrison:0 "Madagaskar Garrison"
MAG_madagaskar_garrison_desc:0 "Organizing the forces on our Island is the Madagaskar Garrison, a force assigned by Germany to better help with the ground defenses. They will defend Madagascar when the navy can not."
MAG_airforce:0 "The Navy in the Air"
MAG_airforce_desc:0 "Our Naval Forces operate not just on the vast open oceans, but in the vast blue skies as well. So, focusing resources on the Air Force will have positive effects on our Naval Prowess as well."
MAG_naval_aviation_branch:0 "Naval Aviation Branch"
MAG_naval_aviation_branch_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the major breakthroughs in naval warfare, naval bombers are able to lay waste on enemy fleets with torpedoes and other dedicated naval payloads like mines. Supporting our fleets, they can challenge capital ships and wreck havoc in the naval screens."
MAG_copy_german_airforce:0 "Copy the Vaterland"
MAG_copy_german_airforce_desc:0 "The German Empire has the mightiest army on the planet, so it would be natural that we copy their strategies in regard to war, especially in the air. In Madagascar, we only copy the best."
MAG_home_airports:0 "Airports on Madagascar"
MAG_home_airports_desc:0 "Madagascar is quite far away from everywhere on earth, so naturally getting supplies in and out is bound to be a challenge. Since our ports are to be occupied with mighty battleships, the best option is to transport goods by air. To do this, we need airports."
MAG_cast_afloat:0 "Cast Afloat"
MAG_cast_afloat_desc:0 "Disaster has struck, the Mittelafrikan Regime has fallen and now we find ourselves alone. Heydrich has fled to Göring’s Warlord state and has taken the entire Afrikan fleet with him. We have been cast afloat in a vast ocean, and nobody knows what the future holds."
MAG_alternative_means:0 "Kidnap Foreign Ships"
MAG_alternative_means_desc:0 "With little sources of income left, the desperate citizens of Madagascar have begun kidnapping any ship that sails within our waters, holding their crew and goods for ransom. While this may be against international laws, in these desperate times we can not turn down a source of income; no matter how shady."
MAG_free_port:0 "Open Port for All"
MAG_free_port_desc:0 "Madagascar’s location is in the middle of nowhere, and that may be a blessing in disguise. Using our remote location, we can offer our ports as a safe haven to anyone in the world to use to connect to the vast lands on the other side of the ocean such as India and Australia."
MAG_encourage_tourism:0 "Encourage Tourism"
MAG_encourage_tourism_desc:0 "While Heydrich did focus on developing Madagascar’s Tourist Economy, this was downplayed by his vast naval projects. With Heydrich gone and his projects scrapped, we can now focus on developing Madagascar’s tourism industry, offering a new source of income for our cash-strapped nation."

mag.1.t:0 "Heydrich Departs"
mag.1.d:0 "Today, Governor of Madagascar Reinhard Heydrich has departed from his post in Madagascar. He, along with the fleet stationed on the island, will be relocating to Dar-Es-Salaam, where they will join with the Göring Loyalists. His departure is sudden, and most know that he is quickly leaving to avoid dealing with the woes of the Colony; woes that have come up as a result of the Mittelafrika's Collapse crisis, that has crippled the German Sphere, and especially rule in Afrika.\n\n Taking over for Heydrich is Emil Maurice, who has steadily gained power within Heydrich’s regime. He moved to Madagascar due to incentives based off of his supposed Jewish ancestry, being able to secure a livelihood in the colony despite only having one ancestor of Jewish origin. Maurice of course did not bother to get this problem fixed as Madagascar was a relatively favourable post. While in Madagascar, Maurice became a Chauffeur and person friend of Governor Reinhard Heydrich; and slowly rose through Heydrich’s inner circle until he was poised to take over if Heydrich was gone.\n\n However, he never wanted to take over Madagascar, ruling the colony was the last thing he wanted. Maurice, along with others wonder if he can keep control of Madagascar."

mag.2.t:0 "A So-Called 'Model Colony'"
mag.2.d:0 "On the fringe of German rule in Afrika, Madagascar sits. Yet despite its position separated from both Berlin and Dar-es-Salaam, it thrives and prospers.\n\n The Streets of Antananarivo are busy with life, the ports flow with docked ships, and off-duty Sailors indulge in all that the island has to offer. There is a reason that Madagascar is seen as one the Fatherland’s most favourable posts. Yet under the surface, the Island stirs. Many wish to see France rule the Isle once more, and the Jewish Settlers that have flocked to the Island now grow weary, some wishing for a state of their own.\n\n As well, things do get darker. Heydrich’s naval projects have come at a severe cost. Workers deaths are among the highest in the world, and has mostly failed at its objective to turn the Island into a massive naval base.\n\n All of the Island is tied together by Reinhard Heydrich, who has overseen the colony for the last number of years. Under his rule Madagascar has become a hub of commerce, and the center of Mittelafrika’s vast Naval Fleet. As long as Heydrich is here, Madagascar will thrive. And even if he does depart, everything will be fine\n\n Right?"
mag.2.a:0 "Let's keep it that way!"

mag.3.t:0 "A Waking Nightmare Made Real"
mag.3.d:0 "With the collapse of Mittelafrika, the entire German colonial apparatus has fallen into complete disarray, and now only chaos reigns. Even here in our isolated island ‘paradise’, the tremors of this upheaval have been felt. With the rise of Göringia, Hermann Göring’s personal fiefdom, our local governor Reinhard Heydrich has fled to aid his old friend, leaving his chauffeur and right-hand man Emil Maurice in charge of our colony here in Madagaskar. With the colony now under Maurice’s command, and with Heydrich’s crimes fully revealed to him, the new governor must figure out how to run this massive island, despite his complete lack of experience in running such an administration. Establishing his new cabinet and reorganizing the colony’s regime so that it may undo Heydrich’s evils will be a tall order, and Maurice will likely need help in doing so, but if he can just keep the nation stable, then perhaps the horrors and crimes of the Heydrich regime can be fully undone."

mag.4.t:0 "The Government Falls!"
mag.4.d:0 "Maurice’s inaction has led to French-Aligned organizations seizing power. With them in power, the French Government in Algiers has gained overlordship over Madagascar once more. For now, a fragile coalition exists between the nationalistic ORA loyalists, led by Léon Cayla and the Madagascar Branch of Action Française, led by Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo.\n\n After the coup, Maurice fled from his home and boarded a plane to Brazil, as the German government put out a warrant for his arrest due to “Gross Negligence” and the “Wasting of State Funds” as well as “High Treason”.\n\n As of now, the government in Berlin has formally protested this act to the French Government in Algiers, who have paid them little head. With the Mittelafrika's Collapse sending Africa into crisis, and Berlin refusing to act further; there is little that they can do to retake Madagascar."
mag.4.a:0 "Cayla's Loyalists take power!"
mag.4.b:0 "Rabearivelo takes power!"

mag.5.t:0 "The Settler Situation"
mag.5.d:0 "Many rare and unique forms of life inhabit the diverse terrain of Madagascar. From the lowliest lemurs to the tallest of the Grandidier’s baobab trees,  much of our biodiversity can only be found here. In recent decades however, another strange and uncommon group has come to call our rich island home: the Jews. Fleeing centuries of anti-Semitism and bigotry, many Jews have retreated to our shores to find peace and to build a new life far from the hate they are used to enduring. Their migration here is only partially by chance though, as the ever diligent leader of our island, Reinhard Heydrich, has played a large role in their arrival as well. With Heydrich’s recent “projects” getting more expensive and destructive by the day, the population of the island began to see a *significant* decline as an ever increasing number of native *labourers* lost their lives slaving away to fulfill Heydrich’s deluded schemes. The population was in free fall until Heydrich’s luck turned when one day a boatful of Jewish refugees arrived in Toamasina, fleeing persecution from some regime or another, begging for asylum. Realizing the potential of these new idle hands, Heydrich began to advertise to the world that Madagascar was open to all Jews across the globe. Offering them incentives such as work and cheap housing, Jews have now been flocking to Madagascar by the thousands for years. This has led to a sizable Jewish minority in the nation that only continues to rise as more boats arrive and more natives meet their fate in Heydrich’s work camps. What this massive demographic shift will mean for the future of our island however, no one can say for certain..."
mag.5.a:0 "Interesting."

mag.6.t:0 "The Beast's Driver"
mag.6.d:0 "Reinhard Heydrich, or “The Beast” as he is *affectionately* known as by the natives, is an imposing and nearly-alien looking man; able to both ensnare and disturb with a single glance. Despite this menacing appearance, he is nearly always accompanied by one of the most unassuming members of the German colonial mission here in Madagascar: Emil Maurice. Arriving here on our shores with one of the Jewish refugee boats, Heydrich was quick to label Maurice as one of asylum-seekers, which wasn’t totally incorrect given his mixed German-Jewish ancestry. However, Maurice was neither a practicing Jew himself nor did he come here fleeing persecution back home. Instead, Maurice came to Madagascar simply because he had heard of the beauties and oddities of our wondrous island and wanted to feast his eyes upon our splendor himself, a fact he still has yet to bring to Heydrich’s attention. Though he had come here to lounge on our beaches and continue his hobby of watchmaking, living out the rest of his days relaxing in the sun, Maurice was in for a surprise. Meeting Heydrich on his first day arriving at the docks, “The Beast” took an instant liking to this little, unassuming man and they became fast friends. Heydrich would not let his new friend dawdle however, and nearly forced Maurice to take a job in the colonial administration. After becoming Heydrich’s personal chauffeur, the two have grown quite close in the following years, and Maurice has reluctantly proven himself to be one of the only competent Germans in Madagascar."
mag.6.a:0 "Such a happy fellow!"

mag.7.t:0 "Just Another Project"
mag.7.d:0 "Reinhard Heydrich has always been an ambitious man, seeking fame and honor long before his arrival in Madagascar. Since he first became the lord of this land, he has started and completed many extravagant and expensive “projects.” From the creation of expansive infrastructural systems that span the island tip to tip, to the opening of a network of work camps and factories that supply the Kaiserreich, Heydrich’s schemes have always been large and over the top. However, none of his past endeavors compare to the crowning jewel of his egotistical ambition: the creation of an island-wide naval base. Of course it sounds ludicrous now, but what “The Beast” envisions would be the lynchpin of German naval expansion deeper into the colonies in Africa and Asia and, the way he dreams it, would make himself the darling of the Kaiser and his people. By expanding ports, building new docks and shipyards, and overall covering every square mile of our coast in naval infrastructure and production facilities, Heydrich hopes to turn this island of nature and life into a metal fortress that stands against the waves and furthers the reach of the Kaiserreich. Will he achieve this ludicrous plan, no one is for sure, but what-ifs will not stop “The Beast” from achieving his dream while he still breathes."
mag.7.a:0 "All in the name of progress."

mag.8.t:0 "Disaster!"
mag.8.d:0 "Disaster has struck the colony! Our administration here is constantly balanced on a razor’s edge as Heydrich’s ambitions cause more and more chaos. Occasionally, the balance is thrown off and with it, tragedy always follows. Today was one such day of imbalance; earlier today in one of the drydocks at Toamasina, Madagascar’s largest port, a boiler malfunction caused by some shortsighted logistical planning on Heydrich’s part has led to a cataclysmic series of explosions that has completely decimated the area. Worse still, it occurred at the port’s busiest hours as thousands of merchants, dockworkers, and other locals were working in the immediate vicinity. The carnage has claimed the lives of hundreds, and hundreds more are still missing as rescue teams search the rubble. Even without the calamitous loss of life, millions of marks worth of damages have been inflicted on the port and surrounding ships that had been docked there. It will take untold months to repair the damages done to the port, but the lives lost will forever be irreplaceable, and the families of the victims all know who to blame: the Beast."
mag.8.a:0 "An unfortunate loss."

mag.9.t:0 "Aron Protests"
mag.9.d:0 "Word of the tragedy at the docks of Toamasina has finally reached Europe. Among the barrage of mail regarding the incident flooding Reinhard Heydrich’s office, we received a very strongly-worded letter from one Raymond Aron, famous French-Jewish philosopher and vocal political critic. He has hounded Heydrich and the administration here over the unnecessary deaths of so many French and Jewish workers in the disaster, and has condemned our colony as a trap for the downtrodden, accusing us of preying on these refugees and using them as little more than slave labour. This is all hog-wash of course, and Heydrich has decided to not give the old fool a response. Though this will likely increase the ire of our ever-increasing Jewish population towards us, Heydrich knows best, and what is best is for him to achieve his goals through any means he deems necessary."
mag.9.a:0 "Perhaps Jews need their own state."

mag.10.t:0 "The French Protest"
mag.10.d:0 "With his hatred towards the remnants of old French bureaucracy, who used to run Madagascar before the Weltkrieg, only growing since his arrival, the recent letters have only sent “The Beast” into a blind rage. Cursing the “frogs and rats” that stand outside the colonial capital protesting his recent actions, Heydrich has begun to lose all reason. As the protesters grew louder and Heydrich grew angrier, a sudden moment of clarity washed over him: he had an idea. To solve his “frog” problem, he would simply remove them from the equation. Heydrich gathered his guard retinue and stormed outside the building he was hunkered down in, ordering them to systematically drive away every single protester, and shoot anyone stupid enough to stay and shout. Once the deed was done, he gathered more guards and began to clear every single administrative building in the colonial capital of Frenchmen, radioing to other colonial centers around Madagascar to do the same. The French bureaucrats in the entire colony would get what they deserved: premier spots on the next construction projects, with no possibility of a failure. After the day of bloodshed ended, the streets of every major city on the island were eerily quiet, with not a single “frog” left in any position of power. Tomorrow, Heydrich would deal with the fallout of such actions, but tonight, he could finally sleep in peace without the incessant croaking."
mag.10.a:0 "We need German administrators at once!"

mag.11.t:0 "Investigation into Heydrich"
mag.11.d:0 "Despite his near limitless power while on Madagascar, even “The Beast” is chained like a dog to Berlin. As they have caught wind of the recent disaster at Toamasina and his ghastly purges, as well as his past history of aggression against the natives, the Reichstag has issued a clear and direct warning to Heydrich for being far too harsh in his methods. Of course Heydrich has dismissed this warning as nothing more than a slap on the wrist, and shall continue with his schemes, but not before writing a silver-tongued reply categorically denying these “false accusations” as nothing more than rumor and slander. Heydrich knows he will have to pull the wool over the ever-watching eyes of Berlin and convince them of his innocence, at least partially, if he ever wants to finish his greatest project."
mag.11.a:0 "Their complaints are baseless!"

mag.12.t:0 "A Paradise on the Surface"
mag.12.d:0 "Reinhard Heydrich’s various projects have painted a thin veneer of paradise over the festering reality that is life in Madagascar. Within the largest cities, all seems perfect with new roads, beautiful architecture, and clean, smiling Germans waving as you go by. Take a few steps outside the cities, and the real Madagascar is revealed: a toxic industrial hellscape ever expanding into the surrounding jungles. Massive dockyards and ports cover the coasts, eating away at the once pristine beaches, while the once quiet jungles now endlessly echo with the sound of heavy equipment. Most horrifying of all are the work camps and plantations that dot the landscape, raping the Earth’s natural beauty as thousands of native and Jewish workers are driven to death as they are overworked to fulfill “The Beast’s” unquenchable ego and ambition. This once pure and idyllic island is slowly being strangled of all its wonder, and there is no end in sight as long as Heydrich still reigns supreme."
mag.12.a:0 "Still one of the Fatherland’s best posts." 	

mag.13.t:0 "Too Little? Too Late?"
mag.13.d:0 "Instability and chaos are at an all time high in Madagascar. With “The Beast” ruling supreme, raining death and destruction upon the land in his endless pursuit of glory, protests, violence and guerilla movements are breaking out across the island. With the German garrison being far too small to effectively quell these insurrections, Heydrich has become desperate to repair his position and maintain order and control. Forced to utilize drastic measures, he has begrudgingly decided to institute some *minor* reforms in order to quell this rising instability. Basic access to healthcare and nominal rights for workers will be granted in order to (hopefully) stop the chaos and return the colony to some semblance of a working order. If this works to ease the populace remains to be seen..."
mag.13.a:0 "But will it help?"

mag.14.t:0 "A State for all Jews"
mag.14.d:0 "We have secured this new homeland for the Jewish people! "The Beast" has fled to Göring's personal fiefdom in eastern Africa while the last of the German occupation forces are being mopped up by guerrillas or fleeing on the last German boats leaving our shores. As the warm, orange sun rises on a new day, its light will bathe this land in holy light, blessing our newly won island as a permanent and true home for the Jewish people. Centuries of oppression, false accusations, and hate will be washed away in the luminous dawn as we, God's Chosen, awake to our new future. We shall announce to the world that the Jews have finally found their new Promised Land"
mag.14.a:0 "Finally, home."

mag.15.t:0 "The Divided Island"
mag.15.d:0 "While on paper, our new Promised Land stretches across the entirety of this vast island, in reality our control barely projects outside of a few major cities with minimal Malagasy populations. Most of the island's interior and many of the smaller towns and cities are entirely within the control of either Malagasy natives or leftover Germans resisting our purges. Over this harsh reality, two diametrically opposed camps have formed in our provisional government: those who believe Madagascar can remain whole, and those who believe the island must be split between two separate states. The former camp argues that a divided Madagascar would only leave us open prey to future reprisals, while the latter camp fears the inherent instability of Jewish-Malagasy interactions. Whichever camp wins out will determine the future of not only Madagascar, but the future of the Jewish people as a whole. The people of Madagascar wait on bated breath for the government's decision."
mag.15.a:0 "A Two-State Solution is the most Viable"
mag.15.b:0 "We can survive with one state!"

mag.16.t:0 "A Governor for Madagascar"
mag.16.d:0 "I, Emil Maurice, first arrived on this wonderful island years ago now, hoping to live out my days in peace and quiet. A watchmaker by trade like my father before me, I had wished to tinker and relax as the tropical sun baked my skin into leather and to die peacefully as an old man free from all worldly tethers. Fate had different plans for me it seems, as I was unwillingly thrust into a more *lively* way of living. Since my arrival to this strange land, I have had drinks and parlayed with malagasy chieftains, I have broken bread with my fellow Jews who had fled from far and wide, I have even dined with "The Beast" as we discussed old symphonies and the finer things from back home in Germany... I have lived enough experiences for ten common lifetimes, but yet I still feel empty. I look back at all this pomp and pageantry, and all I can think about is the time wasted, the lounging and living I have missed. With Heydrich gone, it is now upon my shoulders to steer this ship; a duty I wished would never be granted to me. Fate is a funny and fickle thing, and it seems fate is not just done with me. All I can do now is laugh and wait for what fate has in store."
mag.16.a:0 "What a world."

mag.17.t:0 "The Driver's Driver"
mag.17.d:0 "The circle of life continues, or so they say. With Heydrich on the run, fleeing his fiefdom in Madagascar, Emil Maurice has become the top German official on the island. Once the driver to "The Beast", it was now Maurice's turn to rule and be doted on. Interestingly, Maurice has struck up an odd friendship with a local Jew who himself fled persecution in Europe. Meeting by chance during one of Maurice's evening beach strolls, the two bonded over their love for the *less stressful* aspects of life. Sensing that this young man had no future other than the German boot, Maurice has taken him in as his personal chauffeur. Echoing relationships of lives now past, Maurice can't help but to chuckle at how destiny always seems to repeat itself, no matter how hard we run from it..."
mag.17.a:0 "Perhaps the cycle could continue."

mag.18.t:0 "Cultural Revival"
mag.18.d:0 "With the German dogs on the run and the rule of the Malagasy returning to our hallowed lands, the age of the Malagasy cultural revolution is upon us. Not since the first white devils landed on our shores centuries ago has Malagasy life and culture been so vibrant with the fall of "The Beast." Across every city, village, and hut on this island, the song of the true people of Madagascar rings true. A variable and vibrant golden age has dawned as old customs long forgotten are modernized and/or revived. Malagasy art, cuisine, and other higher cultural forms have soared to new heights, while native architecture is brought to the cities as old colonial administrations are leveled. The age of the Malagasy has come to our beautiful land, and the era of imperialist domination lies burning at our feet. The Malagasy people live strong and free once more! The German and French dogs of old may have taken many lives, but they will never take our spirits."
mag.18.a:0 "We will never lose what makes Madagascar Madagascar."

mag.19.t:0 "It all Comes Crashing Down"
mag.19.d:0 "As part of this new Golden Age for the Malagasy, the remnants of the old world must be torn down and eradicated. Colonial buildings are to be demolished and replaced with native-inspired designs while statues erected in Heydrich's honor are desecrated and torn down by the Malagasy people nationwide. Most satisfying to destroy of all Heydrich's old domain is the dismantling of the work camps, dockyards, and prisons of old whose chains held the Malagasy people to the mud, unable to reach for their destinies...until now. Brick by brick, the old order of "The Beast" will be torn down, and in its place, a true Madagascaran state shall rise from the ashes."
mag.19.a:0 "The beauty of Madagascar will be reclaimed."

mag.21.t:0 "What Falls Faster?"
mag.21.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to cleanse Madagascar from the taint of the Europeans, a particularly stubborn virus has proven to be far more difficult to remove from our lands: syndicalism. A vile and wretched school of thought that seeks to infest the minds of the Malagasy people, divorcing us from our native traditions and ways of life. We will not stand for this. However, we can not go around slaughtering our own people on the dawn of our independence; it would sully our name for generations to come and leave a mark so dark on our history, we would never be able to cleanse it. There are ways around this though. The ORA, a French paramilitary organization that has operated in some small capacities here on Madagascar for decades, separate from the main cells in France. Originating from France’s era of colonial rule over the island and fiercely dedicated to the destruction of their enemies and upholding their own ideals, they have operated in secret, separate from our government...until now. Quietly and behind closed doors, the new Malagasy government has stuck a deal with the ORA that is *mutually beneficial*. In exchange for amnesty and turning a blind eye to some of their more dubious activities, the government will allow the ORA to handle their shared “syndicalist problem.” Though many argue that working with the imperialists is what got us in this mess in the first place, no one can doubt their efficacy. To celebrate this newfound partnership, the Malagasy government has decided to even gift the ORA with a small fleet of older cargo planes no longer in service, left abandoned by one colonial administration or the other. Many have asked us what use these terrorists could possibly have for these old planes, and we simply replied “Even syndicalists like free plane rides.” Remember, don’t look out the windows of the planes too far, as accidents are always bound to occur..."
mag.21.a:0 "At least they get a free ride."

mag.22.t:0 "The Lion of Verdun Visits"
mag.22.d:0 "With our newfound partnership with the Gouvernement Militaire Nationale growing more beneficial by the day, and with Syndicalism’s grasp on our populace weakening with it, the official head and founder of the GMN, the Lion of Verdin himself, has come to make a visit to our illustrious island. Maréchal Pétain arrived in our capital this morning to much pomp and fanfare, greeted as a hero by many. Though much of our populace hears rumors of the rogue Germans and Judaic radicals, most ignore what occurs in the shadows to focus on our brighter future, and as both the Algiers Regime and our Madagascar grows more powerful, more and more Malagasy see this brighter future intertwined with the French to be a necessity.\n\nWith Maréchal Pétain’s visit, pro-French sentiment is at a fever pitch not seen in decades, and the Lion of Verdun plans to use this to his advantage. Meeting with the colonial governor Léon Cayla, the two have committed themselves to a partnership to become the face of French cooperation and civilization on this island, and today have outlined a plan to restore Madagascar to greatness. In public, they serve as both the smiling and stoic faces of French cooperation, but in private, Pétain has revealed larger aspirations for the island. Maréchal Pétain envisions a Madagascar free of all German traces, fully wrapped in the embrace of the French Empire and serving as another loyal cog in their quest for African domination and the Reclamation of the Metropole. What will be the outcome of the GMN’s growing influence can’t be said, but the writing on the wall grows clearer each day: the French have no plan on leaving Madagascar again."
mag.22.a:0 "The grasp of the Frenchman inches ever closer."

mag.23.t:0 "Piracy Issue"
mag.23.d:0 "Despite the cultural revivalism and the slow but effective eradication of the syndicalists who plague our nation, Madagascar still bears deep wounds from its time under “The Beast.” Unemployment, poverty, and, worst of all, crime have reached a fevered pitch, and instability steeps every inch of the island. One such issue to arise from this catastrophe is the return of piracy. Both on land and at sea, these modern buccaneers pillage and plunder all possible sources of income, from our trade lanes full of cargo ships out at sea to the coastal batteries and storehouses where much of the goods-to-be-stolen are stored. Like the age of the Barbary corsairs or the great privateers of Somalia, these Malagasy pirates are ruthless and seemingly unbeatable. With every pirate vessel sunk, another two take its place as our people grow more and more desperate. Something must be done to stop these perfidious pirates from ruining our newly-independent home."
mag.23.a:0 "Oh dear..."

mag.24.t:0 "The Open Ports"
mag.24.d:0 "We have done it! After a long and expensive campaign and numerous bloody raids into their territories, the pirate threat to Madagascar has been put under control. Though small incidents still occur, the bulk of the large pirate gangs have been slaughtered or forced to flee to friendlier waters, freeing up their stranglehold on our young economy. Full naval shipping will resume with our neighbors and trade partners to start the flow of wealth into Madagascar again, and our dockworkers and coastal inhabitants can finally live fearlessly without the impending threat of piracy. Though this was only one hurdle of many on our journey to build up Madagascar, many feel confident in our government’s ability to handle crises due to recent successes. Let us hope this was the start of our good fortunes, and not just a lucky break."
mag.24.a:0 "Let the goods flow!"

mag.25.t:0 "Tourist Economy"
mag.25.d:0 "With the last remnants of “The Beast” and his Hunnic dogs’ taint being expunged from our proud, new nation, Madagascar looks ahead to a shining future. Our island is beautiful once more with the damages wrought by the Hun being undone as we speak. Forests are regrown and animals reintroduced to their historic ranges, while our water is depolluted to the best of our ability and the industrial hellscape that once spread across these lands is reclaimed by the jungle. With beauty and majesty returning to our lands, a unique business opportunity opens: tourism. With such unique and biodiverse land such as this, tourists from across the globe would love to see what our island truly has to offer. To aid in this venture, the government has created a new Board of Tourism to spearhead this burgeoning industry. With a bustling tourist industry, Madagascar could finally make money by expanding its natural curiosities instead of by actively destroying it as before under past administrations. The soul of the island shall no longer be harmed for material gain, and we will show our old masters the true potential of our island and its beauty."

mag.26.t:0 "The Long Shadow"
mag.26.d:0 "The last few days in Berlin were restless. How else could the mood manifest itself in the face of the calamity that was the stock market collapse, with businesses closing, people losing jobs, lives ruined, a hegemon in tatters. While the Kanzler's government was already hard at work dealing with the fallout of the Black Monday, a very unusual report came across von Westarp's desk. A series of mysterious posters and pamphlets began to be distributed in the most industrialized areas of our nation, with a particular focus on the cities hit hardest by the slowed down economy.\nAfter dispatching local police units to investigate, and hopefully apprehend the culprits, the telegraphs returned to Berlin told of a shocking revelation. The campaign was seemingly organized by Reinhard Heydrich, the Governor and Admiral of our Madagaskar colony. While the Island was already a subject of numerous complaints sent by the local bureaucrats supposedly 'terrorized' by Heydrich, the administration back home was too busy with other projects to investigate further. But no one expected for the Admiral to capitalize on the tragic opportunity of the collapse and plastered factory walls across the cities of Germany with slogans like: 'Build a New Future, The Bright Horizons of Madagaskar Await!' or 'Stability, Work, Prosperity. Venture to Mittelafrika's Jewel Today!'. What was most unusual, however, were numerous posters written in Yiddish, inviting Jewish families to 'Build Their Paradise' in a free and boundless expanse of the colony.\n\nThe Kanzler's bureau quickly sent an envoy to the Kaiser with an intention of informing him of the Admiral's scheme. The delegation was invited to witness a field test, overseen by the monarch himself, of the improved radio infrastructure meant to deliver news to the population of our Empire. Although most of the experiment went according to the plan, with Wilhelm enjoying the sound of Johann Strauss Jr's Künstlerleben, Op. 316. coming from the speakers, the last twenty minutes were interrupted by a voice familiar to a few generals gathered.\n'Greetings to all loyal subjects of our Kaiser and proud citizens of the Fatherland. Today, I offer you an opportunity in these hard times, a place in the world untouched by the decline felt in Europe. Every able bodied man, and every family of the Mosaic faith, is welcome to sail to and start a new chapter of their life in the colony of Madagaskar. Settlers will be provided with accommodations, stable work, and chances to create an Idylla on the distant Isle. Inquire with the nearest office of the Mittelafrikan Kaiserliche Marine today!'\nEverything was spoken with the cold demeanor characteristic of Governor Heydrich. It was clear that some consequences would befall the men responsible for the interruption, excluding Reinhard himself, yet no one could be sure what the newest 'project' of our Southern colony's shadow noble could entail."

mag.27.d:0 "News has just reached us from Paris that, after several years in exile, the legitimate government deriving its legitimacy from a direct continuation of the Third Republic has at last reclaimed the Metropole from the tyrant Communards who ruthlessly occupied it. The French government is currently busy rebuilding and reorganizing the Metropole after the bloody conflict that pitted our fellow Frenchmen against each other, thus their priority is not currently turned towards the lost Colonial Empire. So perhaps it's up to us to make the first move towards them. Indeed, it would seem that the current French government has a much friendlier attitude towards people of Jewish descent and practicing Judaism than its predecessors, which pleases a large majority of our French-speaking Jewish settlers as well as our leader Abraham Schrameck, himself a former French minister of Jewish descent. It would therefore seem logical for our administration to once again become a colony of France, with our non-Jewish French settlers pressuring us to do so as soon as possible. But there are still some voices opposed to this, from the German settlers who remained on the island after the fall of Mittelafrika, still hostile to the French, and from our Jewish settlers of Zionist ideology, who would prefer to see our independence preserved. It's up to Schrameck and his advisors to make the final choice, however, either to preserve our fragile, young republic or to regain our original place as a loyal colony to Paris."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_AMANULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Born in 1892, as the third son of Habibullah Khan, Amanullah Khan was, upon reaching proper age, installed as governor of Kabul and commander of the Army, gaining many important tribal allies. When the Weltkrieg broke out Amanullah, seeing this as a chance to seize lands on the other side of the Durand Line, joined Nasrullah in urging for joining into the Weltkrieg on the Kaiserreich’s side. When his father remained steadfast in his neutrality, Nasrullah and Amanullah, using mainly Amanullah’s tribal contacts, gathered up a force to invade the Raj. The initial push was a debacle and Amanullah was forced to retreat back into Afghanistan with the Raj hot on his heels. So began the Third Anglo-Afghan War. \n\nAmanullah was then forced to watch as his Army struggled to fight off the British and Indian invaders. However, when the Weltkrieg in Europe came to an end, Afghanistan was given its due. Since then, however, Amanullah has seen his father grow fat and lazy on the throne and angled his way to become his successor. Now having triumphed over Nasrullah, his uncle, and former ally, Amanullah stands as the unchallenged Emir of Afghanistan. Amanullah is not content with just sitting on his present victories, however. He sees a future Afghanistan shining like a beacon of modernity in the roughness of Central Asia. He sees a future free of imperialist influence and the meddling of outside powers and their ‘spheres of influence’. For too long has mighty Afghanistan been forced to hide in the shade of the Raj, and the King of the God-granted Kingdom of Afghanistan and its dependencies been regarded as the leader of a second-rate power. Only through blood and steel shall the Afghan people carve their place in the Sun from the corpse of the British Empire, just as the Germans did. Now it remains to be seen if he can achieve his dream."
POLITICS_HABIBULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Habibullah's reign has thus far been marked by reforms and attempts to modernize his country by working to bring modern medicine and other technology to Afghanistan. Born in 1871, in Uzbekistan, he would rise to power in 1901, upon the death of his father, the previous Emir. Habibullah’s early reign was one of reform, as he quickly issued a general amnesty to his father’s many enemies, allowing them to return to the country. He also began to import new technology and further modern science within Afghanistan. He also was a social reformer, repealing many draconian criminal punishments while making the legal system fairer in general. One of his principal reforms was dismantling his father’s internal intelligence system that oppressed huge swaths of the country. In 1903, Habibullah founded the Habibia school as well as a military academy. \n\nWhen the Weltkrieg broke out, Habibullah took great pains to keep his nation neutral in the War. Despite the insistence of the Sultan in Istanbul and the Kaiser in Berlin, his proximity to India and the British made any intervention seemingly doomed to fail. This all changed with the defeat of the British in Europe and the ensuing revolutions that ripped through their Empire, however. As chaos gripped the Raj and British rule faltered, Habibullah was initially hesitant to do anything. This meant little to his generals, who quickly crossed the Durand Line and seized border towns of the Raj. Habibullah, unable to reverse this without appearing fatally weak, was forced to go along with this fait accompli. This bolstered his popularity at home since the Raj, still battling for its own survival, was unable to resist.\n\nTwenty years after his victory, Habibullah has had to watch his grand dream of a powerful Afghanistan begin to wither. In the hinterlands, rebellion has once again reared its ugly head while members of his own family eye the crown hungrily. If Afghanistan is to be truly stable, Habibullah knows he must do something."
POLITICS_KALAKANI_DESC:0 "Habibullah Kalakani was born in 1891 in the village of Kalakan, north of Kabul. An ethnic Tajik, his father was named Aminullah and delivered water to people's homes. This heritage is how Kalakani gained the nickname ‘Bacha-ye Saqao’, or son of the water carrier. During his adolescence, Kalakani ventured out of his village and traveled to the city of Kabul. In the south, he met an old Sufi who told the young Habibullah that he would become king one day. He would fight with the Afghan Army in the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the Khost Rebellion. After being discharged from the army after attacking a superior officer, Habibullah escaped Kabul in the dead of night and once again returned to a life of banditry. Habibullah's exploits as a bandit gradually gathered him a small but loyal band of brigands, robbing caravans during the day and hiding out at night. Afghan Army units sent to round him up were routed or brought over to his cause and it was not long before Kalakani became the real authority in Eastern Afghanistan. While Habibullah grew fat and lazy in Kabul, Kalakani began to draw up plans to fulfill his destiny and become King of Afghanistan. However, despite his growing power and ambitions, he was reluctant to strike at Kabul and tear the heart out of the decadent regime he had come to despise. That time came eventually with the catastrophic war against the Raj, and despite all odds, Kalakani now has seized the reins of government. What he intends to do with his newfound power however only Kalakani and Allah know and neither of them seems interested in telling."
POLITICS_NASRULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Nasrullah Khan was born in 1874, the second of three sons to Emir Abdur Rahman. As a young man in his early 20s, Nasrullah was sent on a journey to the UK to pay his father’s respect to Queen Victoria. Since he spoke little English and did not make a good impression on the local press who described him as a 'stolid, impassive and bored youth'. Nevertheless, he paid his respects as demanded and after a detour through Paris and Italy, returned home. This experience, while considered a diplomatic failure, prepared the young man for life in statecraft. When his older brother Habibullah rose to the throne, Nasrullah was suddenly one of the most important men in Afghanistan, if not more so than before. \n\nFirst to court him were the religious authorities who languished under his father Abdur. Nasrullah was a deeply religious man by this point and quickly warmed to their influence. The second was his brother, the Emir, who saw him as a potential rival. To secure his loyalty, Habibullah made him Commander in Chief, President of the State Council, and later heir over his own sons. Nasrullah was also kept loyal by the fact that the Emir held their brother, Mohammed, and Mohammed’s mother as little more than prisoners. Nasrullah was no Claudius, for he was loyal to Habibullah throughout his reign.\n\nDuring this time Nasrullah also grew to despise the British, despite his early venture to the Isles. The British had, under an earlier treaty, kept the Afghan government from maintaining valuable alliances with the powerful tribes of the Afghan hinterlands. At the same time, British influence began to slowly creep deeper and deeper into Afghanistan, which Nasrullah saw as a threat to his family and his people. When the Weltkrieg broke out, Nasrullah saw his chance to strike decisively at the British. He, along with the Young Afghan movement, urged the Emir to join the war on the side of the Turks and Germans. To their frustration, Habibullah remained neutral. When the Niedermayer Hentig Expedition arrived in Afghanistan, Nasrullah found a new group of loyal allies. Along with the Expedition, Nasrullah proposed numerous ways to undermine the British but all of them were dismissed by the Emir. As the Germans’ victory seemed imminent, however, Nasrullah finally got fed up with waiting for his brother. Without orders Nasrullah helped round up a group of tribes on the border and invaded the Raj. He was beaten, decisively and the nation he loved was dragged into a devastating war. When the Weltkrieg ended, so did the Third Anglo-Afghan War and Nasrullah Khan had achieved his dream. \n\nTwenty years later, Nasrullah now sits at the helm of his beloved nation, having defeated usurper and conspirator alike. With Allah guiding him, who can stand between him and greatness?"
POLITICS_NADIR_SHAH_DESC:0 "The wild card’s hand has been revealed for the world to see. Born to an exiled branch of the royal family in India, Mohammad Nadir Khan would return to Afghanistan only in the early 1900s, when Habibullah Khan married Nadir’s sister. He served admirably in Habibullah’s government until the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Afghan War. While faring decent against the seasoned British forces, he was never able to gain the successes needed to cripple the Raj. Instead, he was forced to fight on for years until an end to the war in Europe forced an end to the War in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile Afghanistan had triumphed, Nadir was left with a bitter aftertaste, and he was further enraged by radical proposals for the modernization of Afghanistan. While no traditionalist like Nasrullah, Nadir felt that some of Habibullah’s more ambitious reforms, no doubt suggested by his son Amanullah, were too far, stripping Afghanistan of its identity. During this era of peace, if not animosity, the British have appealed to Nadir Khan, promising him the throne in exchange for his cooperation. Now Nadir rules in Afghanistan with undeniable help from his former enemies, the British. While few expect him to kowtow to Delhi and Ottawa for long, even fewer see his reign as one of continuing reform. Nadir instead seems to want to propel Afghanistan into the future, but also pay respects to its admirable past. Whether or not he can continue this balancing act remains to be determined."

afghanredux.0.t:0 "The Graveyard of Empires Stirs"
afghanredux.0.d:0 "Much has changed for the Emirate of Afghanistan since the turn of the century. Habibullāh Khan’s reign initially endeavored to push his once reformative agenda into practice despite resistance from the nation’s many entrenched conservative sources of influence. Despite this, Afghanistan has seen some progress, with its legal, economic and educational systems all receiving minorly beneficial reforms, but above all, no institution within our Emirate has flourished like our military has, with Habibullāh passing a slew of new laws to improve the Afghan Army. This military prowess was built up as the earliest years of the new century dragged on until the Weltkrieg broke out in 1914. \n\nAs the horrific Weltkrieg dragged on, Afghanistan was put under increasing pressure from both the Kaiserreich and the Ottoman Empire to join the conflict on their behalf. Initially, Habibullāh resisted these calls for war, instead turning inward as he focused on ruling his own kingdom sealed away from the wider world. However, this peace would be shattered in 1917, when a band of tribes rallied by Nasrullah Khan and Ghāzī Amānullāh Khān disobeyed all previous orders and took a secretive gamble to push into British India without informing their Emir. Without support from the wider armed forces, Amānullāh’s forces were disastrously beaten and quickly forced back into Afghani territory, dragging the nation into the Weltkrieg and sparking a third war between us and the Anglos ... \n\nTwo years prior, the Kaiserreich established the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, a military attache aimed at training, supplying, and otherwise aiding the Afghani forces for a surprise attack against the Anglo-Indian forces. Eventually, the cacophony of the Weltkrieg drew silent, and Afghanistan stood on the side of the victors.\n\nAs the decades since that horrific conflict have worn on, Habibullāh’s rule has only drifted further from his original ideals as he grows lazier and more opulent with age. It is now 1936, and the German mission is still here, Habibullāh still lounges on his throne, and our Emirate is as unstable as ever. The constant meddling of the Kaiser’s expeditionary force has only driven up unrest, regardless of the military benefits it has provided, and this chaotic situation has only been stoked by the rising radicalism being proliferated within the Provisional Government of India which we have so generously harbored. The Young Afghans, a local nationalist movement, grow increasingly vocal over their displeasure with Habibullāh’s rule, and the Emir’s two main rivals of Amānullāh and Nasrullah are at each other’s throats, each vying for their seat on Habibullāh’s throne. The aging Emir is growing desperate to keep his seat of power intact, and some whisper that he is even willing to start another war to do it. The nation of Afghanistan is once again on the edge of great change or utter collapse, and only Allah knows which way it will fall."

The previously disunited tribes now find unity in the pride of the newfound Afghan power and the many plots against our sovereign seem to have dissipated. It was decided to organize a great and sumptuous parade in the streets of Kabul, with a huge crowd and all the tribal and political representatives of the country present during the event. At the end of the parade, King Ghazi Habibullah Khan delivered a speech to his people praising the merits of Afghanistan's modernization and its proud army during the Fourth Anglo-Afghan War. To the surprise of his people, the King announced the formation of a new Barakzai Empire, risen from the ashes of the Durrani and Mughals, and that he would lead it to greatness. He left the stage to the loud applause of both his people and the tribal leaders.\n\nMeanwhile in Delhi, news of the announcement of 'Mughal ambitions' has shaken the government to its core. Communications between Delhi and Ottawa are frantic. Fear of another invasion, one which could see the complete annexation of the Raj, has paralyzed the British administration. The Entente's grip over India seems to be at its lowest point yet."

Undoubtedly because of these factors, having failed to modernize Afghanistan and lead it to glory, and fearing for his life, our King fled the country in the early hours of the morning with some of his relatives.

In addition, such a move would surely come as a snub to the Canadians, something that is always welcome by the German people. However, with Black Monday currently ravaging our economy and the Empire having bigger problems to deal with than Afghanistan's distant wars, perhaps it might be best to keep the planes and men to ourselves. Some have pointed out that while it would be nice to have a strong friend in the region, supporting the Afghans comes with the risk of upsetting the Canadians at a time when their new King provides an opportunity for renewed relations, and would undoubtedly hurt us in the long run should Delhi emerge victorious.

When he is done he is taken to the Sultan and the two hit it off well. The Sultan asks about the War and how Afghanistan is doing while Amanullah asks about how the Sublime Porte fares in turn. The Sultan pledged to provide support to the Afghan cause by any means necessary, and in turn, humbly requests support. Many in the Royal Court, the Caliph included, believe war may be coming to the Ottoman sphere of influence. The Emir’s son pledged to support the Caliph in any way he could. Amanullah then watched the Palace Guard execute parade maneuvers in the courtyard and appeared thoroughly impressed. Such discipline! Such fervor! He was seen off by the Sultan himself, and as Amanullah sits down in his plane, all consider the visit between the two as a great success.

The men are all too sloppy; their uniforms are the wrong size and they conduct their military drills and maneuvers without tempo or panache. During his inspection of what was heralded as an 'elite' division, a soldier further down the line drops his rifle and it goes off, shooting himself in the foot.

While Amanullah is not first in line to receive the throne, should his father abdicate or be rendered incapable, he is a man of ambition. His uncle, Nasrullah, is a reactionary man, who would rather see Afghanistan wallow in the same troubles that have been affecting it for centuries instead of dragging it into the future.

Prized for its isolation, its pristine and unspoiled natural beauty, and its ample hunting grounds, this isolated and forgotten cut has long been the well-kept secret of Afghani nobles and royals seeking a bountiful foray into the wilds. First traveling here what must be years ago by now with Mohammad Nadir, who has long used this gorge as his own personal plot to hunt the varied beasts of our lands, our king Habibullah and his most trusted confidants have frequently used this strip of wilderness to clear the mind, to discuss politics or matters of the state in private, or even to just take an occasional break from the rigors of rule and statecraft. \n\nThis hunting trip was no different, with Habibullah and his retinue leaving their horses back at the entrance of the pass where a small rest shack stood, continuing deeper into the wilds on foot. Bringing with them only a small amount of survival supplies, their traditional jezails with ample shot and powder, and other various supplies needed for the hunt such as bait and skinning knives, the royal retinue embarked deep into the heart of this ‘Valley of the King’ in search of noble prey such as wild boar, ibex, antelope, markhor, and if they were so lucky, even snow leopard and Asiatic cheetah. As the sun rose high in the arid and crisply blue sky, their multi-day hunt began with their guards lowered and their spirits high, for it's not like anything ever goes awry this far from the causticness of civilization..."

However, fate had other plans, and as the retinue scrambled their way up the mountain, disaster struck. With the snow leopard finally catching the hunters’ scent as the wind shifted, the stark white feline bolted, causing the hunting party to attempt to chase after it. However, one of the nobles on the trip with Habibullah lost his footing on the rock face above the king, slipping down the cliff face by a few meters before regaining his grip. Thinking the worst was behind them and disaster was just avoided, the small sighs of relief and quiet cheers ended abruptly when the sound of gunfire cut through the valley. Turning back in horror, Habibullah’s men saw the jezail fall from the slipping noble’s back, hitting the sound of the mountain and misfiring directly into the face of their king. In an explosion of pink mist and grey smoke, a hole the size of a softball was blown through the head of Habibullah, sending the honored king tumbling down to the valley floor, leaving a red trail behind him as he plummeted lifelessly to the ground. As his men quickly repelled down the mountain rushing to the aid of their wounded king, it was far too late to save him by the time they reached his side. Managing to gurgle out a swift goodbye through the blood filling his lungs and throat before finally passing, Habibullah died on the floor of the valley surrounded by some of his closest allies. \n\nA tragic accident if ever there was one, the men wrapped the king’s body in gauze and prepared to take him back to Kabul, dreading having to break it to the nation that the king was well and truly dead. Though all in the retinue understood clearly that this was an accident in every sense of the word, the more cynical within the group believed that upon their return, accusations would begin to fly as rival groups vying for power each start to throw blame on one another. Whatever awaited them in Kabul, they would soon see, but the trek back was sure to be a solemn one."

He described the Ottoman Empire as a "powderkeg" with increasing strength of the Cairo Axis and internal discord. Border disputes and skirmishes with Iran, along with escalating tensions in the Levant and the Arabian Peninsula, had reached unprecedented levels. The Sultan, feeling cornered, sought a favor from the Emir – to align Afghanistan with the Ottoman Empire. He emphasized that the fate of the Ottoman Empire depended on Afghanistan's support in case of a conflict. As they gazed out towards the rooftops of Kabul, the Emir delivered his response:"

Radical imperialists belonging to the United Empire Society in Afghanistan had cut all ties with the Entente and marched their ‘Army of Retribution’ to Delhi. In a surprising turn of events, these traitors have taken advantage of the political instability in the subcontinent and have captured Delhi, forcing the Dominion government into exile. With the fall of the Dominion, we have received a delegation from asking for a truce between the rogue government and the Entente.

The rogue colony claimed that they were only enemies of the corrupt administration in Delhi and they are still wholly loyal to the British crown. They have requested to rejoin the Entente to aid us in our liberation of the home isles. While some believe that a loyal India is too important to give up, many within the government see these imperialists as nothing more than traitors to the Empire and inviting them back in would be an utter disgrace to those who died trying to defend the Dominion from their invasion."

Similar to a pack of wild animals, Kalakani and his men poured out from the gates of the Arg and back into the streets of Kabul. Saqqawist brigands broke into homes and looted the merchants quarter, taking anything that was not nailed to the floor. Eager to use the modern rifles they seized from the Kabul arsenal, the bandits tested these weapons by indiscriminately shooting anyone who dared get in their way. Under the Bacha’s orders, all schools, palaces, and anything else deemed heretical were to be razed to the ground. Smoke plumed into the night skies as Kalakani and his men returned to the Arg with their newfound gains. Kalakani knew that this action would attract the ire of the local elites, causing them to take up arms against the new Emir. Tonight, this mattered nothing to the Bacha, for he and his men celebrated in the former Emir’s palace."

Bandits and brigands have emerged from their foxholes, raiding cities, looting and pillaging. Anarchy is now rampant in the once glorious Emirate. The cities of Peshawar and Quetta have been laid to waste by the invading armies and Wali of Swat, Miangul Abdul Wadud, a staunch supporter of the Afghan Kingdom, lays besieged in his fortress, Raja Gira, with no possibility of help from the outside. Seeing the sad state of affairs of the emirate, Nasir ul Mulk, King of Chitral, has declared his allegiance to the British and attacked the Afghan garrisons in his state with his famed Scouts and killed the local Afghan Governor. \n\nAll the while, blood now flows through streets of Kabul and into the river as people try to defend their property and family from looters and bandits as all law enforcement are either overwhelmed or destroyed. The new Emir, Nasrullah Khan, is missing and presumed dead as bandits descended upon the city and the Royal Palace. The bandit leader, a Kohistani Tajik named Habibullah Kalakani, has launched an all-out assault on Kabul to take the capital city for themselves."

Due to the Iron Emir, Habibullah's father, realizing that the branch family would never cease trying to seize the throne, he exiled them to India and told his heir to never allow the “Al-Yahya” family into the country again, or his dynasty will face the consequences. After ascending to the throne, Emir Habibullah paid an official visit to British India where he fell in love with Nadir’s sisters. Nadir, realizing an opportunity had opened for him, took advantage of the Emir’s philandry, and had his sister married to the Emir. It was quick work to convince the king to let their family return to Afghanistan. \n\nReturning to Afghanistan, Nadir immediately started to make contacts with previous friends of the branch family and using these contacts, became a general and led the Afghan Army in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. After distinguishing himself in the war, he was made Minister of War and set out to reform the army, a task which was made easier by the involvement of the German military attaché. Currently, Prince Nadir along with his son Zahir, are not in Afghanistan, as the old Prince is currently recovering from surgery in Europe. Now as the country stands at the precipice of war, Nadir Khan is making plans for his return, plotting to destabilize the nation and take the throne for himself. Rumors have reached the ears of the Emir that there have been shady dealings between the British and Nadir Khan about a possible coup but the Emir has turned a deaf ear to these concerns saying his brother-in-law would never harm him for he is like his own brother. Whatever his intentions, Nadir Khan has the influence and the men behind him to become a big name in the inevitable power struggle in Kabul."

In an act of desperation against the Bacha and his righteous army, members of the religious clergy have declared Ali Ahmad Khan as Emir. Ali Ahmad Khan, a member of the Shaghasi cadet branch of the Mohammadzai royal family, is one of the few remaining royals still in the country. From the anti-Saqqawist stronghold of Jalalabad, the so-called ‘Emir’ has rallied the local Pashtun tribes in a full-scale rebellion against our government. Upon receiving news of this proclamation, the Bacha let out a hearty laugh, vowing to crush this pretender emir in just a few months.

The envoy had explained to Kalakani that he had been traveling all night with news that Saqqawist forces were driven away by an invading army in the Logar Valley. When Kalakani asked if these men were soldiers of Ahmad Khan or perhaps even the British, the messenger replied that the army was led by none other than Mohammad Nadir Khan, the Soldier Prince. This news made the color drain from Bacha’s face as he fell back in his chair. Kalakani had long admired the talents of Nadir Khan, whom he served under as a soldier during the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Shaken, but unyielding in his goal, Kalakani called upon his brother Hamidullah to raise a force to counter Nadir Khan’s forces in the south. With the Saqqawists now facing a two front war, the Bacha must make an effective use of his limited resources and his cunning if he is to triumph against the pretenders to the throne."

For Kalakani, the real prize lay beneath the fortress of the Arg. Before they began their assault, an informant had informed the brigands that Habibullah’s treasury lies beneath the fortress, filled to the brim with gold and other treasures. Using a captured artillery piece, the Saqqawists blasted through the fortified walls and flooded into the palace, wiping out the remaining guards and princes. As Kalakani and his men descended into the dungeons of the Arg, they had finally arrived at the giant iron door. Using dynamite to blast it open, the bandits hungrily awaited their reward. As the dust settled, all that remained in the vault was a few coins scattered on the floor. Habibullah had already emptied the treasury before he fled Afghanistan. The Bacha was enraged, for that he had promised to repay his men in full. Not wishing to anger his loyal band, Kalakani set his men towards their new bounty, the city of Kabul."

afghanredux.64.t:0 "Death of a Craft"
afghanredux.64.d:0 "For the martial tribes of Afghanistan, most notably the Pashtun, the jezail is a beloved cultural icon as well as a dependable weapon. Handcrafted and passed down through generations, most of our young men are familiar with these flintlocks and prefer to use them above everything else. However, with the developments of the world around us, the jezail is quickly becoming more and more of a relic. While the craftsmanship cannot be denied, they cannot live up to their modern counterparts on the battlefield. This was shown in full display during our recent war against the Anglos, with our warriors’ weapons being outranged by the more reliable and standardized Lee Enfield rifles. While we may have triumphed against the British once, we cannot be complacent. \n\nWith our new reforms to our Afghan army, it is with a heavy heart that we must standardize our army’s weapons and do away with the jezail in our army. We are already being met with resistance, as senior military meetings explode into vicious arguments. Several tribe leaders and more conservative members of the army have been in uproar over these changes, pledging to resist such developments that ‘destroy the heritage of our nation’. Yet, we cannot control the world around us, and if we are to protect the sovereignty of our nation, we must ensure that every young man in our army has the tools he needs to defend our beloved country."

afghanredux.65.t:0 "Legacy of the Durrani"
afghanredux.65.d:0 "Taking the visage of his ‘predecessor’, Emir Kalakani has finally gone through with his ultimate declaration of a new Durrānī Empire in order to solidify his place as a true monarch whose legacy shall last the test of time as he seeks to unite most of Central Asia under his own Islamic imperium supported by his leagues of bandit allies. Standing on foundational pillars of tribalism, guerilla warfare and banditry, Sharia law and absolute dedication to Islam, Mujahideen loyalism, traditionalist fundamentalism and hyper-conservatism, this new domain stands more as the personal warlord state of Bacha-ye Saqao than it does any regal suzerainty, but it still stands nonetheless in defiance of all that seek to oppose Allah’s so-called chosen. A ‘true’ second Durrānī empire in name only, Kalakani’s new fiefdom shall obey its new master as a nightmare from of Ahmad Shah Durrani rises over the arid heart of Asia once again."

afghanredux.66.t:0 "Questioning the Caliph"
afghanredux.66.d:0 "With the Ottoman Empire falling to decadence and corruption as the Egyptian, Levantine, and Persian parasites gnaw away at its foundations along with the meddling forces of its varied tribals and other more foreign powers, Emir Kalakani has questioned their so-called ‘rightful’ role as supreme Caliph of all Islam, along with their claim to a united Muslim empire as a whole. Even considering declaring himself Caliph, Kalakani often dreams of launching an invasion westwards to claim the title for himself by right of conquest. A curious proposition indeed, but there is no way he would go through with it...right?"
afghanredux.66.a:0 "Only the Bacha is worthy of being the Caliph!"

afghanredux.67.d:0 "Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and its holdings in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Middle East, it has come to our attention that the Sultan, along with members of his cabinet and army, has arrived in Kabul. While it is indeed remarkable that the Sultan survived the challenging conditions of the territories they had to traverse to reach Afghanistan, we are honored that he has chosen our country as a refuge. Nevertheless, some advisors to the Emir have raised concerns. They suggest that this initial 'temporary' exile could potentially become permanent. To safeguard the Emir's authority, they propose that measures be taken to prevent the Sultan from gaining too much influence within Afghanistan, should Osman’s exiles attempt to do so."

afghanredux.68.t:0 "The Ottoman Army asks for Army Positions"
afghanredux.68.d:0 "Surprisingly, remnants of the Ottoman Army have also arrived in Afghanistan after a long journey through Iran from their positions in the Middle East. Despite facing challenges like the initial vanguard of the Cairo Axis, Bedouin ambushes, and Iranian patrols, they have successfully reached Kabul and established a garrison on its outskirts. While their presence has helped reduce banditry in the surrounding villages, it has also led to an increase in begging and loitering. Officers from this group have approached the Emir, expressing their interest in serving in his forces and offering to enlist their troops into the Afghan Army as well."

afghanredux.69.d:0 "Ever since the arrival of the Ottoman exiles in Afghanistan, a considerable number of individuals from their General Assembly, who have made it to Kabul, have approached the Emir seeking positions within the current government. While their abilities and contributions would be welcomed instead of them remaining idle, there are concerns that if they were granted influential roles, it might shift the balance of power in favor of the exiles and potentially jeopardize our autonomy..."

afghanredux.70.d:0 "After the accumulation of power from the Ottoman exiles within the Emir's administration, their authority fully exerted over the current government of Afghanistan, and sentiments of dissatisfaction shared among the administrators, the Ottoman exiles and officers have decided to take matters into their own hands. A coup was launched against the current government, and the Emir has successfully been subdued. As a result, our forces have asserted full control over the entire state, and have moved to eliminate traitors that dare oppose Ottoman rule. Thus, the spirit of liberation has been lit aflame in the hearts of the exiles, as the new government under the guidance of Osman Fuad paves the way towards the glorious reclamation of our lost empire."

afghanredux.71.t:0 "Ottomans and Afghans Rule Together"
afghanredux.71.d:0 "Ever since the exiles from the Sublime Porte have stepped foot in Afghanistan, whom are welcomed with open arms by the Emir, the relationship between the Emir and the Ottoman exile has been a long and complicated one, as contradictions and conflicts have reared its head throughout the exile's stay. Despite that, through wise political juggling and maneuver performed by both of the dual administrations, it appears that a possible compromise that satisfies both parties has been reached. With that, a joint government was agreed upon between the exiles and our current administration, fusing into a proper Afghan-Ottoman government, forging a unique bond like no other, seeking to restore glories of the past."

From the Dardanelles to Baghdad, from Sinai to Ankara, the lands of the so-called Sick Man of Europe have been cleared of disease and brought back to life as the true scions of Allah grace the Fertile Crescent once more. Standing side by side, our allied forces of Afghanistan and the Ottoman government in exile were able to beat all the odds, and now we may bask in the sunlight together as brother-nations forevermore. Now begins the herculean effort of rebuilding the old order in a new light so that it does not collapse into decay once again, but at least we shall not be alone in the efforts this time as Allah’s chosen land on this fertile earth is rebuilt brick by brick."

Should we allow this brave soldier of Islam to work to rebuild their lost legacy from Kabul, or should we cast off these relics of a bygone era to the dusty pages of history where they belong?"

afghanredux.76.d:0 "To celebrate his triumph over the rebellious that tested his reign and the success of his reforms, Amanullah Khan has finally begun the construction of his namesake city, Darul-Aman, located just a few kilometers to the southwest of Kabul. Infatuated with European city planning, Amanullah has already laid out blueprints for palaces, museums, and a modern public transport service. Should Amanullah limit Darul-Aman’s brilliance to a mere section of the city or shall this district serve as a stepping stone for a full-scale modernization of the Afghan capital?"

afghanredux.77.t:0 "Fate of the Aristocracy"
afghanredux.77.d:0 "India is home to a landed elite that has dominated its politics for millennia. Even within our conquered territories there are hundreds of princes, chiefs, and landowning elites. Amanullah has called a jirga to answer the question of the Indian nobility in our newly conquered territories. The traditionalist Pashtun chiefs have put forward a plan that would grant vast swathes of lands to Afghan princes while also letting the Islamic faithful keep their lands. Favoring neither side, many within the government have advocated towards a meritocratic solution that would seek out the most efficient administrators, whether they are Afghan or Hindus. Wishing to ease the strain on the administration and pursue more of his reforms at home, Amanullah has considered leaving the Hindu caste system in place to appease the princes and maintain order across the Khyber Pass."

afghanredux.78.t:0 "Fate of the Administration"
afghanredux.78.d:0 "While the territories ceded to us under the Third Treaty of Rawalpindi has brought our nation prestige and glory, actually administering these new lands has been anything but glorious. These territories have more than quadrupled our population and have greatly added on to the administrative problems we face at home. Amanullah has called a jirga to build a framework that will relieve the administrative strain of our new Indian territories. The ambitious Pashtun chiefs have proposed a plan that would carve up the territories among Pashtun elites and collaborative princes. Young Afghan moderates have supported an initiative that would see the revival of the Subah system that was created during the administrative reforms of the Mughal emperor, Akbar the Great. These new provinces will enjoy a great deal of autonomy while the government can free itself from the administrative strain and focus on reforms. Seeking to appease the local elite, some have proposed to simply put our trust in the locals and keep the current power structures intact."

afghanredux.79.d:0 "Often called a ‘land of many faiths’, Hindustan throughout its history has been a cradle of the world’s religions and faiths. These sacred lands are the birthplace of the Dharmic religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. In addition to these faiths, Islam, Christianity, and a variety of other religions have left a significant impact on India’s culture and history. In Afghanistan, Islam has been embedded in all facets of the region’s society for well over a millennia. With our recent conquests, we now rule over millions of new subjects belonging to various faiths and creeds. To mend this religious rift, Amanullah has once again called a jirga to solve the religious debate. Perhaps the most obvious solution, the traditionalists and their allies in the clergy have supported promoting the Islamic faith. Seeking to foster a new Islamic identity, religious leaders have supported providing aid to local mosques and collaborating with Muslim princely states. The Young Afghans have instead proposed a secularist approach by valuing the importance of all faiths throughout the empire. Taking inspiration from the Baha'i faith and the Din-i Ilahi of Akbar the Great, these moderates hope to focus on a shared national identity rather than that of a religious one. Wishing not to tread on any ideas of religion, some of Amanullah’s most fanatic supporters have urged the king towards endorsing a massive propaganda campaign throughout the empire that would exalt the achievements of the king"

afghanredux.80.d:0 "Called the ‘Graveyard of Empires’ in the west, Afghanistan has been the stepping stone to some of history’s most revered statesmen and empires. An avid scholar of history, Amanullah has decided to look to Afghanistan’s past to find both legitimacy and inspiration for his leadership and reformist agenda. Shall he look to the traditionalist legacy of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire? Or perhaps Babur’s great grandson, Akbar, whose syncretic policies brought prosperity for the Mughals. Looking further to the past, Amanullah has also found inspiration in Alexander the Great and the Indo-Greek legacy of his successors. With all of these considerations in mind, the King has decided to follow ... "

afghanredux.81.d:0 "With both the Pashtun elite and his old Young Afghan allies turning their back on the king, Amanullah has sought out more like minded allies. With free rein over the government, the king is now able to pass his more controversial reforms. To facilitate his radical reforms, Amanullah Khan has sought out the rising star in the socialist scene, Nur Mohammad Taraki. While originally a journalist for the Awakened Youth, Taraki’s fate would change when he met with Abdul Ghaffar Khan, whose redshirts had fled to Afghanistan during the Hijrat. Through Abdul Khan, Taraki met with other Indian socialists and began his goal to bring socialism to the rugged mountains of Afghanistan. Taraki broke off with the Awakened Youth to form the People’s Party. Recently the People’s Party has merged with the other nascent socialist clubs to form the Eternal Flame. After a meeting between the chairman and the king, Taraki has pledged his support to Amanullah and has agreed to faithfully serve as Prime Minister. Under Amanullah and Taraki, Afghanistan is now under a uniquely Afghan breed of social monarchism."

Before the people are four major parties, largely split into two camps. There are the Islamists, dedicated to maintaining a truly Islamic government guided by Allah, uplifted by cultural reformation, and allied to the imams, with their loose coalition being split between the progressive populists of Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar’s Fatherland Party that seek to build a welfare state based on the proto-Islamic Socialism of Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī and the Tatar Wäisi, and and the conservative populists of Muhammad Iqbal’s Muslim League that seek to build a broad coalition of traditionalist and conservative Muslims across the Subcontinent. On the other hand stands the secularists which seek to distance Afghan governance from religion in different ways, with Abdul Rauf Benawa’s Awakened Youth looking towards the Religious Enlightenment in order to keep religion alive and well and respected, but wholly separate from government, and the Young Afghans of Abdul Hadi Dawi and his Liberal Kemalist nationalists that seek to divorce Afghanistan government from Islam completely.

It is no secret that our empire is already overstretched beyond comparison, so ceding some territory that will likely be a thorn in our side for decades to come is not the worst idea, but it would weaken our own plan to create a similar puppet administration across all of Persia instead. Doing so would limit our direct control over the region, but would do so by empowering one of our closest allies instead while still allowing us to reap the benefits and profits of Persia’s profitable oil industry, and while freeing us of the violent burden these new subjugated citizens will likely carry with them into the protectorate.

Most important to Amanullah, the King has studied the emperor’s drive to bring unity to a land as diverse as India. Akbar greatly encouraged debate and unity between the different faiths.

To ensure a stable transition, Shah Mahmud Khan has proposed the creation of a ‘Nonpartisan Bloc’ of sorts that would assist these political groups and proto-parties in running the nation and its new anocratic government. In the eyes of many traditionalists and conservatives, this is a no-brainer, for it would ensure that the new democratic government cannot go off the rails in its future reforms, keeping the new legislative body on a tight leash. However, believers in true, unfettered democracy - few as they are - see this nonpartisan bloc as a thinly-veiled attempt by deep-seated elitist elements to truncate the democratic process, mutilating it before it can be truly born and effectively rendering this new democracy a tool of the stable, yet possibly stagnating, status quo.

However, Ghobar has other allies he could perhaps turn to in order to realize his pink dream. Inspired by the non-violent works of the Anjuman-e-Islah-e Afghania - or Society for the Reformation of Afghans - led by the great ‘Frontier Gandhi’ Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the personal correspondence between Amanullah Khan and the late Vladimir Lenin, by the Wäisi movement of the Tatars who rallied against the Russian Tsarists in a Leftist facsimile of the liberal Jadid movement, and by the legacy of Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī - Muhammad’s disciple and history’s first true Islamic Socialist, Ghobar has many sources of strength to pull from if he were to go at his reformist dream without the aid of the conservative Islamists of his colleague Iqbal. Instead, he could even strike up a coalition with the more moderate and non-violent members of Anjuman-e-Islah-e Afghania in order to have his Fatherland Party be able to stand largely on its own and dash towards the dream of democratic and egalitarian Islamic Socialism without obstacles.

On matters of culture and society, the two could not be more diametrically opposed as Iqbal stands for tradition and the conservative status quo while Ghobar stands for reformism and societal evolution in tune with our Durrani past. However, both men are devout Muslims, allies of the imams, and quite interestingly, they share a large amount of their ideas on economic theory as well, both being populists seeking to uplift the masses while keeping them faithful and orderly. Both also curiously have spent much time personally studying figures like Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī and other early Islamic populists, though Iqbal adamantly stands against Ghobar’s position that Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī was a true Socialist.

To celebrate this divine revelation, past cultures and dynasties built great works dedicated to their new and sole God, with ornate mosques and other structures appearing all across our mountain paradise. However, none of these great works compare to the great Minaret of Jam and its similar contemporaries like the Ghazni minarets and others like them. Roughly 60 of these minarets and towers were constructed by the great Islamic conquerors of Central Asia between the 1tth and 13th centuries to honor their victories and to mark their new lands, with many still standing today not only in our own Afghanistan, but in places like India, Persia, Bukhara, Kokand, and Khiva - the most famous of which being the tallest of them all, the Kutlug Timur minaret in Urganj near Lake Sarygamysh. Not just towers to be forgotten, these minarets have influenced architecture and art in Central and Southern Asia for centuries, with even the famous Mughal Empire of India copying their design in many of their great works. However, it seems this storied legacy was not built to last. \n\nAfter centuries upon centuries of arid weather, sandstorms, earthquakes, and violent conquest all across the region, these minarets - and especially the Minaret of Jam despite its extreme isolation in one of the most inaccessible regions of the nation - have begun to fall apart. As the verses of the Qur’an chiseled into the masonry begin to decay and as the intricate brick, glazed tile, and stucco all adorned in kufic and naskhi calligraphy continues to crumble into dust, we must decide on their final fate.

Should we work to finally finish the total Islamization process, destroying and replacing the last of this potentially harmful Greco-Buddhist influence, or should we allow this portion of our history to remain as it is and always has been despite its heretical nature? Alternatively, we could work to fund a new wave of Afghan art both Islamic and Greco-Buddhist in design in order to revitalize this nearly-lost art form and uplift it as one of the many cultural facets of our nation at the crossroads that has always made Afghanistan unique.

Tying the puppet to a string attached to his wrist, the puppeteer moves the goat in a rhythmic beat as they themselves also play music using a dambora/dombra (an Afghan string instruments similar to a guitar, a balalaika or a lute), syncing the puppeteers movement to the music at all times. This multitasking musical magic is possible because the goat puppet is on a platform that has a string connected through a pipe to the instrument, creating a one-man band and play that truly is a sight to behold. Wishing to spread this unique piece of Afghan artistic culture to the rest of the nation, [AFG.getleader] has announced the creation of an entire theater dedicated to Buz-baz performances now opening in the heart of Kabul so that all in the nation can experience this traditional artform.

Traditionally softer than burfis - another related dish that is served in a more fudge-like consistency - kalakand is basically the Central and South Asian version of Italian cheesecake, being made of strained and kneaded chhena/Indian cheese that is then mixed into a boiling concoction of whole milk and water until it forms a cohesive paste. Then thickened like burfis using sugar, the kalakand mixture is finally finished with the addition of ghee (clarified butter), set to cool, then cut into squares and garnished with pistachios for flavor and aesthetic. A lovely treat for all citizens that has begun to become one of the most popular desserts in the nation, there is one man in Afghanistan that loves these little delights more than all others - our own Habibullah Kalakani. Eating dozens of these little pastries a day, kalakand has taken on its own new nickname in our state as the masses begin to call them ‘Kalakanis’ after our own Emir. Whether it is a nickname of endearment or amusement at the expense of our Emir, Kalakani himself does not know, but that has not stopped him from accepting the name change with open arms. Declaring that kalakand is a name only to be used by those dirty Indians, all Indian, or now rather Afghan milk cakes in Afghanistan are to be called Kalakanis from here on out, even forcing the local halwai to all change their storefronts and signage to match the new decree.

Also called nās, nāsor, or nasvay, naswār is a moist, powdered tobacco dip that can be found packed into the lips and under the tongues of untold thousands across Afghanistan. Coming in two main forms - a loose powder or in compacted pasted cakes mixed with lime - naswār is known for being pungent, holding a powerful smell that resembles that of freshly cut, still wet coastal hay, with its flavor being subtle until it mixes with saliva. The nicotine effect kicks in after about 5 minutes of chewing, producing a slight burn and numbing irritation on the upper lip and the tongue. The main powdered form is made by pouring water into a cement-lined cavity, to which slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and air-cured, sun-dried, powdered tobacco is added. Later, indigo is added to the mixture to impart its famous bright green color, and ash from the burning of juniper bark along with cardamom, oil, menthol, gum, sesame oil, and more can all be often added as flavoring as well, while the paste form is made by taking the prepared powder and adding water to it so that it may be rolled into little balls and set to dry, creating little chewable balls that cause the same effect. Frequently sold on platters alongside sunflower seeds and cigarettes, or in their own rolled packets, naswār and its derivatives are not only important to Afghan culture and our traditional way of life, for naswār sales both domestically and internationally help fund our economy in a major way as naswār is commonly exported to Russia and Eastern Europe, Iberia, and the rest of Central and South Asia. Cities like Herat, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Charsadda, and Mohmand are some of the largest producers of this snus-like compound, with their sale and production forming a large pillar of the urban economy while also enriching the lowly farmers that grow the tobacco in massive fields. \n\nWith all this in mind, banning naswār is out of the question entirely, despite its apparent health effects like its ability to cause cancer, but that does not mean we have no dog in this race. We can just continue to turn a blind eye to the problem in order to appease the masses, or we could actively tap into this commodity market, helping our domestic naswār business truly boom while taking a cut of the profits to further fund the state.

Pelwhani is one of the many names given to the local type of wrestling practiced not only in Afghanistan, but also across the Subcontinent. Also called belt wrestling or ‘the struggle’ in English, this form of traditional wrestling pulls both from Indian styles like Malla-yuddha, from Persian styles like Koshti  Pahlevani, and most recently from Mongolia Bökh and other similar forms from Central Asian and the Steppe, and was largely popularized across the region thanks to living titans like The Great Gama, Brahmdev Mishra, and Kodi Rammurthy Naidu to name a few, cementing Afghanistan as one of the hotbeds of traditional Asian wrestling. \n\nOn the opposite hand from these feats of human strength and skill stands our other national sport, called Buzkashi, in which two teams on horseback compete to toss a sheep or goat carcass into their respective goal. Common all throughout Central Asia, our former occupiers among the Anglos tried to replace this so-called ‘barbaric’ pastime with their own version they call Polo, but the latter never took off outside the wealthy elite and Afghan nobility while Buzkashi is played by the masses, especially among the tribal clans. Not only playing these sports on our own, both Buzkhasi and Afghan wrestling are included in the newest attempts at our nation to work diplomatically with the outside world as professional and minor leagues are created with our nomadic brethren in places like Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, and even as far as Eastern Europe and the Steppe in order to compete on an international level while strengthening our similar cultures among these foreign kin. Commonly practiced by young men and often seen as a right of passage, these sports are central pillars to traditional Afghan culture, and they shall stay in such an honored place thanks to our support and our continuing efforts to further popularize these sports not only across the nation, but our wider sphere of influence as well."

Facing this reality, our Amanullah’s partner and rock to rely on in these times is Soraya Tarzi, queen consort of Afghanistan and the beloved wife of our monarch. Originally born in the Syrian lands of the Ottoman Empire, she and her affluent family returned to Afghanistan after Habibullah allowed the many modernist Afghan exiles to return home, placing her in the court of Amanullah’s father and sealing their future fate together as a paired match. Daughter of the intellectual leader Sardar Mahmud Beg Tarzi of the Mohammadzai Pashtun tribe - a sub-tribe of the old Barakzai dynasty - who also founded the Young Afghans that serve a key role in Amanullah’s reformation and in his daughter’s own ideology, Queen Soraya is a central figure in our administration’s newest direction that strongly takes after her late father as a symbol of modernism and liberal reform. Well vested in women’s rights and humanitarian charity efforts, she has run her own women’s magazine - Irshad-e Naswan aka the Guide for Women - since 1921, which also stands as the first woman-owned intellectual property in the nation, along with her own woman’s organization the Anjuman-i Himayat-i-Niswan aka the Association for the Protection of Women: both created to champion ideas of women's suffrage both within the royal court and across the wider nation as well, along with providing information on the rights of women, child care, home economics and etiquette, social, political and international issues, and even fashion and household tips while also educating our women on Amanullah’s new laws and reforms created to protect women like the ban on polgamy or the new marriage and divorce laws. In addition to these organizations, the Queen has also worked with her Young Afghan allies to create the first women-only school and hospital in the nation in order to educate and care for women in need or at risk, in addition to numerous other ventures all the while she whispers in her husband’s ear as he plans the newly dawning age that shall soon grace our people.

Before taking the throne, many of the King’s detractors had labeled him as an agent of the British Empire, a baseless claim that has ended up being all but true.

The success of the chief’s plans rely on the judgment of those implicated and their loyalty to Nadir Shah."

With the continuation of this constitutional monarchy, a new fair and free democratic elections in our nation’s history shall be held in order to determine which party shall dominate our new parliament as they guide the creation of this infantile democratic system, and by extension which party leader shall rise to the esteemed position of Prime Minister. Before the people are four major parties, largely split into two camps. There are the Islamists, dedicated to maintaining a truly Islamic government guided by Allah, uplifted by cultural reformation, and allied to the imams, with their loose coalition being split between the progressive populists of Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar’s Fatherland Party that seek to build a welfare state based on the proto-Islamic Socialism of Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī and the Tatar Wäisi, and and the conservative populists of Muhammad Iqbal’s Muslim League that seek to build a broad coalition of traditionalist and conservative Muslims across the Subcontinent. On the other hand stands the secularists which seek to distance Afghan governance from religion in different ways, with Abdul Rauf Benawa’s Awakened Youth looking towards the Religious Enlightenment in order to keep religion alive and well and respected, but wholly separate from government, and the Young Afghans of Abdul Hadi Dawi and his Liberal Kemalist nationalists that seek to divorce Afghanistan government from Islam completely. Now all we must do is wait for the votes to come in and be counted as the people decide their fate once again."

afghanredux.131.d:0 "Designed around 1933, the Disston Tractor Tank, aka the Disston 6-ton, is just one example of many experimental armored vehicles designed in America and by the other great powers as well that utilized caterpillar tractors and an armored superstructure as ways for these nations to practice and perfect tank design since their inception during Great War while turning a buck by exporting them to smaller, more desperate nations and militaries along the way. The Disston itself is made up of one such simplistic armored chassis, anywhere from 6 to 13mm thick, affixed atop said caterpillar tracks that can move the vehicles along at a top speed of about 10kmph/5mph, while being fitted with a hull-mounted .30 cal Marlin machine gun all below a turret sporting a 37mm M1916 cannon, amounting to a slowly moving metal box as dangerous to any soft targets around it as it is to its own three-man crew inside - earning our new tankers the nickname of the new Jaanbaz, taken from the old Afghan cavalry in service of the Shah whose title meant ‘life gamblers’. Nevertheless, these beasts are all we got, and after the Americans failed to find a buyer for these metal deathtraps anywhere else in the world, we were able to secure their entire stock - a whopping 5 tanks - of these experimental relics at a massively reduced cost in 1935, importing them through the Port of Karachi by boat from America and then by train the rest of the way to Kabul, and now after being fully integrated into our armed forces, we are ready to see the results. Though some international onlookers from our allied foreign attachés - whom have been training us on the Disston’s use and wider armored tactics - have laughed at the sight of such a vehicle while likening the Disston’s boxy and ‘scrappy’ appearance to something called a ‘Bob Semple’, whatever that is, we know the truth! These are the mightiest armored vehicles to ever trudge across the sands and mountains of Central Asia, and with this mighty land fleet at our command, Afghanistan’s dominance is all but assured!"

Emulating the conquerors of old by taking over Delhi, the invaders have thrown the entire commonwealth in disarray! The British forces and their Indian auxiliaries have been overwhelmed and routed, fleeing to the ports of Karachi and Ahmadabad to escape the collapsing nation. Massive concessions have been granted to the jubilant Afghans, ceding enough land to nearly double the size of the Emirate. The Entente has declared that the Afghan victory was a fluke and not a representative of its weakness, while the Princely States and the Commune look upon the lands with an opportunistic eye! Afghan newspapers have declared it to be the beginning of the end for infidel rule in India and the Emir appears to have consolidated his power. Meanwhile, the other major powers of the world have not released any statements regarding this development as they didn’t expect an Afghani victory. While the Entente is shaken, those in Paris and Berlin look in glee as their rivals of the former British Empire sink further into despair.

The King, after hearing news of the victory, has declared it to be a sign of changing times, promising that the citizens of the dominion will be rewarded in due time for their bravery and valor in the battle for the Crown. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Afghanistan has fallen into instability, with some even advocating for the Emir to step down after this embarrassing defeat to the “Infidels”. With the Emir’s rule openly questioned, more and more of the radical elements of Afghan society have started to spread their influence to try and destabilize the nation. The bandits under a Kohistani Tajik named Habibullah Kalakani have started to raid cities and engage in looting and pillaging as they see fit with some even saying that the bandit leader eyes the Durr-e-durran throne itself.

The Dominion has declared that Afghans will not be treated as equal citizens and will have dominion status to allow for more flexible British rule. Meanwhile, the Afghani nation has been in a frenzy and has watched in horror as British troops have marched into their towns and declared that the kingdom is no more. The Emir after signing the surrender has gone into exile to Holy cities to spend the rest of his time in front of God to beg his forgiveness for his rash decision to invade the British when he knew he couldn’t win.

Racked by the sudden departure of Emir Habibullah and a failed putsch by the Crown Prince, Nasrullah Khan, the city of Kabul had been left to the wolves. Weeks prior, the Saqqawist forces led by the infamous Habibullah Kalakani, known to many as Bacha ye-Saquo, have circled Kabul like vultures, waiting for their moment to strike. Initially being repelled in previous skirmishes, the Bacha and his men had exploited the fallout of Nasrullah Khan’s failed coup and finally seized control of Kabul. In search of plunder, Kalakani and his bloodthirsty brigands have laid waste to the city, committing horrific acts of looting, rape, and murder. These atrocious acts have already led numerous tribal chiefs to begin mobilizing their levies to oppose the Saqqawists. With the Bacha declaring himself ‘Emir’, the world can only wonder how long these bandits can hold on to their ill-gotten gains."

The prince was able to quickly forge an alliance with anti-Saqqawist tribes to put an end to the bandit king’s tyranny. While the Prince’s forces were equally matched in the early stages of his campaign, the diplomatic isolation of Kalakani’s ‘Emirate’ and a series of irrecoverable losses caused the collapse of Kalakani’s bandit army. Nadir Khan’s arrival in Kabul was met with celebration and an assembly of local elites elected Nadir Khan to become the next Emir, a position he initially refused, but graciously accepted. The months following Kalakani’s takeover of Kabul have left untold amounts of death and destruction throughout the nation, and the victorious Emir must work diligently if he is to bring Afghanistan back from the brink."

Amanullah's death-marred path to the throne concluded when the investigation into the murder of his father revealed that Nasrullah Khan, the heir-apparent to the throne, was solely responsible for the Emir's death. Nasrullah was subsequently arrested by forces loyal to Amanullah, who was then proclaimed King. Amanullah, a die-hard reformist who has often taken inspiration from the Ottoman Empire's Mustafa Kemal, is determined to transform Afghanistan into a modern state. His objectives are easier said than done however, as Afghanistan is a nation seemingly trapped in the past, and it is clear that his attempts at reform will be bitterly resisted by Afghanistan's Pashtun elites. Whether Amanullah can persevere his administration, or if he will fail and succumb to the chaos remains to be seen as this renegade 'Reformist King' begins formalizing his grandiose plans for Afghanistan."

Fearing that the ambitious Nasrullah might’ve seized the throne from the former Emir, Habibullah had made Nasrullah both commander in chief of the Afghan Royal Army and designated heir to the throne, superseding even his own sons. With the Emir’s assassination, Nasrullah’s ascension was challenged by Habibullah’s youngest son, Amanullah Khan, who claimed that the Crown Prince was behind the late Emir’s death. Amanullah’s conspiracy was quickly thwarted by loyalists in the army and the defeated prince fled the nation in shame. Nasrullah Khan’s ambitions are only matched by his piety. Along with his allies in the clergy, the new Emir seeks to rule in adherence to Islamic doctrine, reverse the reforms of the late Habibullah, and restore the influence of the Islamic aristocracy over the government. Nasrullah’s anti-reformist direction has won the Emir the support of Afghanistan's conservative Pashtun nobility, who view the Crown Prince’s rise to power as a much-needed return to stability in the nation."

Known throughout the royal court as the ‘wild card’, Nadir Khan’s motivations and loyalties have ultimately been a mystery. Returning to Afghanistan shortly after Emir Habibullah’s victory in the Fourth Anglo-Afghan War, Nadir Khan had been fostering ties among dissident officers in the Royal Army to undermine support for Nasrullah Khan. With the army’s support, Nadir Khan marched on Kabul and ordered the arrest of the Emir for the murder of the late Habibullah Khan and seized control of the throne for himself. The Soldier Prince has promised to greatly modernize Afghanistan while not abandoning its tradition and to restore law and order to the unruly Afghan countryside. With his true intentions still unknown, it seems that only Nadir Khan knows the fate of the nation."

Most of our standing army is reliant on levies from the various tribes under our rule, and almost all of them are severely lacking in equipment, with many preferring the ancestral jezail flintlock than a standard issue rifle. This stagnation means that our armies are often underequipped and will likely crumble in the face of a modernized adversary."

His enemies still circle, waiting for their time to strike but they will be dealt with in time. It's up to the new Emir to decide the future fate of Afghanistan. While it's impossible to say what Nasrullah will do, his almost unmatched zealotry, love of tradition, and alliance with the conservative religious elements of society can give the world a hint as to what the future holds for the country."

With the Conservatives rallying behind the new Emir their great influence over the country has begun to be exerted in Nasrullah’s favor. Rival factions, claimants and disgruntled citizenry are slowly dispersing as their support evaporates behind this groundswell of support for Nasrullah. With his throne secure however, Nasrullah can really get down to business."
AFG_consolidate_rule:0 "Bring Unity to the Empire"
AFG_consolidate_rule_desc:0 "The instability that has plagued the Emirate has to come to an end if Afghanistan is to thrive. Various rebellions of equally various sizes still roam the countryside, taking advantage of the near-anarchy ushered in by the chaos of Habibullah’s death. While Nasrullah is kind to his friends, these rebels are not his friends. All available military force will be used to disperse these rebels and finally unify the state."

AFG_seize_press:0 "Oversee the Press"
AFG_seize_press_desc:0 "Afghanistan does not have a lot of press outlets already, and most of those we do have are printed. While Nasrullah respects the press and values their independence, he cannot let them run amok. If they print falsehoods, they could destabilize the Emirate and throw the nation into chaos. To remedy this, Nasrullah will invite the heads of the largest media companies in the country to meet with him. They won't be outright censored per se, but Nasrullah will make it clear that any falseness will be punished. Severely."

We saw what happened when their progenitor, the Young Turks, took over the Sublime Porte. The group is already reeling from the exile of their man in the Royal Family, Amanullah. Nasrullah has ordered the police and army to launch a series of raids on known Young Afghan hideouts and ordered its leaders arrested. With their leaders gone, the wayward souls will return to the fold and be welcomed."

The Emirate is tied fundamentally to Allah, so Habibullah’s attempts to separate the two are simply laughable. Nasrullah, with the support of his cleric allies, will begin to undo these ‘reforms’ and make Afghanistan right once more. We will mesh our state into its fundamental religion so much that to try and separate the two once more would be impossible. "

He and his brigands continue to be a thorn in our side trying to pull our nation even further to the right. However, while some in our military and government want us to outright destroy him, Nasrullah remains hesitant. While Kalakani at his most radical is little more than a despot, some of his less radical positions are not too different from Nasrullah, and rumor has it that there are talks between him and the bandit king."
AFG_traditional_roles:0 "Re-establish the Darogha"

Our additions in India only magnify this problem. To better control the rabble Nasrullah has returned to the past to reestablish the Darogha, a local police force in the Mughal Empire. They will be assigned to governors to be distributed as they see fit, within some parameters, and in more rural areas will effectively be the Government. As such, they shall undergo harsh vetting. In any case, we already have hundreds of them ready with thousands more on the way. "

AFG_mission_to_istanbul_desc:0 "The Sultan in Istanbul is both Sultan of the last great Caliphate and the Caliph of all Islam. Nasrullah, as a deeply religious man, seeks to strengthen ties with the Porte. Not only is the Caliph a religious strongman, but his hold over the Middle East is tenuous but still undeniable. While the Dominion may be gearing up for another round of warfare, an alliance with Istanbul would strangle that hope in its cradle and make Afghanistan as peaceful as the Middle East!"

That has made his true loyalties suspect. Until now he has made no real effort to take the throne but Nasrullah knows of his true ambitions, and the fact he plans on eventually acting on them.

While the Kaiser’s help has been invaluable, his soldiers have begun to gather a clique of seditionists and fifth columnists around them seeking to draw Afghanistan closer to Berlin. This simply cannot continue. While it would be simple to expel them all, doing that would anger the Kaiser and alienate a good friend in times of crisis. Instead, Nasrullah will send a letter to the Kaiser and ask him politely to draw back most of the Expedition. The skeleton crew that remains will be useful to us while also being so hobbled as to not be a threat to Nasrullah’s rule."

He once ran it as its Commander in Chief, he led it in the battle against the decadent Raj while his elder brother drowned in decadence and now he leads it once more not as simply Commander in Chief, but Emir. His military victories and consolidation of the Army behind him have gained him the moniker, ‘the Soldier Emir’.

Imperialists of the British and Indian flavors, Indian nationalists, and general dissenters of the Emir’s rule have made the area their home. Nasrullah has finally decided to do something about this and has ordered the Darogha to sweep the New Territories for potential trouble areas with orders to ‘deal with all problems promptly’. Reports of executions in the streets are already pouring in and are only expected to get more frequent."

Nasrullah has put forward a proposal to adopt a modified version of this for Afghanistan. This has caused some debate among his advisors. Those loyal to Nasrullah point out how it led the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb to new heights economically and militarily while also keeping resistance to the Mughals repressed. They also point out that the Raj still uses a version of this as their own law. The proposal's enemies condemn it as too restrictive, too open to interpretation, and therefore unable to be properly enforced. However, it’s up to Nasrullah to decide."
AFG_sharia_administration:0 "Reimpose Sharia?"

This has been met with both celebration from the Conservative elements of society and clerics while simultaneously enraging more liberal elements, particularly among these are the Hindus, an outspoken minority who has opposed Nasrullah since he took the throne. If we go through with this they will surely fight back. Ultimately, it’s up for Nasrullah to decide."

AFG_return_of_jizya_desc:0 "For any state to function it must collect its taxes. The ruggedness of Afghanistan has made this an issue for every one of its rulers. Nasrullah is determined to overcome this hurdle. A new system of tax collection will be instituted to ensure all of Afghanistan’s subjects pay their due to the Crown so the state may be properly maintained. This will cause considerable grumbling, especially among the tribes who were able to slip away from taxes for so long, but that is the price we must pay."

AFG_patronize_works:0 "Facilitate Spread of Islamic Culture"
AFG_patronize_works_desc:0 "Afghanistan is a mix of Indian, Central Asian, Islamic, and even remnant Greek culture. This cultural disunity cannot stand if Afghanistan is to continue to function. Nasrullah will set up a Department of Islamic Culture to promote and encourage Islamic culture in the areas it is weakest. New Islamic newspapers will be printed, Islamic will replace local languages, and monuments to non-Islamic heroes will be replaced or overshadowed by new ones. This is a heavy step to take, to suppress dissenting cultures in favor of our own, but the hardest choices take the strongest wills."

Nasrullah, emulating this great man, will do the same. The decadence of his predecessor will be curtailed and the money saved will be donated to the newly established Afghan Prosperity Fund and to mosques.

Under the just and pious rule of Nasrullah Khan, scholars will arrive in Kabul and usher in a second Islamic Golden Age. Our government will provide incentives to these scholars, allowing them to conduct their studies here in Afghanistan. Through our efforts, we will become the shining light of the Islamic world. "

AFG_ottoman_exile:0 "The Sublime Porte Finds Safe Harbor!"
AFG_ottoman_exile_desc:0 "Ottoman officials who are still loyal to the Sultanate have found their way to Afghanistan after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. These displaced soldiers, officers, and administrators are loyal to Osman Fuad Efendi, the ‘Warrior Prince’, who has refused to give up any claims to the Sultanate despite Abdülmecid’s abdication. Honoring our ancient traditions of Pashtunwali, we will welcome our fellow brothers of the faith to our mountain home."
AFG_ottoman_ex_army_refuge:0 "The Army's Arrival"
AFG_ottoman_ex_army_refuge_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, the Ottoman Army was the most feared force in all of Europe and the Near East. Even in its twilight years, it took a combined force of all of the Sublime Porte’s enemies to overwhelm the armed forces. Those within the Ottoman Army who are still loyal to the rightful Sultan have finally arrived in Afghanistan. With their expertise, the Royal Afghan Army will reach new heights!"
AFG_ottoman_ex_industry_refuge:0 "Provide Refuge for Ottoman Industry"
AFG_ottoman_ex_industry_refuge_desc:0 "Many prominent Ottoman industrialists have fled the chaos that has engulfed their homeland. We will provide these exiled entrepreneurs refuge here in Afghanistan, providing them protection from the ravenous bandits and invading armies. With our vast natural resources and their expertise, we will bring economic prosperity to the Afghan nation."
AFG_ottoman_ex_sultan_refuge:0 "The Warrior Prince's Arrival"
AFG_ottoman_ex_sultan_refuge_desc:0 "After the abdication of Abdülmecid II, the rightful sultan Osman Fuad has narrowly escaped death and has finally made his way to the mountains of Khurasan. From here, the Warrior Prince has begun to lay out his plans for the restoration of the Ottoman Empire. We will join the rightful sultan in reclaiming what was stolen by the Egyptians and their perfidious allies."
AFG_ottoman_ex_brains_refuge:0 "The Salvation of Millet Mektepleri"
AFG_ottoman_ex_brains_refuge_desc:0 "Some of the finest universities in the Islamic world are located within the lands of the Sublime Porte. With the fall of the empire, the centuries worth of knowledge are threatened by the chaos brought upon by the Egyptians and their Axis. We must recover these treasures of the past as well as granting these exiled scholars refuge here in Kabul."
AFG_ottoman_ex_navy_refuge:0 "Scuttle the Ottoman Navy"
AFG_ottoman_ex_navy_refuge_desc:0 "Despite the near impossible odds, a small contingent of the Ottoman fleet have outmaneuvered the Egyptian navy and have found  their way to our ports. The Ottoman Navy was a force of Strength for the empire but now it lacks a homeland. With our ports and economy ultimately incapable of supporting such a large fleet, we will scuttle these ships to prevent them falling into the wrong hands."

AFG_ottoman_sultan_takes_over_desc:0 "Through Osman Fuad’s clever political maneuvering, the Sultan has seized the title of Shāh Durr-i-Durrān from the foolish Nasrullah Khan. With the Emir reduced to a mere figurehead, the Afghan government and the Royal Army are firmly under the leadership of the Sultan’s loyalists. Under Osman IV, the Ottoman Empire rises from the ashes, stronger than the enemies that tried to destroy it."

AFG_ottoman_nasrullah_holds_on_desc:0 "By making concessions with the Ottoman loyalists, Emir Nasrullah has successfully lowered tensions with the exiles and has stabilized the nation. Under our joint government, Afghans and Ottomans both enjoy an equal role in the administration of the new empire. With this decision, the destinies of Afghanistan and the Sublime Porte have become intertwined. Glory to the Emir and the Sultan!"

AFG_ottoman_ex_800_years_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire has had its highs and lows, but it will never truly fall until every last drop of Turkish blood is strewn across the fields of battle. The Sublime Porte has stood since the 13th century and it will stand resilient until the 23rd century. Let us embark on our righteous mission to save our empire from the designs of those who sought to destroy us. Never again shall we fall to insurrection and foreign invasion!"
AFG_ottoman_ex_iran_war:0 "Pave the Way Home"
AFG_ottoman_ex_iran_war_desc:0 "If we are to return to our homeland in Anatolia, we must first traverse the rugged Zagros Mountains in Persia. Luckily for us, the Persians and their tenuous alliance with Egypt is already showing cracks. We will follow in the legacy of the great Sultan Murad III, and once again bring the Persian Empire to its knees!"
AFG_ottoman_ex_caucasus_war:0 "Scale the Caucasus"
AFG_ottoman_ex_caucasus_war_desc:0 "The indomitable mountains of the Caucasus have long been an important region for the Sublime Porte. This diverse mountain range is home to both our close allies in Azerbaijan and our historic foes in Armenia and Georgia. A campaign in this region may seem daunting but beyond the mountains lies vast deposits of oil and the largest exporters of grain in Europe."
AFG_ottoman_ex_russia_war:0 "Topple the Bear!"
AFG_ottoman_ex_russia_war_desc:0 "Past the Caucasus Mountain lies our mortal Russian adversary. For centuries, our two empires fought for supremacy over the Black Sea and the Caucasus. The Russian Bear has always eyed our land with hate and greed, and now we shall pay them in kind by bringing devastation to their lands and driving them out of our domain once and for all."
AFG_ottoman_ex_iraq_war:0 "Seize the Levant"
AFG_ottoman_ex_iraq_war_desc:0 "The Levant has always been an important part of both the Sultanate and the Islamic world. The historic city of Baghdad was once the capital of Islamic science and culture, and to this day it still remains a crucial point for global trade. More recently, the rich oil deposits in this region have caught the attention of the global powers of the Reichspakt and the Entente. We must reassert our control before any foreign power takes the oil fields for themselves."
AFG_ottoman_ex_cairo_war:0 "Fire in Cairo"
AFG_ottoman_ex_cairo_war_desc:0 "The Egyptians so foolishly believed that they and the lackeys in their ‘Axis’ had finally brought an end to the Ottoman Empire. Now they can only hide in fear behind the Suez Canal, watching as their former allies in Persia and the Levant fell like dominoes to our righteous armies. Cairo has seen independence for too long and now must feel the iron fist of the empire as we return to our former glory."
AFG_ottoman_ex_restoration:0 "Restoration of the Sublime Porte"
AFG_ottoman_ex_restoration_desc:0 "After a hard fought campaign, we have finally retaken Kostantiniyye and have saved the Ottoman Empire from complete destruction.

AFG_ottoman_ex_what_now_desc:0 "At long last, Kostantiniyye is ours again! The Ottoman Empire rises from the ashes once more to make the west cower in fear. But before we set out to restore our ancient glories, we must first reward the Afghans who offered us refuge in the empire's darkest hour. What role shall the Afghans play in our restored Sultanate?"
AFG_ottoman_ex_inseperable_bond:0 "Forge an Inseperable Bond"
AFG_ottoman_ex_inseperable_bond_desc:0 "It was not only the Ottoman or the Afghan, but the combined effort of both nations to restore the Sultanate to its rightful place. As the two armies marched side by side, the division between our two nations had slowly begun to fade. The bond between the Turks and Afghans is now inseparable, may the ascendant Afghan-Ottoman Empire last for a thousand years!"
AFG_ottoman_ex_die_europe:0 "The Final Balkan War"
AFG_ottoman_ex_die_europe_desc:0 "It seems that the wider world had wrongfully believed that our Empire, the so-called ‘sick man’ of Europe, had finally come to an end. They thought that we were a spent force, collapsing under the weight of a foreign invasion and revolts. With the restoration of the Sultanate, a new golden age dawns on the Sublime Porte. As a show of strength, our armies will cross the Bosphorus and return to Europe once again."
AFG_ottoman_ex_africa_war:0 "Hayreddin's Legacy"
AFG_ottoman_ex_africa_war_desc:0 "It was during the 16th century that the great Hayreddin Pasha was able to establish Ottoman dominance over the Mediterranean Sea. Originally a corsair, Hayreddin and his brothers rose to prominence by launching raids on Spanish and Portuguese ships, halting European efforts to assert their rule over Algiers and Tunis. Hayreddin’s efforts caught the attention of Suleiman the Magnificent, who made him Grand Admiral of the Ottoman Navy. We will follow in Hayreddin’s footsteps and bring Ottoman dominance back to North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea. Once again shall the Europeans fear to traverse the Barbary Coast!"

# AMANULLAH #

AFG_amanullah:0 "The Prodigal Son"
AFG_amanullah_desc:0 "Amanullah will not be denied his rightful rule over Afghanistan! Having ousted all competitors, Amanullah sits on an unstable throne. Advancing a reformist agenda, Amanullah undoubtedly will now shoulder the monumental task of reforming the Afghan nation. Whether his vision of a modernized Afghanistan comes to fruition, or if his dream will come crumbling down remains to be seen."
AFG_western_ways:0 "Learn from Western Reformers"
AFG_western_ways_desc:0 "While the Middle East and Central Asia as of now is stuck in something of a backwater compared to Europe, there are no shortage of reformers in the Muslim World who have managed to gradually yet substantially modernize their own nations. Amanullah, seeing in such great men like the Ottoman Empire’s Mustafa Kemal and Persia’s Reza Khan a model for a better future, will accordingly take influence from these visionary and often radical thinkers in matters of state."
AFG_continuing_habibullah_reforms:0 "Advancing Habibullah's Reforms"
AFG_continuing_habibullah_reforms_desc:0 "While Habibullah was a visionary and a modernizer, his reforms were not expansive enough to pull Afghanistan out from the muck which envelopes it. Amanullah, in turn, has elected not only to push the reforms of Habibullah, but to also advance them, ensuring that Afghanistan will advance to the future; much to the dismay of the traditionalist Pashtun elite. The people of this country will breathe the fresh air of modernism, even if we must drag our populace into modernity kicking and screaming."
AFG_free_press:0 "Emancipation of the Press"
AFG_free_press_desc:0 "The concept of a ‘Free Press’ is alien to the good people of Afghanistan. While some meager freedoms exist, the legacy of the press controls instituted under Habibullah still exist. To aid in our transformation into a truly free state, Amanullah has called for the full freedom of press in addition to establishing Afghanistan’s first public radio station: Radio Kabul."
AFG_2nd_islamic_golden_age:0 "The 2nd Islamic Golden Age"
AFG_2nd_islamic_golden_age_desc:0 "Amanullah’s modernizing outlook has led to an influx of academics and students to Afghanistan, leading to what some would call a ‘Second Islamic Golden Age’, right here in Afghanistan. No longer shall our nation be known as a backwater, instead Kabul will become the new Baghdad as the center of scientific advancement in the Islamic world. "
AFG_womens_rights:0 "The Push for Women's Rights"
AFG_womens_rights_desc:0 "Any modern King needs a modern Queen; accordingly, alongside the great Amanullah Khan is his wife and queen consort: Soraya Tarzi, the daughter of the great Mahmud Tarzi and a tireless advocate for the rights of women. A great influence behind some of her husband’s reforms, Tarzi and Amanullah have pushed for the greater emancipation of Afghan women, and have embarked on a campaign against the veil, against polygamy, child marriage, and to encourage education of girls and women."
AFG_emancipation:0 "The Emancipation Proclamation"
AFG_emancipation_desc:0 "While Slavery was officially banned in 1923 during the Reign of Habibullah Khan, it has unofficially persisted in more limited ways since then. In accordance with our platform of aggressive modernization, Amanullah will fully crack down on slavery while drafting a modern bill of rights to be included in the new constitution."
AFG_bank:0 "Bank-e-Millie"
AFG_bank_desc:0 "Afghanistan is a land fundamentally not used to financial institutions; with even the concepts of physical currency being alien to most of our nation. To help our finances along, King Amanullah has created the Bank-e-Millie, an organized financial institution that will be able to help our infantile economy flourish."
AFG_tax_code:0 "Reform the Tax Code"
AFG_tax_code_desc:0 "Part of what has helped the great Empires of Europe flourish was the ability to effectively gather funds to pay for government expenses. While we have tried to maintain a proper taxation system, most government funds have been stolen by errant tribesmen or skimmed off the top by corrupt bureaucrats. Under Amanullah’s watch, our outdated tax code shall be massively overhauled under the guidance of the central government alone."
AFG_new_bureaucracy:0 "A Modern Bureaucracy"
AFG_new_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Long has our nation’s bureaucracy been filled with corrupt lackeys and tribal warlords; useless yes men who serve to do nothing but fill their own pockets. This unofficial system of secondary governance shall come to an end under Amanullah’s watch. Instead of bickering warlords, we will hire dedicated administrators and civil servants, and will move towards the creation of a modernized administration that can steadily lead the nation towards the future."
AFG_national_assembly:0 "Establish the National Assembly"
AFG_national_assembly_desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest hallmark of a truly modern state is an independent legislature; with our modernization campaign well underway, the creation of an independent parliament is finally in order. Drifting away from the outdated system of tribal courts that has ruled the nation for centuries, Amanullah has pushed for the creation of a modern Bicameral National Assembly to meet the needs of the Afghan nation."
AFG_pluralist_imperialism:0 "A Truly Pluralist Empire"
AFG_pluralist_imperialism_desc:0 "Afghanistan is not one people, but rather the makeup of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, and dozens of other tribes, all residing within our mountain home. To complicate the situation further, our recent Indian conquests have only added to the countless tribes living within our new domain. Taking influence from the ambitious reformists of the Habsburg Empire, King Amanullah will foster the creation of a pluralist Afghan society that meets the needs of all of the nation’s people. While many Pashtun chauvinists within the ruling elite grumble at the King’s decision, these reforms will bring much needed unity and stability to our realm."
AFG_meritocratic_governance:0 "The New Aristocracy"
AFG_meritocratic_governance_desc:0 "Our newly conquered Indian territories are home to countless local Princes and Chiefs who continue to hold great sway over their subjects.

AFG_reformed_subahs_desc:0 "While we are grateful for our newly acquired lands, our Indian conquest has caused quite the strain on our nation’s resources. To solve this question of administration, must come to a formal decision on how to administer these new territories. Shall we reform the Subah system? Delegate to Tribal Princes? Or shall we simply trust the locals with their own administrative matters. "
AFG_question_of_religion:0 "A Question of Faith"
AFG_question_of_religion_desc:0 "While our new conquests are inhabited by many of our Islamic brothers of the faith, there are equally as many adherents to other religions such as Hinduism or the esoteric Baháʼí faith. With this pressing question on everyone’s minds, we must decide what our stance on organized religion should be,if we are to have one at all."
AFG_babur:0 "The Legacy of Babur the Founder"
AFG_babur_desc:0 "Seeking to preserve stability within the Afghan nation, King Amanullah has carefully heeded the words of the influential conservative nobility. Alongside his traditionalist Pashtun allies, Amanullah rules over Afghanistan’s new territories along the Indus through a traditionalist, Islamic lens. Seeking to build legitimacy among his new Islamic subjects, King Amanullah has begun drawing comparisons to himself and the founder of the Mughal Empire, Babur the Great. This decision, however, will certainly provoke the powerful Hindu princes that reside within our frontier provinces."
AFG_akbar:0 "Memories of Akbar the Great"
AFG_akbar_desc:0 "Continuing to cooperate with his time-honored Young Afghan allies, King Amanullah has decided to walk a moderate path in regards to administering the new Indian territories. With the modernist Young Afghans, the new government has promised the creation of a secular constitutional monarchy that meets the needs of all of its subjects. Taking influence from history, Amanullah has paralleled his policies to that of Akbar the Great. While many are satisfied with this change in course, the traditionalist Pashtun nobles and skeptical Hindu princes have shown hostilty against the King."
AFG_alexander:0 "In the Footsteps of Alexander"
AFG_alexander_desc:0 "In a surprising turn, King Amanullah has decided to co-opt his more radical reforms with his pro-Indian stance towards the administration of the new territories. Seeking to create a new society that is neither wholly Afghan nor Indian, the King has begun his attempt to syncretize Afghan and Indian culture. Looking to the past for inspiration, Amanullah has taken influence from Alexander the Great and his legacy. While his new Indian subjects cautiously support the King, both the Pashtun nobility and Amanullah’s Young Afghan allies are furious with this decision."

AFG_AMN_destroy_reactionaries:0 "Quiet the Reactionary Voices"
AFG_AMN_destroy_reactionaries_desc:0 "The cries of reactionaries have often drowned out Amanullah’s calls for aggressive reforms and modernization. While we wish to advance into a more stable future, the incessant tribalists have dragged their heels, and continue to delay our advancement into the future. To help keep our government running smoothly, we shall institute a massive propaganda campaign slandering these groups, ensuring that responsibility for the death of Habibullah Khan is placed squarely on their de-facto leader :Nasrullah Khan."
AFG_AMN_quell_countryside:0 "Quell the Countryside"
AFG_AMN_quell_countryside_desc:0 "The countryside and vast mountains of Afghanistan still echo with the voices of discontent. The fact that strife and bandits are more commonplace than forces loyal to the King in our hinterlands is a cause for serious concern. The only way to pacify these wild outlands is with the use of excessive force. There will be no negotiation, these monsters will only respond to a display of brutality and will."
AFG_AMN_young_afghans_thrive:0 "A New Age of Afghan Patriotism"
AFG_AMN_young_afghans_thrive_desc:0 "Emulating the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire proper, the Young Afghans will begin ushering in a new era of Afghan patriotism and nationalism, while also supporting pan islamic and modernist ideas.

AFG_AMN_expand_habibia_desc:0 "In 1903, Emir Habibullah ordered the construction of the Habibia High School. Habibia has already educated the new generation of Afghanistan and we must continue its mission. King Amanullah will greatly expand the Habibia School in addition to providing financial support to the school. Seeking to continue in his father’s legacy, Amanullah will also establish his own namesake school. the Amani High School. Utilizing our close relationship with the Kaiserreich, the Amani School will specialize in a European styled curriculum as well as German language courses. While we educate Afghanistan’s young minds, the Amani School in turn helps us draw closer to the Reich." 
AFG_AMN_draft_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
AFG_AMN_draft_constitution_desc:0 "With the political crisis averted, Amanullah and the Afghan government can finally begin drafting the new constitution. This document will allow us to define the future of our nation, as well as allowing us to codify the reforms of the King and his allies. The constitutional framework will allow us to provide funds to our run down ministries and finally put an end to corruption within the old administration."
AFG_AMN_gradual_1:0 "Compromise with the Heart of the Nation"
AFG_AMN_gradual_1_desc:0 "King Amanullah, while undoubtedly a progressive reformer, is still an Autocrat at heart, and thus has decided that the best path forward is one of compromise. While we wish for rapid and far-reaching reform, we must remain realistic in our ambitions. We shall reach common ground with reactionary elements to ensure continued stability, while making gradual reforms that will slowly yet surely transform the very face of Afghanistan. While the prospect of Afghanistan becoming a Constitutional Monarchy any time soon is dead in the water, our pragmatic stance will ensure that Afghanistan will not be consumed by the furies of instability."
AFG_AMN_moderate_1:0 "Only the Young Afghans!"
AFG_AMN_moderate_1_desc:0 "While Amanullah has managed to stay afloat through the storms that surround us, he has not persevered without generous aid. With the Young Afghans firmly winning out as the most influential faction in the Government, Amanullah, with the Young Afghans by his side, will continue the modernizing mission. The good people of Afghanistan will soon be able to breathe the fresh air of freedom while staying shielded from some of the King's more 'radical' ideas. The Young Afghans will thrive as the installer of democracy to this chaotic land, transforming Afghanistan into a true European-style Constitutional Monarchy, which will allow all Afghans to have a say in their own futures."
AFG_AMN_ultra_1:0 "Only Me."
AFG_AMN_ultra_1_desc:0 "The King, while cautioned against making his more 'radical' ideals into concrete policy, has nonetheless advanced an agenda consisting of his wills alone. This radical approach has cost him the support of the Young Afghans, who until now have been his most ardent backers; in their stead, Amanullah has gained the support of one Nur Muhammad Taraki and his 'Party of the Eternal Flame'. With the pseudo-reactionary Young Afghans turning their backs on Amanullah, we can finally indulge the most radical of Amanullah's policies, throwing out any pretense and allowing Afghanistan to thrive as a truly Socialist State. Untrammeled, we will destroy all the malefactors of Afghanistan with a fist of scarlet steel, bringing our nation into the future and deposing the legacy of Imperialism forever."

AFG_AMN_facilitate_trade_desc:0 "Historically Afghanistan was at the crossroads of the old Silk Road, serving as an intermediary for traders arriving from the East and West. For centuries, our nation greatly profited from this trade but recent conflicts have dried up these once profitable routes. Striving towards the creation of a modern Silk Road, our government will encourage foreign capital to invest in the nation’s growing financial sector. Through our cooperation in a new economic world, the gold will once again flow into Afghanistation."

AFG_AMN_10_year_plan_desc:0 "Our compromise with the nobility has led to some of our detractors accusing King Amanullah of being a spent force in Afghan politics. While we ensured stability instead of rapidly reforming, Amanullah will prove that his reforms will arrive one way or another. Amanullah has laid the foundations of what would be the first of many Ten-Year-Plans. This careful planning will allow us to promote massive improvements over a long amount of time. These economic plans have won the support of both traditionalist and reformist elements of the government as it allows for gradual, but meaningful, change."

AFG_AMN_aristocracy_desc:0 "While we may not reap the rewards initially, the gradual economic reforms brought upon by King Amanullah has already guided the nation towards a positive trend.

During the chaos following his father’s death, Amanullah revealed the wicked plot of the tyrannical Nasrullah Khan, and secured the throne. All of Afghanistan must recognize the selflessness of their King, who had sacrificed everything to free the nation from the shackles of reaction and foreign imperialism."

AFG_AMN_cleric_hostility_desc:0 "Reminiscent of the reign of his father Habibullah, the early years of Amanullah’s rule were constantly impeded by tribal chiefs and the Islamic clergy. As Amanullah attempted to bring Afghanistan from a feudal backwater to a modern functioning state, these snakes only tried to pull the nation back into the shadows of religious zealotry and tribalism. With the Pashtun elite finally humbled and put under the thumb of Amanullah, we can destroy the pervasive influence of these reactionaries once and for all! To combat their influence, the government has moved to nationalize the assets of the clergy and the tribal elites."

AFG_AMN_economic_collectivization_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Amanullah’s new Prime Minister, Nur Muhammad Taraki, Afghanistan’s antiquated economy will be overhauled along the lines of a true socialist nation. The cities of Kabul and Herat will become new centers of industry thanks to extensive economic planning by Amanullah and the party leadership. In the countryside, the government has approved a massive land reform effort, seeking to limit the amount of land a family can own. These excess lands will be seized by the government to which they are to be redistributed to the local populace."

AFG_AMN_the_red_emir_desc:0 "While he was betrayed by his so-called ‘allies’ among the Pashtun elite and the Young Afghans, Amanullah knew that ditching these traitors would be a blessing in disguise. Unshackled by their selfish ambitions, Amanullah is free to pass even the most radical of his reforms with no opposition. With the King’s new alliance with Nur Muhammad Taraki and the Party of the Eternal Flame, many within Afghanistan have begun to call Amanullah the ‘Red Emir’, a title which he now carries with pride.

# THE ETERNAL ANGLO #

AFG_croft:0 "The Anglo Over Afghanistan"
AFG_croft_desc:0 "Nearly two decades ago, the scheming Afghans took advantage of our Empire at its weakest and invaded our Crown Jewel at the insistence of the villainous Turks and Huns. Attempting to repeat their success, the Afghans so foolishly crossed into India and their ‘nation’ descended into chaos while their pitiful army crumbled. Following in the footsteps of the great Sir George Pollock, empire loyalist Leo Amery alongside army officer Charles Howard Foulkes have victoriously led a ‘Second Army of Retribution’ to secure Kabul for the Empire."

AFG_gemstone_mines:0 "Jewels for the Royal Crown"
AFG_gemstone_mines_desc:0 "Long have we sought the vast gemstone deposits that litter the Afghan countryside. Precious gems such as rubies, lapis lazuli, and sapphires are plentiful while the Panjshir Valley has garnered world renown for its high quality emeralds. To fund our glorious reclamation, we will send an expedition to scout out these resource rich valleys to help turn a profit in our new Dominion."

AFG_new_wealth:0 "Graverobber of Empires"
AFG_new_wealth_desc:0 "It has often been said that Afghanistan is the ‘Graveyard of Empires’, whose unyielding mountains led to the fall of history’s greatest conquerors. Here we stand where they have failed, the defeated Afghans now humbled by the victorious British Empire. No longer a symbol of our defeat, we shall make these mountains a symbol of our triumph! We will dig deeper into the mines, foster closer economic ties with our Entente allies, and march our armies to where the sun never sets."

AFG_for_the_liberation:0 "Everything for the Liberation"
AFG_for_the_liberation_desc:0 "While some fervent imperialists within our government wish to throw lives away in pointless wars across the Near East, we must never stray away from our true mission. The Home Isles are still under the control of the Syndicalist menace and the former Raj lies divided. We must focus our attention towards this righteous crusade before we can consider expanding our influence elsewhere."

AFG_afghan_railway_connection:0 "Charter the Afghan Railway Company"
AFG_afghan_railway_connection_desc:0 "Much of British dominance over India can be accredited to the vast system of railways that were constructed across the subcontinent. English companies helped lay the tracks that moved resources and armies across India, transforming a rural backwater to the Crown Jewel of our great Empire. Seeking to emulate this success, we will cooperate with Delhi to create a separate Afghan Railway Company to prop-up the nascent rail lines constructed during Habibullah’s reign."

AFG_british_garrison_force:0 "Bolster the Garrison Force"
AFG_british_garrison_force_desc:0 "While the Second Army of Retribution was successful in taking Kabul amidst the Emir’s departure, we now face the herculean task of holding on to the unruly mountains of Afghanistan. Our expeditionary force has already been stretched thin, falling prey to the insurgents that stalk the countryside. We will once again call upon our allies in the Dominion to send additional resources and manpower to reinforce our dwindling forces."

AFG_british_army_model:0 "A British Model Army"
AFG_british_army_model_desc:0 "The Afghan ‘army’ is a generous term used to describe the roaming rabble of bandits and tribal levies that were once under the service of the Emir. While our expeditionary force has been useful in facing off against rebels, we cannot solely rely on them forever. Our top military minds have already drawn plans for a complete overhaul of what existed of the Afghan armies. Our instructors will work tirelessly to forge an army worthy of marching with our Entente allies to reclaim our birthright."

AFG_connection_to_delhi:0 "Our Ties to Delhi"
AFG_connection_to_delhi_desc:0 "With our sister colony across our Eastern border, it’s only natural for us and Delhi to maintain close relations, as we are surrounded by potential enemies. However, we must decide the degree of cooperation between our two nations. While we are loyal to the crown, the last thing we need is a war in the South while our regime is still unstable." 

AFG_churchill_relations:0 "Meeting with Viceroy Churchill"
AFG_churchill_relations_desc:0 "The recent ascension of Winston Churchill to the position of Governor-General could not have come at a more opportune time for our Dominion. A founding member of the Indian Empire Society, Churchill and Governor-General Amery share the same ideals of returning Britain to its rightful position as the master of the Indian subcontinent and beyond. We will arrange for Viceroy Churchill to make an official state visit to Kabul where he and the governor-general can better discuss their commitments to the Empire and draw up plans for future endeavors in the Near East."

AFG_diehard_victory:0 "Continue the Civilizing Mission"
AFG_diehard_victory_desc:0 "The Afghans are not so easily governed. They have fought like rabid dogs against us in our previous wars, and even in lieu of their defeat, they still struggle against us. We understand this defiance, but we will not be deterred. Come time, the Afghans will learn to appreciate the benefits of being a loyal servant of the British Empire."

AFG_closer_ties:0 "Reach Out to Imperial Loyalists"
AFG_closer_ties_desc:0 "Across all reaches of the Entente exists organizations that share our firm adherence to the monarchy and the ideals of the Empire. In Delhi there is the Indian Empire Society, in Australasia exists the New Guard, and in Canada lies the United Empire League. If we are to thrust ourselves into the political scene of the Anglosphere, we must reach out to these various groups to better spread our ideas of preserving the Empire."

AFG_edward_relations:0 "Stick to the Status Quo"
AFG_edward_relations_desc:0 "While the Dominion of India is our trusted ally, we should tread carefully with our relations. We will continue our normal relations with Delhi, as we should prioritize the governance of the Dominion of Afghanistan before gazing elsewhere."

AFG_loyal_empire:0 "March With the Dominion"
AFG_loyal_empire_desc:0 "It is only natural for us two neighbors to cooperate and grow closer bonds! We will work closely with our brothers in Delhi, fostering closer economic ties between our two nations to help mend the centuries of historic divisions that exist between these two nations. Together, we can restore South Asia under the British Crown oncemore."

AFG_king_loyalty:0 "Loyalty to the Dominion"
AFG_king_loyalty_desc:0 "Only the skilled administrators in Delhi have the experience and knowledge that comes with governing over such a varied land as India. It is imperative that we continue our close relationship with the Dominion if we are to bring Heaven’s guiding light back to this divided land. Our government will forge an unbreakable bond with the Dominion through further military and economic cooperation. "

AFG_crown_loyalty:0 "Loyalty to the Empire"
AFG_crown_loyalty_desc:0 "Our loyalty lies solely with the Crown and the Empire, not with the conniving bureaucrats and princes across the Durand Line. We will begin making diplomatic overtures with His Majesty’s government in Ottawa to unshackle ourselves from the failures in Delhi and allow our Dominion to enjoy a higher degree of autonomy within the Empire."

AFG_maharajah_relations:0 "A Cold Shoulder with the Dominion"
AFG_maharajah_relations_desc:0 "Under the new administration in Delhi, Indian demagogues are allowed to spread propaganda about Home Rule and even independence from the Empire. If left unchecked, these harmful ideas can lead to the undoing of nearly a century of development that our Empire has worked towards. We will slowly begin to phase out our ties with Delhi to become a separate and self-sufficient dominion that is wholly loyal to the Empire rather than scheming princes or corrupt politicians."

AFG_conflicting_interests:0 "A Conflict of Interests"
AFG_conflicting_interests_desc:0 "Despite the urgings of pro-Dominionist politicians, we have vastly different plans regarding the direction that India must take towards preserving British domination of the subcontinent and abroad. While the narrow-minded princes in the Dominion can only think about saving their palaces from squatters, we are planning for the next war and the war after that. India shall only be a starting point for expanding our influence across the Near East."

AFG_battle_of_delhi:0 "Save the Dominion from Sedition"
AFG_battle_of_delhi_desc:0 "Our patience with the Dominion of Delhi has finally worn thin. Once loyal citizens of the Empire have been poisoned by independence activists who only seek to destroy our Empire from the inside. Left with no other options, the Governor-General has decided that only our loyal government can restore order to Delhi and save India from itself. While many are reluctant to fight against our own brothers, it is imperative that the Crown Jewel must not fall into the hands of the enemy."

AFG_gun_grabbing:0 "Disarm the Rebels"
AFG_gun_grabbing_desc:0 "One of the biggest hurdles towards securing our rule over the Afghan tribes has been the prevalence of arms trafficking within the region. Located within the Khyber Pass, these crafty gunsmiths have used scavenged metals to create convincing copies of our own weaponry. While not particularly reliable, these smiths can easily mass produce and hand-me-down ‘Khyber Pass copies’ that could easily fall into the hands of dangerous insurgents. To prevent a future revolt, an expeditionary force will be sent down the Khyber to seize any and all counterfeit weapons."

AFG_bribe_local_leaders:0 "Pay Off Tribal Leaders"
AFG_bribe_local_leaders_desc:0 "Afghanistan has never been a unified nation in any sense of the word, it is a loose band of tribal chiefs operating under the nominal rule of the former Emir. For centuries these warlords have vied for wealth and power, scheming against one another to come out on top. We shall make contact with any willing local collaborators to bring them under our wing. These tribal leaders will be provided with expensive gifts and lofty administrative positions as long as they affirm their loyalty to the Empire."

AFG_guaranteed_loyalty:0 "Ensure Local Loyalty"
AFG_guaranteed_loyalty_desc:0 "While we continue to reap the benefits of collaboration with loyal chiefs, there remain dissidents who still foolishly fight against our rule. We  must make an example of these unruly tribes before they can band together against our administration. We will play into the divisions prevalent within Afghan society and pit the squabbling tribes against each other while propping up our loyal allies."

AFG_british_code:0 "Enshrine Common Law"
AFG_british_code_desc:0 "As we move to eradicate lawlessness in Afghanistan, we must acknowledge that the Afghan nation has barely known law. In 1880, Abdur Rahman Khan, the father of Habibullah Khan, had established the nation’s first codified law and justice system. The Afghan justice system, however, plays second fiddle to Sharia courts and that is prevalent throughout the countryside. Habibullah’s attempts to expand the legal system were quickly stamped out by traditionalists within Afghan society. We will replace the Emir’s attempts at judicial reform with the time-tested methods of English law. While not phasing out the Sharia courts entirely, the reaches of our jurisdiction will be greatly expanded upon."

AFG_no_reforms:0 "A 'Hands Off' Approach"
AFG_no_reforms_desc:0 "Let it be known to the average Afghan that their way of life will not be altered by being under the administration of the Empire, in fact it will only improve. Afghanistan’s deep rooted tribal structure will remain in place (if they remain loyal to us) and we will make no attempts to hamper the Islamic faith in the region. In addition, we will show the Afghan people the potential benefits of collaboration through promoting military service and work opportunities."

AFG_part_of_the_empire:0 "Our Place in the Empire"
AFG_part_of_the_empire_desc:0 "We stand at a critical point for the future for not only Afghanistan but the Empire as a whole. As we come to decide our Dominion’s destiny, two vastly different approaches have emerged within our administration. Most within our government have supported using what resources Afghanistan has to aid in the reconquest of India and the reclamation of the Home Isles. Some influential imperialists, however, have drafted up their own proposals to bring the entirety of the Near East under the British boot, drawing in new resources to bring prosperity to the Empire. We must decide carefully how to best use these mountains to serve the Empire."

AFG_gateway_of_east:0 "Gateway to the Near East"
AFG_gateway_of_east_desc:0 "With our rule over the nation absolute, we now stand in a position to carry out our plans to use Afghanistan as a springboard to expand the Empire’s influence throughout not only the Near East, but Asia as a whole. In the north, the Russians have lost their grasp over Turkestan. In the west, the crumbling Ottoman Empire is threatened by revolts and an all out invasion by neighboring states. This chaotic situation will be played to our advantage, allowing us to quickly expand our influence across Asia and bring an end to the Great Game once and for all."

### KALAKANI ###

AFG_kalakani:0 "The Man Who Would Be King"
AFG_kalakani_desc:0 "Habibullah Kalakani, known to many as the Bacha Saquo, has fulfilled his lifelong destiny and has led his army into Kabul in the wake of Nasrullah’s failed putsch. The brigand king already faces numerous challenges to his rule as the entire nation appears to be cracking at the seams. Kalakani must act quickly if he is to hold on to the throne of Afghanistan."

AFG_support_clergy:0 "Court the Mullahs"
AFG_support_clergy_desc:0 "During Habibullah’s reign, the Emir’s reformist streak earned him a number of enemies with traditionalist members of the clergy. In search of allies for our Saqqawist cause, we will make contact with these dissidents to try and gain their support. With their backing we could greatly improve the legitimacy of our government in the eyes of the Afghan people."

AFG_basmachi_allies:0 "Contact our Mujahideen Allies"
AFG_basmachi_allies_desc:0 "Our Saqqawist movement has always maintained close ties with Ibrahim Bek and his ‘Mujahideen’ in Turkestan. Merely called bandits to the outside world, our armies have both bravely waged war against modernity and foreign imperialism. With our rule contested by agents of the British Empire and the lackeys of the Pashtun nobility, we will ask Bek to aid us in our struggle and send his Mujahideen fighters to help us in the war for Afghanistan’s destiny."

AFG_islamic_appeals:0 "Defender of the One True Faith"
AFG_islamic_appeals_desc:0 "Before our armies marched on Kabul, we bravely faced off against Emir Habibullah’s attempts to destroy our movement. But what were we fighting for? Many would tell you that we were just bandits trying to fill our pockets, but that is simply not true. We were fighting to save Afghanistan from falling prey to the demonic Habibullah Khan who tried to separate Islam from the government. Through Kalakani’s alliance with the traditionalist members of the clergy, Kalakani and his band will take on the image as righteous defenders of Islam."

AFG_jalalabad_emir:0 "Deal with the Jalalabad Emir"
AFG_jalalabad_emir_desc:0 "As our forces blasted through the fortified gates of Jalalabad and reconquered the city, the cowardly Ali Ahmad Khan had already left, attempting to flee across the border into British India on horseback. After one of his own men defected to our cause, the traitorous Khan was captured and brought to our forces. After being beaten and dragged through the streets of Jalalabad, Ali Ahmad Khan is now being sent to Kabul, where he will have to answer to the new Emir."

AFG_assure_merchants:0 "Squeeze the Sarrafs"
AFG_assure_merchants_desc:0 "In his native village, Kalakani could vividly recall the pleas of starving mothers and their screaming children while the apathetic Sarraf would demand their tithe. For too long, these brokers have forced the people of Afghanistan to be victims of their unjust loans. With the treasury emptied, we will summon these money-lenders to the Arg to ask for what the nation of Afghanistan is owed. We will see if these thieves can make excuses while they are pleading for their lives!"

AFG_ally_minorities:0 "Rally the Minority Tribes"
AFG_ally_minorities_desc:0 "Kalakani has garnered the ire of the ruling Pashtun elite due to the fact that he is the only non-Pashtun leader of Afghanistan in centuries. An ethnic Tajik, Kalakani has gained blanket support among the minority tribes throughout Afghanistan, who have played a crucial role in the Saqqawist movement. As Emir, Kalakani has called upon the support of these minority tribes to band against the ruling Pashtun class."

AFG_pay_the_men:0 "Repay the Loyal Band"
AFG_pay_the_men_desc:0 "With the capture of the Arg, we have discovered that the bastard Habibullah had emptied the royal treasury. Promised riches and wealth, Kalakani will still carry out the payment that was promised to his men. The Bacha and his men turn their sights to the city of Kabul, eager to lay waste to the capital. This action, however, will certainly catch the attention of those who plot against our rule."

AFG_anti_reformism:0 "Wage War Against Reformism"
AFG_anti_reformism_desc:0 "While westernizers and agents plot to destroy the nation and sell the remains to the British and Germans, Kalakani and his loyal Saqqawists heroically waged a full-scale war against reformism. While most of the country sees us as little more than unwashed bandits, we will let the people of Afghanistan know that we are actually fighting to preserve our traditional way of life and to remain free from foreign powers."

AFG_discredit_nadir:0 "Move Against the Musahiban"
AFG_discredit_nadir_desc:0 "With the revolt of Nadir Khan raging throughout the countryside, it is time we tell the Afghan people the truth about this old fool. We will use the airforce to distribute leaflets that reveal the true intentions of Nadir Khan.The false Emir is nothing more than a pawn in the game of the British Empire, who only seeks to sell the Afghan people into slavery. In addition to our propaganda campaign, we will also imprison members of Nadir Khan’s family as a show of force to that British lapdog."

AFG_nadir_campaign:0 "Fold the Wild Card"
AFG_nadir_campaign_desc:0 "With Ali Ahmad Khan’s forces utterly crushed and our newfound allies providing much-needed legitimacy to our new government, we can now direct our full attention towards stopping Mohammad Nadir Khan’s attempt to take the throne. Kalakani and his loyal band will set out of the Arg and face off against Nadir’s forces in the south of Afghanistan, where we will play our hand against the so-called ‘wild card’ and make him fold."

AFG_the_tajik_emir:0 "The Tajik Emir"
AFG_the_tajik_emir_desc:0 "Following the defeat of Mohammad Nadir Khan’s forces, his remaining loyalists are now being hunted down as they attempt to escape across the Durand Line. Kalakani has proudly declared that his enemies have been vanquished and has begun preparations to plan an official coronation to help legitimize his rule. Taking up the royal title of Habibullah II, Kalakani wishes to build a sense of continuity by ruling as emir rather than merely an illegitimate brigand king."

AFG_enforce_sharia:0 "Enforce Sharia Law"
AFG_enforce_sharia_desc:0 "Emir Habibullah’s father, Abdur Rahman Khan, so foolishly tried to create a code of law to supersede the law of Islam in Afghanistan. These laws were mostly ignored in the countryside, with Sharia courts still remaining the law of the land. Using our close ties with traditionalist mullahs, we will remove the former Emir’s laws and ensure that Sharia will remain the law of the land forevermore."

AFG_no_education:0 "End Wasteful Departments"
AFG_no_education_desc:0 "With the treasury emptied by Habibullah, it’s hard to imagine if it was ever full in the first place. Our financial minister has found that the former Emir’s government has been wasting the treasury on useless departments such as education, justice, trade, and health. We will put an end to these attempts to replace the Quran and Islamic law and remove these ministries entirely. These cuts will greatly relieve the economic strain of governing and divert more funds towards financing the Royal Army."

AFG_appease_nobility:0 "Appease the Pashtun Nobility"
AFG_appease_nobility_desc:0 "While we took a strong stance against the Pashtun nobility during the revolts of Nadir Khan and Ali Ahmad Khan, Kalakani and his cabinet is well aware of the political influence that they still hold over the nation. To win over their trust, Kalakani will meet with the Ghilzai chief, Sher Khan Nashir, to negotiate and discuss a compromise between the Emir and the Pashtun elite."

AFG_loyal_administrators:0 "Hire Loyal Administrators"
AFG_loyal_administrators_desc:0 "While our loyal followers have enjoyed the administrative roles granted to them by the new Emir, it is obvious that they are unaware in the matters of statecraft. To help create a government of action, we will seek out local governors and hire loyal administrators to help run the day-to-day matters of government for us."

AFG_control_trade:0 "Caravansary of the Near East"
AFG_control_trade_desc:0 "Kalakani gained his fortune as a highwayman, harassing trade caravans as they made their way through the rugged Afghan hillside. Well aware of Afghanistan's critical role as a crossroads for trade, Kalakani will transform the entire nation to act as a toll booth for trading with the rest of the eastern world. By getting a cut of all trade that passes through Afghanistan, we will reap the newfound profits and finally be able to fill our treasury."

AFG_end_reforms:0 "End the Former Emir's Reforms"
AFG_end_reforms_desc:0 "Following our reshuffling of the reform-minded governments to one that honors tradition, we have finally snuffed out the remnants of the late Habibullah’s dangerous modernist agenda. These efforts have begun to bear fruit as our hardline anti-modernist stance has been a powerful tool to unite the disparate tribes towards our traditionalist Islamic government."

AFG_end_politics:0 "Free the Minds"
AFG_end_politics_desc:0 "It was in Kabul where Kalakani first heard of the word ‘politics’, where men had formed clubs to discuss the ideas of the West. Like a plague, these ideas spread throughout the cities. Even worse, these clubs have the audacity to twist the words of the Prophet to their western beliefs. To save the nation from these seditious groups, Kalakani has decided to enact a decree that will outlaw any and all political clubs."

AFG_habib_ul_islam:0 "Circulate Habib-ul Islam"
AFG_habib_ul_islam_desc:0 "While Kalakani never saw the need to take up the pen (or to even read), he is a pious man with conviction. Kalakani’s religious views on faith and governance will be transcribed and published into the nation’s sole legal newspaper, Habib-ul Islam. This paper will be distributed throughout the nation to spread the word of Kalakani and the Saqqawist government."

AFG_blend_banditry:0 "Revising our Banditry"
AFG_blend_banditry_desc:0 "With our rule over Afghanistan nearly unquestioned, many still look to our bandit past, especially our sack of Kabul. To alleviate these concerns, Kalakani and the government will undertake a massive effort to revise the history of Kalakani and the Saqqawist insurgency. We were not brigands at all! We simply acted as Islamic warriors who waged holy war against the atheist Habibullah Khan and his cabal of westernizers who sought to sell Afghanistan to the German and British Empire. With these truths revealed to the people, they will understand the necessary sacrifices we needed to make to save the nation from the western imperialists."

AFG_durrani_heirs:0 "Heirs to the Durrani"
AFG_durrani_heirs_desc:0 "To pull Afghanistan away from the Barakzai clans and build a greater sense of legitimacy among the Afghan people, Kalakani was informed by his advisors about the historic Durrani Empire. Under the rule of Ahmad Shah Durrani, the Afghan tribes were united and formed the first cohesive Afghan state. The Durrani Empire became one of the most powerful Islamic empires of the east, extending their influence across Turkestan and forcing the Mughal Empire to submit to their rule. Seeking to follow in their greatness, Kalakani now seeks to emulate their greatness and restore the Durrani Empire once again."

AFG_ahmad_shah:0 "The Legacy of Ahmad Shah"
AFG_ahmad_shah_desc:0 "In an attempt to unite all the tribes that make up Afghanistan under one banner, Kalakani seeks to invoke the legacy of Ahmad Shah. Known as the ‘Baba’, or father of the Afghan nation, Ahmad Shah is seen by many as a unifying figure and a well respected military commander. By following in his wake, Kalakani will create a pious and strong state that will unite all Afghans through tradition and the rule of faith."

AFG_unite_central_asia:0 "Sword of the Mujahideen"
AFG_unite_central_asia_desc:0 "While Ibrahim Bek has led the Mujahideen towards limited success, his accomplishments pale in comparison to that of the Bacha ye-Saquo. With a long standing dream to unite Turkestan under the faithful, Kalakani has decided that only he is capable of accomplishing such a task. Kalakani will march his armies across the Amu Darya to restore order and become the one true brigand king."

AFG_punish_india:0 "The Ninth Delhi Campaign"
AFG_punish_india_desc:0 "During his reign, Ahmad Shah Durrani launched numerous military campaigns in India to help fill the treasury and keep the Indian princes weak. To exact revenge against the Delhi regime who had routed our armies and seized our rightful lands, we will launch a ninth military campaign to punish the Indians in a show of strength of the rebirthed Durrani state."

AFG_turkestani_plight:0 "Slaying the Dragon"
AFG_turkestani_plight_desc:0 "During his reign, Ahmad Shah Durrani had proposed uniting the Muslim tribes of Turkestan against the Qing imperialists from the east. While Ahmad Shah’s ambitions were thwarted by an empty treasury and an overextended army, we will carry on in their footsteps and make this dream a reality."

AFG_restart_raids:0 "Restart the Raids"
AFG_restart_raids_desc:0 "While Kalakani and his men rest easy in the Arg, they can only sit and reminisce about the days where they faced off against overwhelming odds and looted their way across the rugged highlands. With some sense of stability finally returning to Afghanistan, Kalakani and his band have once again decided to take up arms and launch another daring raid into the Persian highlands."

AFG_defying_fate:0 "Defying the Hand of Fate"
AFG_defying_fate_desc:0 "When Kalakani met with the old mullah who told him that he would one day become king, the mullah also told Kalakani that after his death, he would only rule for two more nights where he would then be deposed. Months have gone by after that old mullah’s death, and yet Kalakani still lives. It was not fate, but the strength and cunning of the Bacha that allowed him to defy the old fool’s vision and rule as the Emir of Afghanistan."

AFG_question_caliph:0 "Question of the Caliph"
AFG_question_caliph_desc:0 "Although our relations with the Sublime Porte were strained during Emir Kalakani’s rise to power, we have maintained an adherence to the Caliph and his position in the Islamic world. The once great  Ottoman Empire, however, has slowly begun to fall to decadence. Urged by demonic westernizers such as Mustafa Kemal, the empire has fallen to the foreign vices that almost destroyed Afghanistan as well. These concerns have forced Kalakani to contemplate Afghanistan's future regarding the sultanate. Will Kalakani support the Caliph in Constantinople or shall he take up the sword once again and declare himself as the rightful protector of the Islamic faith?"

### Mohammad Nadir KHAN ###

AFG_nadir:0 "The Wild Card Plays His Hand"
AFG_nadir_desc:0 "Taking advantage of the political crisis following the death of Emir Habibullah, Mohammad Nadir Khan, known as a political Wild Card, has taken control of the emirate. Exiled by the late Habibullah Khan due to his ambitions to rule, Nadir Khan has spent the last few years of his life exiled in British India. With the Afghan throne comes its enemies, both old and new. Nadir Khan must act accordingly if he is to secure his rule."

AFG_crush_saqqawists:0 "Crush the Bacha's Brigands"
AFG_crush_saqqawists_desc:0 "With Kabul secured and under our control, Kalakani and his remaining loyalists have taken to hiding out in the hinterlands. To finally bring an end to Kalakani and his reign of terror in the countryside, Nadir Khan and his royal entourage will travel across the Afghan foothills on horseback to find out the whereabouts of the remaining Saqqawists and their so-called ‘Brigand King’."

AFG_reward_loyal_tribes:0 "Reward Loyal Tribes"
AFG_reward_loyal_tribes_desc:0 "During his rise to power, Mohammad Nadir Khan had established close ties to various tribes who supported his bid for the throne. With the kingdom finally under the rule of its new king, Nadir Khan will give back to those tribes who had supported him, granting them administrative roles in the new government. While Nadir rewards his friends, he will not share this leniency to those who had dared oppose him."

AFG_drive_out_basmachi:0 "Drive out the Mujahideen"
AFG_drive_out_basmachi_desc:0 "Kalakani and his Saqqawist bandits were close allies of Ibrahim Bek and his Mujahideen movement. The Mujahideen and the remaining Saqqawist stragglers still hide out in bases in northern Afghanistan. In order to bring stability back to our nation, Nadir Khan has authorized a military campaign to hunt down these remaining bandits and drive them back into Turkestan."

AFG_purge_amanites:0 "Crumble the Amanite Column"
AFG_purge_amanites_desc:0 "Despite leaving the nation in shame, many tribes are still loyal to the reformist Amanullah Khan, and some even believe that he will return to claim the throne! We must put an end to this treasonous conspiracy and ensure that these unruly tribes submit to the Iron Emir."

AFG_calm_hijratis:0 "Defang the Hijrat Movement"
AFG_calm_hijratis_desc:0 "The Hijrat exiles who have taken refuge in Afghanistan have long agitated our government towards freeing their Islamic brothers in India. The ongoing political crisis in India has riled up these exiles, and some have been spreading seditious materials against our government. To cripple these subversive radicals, we will arrest these dangerous demagogues and demonstrate to the remaining exiles that they have a new home here in Afghanistan."

AFG_court_clergy:0 "Meeting with the Muftis"
AFG_court_clergy_desc:0 "During Habibullah’s rule, the Emir passed his reforms with little to no regard to the religious elite that holds great influence over Afghan society. It could be said that his disregard for the muftis ultimately led to his death. Wishing to not repeat an untimely death, Nadir Khan will use his credentials as a devout Muslim to win over the favor of the mullahs who defied the former reformist emir. We will grant them a renewed role in society that the clergy has not enjoyed for decades. With their favor, Nadir Shah will rightly guide the nation with the support of the faithful."

AFG_ministry_of_war:0 "Assemble the Ministry of War"
AFG_ministry_of_war_desc:0 "During his campaign to take control of the kingdom, Nadir Khan had assembled an inner circle of loyal chiefs and family members to lead the army to victory. Still seeing the value of this close-knit group, Nadir Khan has moved to formalize this structure into the Afghan army. The new Ministry of War will guide the reformation of the Royal Army and help secure the king’s control over Afghanistan."

AFG_musahiban_primacy:0 "The Rightful Place of the Musahiban"
AFG_musahiban_primacy_desc:0 "Mohammad Nadir Khan and his family are a part of the Musahiban, a cadet branch of the Barakzai royal family. For nearly a century, Afghanistan has been ruled by the main-line Mohammadzai branch of the royal house. To reinforce the legitimacy of his rule, Mohammad Nadir Khan will enforce the seniority of the Musahiban branch over the other houses. To signify the change in the royal line, Mohammad Nadir Khan will change his name and formally rule as Mohammad Nadir Shah."

AFG_convene_jirga:0 "Convene the Loya Jirga"
AFG_convene_jirga_desc:0 "Throughout history, Afghan leaders have called a Loya Jirga (great council) to settle disputes among the Afghan people. While it originally followed the Pashtun code of law, the jirga has since then been extended to the various tribal groups that make up Afghanistan. To confirm Nadir Shah’s status as rightful King of Afghanistan, he has decided to call upon a new loya jirga to legitimize his rule."

AFG_modernization_not_reform:0 "Modernization, Not Reform"
AFG_modernization_not_reform_desc:0 "Unlike the rapid and utterly destructive reforms under the former Emir Habibullah, Nadir Shah seeks to modernize the nation while not undermining the traditionalist Islamic structures that have existed for centuries. Through economic planning and a massive military build up, Afghanistan will become a modern, not a reformed, nation."

AFG_faux_constitutionalism:0 "Draft the New Constitution"
AFG_faux_constitutionalism_desc:0 "While the previous government attempted to draft a new constitution, opposition by the traditionalists kept the Emirate in place. Under our government, we will draft a new constitution that establishes the nation’s first ‘constitutional monarchy’. Unknown to the people of Afghanistan, however, this document is merely a farce. Under the new constitution, the king, his family, and loyal tribal allies will guide the nation, all while we reap the rewards."

AFG_hanafi_school:0 "Empower the Hanafi School"
AFG_hanafi_school_desc:0 "In his private life, Nadir Shah is a pious man who is deeply committed to his Islamic faith. Similar to the rest of the Barakzai line, the king is an adherent to the Hanafi School of Islamic law. Nadir Shah will work with his religious allies to make the Hanafi School of law the secondary form of law following the Afghan legal system. This move will appease both modernizers who push for an Afghan code of law as well as the Islamic clergy who supported the king’s rise to power."

AFG_great_north_road:0 "Construct the Great North Road"
AFG_great_north_road_desc:0 "As a part of his modernization effort, Nadir Shah has announced a massive infrastructure effort that will help modernize the Afghan nation. Seeking to unite northern and southern Afghanistan that is divided by the Hindu Kush mountain range. This project aptly called the Great North Road will connect the Afghan people and stimulate trade along the northern routes. In addition, the king has also authorized the construction of radio towers and telephone lines across the country."

AFG_rebuild_the_army:0 "Royal Army Buildup"
AFG_rebuild_the_army_desc:0 "Nadir Shah, alongside his allies in the Ministry of War, have announced a massive buildup of the pitiful Afghan Royal Army. Top of the line foreign equipment will be purchased to fill the arsenals and the traditional jezail muskets and Khyber Pass hand-me-downs will be gradually phased out of use. In addition to these purchases, a massive recruitment effort will be instituted in local villages to bolster the ranks of the army. Through our efforts, Afghanistan will have a modern army that will be the envy of Asia!"

AFG_reverse_reforms:0 "Reverse Radical Reforms"
AFG_reverse_reforms_desc:0 "While many of the late Habibullah’s reforms were not all disastrous, they had been enacted too quickly during such a volatile point in the nation’s history. To better ease the nation into a modern state, Nadir Shah will reverse many of the former Emir’s more radical reforms while keeping true to his push for modernizing the nation. By walking the line of modernity and tradition, we will build a uniquely Afghan society that is prepared to enter the world’s stage."

AFG_kabul_university:0 "Open Kabul University"
AFG_kabul_university_desc:0 "While high schools were constructed under the reign of Emir Habibullah, Afghanistan still does not have a university to call its own. Afghan elites would have to send their sons abroad to receive a higher education. As a part of Nadir Shah’s modernization campaign, Afghanistan’s first university will be constructed here in Kabul. While the school may not be opened immediately, we will work towards the creation of a modern university by inviting the brightest minds from across the world to teach a new generation of Afghanistan’s youth."

AFG_modern_banking:0 "Establish a Modern Banking System"
AFG_modern_banking_desc:0 "While modern nations prosper under a banking system, the only form of banking in Afghanistan is the treasury room under the Arg. Afghanistan cannot possibly hope to build a modern economy or encourage foreign investment if we still rely on our pitifully obsolete system of bartering and money lending. With foreign support, we will lay the foundations for a modern banking system here in Afghanistan."

AFG_open_to_west:0 "Open the Door to the West"
AFG_open_to_west_desc:0 "While in exile in British India, Nadir Shah established close ties with foreign dignitaries and entrepreneurs. Now that Nadir Shah rightfully rules over the nation, he will invite these old friends to tap into the nation’s true potential. We will open the door to the west and Afghanistan shall become the investors paradise. With their help we will make efficient use of our vast natural resources, bringing many new opportunities and potential sources of revenue to our nation."

AFG_future_of_youth:0 "Celebrate Afghanistan's Youth"
AFG_future_of_youth_desc:0 "It is not Nadir Shah or the government, but rather Afghanistan’s younger generation that will decide the future of the nation. To commemorate the achievements of Afghanistan’s graduating class, Nadir Shah will attend an awards ceremony at a local high school in Kabul. While some government officials warn the king about possible security concerns at the event, he has decided to still attend. After all, what’s the worst that could happen?"

AFG_iron_emir:0 "The Iron Emir Tightens his Grip"
AFG_iron_emir_desc:0 "Nadir Shah’s near death experience at the hands of a gunman has caused the king to push his royal prerogatives even further. The government has already revised the constitution, greatly extending the powers of the King. These newfound prerogatives will grant Nadir the necessary powers to restore law and order to Afghanistan."

AFG_renewed_persecution:0 "Crackdown on the Hazara"
AFG_renewed_persecution_desc:0 "Nadir Shah was almost killed by a Hazara gunman. The Hazaras, a tribe that has long been a thorn in the Shah’s side, have constantly plotted against the Shah ever since he returned from his exile. This attempted assassination has provided the king with the perfect justification to clamp down on these rebellious tribesmen. The government will launch a full scale crackdown on the Hazara tribes, showing no mercy to those who would see our king murdered and the nation destroyed!"

AFG_stay_the_course:0 "Stay the Course"
AFG_stay_the_course_desc:0 "While his powers were extended following his attempted assassination, Nadir Shah’s style of leadership over Afghanistan was by no means changed. Seeing the success of his modernization and social policy, the king has opted to stay the course in his rule. Through a conservative society that honors its traditions while striving for economic modernization, Afghanistan can carefully guide itself towards a prosperous future."

AFG_soldier_king:0 "Cult of the Soldier Emir"
AFG_soldier_king_desc:0 "It was through the military genius of Nadir Shah that we were able to cross the Durand Line and secure our nation's independence against all odds. Even when he was forced into exile by Habibullah Khan and recovering from his ailments, Nadir Shah selflessly returned to Afghanistan to save the nation from the clutches of bandits and dangerous radicals who would see the nation destroyed. When the rebellious Hazara tried to have Nadir Shah killed, he bravely soldiered on, continuing in his mission to bring law and order to Afghanistan. To commemorate the story of such a noble king, the government shall celebrate the selfless efforts of our Soldier Emir in every facet of Afghan life."

AFG_full_loyalty:0 "Keep Your Friends Close"
AFG_full_loyalty_desc:0 "While Nadir Shah rules Afghanistan with near absolute control, he is reliant on a close web of local tribal allies to maintain order in the hinterlands. We will honor these chiefs and their loyalty through luxurious gifts in addition to granting them a degree of autonomy over their lands. While some might decry these efforts as nothing more than a kleptocracy, they are simply unaware of our traditional Afghan customs."

AFG_anglo_afghan_mission:0 "Anglo-Afghan Military Mission"
AFG_anglo_afghan_mission_desc:0 "While the modernization of Afghanistan’s Royal Army was overseen by the Hentig-Niedermayer Expedition under Habibullah’s reign, the political crisis saw our so-called ‘allies’ leaving us to the wolves. Instead of allowing these German traitors to come back to Afghanistan, Nadir Shah will use his contacts with Delhi to invite a British military attache to help reform our army."

AFG_entente_relations:0 "Honor our Special Relationship"
AFG_entente_relations_desc:0 "While living in exile in British India, Nadir Shah fostered close ties with the British Empire. It was through their tacit support that the ‘Wild Card’ Nadir was able to play his hand and take the Afghan throne from bandits and radicals. With the political situation finally stabilized, Nadir Shah will pursue closer relations with the British Empire and her allies. While some within our government may chafe under our pro-Entente shift, Nadir Shah cares little for their objections."

AFG_durand_negotiations:0 "Durand Line Negotiations"
AFG_durand_negotiations_desc:0 "Despite decades of war, the Durand Line between Afghanistan and the North-Western Territories in British India remains a contentious issue. With our close ties to the Entente, our government will finally renegotiate the status of the Durand territories. In exchange for solving the question regarding our rightful land, we will support the British Empire in their mission to retake their homeland from the socialist menace in Europe."

AFG_zahir_shah:0 "The Young Emir Rises"
AFG_zahir_shah_desc:0 "Amidst the chaos of Mohammad Nadir Shah’s assassination, the royal government has put an end to the failed military putsch and has ensured a stable continuation of Musahiban rule in Afghanistan. Following the line of succession, the former king’s son, Muhammad Zahir Shah, now sits on the throne. Due to the new king’s youth and inexperience, a government led by Nadir Shah’s brothers, Shah Mahmud Khan, Mohammad Hashim Khan, and Shah Wali Khan will rule over the kingdom."

AFG_true_constitutionalism:0 "A Truly Democratic Constitution"
AFG_true_constitutionalism_desc:0 "While a constitution was ratified during Nadir Shah’s rule, it was evident to the entire nation that this document was merely a farce. Under the guise of a ‘constitutional monarchy’, the Afghan government was in effect an oligarchy that only served to enrich the king and his close allies. To finally put a stop to this national kleptocracy, Zahir Shah and his reformist cabinet will end the former king’s false constitution and draft a new document that will truly serve the needs of the Afghan nation."

AFG_road_to_progress:0 "The Nonpartisan Path to Progress"
AFG_road_to_progress_desc:0 "While pushing the nation towards a modern direction, the reforms of the late Emir Habibullah had made himself a great deal of enemies within his own government. Similarly, the former king Nadir Shah jumpstarted the modernization process while brutally repressing his tribal foes. The untimely death of two of the nation’s monarchs proves that only through cooperation and gradual change, can the nation truly begin to heal and thrive. Rather than relying on the dangerous rule of a strongman government, we will let the people of Afghanistan be heard by working with local political clubs to help foster nonpartisan, moderated progress that only has the best interests of the nation in mind."

AFG_reel_in_army:0 "Reel in the Royal Army"
AFG_reel_in_army_desc:0 "Amidst the chaos of Nadir Shah’s death, radical elements of the army had conspired to seize power. While this attempt was thwarted and the plotters were brought to justice, the bloated Royal Army is still rife with personalist cliques and corrupt officers. To rein in these unfavorable elements, the government will launch an investigation into the army to root out any and all corruption."

AFG_fathers_shadow:0 "Sins of the Father"
AFG_fathers_shadow_desc:0 "While the people of Afghanistan have begun to warm up to the reforms of Zahir Shah, the new government is finding difficulties trying to distance itself from the king’s father, Mohammad Nadir Shah. Dubbed the second ‘Iron Emir’ in reference to the brutal Abdur Rahman Khan, Nadir ruled through fear and repression, using torture and and brutal crackdowns to keep the populace in line. To turn a new page in the nation’s history, the government has begun stripping away the extrajudicial methods used by the former emir against the Afghan people."

AFG_liberization:0 "Prepare Afghanistan for Democracy"
AFG_liberization_desc:0 " The concept of democracy is foreign to most of Afghan society, our brethren in the countryside have only known the rule of local chieftains. To soothe our nation’s transition into a proper constitutional monarchy, our reformist government will begin the process of liberalizing the centuries old regime. With our support, the various political clubs will be formalized into full-fledged political parties that will stand in our first ever elections. We will educate the Afghan people in understanding their role in the new government and the power of their vote."

AFG_join_international_community:0 "Within the International Community"
AFG_join_international_community_desc:0 "While Nadir Shah’s rule was despotic and cruel, the king had made great strides in opening Afghanistan to the wider world. Our new government will build upon the strong foundation of foreign policy that Nadir Shah had constructed during his reign. Through closer ties with foreign investors and opening talks with our neighbors, Afghanistan will finally find its place on the world stage."

AFG_first_elections:0 "The First Free Elections"
AFG_first_elections_desc:0 "With the reforms of Shah Mahmud Khan’s government finally beginning to bear fruit, the government has begun to prepare the Afghan nation for its first ever parliamentary elections. As a part of our voting efforts, polling stations will be established across the nation. From the bustling cities of Kabul and Herat to even the most isolated villages in the highlands, every voice in the nation shall be heard. As the Afghan nation turns a new page in its history, our government eagerly awaits the results."

### MOHAMMAD DAOUD KHAN ###

AFG_daoud_khan:0 "Daoud Khan Seizes the Mantle"
AFG_daoud_khan_desc:0 "In the wake of Nadir Shah’s assassination, young army officers led by Mohammad Daoud Khan, the son of Nadir’s half brother, Mohammad Aziz Khan, have seized power. The leader of a radical clique known as the Melli Pashtun Club, Daoud has coalesced a big tent of nationalists, liberals, and even socialists, all united under the banner of Pashtun nationalism. A political enigma, the people of Afghanistan can only wonder what the young Daoud’s next moves will be."

AFG_fate_of_the_emirate:0 "The Fate of the Emirate"
AFG_fate_of_the_emirate_desc:0 "Following Daoud’s seizure of power and the creation of a new provisional government, the Afghan monarchy has effectively existed in a state of limbo. As the Melli Pashtun Club moves to reshape the Afghan nation, Daoud and the new government must finally decide the fate of the crown. More traditionalist members within our clique believe that the centuries old emirate must not be infringed upon, and that a new emir must be crowned to preserve stability. More radical members, however, believe that the monarchy is merely a relic of the past, and to bring it back would only stagnate the creation of a truly modern Afghan state. With these considerations in mind, the time has come to decide Afghanistan’s destiny."

AFG_autocratic_progressivism:0 "Pursue Progressive Reforms"
AFG_autocratic_progressivism_desc:0 "Only united in our shared beliefs in Pashtun nationalism and modernizing the nation, the Melli Pashtun Club attracted the attention of many moderate figures into our clandestine circle. Piquing the interest of the reform-minded Daoud Khan, he has moved to cooperate with the more reformist members of our clique. With their support, we will bring substantial reforms regarding education, women’s rights, and progressive social policies to the Afghan people. Under our rule, we will bring true progress to the nation while remaining under the watchful eye of Mohammad Daoud Khan."

AFG_sideline_clergy:0 "Sideline the Clergy"
AFG_sideline_clergy_desc:0 "During Nadir Shah’s rule, the former king built a close relationship between the government and the Islamic clergy. The religious elite assisted in both Nadir Shah’s rise to power and his absolute rule over the Afghan nation. Under our new modernizing government, the muftis foolishly believe that they will still have the same sway over our government as they had under Nadir Shah. We will work to greatly undermine the influence of these clerical rats over local governments and all aspects of Afghan society. Through our rule we will free Afghanistan from the mullahs and their stranglehold over Afghanistan."

AFG_one_party_state:0 "All Under the National Revolutionary Party"
AFG_one_party_state_desc:0 "A far cry from the political parties of more modern nations, Afghanistan is home to political clubs in large cities. While many of these clubs share our modernizing outlook, they are ultimately unorganized and powerless. In order to lead Afghanistan towards the future, we will move to absorb the various political clubs in the nation, leading towards the creation of the National Revolutionary Party, the sole organ of the new Afghan state."

AFG_towards_autarky:0 "Afghan Self-Sufficiency"
AFG_towards_autarky_desc:0 "While Nadir Shah brought forth modernization and reform to the Afghan nation, he so foolishly believed that he could sell the nation to the western world. To prevent foreigners stealing our vast natural wealth, our new government will look inwards rather than outwards. Taking influence from the emergent Japanese Empire, the nation will become a model for full economic self-sufficiency."

AFG_pashtun_nationalism:0 "Enshrine Pashtun Nationalism"
AFG_pashtun_nationalism_desc:0 "Nadir Shah’s death was caused at the hands of a Hazara, a tribe that has held a long distaste for our Pashtun people. It is clear that these various ethnic groups such as the Hazaras and Tajiks seek to destroy Pashtun society and have our people slaughtered! We will stoke these flames of these fears in the minds of every Pashtun. In addition, we will champion the accomplishments of the Pashtuns and their role in creating the Afghan nation. We will lead the Pashtun people towards newfound prosperity, and the lesser peoples shall finally know their place."

AFG_rise_of_khorasan:0 "Land of the Aryan"
AFG_rise_of_khorasan_desc:0 "Thousands of years ago, the ancient Aryan race arrived in India from the western steppes in a massive invasion. This advanced Aryan civilization was able to easily conquer the primitive Indians through their advanced technology and culture. Mohammad Daoud Khan has revealed that the Pashtuns are actually the true heirs to the mighty Aryans who once dominated these lands. Daoud and his allies have begun a massive propaganda effort to extol our Aryan origins. No longer confined to the whims of the lesser tribes of Afghanistan, we will continue in the legacy of our ancestors and carve a new empire for the Pashtun-Aryan!"

AFG_constitutionalist_victory:0 "Democracy in the Heart of Asia"
AFG_constitutionalist_victory_desc:0 "For the first time in Afghanistan’s millenia spanning history, the voices of the people of these rugged mountains have been heard. Following the expansive democratization process of [AFG.GetLeader], the Afghan people took to the ballot box to elect one of the nation's leading political clubs, which have since then been transformed into full-fledged political parties. As the nation's first ever democratically elected government, the new administration holds a great deal of responsibilities that comes with ruling over such a diverse nation as Afghanistan. They must now carefully shine the light of democracy over Afghanistan, and make their unique vision for the nation’s future a reality."

AFG_two_state_theory:0 "Proving the Two-State Theory"
AFG_two_state_theory_desc:0 "Inheriting our true legacy as a splinter of the All-India Muslim League that supports the Two-Nation Truth, our Muslim League shall prove that Hindus and Muslims should be kept separate so that our two distinct and unmixable peoples can achieve their greatest possible destinies. Formulating a new pan-Muslim identity for Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, Iqbal and his broad coalition of Islamic poets, theo-nationalists, and other various traditionalists and conservatives shall create a democratic paradise hinged on the old ways we hold so dear that utilizes the Islamic faith to unite our disparate Muslim masses."

AFG_true_faith_desc:0 "Although some other democratic and morally-bankrupt forces within this new Afghanistan wish to pursue the West’s oh-so-beloved secularism, our Muslim League knows the truth. Only by the grace and guidance of Allah and Muhammad can we know true prosperity, enlightenment, and good governance. Afghanistan shall remain linked with the Islamic faith no matter what, keeping it as our state religion and empowering our new allies in the Islamic clergy while ensuring that it always remains a dominant force."

By emulating Rumi’s Islamic and cultural genius, and by working with Rumi’s main living disciple - the Sunni scholar Hakim al-Ummat - aka Mujaddidul Milla or Ashraf Ali Thanwi - the Muslim League will bring enlightened Islamic teachings and culture to all of Afghanistan, allowing us to keep one foot in the past while still progressing towards an enlightened, pious, and prosperous future."

AFG_conservative_concessions_desc:0 "As it stands, the Muslim League is a broad coalition composed of the local democratic conservatives and other traditionalists willing to work within the new democratic system for the good of Allah, along with exiles from the All-India Muslim League and their supporters of two-nations theory who immigrated to Afghanistan because of persecution by Dominion and Anglo authorities in India - authorities Iqbal once looked up to and drew inspiration from until the laughable collapse of the British Empire, the revelation of England’s colossal failure to topple the rightful Ottoman Caliph, and our own victory in the Great War against Angloid forces thanks to our new friends and sources of inspiration within the Kaiserreich. We must make concessions to the various conservative factions within this big tent and work to build a stable pan-Conservative government based on Islamic Traditionalism and other sources of conservative influence like Germany’s Zentrum coalition in order to ensure stability and unity under Allah for the good of the League and all Afghanistan."

No longer shall the various mosques, imams, and other religious forces have control over Afghanistan’s political destiny, though Kemalist principles like freedom for religion and freedom from persecution shall still stand, for a secular, nationalist, and temporally-focused nation of liberalized equals shall be ushered in by force if we must, all thanks to the brilliance of the Young Afghans."

Patriarch and founder of the Young Afghans that now emulate Kemal’s Young Turks under the leadership of Tarzi’s own son-in-law Abdul Hadi Dawi, our movement shall honor our founder’s modernizing mission along with the works of other liberal Kemalists like him like the great Ahmet Agaoglu, continuing Tarzi’s work of dragging Afghanistan kicking and screaming into a more Western, Urban, Modern, Secular, and Nationalist existence, partially modeled on the French inspirations that Kemal himself was inspired by as well."

AFG_germanic_liberalism_desc:0 "Although most of the democratic movements within Afghanistan once looked to the Anglos for inspiration, that attitude has largely died out after our victory alongside Germany in the Great War along with the complete collapse of the British Empire. Instead, our modern Young Afghans look to the true hegemon for guidance - the Kaiserreich. By pulling ideas from the centers of German Liberalism like their German Democratic Party (DDP) and the Nationalliberale Partei (NLP), we shall bathe the nation in the cleansing waters of modern Liberal ideology and free market economics fused with our own Nationalist ideas, creating a Western-inpired but Afghan-grown form of National Liberalism fit for our unique, and heavily conservative, masses."

AFG_obscurantist_shadow_desc:0 "With our party being formed by Tarzi as a way to combat the stagnating forces of Islamic conservatism and traditionalism that long strangled Afghanistan’s potential, we have continued to carry Tarzi’s torch that seeks to banish the obscurantist shadow that has dominated our nation its entire existence. No longer shall imams and clergymen keep the truth from the masses, and no longer shall obscuring sources like the Church or our Quranic schools be allowed to lead our people astray into ignorant bleakness. Secularism, rationalism, classical Liberalism, and the works of the Enlightenment, the West, and the Young Turks shall guide us towards true prosperity free from the shadows of deliberate stagnation."

United under our new national identity that sees us not as Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, or other disparate tribes and clans, but as one and united Afghan people, we shall embrace modernity and all the wonders that come with it thanks to the herculean efforts of these reformers. By our hand, and under the leadership of Abdul Hadi Dawi’s clique, the nation and our people shall evolve, grow, and heal like never before."

By fusing the genius of Islamic scripture and thought with the glories of the West and their Enlightenment, we shall breed the perfect form of Liberalism for our pious populace in an attempt to convert the conservative masses to the light of Allah’s true plan for humanity."

AFG_light_of_enlightenment_desc:0 "Although some of their thinkers were godless heathens, the true genius of the Enlightenment and the religious reformation that followed as dictated by the likes of Rene Descarte, John Locke, and even Immanuel Kant tried to show humanity that God could still be the center of our universe without needing to ignore rationalism and the varied good that modernity can bring. By taking notes from Descartes’ Rationalism, Locke’s Empiricism, and Kant’s concept of religion born from the innate morality of mankind while still believing in a God that cannot be proven empirically, we shall create a Liberal system that is still foundational in the Islamic truth while still inching closer to a truly modern and rational society not held back by traditionally conservative religious forces within the clans or among the Imams."

AFG_nod_to_jadidism:0 "A Nod Towards Jadidism"
AFG_nod_to_jadidism_desc:0 "The Jadids are a group of Muslim modernist reformers that first began their good works as they languished under the oppressive rule of the old Russian Tsars around the turn of the century. Since then, the Jadids - or as they call themselves the Taraqqiparvarlar ('progressives'), Ziyalilar ('intellectuals') or simply Yäşlär/Yoshlar ('youth') - have spread their ideas of modernized, liberalized Islam across Central Asia, the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, and across North Africa and the wider Arab world. At odds with the Ulama or the guardians of traditional or ‘authentic’ Islam like we here are at odds with Afghanistan's massive conservative majority, we shall give the Jadids a new hold here in Afghanistan, taking from their works and working together to breed a new form of humanitarian, progressive Islam here for our faithful."

By working toward the reform of Afghanistan's traditionalist and deeply conservative institutions, behaviors, relations, and expectations across our varied society, we shall have our own enlightenment right here in Kabul. To achieve our particular goals, our growing force of civilian activists and politicians within the Wesh Dzalmian aim to affect political policy on a national scale and across all of society, building new institutions and reforming old organizations while encouraging the masses to change their behaviors directly with the aid of our party’s journalistic arm and the growing news network we building for the nation."

AFG_literary_theory_desc:0 "Written about in the literature, poetry, and prose of our own leader Abdul Rauf Benawa, Literary Theory describes the systematic study of the nature of literature and its effects on our society, history, morals, socioeconomics, intellectual past, philosophies, and more. Started by ancient philosophers like Greece’s Aristotle, Rome’s Longinus, India’s Bharata Muni, and the Muslim world’s Al-Jahiz and ibn al-Mu'tazz, Literary Theory and its aesthetic and intellectual truths must be spread to the illiterate masses of Afghanistan’s clannist structure so that even the most isolated of tribals can learn the basics. Tied to education reform, calls for public schooling provided by the state, and the spread of rational and critical thought, our push for Literary Theory shall banish the ignorance that has long clouded our path to a brilliant future."

Though we still have much work to do before Afghanistan truly is the pious and Liberal heart of the Muslim world, we are well on our way as our people rejoice and live in fair, egalitarian prosperity as equals under Allah for the first time ever."

Under the historian and poet-turned-politician Ghobar, progressive, liberal, and even some pseudo-socialist ideas shall be introduced to Afghanistan’s traditionally conservative populace in hopes that the Fatherland Party can bring the true salvation of ‘Leftish’ populism to our destitute people."

Soon Kabul shall stretch towards the sky like any other Western capital as it becomes the beating urban heart of Afghanistan. From this modernized center of progressive politics and industrial growth, we shall build a better Afghanistan for all those within our borders, not just those within the cities for our tribalist brethren who wish to live like they always have shall always have that opportunity though now will be supported by the modern technologies and advancements made in Kabul, while utilizing the capital and other urban centers like it as the main hubs for our movement’s spread among the populace."

AFG_durrani_populism:0 "True Heirs of Wäisi Populism"
AFG_durrani_populism_desc:0 "Our Fatherland Party takes heavy inspiration from the works of the father-son duo Bahawetdin Wäisiev and Gaynan Wäisiev and their militant Wäisi Movement (a socialist revolutionary movement in 19th and 20th century Russia that served as a Tatar-based Leftist version of the liberal Jadids) that banded together various Tatar groups throughout Russia and Central Asia against the Tsarist regime on a platform of pan-Islamic civic nationalism, class struggle, and proto-Socialist ideology in order to pit the Tatar farmers, crafters, and petty bourgeoisie against the nobles and military men that oppressed them. Eventually their movement shifted to true Islamic Socialism as opposed to simple anti-elitist struggle, but regardless they stayed dedicated to the teachings of the Qur’an and Sharia law while refusing to take part in a civilization run by the Kafir. In their image, we shall create the nation the Wäisi dreamed of here in Afghanistan - an Islamic Socialist paradise rooted in tradition and closely adherent to Islamic laws and customs while still upholding egalitarian democratic socialist principles for all within our nation, and all in tune with Afghan culture. By their design and our interpretation, we shall liberate Allah’s chosen from earthly oppression while keeping us in tune with the one, true faith unlike those other godless forms of Leftist thought that have taken hold of the decadent West."

AFG_poetic_cultural_reformation_desc:0 "For far too long has Afghanistan been a disconnected grouping of differing tribes, clans, and bickering ethnic groups like the Pashtuns, the Tajiks, the Farsiwan Persians, and many more. By the Fatherland Party, this shall end. In line with the writings of our party leader Ghulam Muhammad Ghobar, we shall work to amalgamate the various ethnic groups of our land into one united Afghanistan identity built off ideas of civic nationalism and egalitarian multiculturalism. Only then can our newly united people finally bask in the benefits of progressive modernity and all the strengths it shall bring us."

AFG_afghan_welfare:0 "An Afghani Welfare State"
AFG_afghan_welfare_desc:0 "Taking inspiration from various parties in North America, Western Europe, and East Asia, we shall create a welfare state that provides for the people of Afghanistan an acceptable and healthy standard of modern living. With modernized healthcare paired with the expansion of new free clinics and hospitals, a system of temporary welfare to help those in need get back up on their feet, and other modernizing missions in regards to mental health, womens’ rights, progressive socioeconomics, and more, we shall shine Afghanistan into the pink pearl of Central Asia it was always meant to be without falling to violent radicalism, revolutionary acts, anti-democratic sympathies, and other cancers that have long plague the Left."

AFG_pink_ahmad_shah:0 "Afghanistan Under the Pink Ahmad Shah Durrani"
AFG_pink_ahmad_shah_desc:0 "Long a historian and writer on the glories of the old Durrani Empire, Ghulan Muhammad Ghobar seeks to ‘revive’ a populist legacy he claims the Durrani emperors and their imams once upheld in a system similar to modern progressive socio-economics steeped in the charity of the Islamic faith. Although many doubt his claims and call them pseudo-historical nonsense, that has not stopped our Fatherland Party from posturing ourselves as the true heirs of Durrani’s so-called progressive legacy. Spreading an aesthetic culture based on the old Durrani Empire’s legacy fused with ideas taken from the Tatar Wäisi movement while modeling himself on the founder of the Durrani Empire, the elected emperor Ahmad Shah Durrani, along with some inspiration from the first Islamic Socialist Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī, our party leader Ghulam Muhammad Ghobar has worked to create a social democratic and modern Afghanistan that still holds dear its own historic and Islamic past. By fusing the triumphant legacies, theo-nationalism, aesthetic culture of the Durrani and these other sources with the progressive, egalitarian, and social capitalist ideas to fully socialist politics our Fatherland Party have come to cherish, we shall continue our long labor of love that is bringing the benefits of modern progressivism to Afghanistan without losing sight of our heritage, our past, and our faith."

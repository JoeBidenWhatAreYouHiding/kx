afghanredux.0.t:0 "The Graveyard of Empires Stirs"
afghanredux.0.d:0 "Much has changed for the Emirate of Afghanistan since the turn of the century. Habibullāh Khan’s reign initially endeavored to push his once reformative agenda into practice despite resistance from the nation’s many entrenched conservative sources of influence. Despite this, Afghanistan has seen some progress, with its legal, economic and educational systems all receiving minorly beneficial reforms, but above all, no institution within our Emirate has flourished like our military has, with Habibullāh passing a slew of new laws to improve the Afghan Army. This military prowess was built up as the earliest years of the new century dragged on until the Weltkrieg broke out in 1914. \n\nAs the horrific Weltkrieg dragged on, Afghanistan was put under increasing pressure from both the Kaiserreich and the Ottoman Empire to join the conflict on their behalf. Initially, Habibullāh resisted these calls for war, instead turning inward as he focused on ruling his own kingdom sealed away from the wider world. However, this peace would be shattered in 1917, when a band of tribes rallied by Nasrullah Khan and Ghāzī Amānullāh Khān disobeyed all previous orders and took a secretive gamble to push into British India without informing their Emir. Without support from the wider armed forces, Amānullāh’s forces were disastrously beaten and quickly forced back into Afghani territory, dragging the nation into the Weltkrieg and sparking a third war between us and the Anglos ... \n\nTwo years prior, the Kaiserreich established the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, a military attache aimed at training, supplying, and otherwise aiding the Afghani forces for a surprise attack against the Ango-Indian forces. Eventually, the cacophony of the Weltkrieg drew silent, and Afghanistan stood on the side of the victors.\n\nAs the decades since that horrific conflict have worn on, Habibullāh’s rule has only drifted further from his original ideals as he grows lazier and more opulent with age. It is now 1936, and the German mission is still here, Habibullāh still lounges on his throne, and our Emirate is as unstable as ever. The constant meddling of the Kaiser’s expeditionary force has only driven up unrest, regardless of the military benefits it has provided, and this chaotic situation has only been stoked by the rising radicalism being proliferated within the Provisional Government of India which we have so generously harbored. The Young Afghans, a local nationalist movement, grow increasingly vocal over their displeasure with Habibullāh’s rule, and the Emir’s two main rivals of Amānullāh and Nasrullah are at each other’s throats, each vying for their seat on Habibullāh’s throne. The aging Emir is growing desperate to keep his seat of power intact, and some whisper that he is even willing to start another war to do it. The nation of Afghanistan is once again on the edge of great change or utter collapse, and only Allah knows which way it will fall."

afghanredux.1.t.defeat:0 "King Habibullah has fled the country!"
afghanredux.1.d.victory:0 "After our brilliant victory against the vile and treacherous British and their pawns of the Delhi Dominion, thus proving once again Afghanistan's nickname of Graveyards of Empire, the power and popularity of our great king has never been higher. The previously disunited tribes now find unity in the pride of the newfound Afghan power and the many plots against our sovereign seem to have dissipated. It was decided to organize a great and sumptuous parade in the streets of Kabul, with a huge crowd and all the tribal and political representatives of the country present during the event. At the end of the parade, King Ghazi Habibullah Khan delivered a speech to his people praising the merits of Afghanistan's modernization and its proud army during the Fifth Anglo-Afghan War. To the surprise of his people, the King announced the formation of a new Barakzai Empire, risen from the ashes of the Durrani and Mughals, and that he would lead it to greatness. He left the stage to the loud applause of both his people and the tribal leaders.\n\nMeanwhile in Delhi, news of the announcement of 'Mughal ambitions' has shaken the government to its core. Communications between Delhi and Ottawa are frantic. Fear of another invasion, one which could see the complete annexation of the Raj, has paralyzed the British administration. The Entente's grip over India seems to be at its lowest point yet."
afghanredux.1.d.defeat:0 "After our humiliating defeat against the British forces in the Fifth Anglo-Afghan War, the position of King Habibullah had never been so precarious and fragile, the numerous conspiracies against him by the tribal lords and even some members of the government intensified greatly. The tribal instability in our country has also greatly increased as Afghan national pride has been torn to shreds and a strong resentment against the King is felt among the population. Undoubtedly because of these factors, having failed to modernize Afghanistan and lead it to glory, and fearing for his life, our King fled the country in the early hours of the morning with some of his relatives and much of the treasury. This flight did not help the stability of the country, which is on the verge of chaos as conflicts spark between various political factions each wanting more control. The future of Afghanistan is grim."

afghanredux.1.b:0 "May Allah protect Afghanistan"
afghanredux.2.t:0 "The Graveyard of Empires Stirs"
afghanredux.2.d:0 "As the Anglo-Afghan War rages on, Kabul has come to us requesting planes and a contingent of elite troops to aid them in defeating the British Indians in Delhi. The war is hotly contested right now, with both sides having a fair chance at victory. Our support could help tip the balance in favor of the Afghans, especially in the battle for the air. Since Afghanistan and the German Empire are on friendly terms, helping the Afghans out would reaffirm our ties and further improve relations. In addition, such a move would surely come as a snub to the Canadians, something that is always welcome by the German people. However, with Black Monday currently ravaging our economy and the Empire having bigger problems to deal with than Afghanistan's distant wars, perhaps it might be best to keep the planes and men to ourselves. Some have pointed out that while it would be nice to have a strong friend in the region, supporting the Afghans comes with the risk of upsetting the Canadians at a time when their new King provides an opportunity for renewed relations, and would undoubtedly hurt us in the long run should Delhi emerge victorious. We must choose carefully..."
afghanredux.2.a:0 "We shall support our friends in Kabul, send the planes and boys over!"
afghanredux.2.b:0 "We sympathize with Afghanistan's struggle, but we simply cannot aid them at this time."

afghanredux.3.t:0 "A Visit from Friends in Kabul"
afghanredux.3.d:0 "We have received a message from Kabul asking for our Sultan, the Caliph, to declare a jihad against the Raj. The Emir is currently doing battle with the full fighting force of the imperial dogs in the Entente and is requesting our support. If we were to do this, loyal servants of Allah from around the world would rally behind the banners of the Barakzai dynasty. They claim if we do they would have both Allah and the faithful mujahideen on their side, meaning they couldn’t fail. The Caliph is wary of picking sides in the Indian subcontinent, but the rewards would be great if he were to gain a loyal ally at the crossroads of the World. What will the Caliph decide is the right course?"
afghanredux.3.a:0 "I declare a Jihad for Delhi!"
afghanredux.3.b:0 "They will win without our help, Inshallah."

afghanredux.4.t:0 "The Emir Requests Arms!"
afghanredux.4.d:0 "We have received a message from the far-off land of Afghanistan asking for weapons to fight the British Raj. Some of our advisors say we should send them at once, as an Afghan victory would be a deep bruise to the Entente. The Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, after all, is still in the Graveyard of Empires, and increased funding and support to them wouldn’t be a gargantuan task. Others, however, remind the Kaiser that the Entente is currently in exile, and we have more present enemies just across the border to the West. There are more pressing enemies than our old grudges, some say. What shall we do?"
afghanredux.4.a:0 "In the spirit of 1914, we shall help Afghanistan."
afghanredux.4.b:0 "We must focus on the threats at home first."

afghanredux.5.t:0 "The Emir Requests Arms!"
afghanredux.5.d:0 "Our friends in Afghanistan have asked us for weapons to fight their war. The war between our friends and the Anglo dogs still rages as fighting stretches for hundreds of miles across their borders. Some of our military advisors urge us to accept in the name of Muslim solidarity and to use this as another way to get back at the perfidious Brits. Others however remind us of the unrest currently gripping the Middle East and urge the Sultan to keep all his resources focused on the enemies closer to encroaching on our influence."
afghanredux.5.a:0 "These weapons are dedicated to the brave Mujahideen fighters of Afghanistan."
afghanredux.5.b:0 "They don't need us anymore."

afghanredux.6.t:0 "Movements from the Himalayas!"
afghanredux.6.d:0 "Shimla has been seized by the Nepalese! The disorganized British garrison was routed nearly instantly by the invading mountain men, as their recent defeat has shaken their military apparatus to its rotten core. Delhi is rattled even more as their mandate shrinks even more with a relative blink of the eye. While this poses no real threat to us it does mean Nepalese troops are now on our borders. We have no quarrel with the Nepalese, for now. It would be wise for them to not further encroach on our new conquest."
afghanredux.6.a:0 "Keep an eye on them."

afghanredux.9.t:0 "Amanullah in Istanbul"
afghanredux.9.d:0 "Amanullah Khan, son of Habibullah, arrived in Istanbul earlier today. When Amanullah landed in Istanbul, he was immediately taken aback by its glory and grandeur. The Queen of Cities easily lives up to her name. He is greeted by a government delegation with a smart and clean honor guard and is first taken around the city for a few hours as the Sultan is said to be asleep. He eats the best food he has in some time, visited numerous historical sights, answered questions asked by throngs of foreign reporters, and finally has his midday prayers in the Hagia Sophia. When he is done he is taken to the Sultan and the two hit it off well. The Sultan asks about the War and how Afghanistan is doing while Amanullah asks about how the Sublime Porte fares in turn. The Sultan pledged to provide support to the Afghan cause by any means necessary, and in turn, humbly requests support. Many in the Royal Court, the Caliph included, believe war may be coming to the Ottoman sphere of influence. The Emir’s son pledged to support the Caliph in any way he could. Amanullah then watched the Palace Guard execute parade maneuvers in the courtyard and appeared thoroughly impressed. Such discipline! Such fervor! He was seen off by the Sultan himself, and as Amanullah sits down in his plane, all consider the visit between the two as a great success. Hopefully, the friendship between our two great nations never dies!"
afghanredux.9.a:0 "The Sick Man doesn't seem so sick to me"

afghanredux.10.t:0 "Amanullah in Tehran"
afghanredux.10.d:0 "Amanullah lands in Tehran for another royal visit and is immediately put off by how demonstrably hot it is. When he exits his plane he finds not a grand delegation as he met elsewhere, but a small group of politicians with a small guard. They explain that the government is tied up elsewhere and as such, they were all who could meet him. He is ferried around the city and enjoys it despite his company. Finally, he is flown to Qoms where he observes a grand military parade followed by an inspection. Amanullah notes the disheveled looks of some of the soldiers and their disorganization despite the shouts of their commanders. The men are all too sloppy; their uniforms are the wrong size and they conduct their military drills and maneuvers without tempo or panache. During his inspection of what was heralded as an 'elite' division, a soldier further down the line drops his rifle and it goes off, shooting himself in the foot. The Prince is insulted by such a shoddy reception but does his best to contain his dissatisfaction. When he returns to the plane he is all too happy to be out of Tehran."
afghanredux.10.a:0 "They think they can run the Middle East better than the Turks?"

afghanredux.11.t:0 "Amanullah Returns"
afghanredux.11.d:0 "When Amanullah returns to Kabul he returns a changed man. He looks out on the capital he left no longer content with its vistas. He saw the magnificence of Istanbul and the squalor of Tehran and is ashamed to see Kabul looking like the latter rather than the former. He is also all too aware of the state of his military before the War and his visit to the Ottomans has given him some ideas as to how to improve his situation. While Amanullah is not first in line to receive the throne, should his father abdicate or be rendered incapable, he is a man of ambition. His uncle, Nasrullah, is a reactionary man, who would rather see Afghanistan wallow in the same troubles that have been affecting it for centuries instead of dragging it into the future. A foolish agenda! Amanullah Khan, one way or another, will have his throne, and he will force Afghanistan, one way or another, into the modern world."
afghanredux.11.a:0 "I found Kabul a city of mud, I shall leave it a city of gold."

afghanredux.12.t:0 "The Khan Prospers"
afghanredux.12.d:0 "People are happy, dissent is nonexistent and the Emir’s power has never been stronger. Before a generally hated man, the Emir has seen a wave of popularity that his rule has never before seen. While the state of our rule before the war was a little shaky, things have improved, as Habibullah's gambit has proven to be successful. The risk has paid off. What could go wrong?"
afghanredux.12.a:0 "The Afghan Golden Age begins now!"


afghanredux.13.t:0 "A Royal Hunt"
afghanredux.13.d:0 "A three days drive northwest of Kabul, deep into the heart of the western range of the Hindu Kush, and beyond the extent of the Kahmard district lies the Ajar Valley. Prized for its isolation, its pristine and unspoiled natural beauty, and its ample hunting grounds, this isolated and forgotten cut has long been the well-kept secret of Afghani nobles and royals seeking a bountiful foray into the wilds. First traveling here what must be years ago by now with Mohammed Zahir, who has long used this gorge as his own personal plot to hunt the varied beasts of our lands, our king Habibullah and his most trusted confidants have frequently used this strip of wilderness to clear the mind, to discuss politics or matters of the state in private, or even to just take an occasional break from the rigors of rule and statecraft. \n\nThis hunting trip was no different, with Habibullah and his retinue leaving their horses back at the entrance of the pass where a small rest shack stood, continuing deeper into the wilds on foot. Bringing with them only a small amount of survival supplies, their traditional jezails with ample shot and powder, and other various supplies needed for the hunt such as bait and skinning knives, the royal retinue embarked deep into the heart of this ‘Valley of the King’ in search of noble prey such as wild boar, ibex, antelope, markhor, and if they were so lucky, even snow leopard and Asiatic cheetah. As the sun rose high in the arid and crisply blue sky, their multi-day hunt began with their guards lowered and their spirits high, for it's not like anything ever goes awry this far from the causticness of civilization..."
afghanredux.13.a:0 "Hunting is badass!"

afghanredux.14.t:0 "Disaster Strikes the Hunting Party!"
afghanredux.14.d:0 "It all happened so fast, and without any warning or time to think, but tragedy struck and now our glorious King Habibullah lies dead at the base of the Ajar Valley. \n\nWhile hunting through the rocky crag of the pass on the final day of the hunting trip, their party came across a fabled and magnificent snow leopard silently making its way up the rockface to some unseen cave or den. \n\nDespite the ample amount of antelope and other beasts the party had slain, this final quarry would be the perfect cap to an already amazing venture. However, fate had other plans, and as the retinue scrambled their way up the mountain, disaster struck. With the snow leopard finally catching the hunters’ scent as the wind shifted, the stark white feline bolted, causing the hunting party to attempt to chase after it. However, one of the nobles on the trip with Habibullah lost his footing on the rock face above the king, slipping down the cliff face by a few meters before regaining his grip. Thinking the worst was behind them and disaster was just avoided, the small sighs of relief and quiet cheers ended abruptly when the sound of gunfire cut through the valley. Turning back in horror, Habibullah’s men saw the jezail fall from the slipping noble’s back, hitting the sound of the mountain and misfiring directly into the face of their king. In an explosion of pink mist and grey smoke, a hole the size of a softball was blown through the head of Habibullah, sending the honored king tumbling down to the valley floor, leaving a red trail behind him as he plummeted lifelessly to the ground. As his men quickly repelled down the mountain rushing to the aid of their wounded king, it was far too late to save him by the time they reached his side. Managing to gurgle out a swift goodbye through the blood filling his lungs and throat before finally passing, Habibullah died on the floor of the valley surrounded by some of his closest allies. \n\nA tragic accident if ever there was one, the men wrapped the king’s body in gauze and prepared to take him back to Kabul, dreading having to break it to the nation that the king was well and truly dead. Though all in the retinue understood clearly that this was an accident in every sense of the word, the more cynical within the group believed that upon their return, accusations would begin to fly as rival groups vying for power each start to throw blame on one another. Whatever awaited them in Kabul, they would soon see, but the trek back was sure to be a solemn one."
afghanredux.14.a:0 "A dark star rises over the nation as its beloved King lay bleeding out."


afghanredux.15.t:0 "The Ascension of the Crown Prince"
afghanredux.15.d:0 "While the country mourns the death of Habibullah the ship of state must move forwards. Nasrullah, the designated heir to Habibullah, is already planning his coronation but some clamor for an investigation into the death of the beloved former Emir, especially since Nasrullah seems a bit apathetic about his brother's death. While some attribute this to the new Emir's solemn personality, others suspect foul play. Nasrullah was never the power-hungry man, but a majority of the public is unaware of the man's personality. Yet, prominent figures in the military are divided in their support for the new Emir, and some fear another conflict so soon. Nasrullah must make a decision to either submit to investigation or resist it."
afghanredux.15.a:0 "I have nothing to fear from baseless claims."
afghanredux.15.b:0 "Shut them down now!"

afghanredux.16.t:0 "Nasrullah Arrested"
afghanredux.16.d:0 "Treachery! We have found evidence that Nasrullah engineered the death of our beloved Emir! Amanullah Khan has already gathered a loyal faction of the Army and marched on Kabul and arrested the traitorous Nasrullah. While the manufactured evidence was shoddy at best, it was more than enough to try and imprison the Crown Prince. Besides, no one would question the integrity of our operation, anyway. With Nasrullah thrown in jail for the foreseeable future, the crown falls to Amanullah’s lap."
afghanredux.16.a:0 "Long live Ghazi Amanullah Khan!"

afghanredux.17.t:0 "A Split in the Army"
afghanredux.17.d:0 "The recent death of Habibullah Khan and the subsequent controversy surrounding his death has caused a rift in the Army. With the two men vying for the throne, Nasrullah and Amanullah Khan, being career military men, the Army has begun to choose sides between the two candidates. More traditional sects have sided with Nasrullah while the progressive factions within it have fallen in behind Amanullah. One however has managed to seize the lion's share and forced the other army group to stand down. Who has won out in the end?"
afghanredux.17.a:0 "Amanullah Khan's upstarts in the Army prevail."
afghanredux.17.b:0 "The Old Order holds as the Army stands by the Commander-in-Chief."

afghanredux.18.t:0 "Amanullah Flees into Exile"
afghanredux.18.d:0 "Amanullah’s coup attempt has collapsed under its own falsehoods and Nasrullah has been freed and restored to power. While Amanullah has fled to Switzerland, there are still many within the Army who support him. The influence of the Young Afghans is still strong and it is almost certain that they will oppose the rightful Emir with everything they have. If he were to ever return they would be a potentially fatal fifth column. What are we to do with them?"
afghanredux.18.a:0 "Without the head, the snake will die."
afghanredux.18.b:0 "Leave nothing to chance!"

afghanredux.19.t:0 "Nasrullah Wins!"
afghanredux.19.d:0 "Nasrullah Khan has consolidated his rule against all opposition. His opponents on all sides have been broken, killed, or forced into hiding. The Traitor Prince, Amanullah, has fled the country, and his support is dwindling even amongst the Young Afghans. The Army is fiercely loyal to its new Emir, and Nasrullah is riding a wave of popularity began by his late brother. Other dissidents have been forced into the mountains, where they will starve and dwindle away. Now there is nothing standing between the Emir and his vision for Afghanistan. The worst is behind us."
afghanredux.19.a:0 "Excellent!"

afghanredux.20.t:0 "Nadir Shah Plays His Hand"
afghanredux.20.d:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah, a relative outsider in the Royal Family, has marched on Kabul and deposed Nasrullah. The purge backfired and rather than be killed or fired, the enemies of Nasrullah flocked to Shah’s banner. Many were unjustly targeted during the purge, and Nasrullah has more enemies than friends he can depend on. Now, the Afghan Wild Card is in control of the country and there are few left to challenge him. While his vision for Afghanistan is still hazy, many are hesitant to support him due to his old ties to the British. One thing is clear, however: Nadir Shah is here to stay with most of the military at his back."
afghanredux.20.a:0 "A new man for a new Afghanistan."

afghanredux.21.t:0 "The Luftexpedition Arrives!"
afghanredux.21.d:0 "The Germans have sent help! The so called Luftexpedition has arrived in Kabul to seemingly an equal amount of cheers and jeers. The roar of a regiment of the finest planes of the world is such a beautiful sound! These German air wings and volunteers have been drilled in desert warfare during a stopover in Aleppo and, as such, are not totally out of their element. However, there was a mishap, as a German bomber bounced off of the makeshift airbase in Kabul before crashing to the ground. The plane's landing gear was ripped off by the bumpy and uneven surface before the nose was sent careening into the dirt. \n\nIn any case, German advisors are already discussing with our military brass on how to best utilize the expedition. While a group centered around the remnants of the newly revitalized Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition have welcomed these pasty white men with open arms, traditional elements within our nation still regard them with suspicion. Habibullah has built the reputation of being the lapdop of the Hun, and the new developments within our Emirate seem to confirm such a tale. It remains to be seen whether the German elements within our nation will lead to victory or disgrace."
afghanredux.21.a:0 "Willkommen Waffenbrüder!"

afghanredux.22.t:0 "Jihad!"
afghanredux.22.d:0 "In an address from Constantinople, the Caliph has declared that our war against the Raj as a jihad to free the shackled faithful under British imperialism. To jubilant Ottoman crowds, the Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] unleashed a tirade against the centuries-long British yoke under the Indian subcontinent and demanded that self determination be granted to the Indian population. This has been an immediate boon to our efforts as pious Muslims from across the region and in fact the world have begun to arrive in Kabul to join our struggle. Our airports and travel stops are overrun by pilgrims and warriors who seek Allah's glory by supporting our struggle. However, a countermovement led by the Emir of Mecca have decried this as a purely political maneuver by the Sultan to gain influence in the region, and the Ottoman rivals in Cairo have condemned the Caliph's actions. Political play or not, the results are undeniable, as warriors from around the Islamic world come to our aid."
afghanredux.22.a:0 "Inshallah."

afghanredux.23.t:0 "German Resources Arrive!"
afghanredux.23.d:0 "Rifles by the crate, ammo by the box and artillery by the pallet. All arrive in Kabul airport aboard German planes. The almost state of the art weapons of war are a far cry from what we were using previously and as such our men will require a lot of retraining to properly use them. Despite this we can now fight on more equal terms with our enemy and have a greater chance of victory."
afghanredux.23.a:0 "Maybe, one day, we can repay them."

afghanredux.24.t:0 "The Turks Send Arms!"
afghanredux.24.d:0 "As our troops pour over the crates of rifles and masses of artillery they are awed by their craftsmanship. The Turks promised us weapons and they have delivered in spades. We have begun to immediately disperse them to our soldiers on the Front and with these weapons straight from the Caliph, Allah will surely look upon us favorably."
afghanredux.24.a:0 "Allahu Akbar!"

afghanredux.25.t:0 "Send in the Hounds!"
afghanredux.25.d:0 "Not all Indians accept the rule of the Raj. Within our nation resides the Provisional Government of India, a native resistance group dedicated to finishing the destruction of the Raj. We have given the refuge in our nation long ago; however, they have long wasted away in exile, never finding an opportunity to strike at the Raj nor return home. Now with war having broken out we have finally found a reason to use them. They shall be smuggled back into their homeland to commit acts of sabotage and riotous sedition to divide our enemies' attention. The Raj, for all their faults, are much bigger than us and with their undivided attention we will surely fail. With them feeling the heat of their new fire in the rear, however, we will surely gain our righteous victory. Who knows, maybe they will even gain power in the ruins of the Raj!"
afghanredux.25.a:0 "United against Imperialism!"

afghanredux.26.t:0 "The Coronation of Nasrullah Khan"
afghanredux.26.d:0 "Nasrullah receives his crown as Emir. Whole lotta hoopla (a lot). Mohammed Nadir Shah is invited as an olive branch to a political rival. The Ottoman sultan sends a delegation to deliver gifts to the new emir, and many tribal leaders are invited to the event, to which they agree. Perhaps, this is a new era of tribal peace and prosperity, as Nasrullah looks to settle internal strife and dissent among his new people."
afghanredux.26.a:0 "The Shahzada has finally ascended!"

They say he is nothing more than a German puppet.\n\nEven if our army is in shambles, we have no choice. We must go to war against the British Raj, lest the house of cards comes crashing down."

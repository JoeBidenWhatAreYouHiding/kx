POLITICS_AMANULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Born in 1892, as the third son of Habibullah Khan, Amanullah Khan was, upon reaching proper age, installed as governor of Kabul and commander of the Army, gaining many important tribal allies. When the Weltkrieg broke out Amanullah, seeing this as a chance to seize lands on the other side of the Durand Line, joined Nasrullah in urging for joining into the Weltkrieg on the Kaiserreich’s side. When his father remained steadfast in his neutrality, Nasrullah and Amanullah, using mainly Amanullah’s tribal contacts, gathered up a force to invade the Raj. The initial push was a debacle and Amanullah was forced to retreat back into Afghanistan with the Raj hot on his heels. So began the Third Anglo-Afghan War. \n\nAmanullah was then forced to watch as his Army struggled to fight off the British and Indian invaders. However, when the Weltkrieg in Europe came to an end, Afghanistan was given its due. Since then, however, Amanullah has seen his father grow fat and lazy on the throne and angled his way to become his successor. Now having triumphed over Nasrullah, his uncle, and former ally, Amanullah stands as the unchallenged Emir of Afghanistan. Amanullah is not content with just sitting on his present victories, however. He sees a future Afghanistan shining like a beacon of modernity in the roughness of Central Asia. He sees a future free of imperialist influence and the meddling of outside powers and their ‘spheres of influence’. For too long has mighty Afghanistan been forced to hide in the shade of the Raj, and the King of the God-granted Kingdom of Afghanistan and its dependencies been regarded as the leader of a second-rate power. Only through blood and steel shall the Afghan people carve their place in the Sun from the corpse of the British Empire, just as the Germans did. Now it remains to be seen if he can achieve his dream."
POLITICS_HABIBULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Habibullah's reign has thus far been marked by reforms and attempts to modernize his country by working to bring modern medicine and other technology to Afghanistan. Born in 1871, in Uzbekistan, he would rise to power in 1901, upon the death of his father, the previous Emir. Habibullah’s early reign was one of reform, as he quickly issued a general amnesty to his father’s many enemies, allowing them to return to the country. He also began to import new technology and further modern science within Afghanistan. He also was a social reformer, repealing many draconian criminal punishments while making the legal system fairer in general. One of his principal reforms was dismantling his father’s internal intelligence system that oppressed huge swaths of the country. In 1903, Habibullah founded the Habibia school as well as a military academy. \n\nWhen the Weltkrieg broke out, Habibullah took great pains to keep his nation neutral in the War. Despite the insistence of the Sultan in Istanbul and the Kaiser in Berlin, his proximity to India and the British made any intervention seemingly doomed to fail. This all changed with the defeat of the British in Europe and the ensuing revolutions that ripped through their Empire, however. As chaos gripped the Raj and British rule faltered, Habibullah was initially hesitant to do anything. This meant little to his generals, who quickly crossed the Durand Line and seized border towns of the Raj. Habibullah, unable to reverse this without appearing fatally weak, was forced to go along with this fait accompli. This bolstered his popularity at home since the Raj, still battling for its own survival, was unable to resist.\n\nTwenty years after his victory, Habibullah has had to watch his grand dream of a powerful Afghanistan begin to wither. In the hinterlands, rebellion has once again reared its ugly head while members of his own family eye the crown hungrily. If Afghanistan is to be truly stable, Habibullah knows he must do something."
POLITICS_KALAKANI_DESC:0 "Habibullah Kalakani was born in 1891 in the village of Kalakan, north of Kabul. An ethnic Tajik, his father was named Aminullah and delivered water to people's homes. This heritage is how Kalakani gained the nickname ‘Bacha-ye Saqao’, or son of the watter carrier. During his adolescence, Kalakani ventured out of his village and traveled to the city of Kabul. In the south, he met an old Sufi who told the young Habibullah that he would become king one day. He would fight with the Afghan Army in the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the Khost Rebellion. They say there are no atheists in a fox hole, and Habibullah is an extreme example of that. When he deserted his unit during the Khost Rebellion he left a changed man, devoted seemingly entirely to Allah and his faith. After nearly a year in prison, Habibullah was released and turned to banditry since he saw many menial jobs like viticulture and firewood selling beneath him. He gradually gathered a group of 24 around him and they robbed caravans during the day and hid out at night, continuously evading government attempts to find him. While Habibullah grew fat and lazy in Kabul however, Kalakani grew angry and zealous in his caves. He began to denounce the Khan as little more than a German puppet and suggested that he had to be overthrown if Allah’s grace was to return to Afghanistan. It was about this time he began to refer to himself as both King and Emir. He began to meet with tribal leaders in the West of the country and gathered around himself a small but very effective army. Afghan Army units sent to round him up were routed or brought over to his cause and it was not long before Kalakani became the real authority in Western Afghanistan. However, despite his growing power, he was reluctant to strike at Kabul and tear the heart out of the decadent regime he had come to despise. That time came eventually with the catastrophic war against the Raj, and despite all odds, Kalakani now has seized the reins of government. What he intends to do with his newfound power however only Kalakani and Allah know and neither of them seems interested in telling."
POLITICS_NASRULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Nasrullah Khan was born in 1874, the second of three sons to Emir Abdur Rahman. As a young man in his early 20s, Nasrullah was sent on a journey to the UK to pay his father’s respect to Queen Victoria. Since he spoke little English and did not make a good impression on the local press who described him as a 'stolid, impassive and bored youth'. Nevertheless, he paid his respects as demanded and after a detour through Paris and Italy, returned home. This experience, while considered a diplomatic failure, prepared the young man for life in statecraft. When his older brother Habibullah rose to the throne, Nasrullah was suddenly one of the most important men in Afghanistan, if not more so than before. \n\nFirst to court him were the religious authorities who languished under his father Abdur. Nasrullah was a deeply religious man by this point and quickly warmed to their influence. The second was his brother, the Emir, who saw him as a potential rival. To secure his loyalty, Habibullah made him Commander in Chief, President of the State Council, and later heir over his own sons. Nasrullah was also kept loyal by the fact that the Emir held their brother, Mohammed, and Mohammed’s mother as little more than prisoners. Nasrullah was no Claudius, for he was loyal to Habibullah throughout his reign.\n\nDuring this time Nasrullah also grew to despise the British, despite his early venture to the Isles. The British had, under an earlier treaty, kept the Afghan government from maintaining valuable alliances with the powerful tribes of the Afghan hinterlands. At the same time, British influence began to slowly creep deeper and deeper into Afghanistan, which Nasrullah saw as a threat to his family and his people. When the Weltkrieg broke out, Nasrullah saw his chance to strike decisively at the British. He, along with the Young Afghan movement, urged the Emir to join the war on the side of the Turks and Germans. To their frustration, Habibullah remained neutral. When the Niedermayer Hentig Expedition arrived in Afghanistan, Nasrullah found a new group of loyal allies. Along with the Expedition, Nasrullah proposed numerous ways to undermine the British but all of them were dismissed by the Emir. As the Germans’ victory seemed imminent, however, Nasrullah finally got fed up with waiting for his brother. Without orders Nasrullah helped round up a group of tribes on the border and invaded the Raj. He was beaten, decisively and the nation he loved was dragged into a devastating war. When the Weltkrieg ended, so did the Third Anglo-Afghan War and Nasrullah Khan had achieved his dream. \n\nTwenty years later, Nasrullah now sits at the helm of his beloved nation, having defeated usurper and conspirator alike. With Allah guiding him, who can stand between him and greatness?"
POLITICS_NADIR_SHAH_DESC:0 "The wild card’s hand has been revealed for the world to see. Born to an exiled branch of the royal family in India, Mohammed Nadir Shah would return to Afghanistan only in the early 1900s, when Habibullah Khan married Nadir’s sister. He served admirably in Habibullah’s government until the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Afghan War. While faring decent against the seasoned British forces, he was never able to gain the successes needed to cripple the Raj. Instead, he was forced to fight on for years until an end to the war in Europe forced an end to the War in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile Afghanistan had triumphed, Nadir was left with a bitter aftertaste, and he was further enraged by radical proposals for the modernization of Afghanistan. While no traditionalist like Nasrullah, Nadir felt that some of Habibullah’s more ambitious reforms, no doubt suggested by his son Amanullah, were too far, stripping Afghanistan of its identity. During this era of peace, if not animosity, the British have appealed to Nadir Shah, promising him the throne in exchange for his cooperation. Now Nadir rules in Afghanistan with undeniable help from his former enemies, the British. While few expect him to kowtow to Delhi and Ottawa for long, even fewer see his reign as one of continuing reform. Nadir instead seems to want to propel Afghanistan into the future, but also pay respects to its admirable past. Whether or not he can continue this balancing act remains to be determined."

afghanredux.0.t:0 "The Graveyard of Empires Stirs"
afghanredux.0.d:0 "Much has changed for the Emirate of Afghanistan since the turn of the century. Habibullāh Khan’s reign initially endeavored to push his once reformative agenda into practice despite resistance from the nation’s many entrenched conservative sources of influence. Despite this, Afghanistan has seen some progress, with its legal, economic and educational systems all receiving minorly beneficial reforms, but above all, no institution within our Emirate has flourished like our military has, with Habibullāh passing a slew of new laws to improve the Afghan Army. This military prowess was built up as the earliest years of the new century dragged on until the Weltkrieg broke out in 1914. \n\nAs the horrific Weltkrieg dragged on, Afghanistan was put under increasing pressure from both the Kaiserreich and the Ottoman Empire to join the conflict on their behalf. Initially, Habibullāh resisted these calls for war, instead turning inward as he focused on ruling his own kingdom sealed away from the wider world. However, this peace would be shattered in 1917, when a band of tribes rallied by Nasrullah Khan and Ghāzī Amānullāh Khān disobeyed all previous orders and took a secretive gamble to push into British India without informing their Emir. Without support from the wider armed forces, Amānullāh’s forces were disastrously beaten and quickly forced back into Afghani territory, dragging the nation into the Weltkrieg and sparking a third war between us and the Anglos ... \n\nTwo years prior, the Kaiserreich established the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, a military attache aimed at training, supplying, and otherwise aiding the Afghani forces for a surprise attack against the Anglo-Indian forces. Eventually, the cacophony of the Weltkrieg drew silent, and Afghanistan stood on the side of the victors.\n\nAs the decades since that horrific conflict have worn on, Habibullāh’s rule has only drifted further from his original ideals as he grows lazier and more opulent with age. It is now 1936, and the German mission is still here, Habibullāh still lounges on his throne, and our Emirate is as unstable as ever. The constant meddling of the Kaiser’s expeditionary force has only driven up unrest, regardless of the military benefits it has provided, and this chaotic situation has only been stoked by the rising radicalism being proliferated within the Provisional Government of India which we have so generously harbored. The Young Afghans, a local nationalist movement, grow increasingly vocal over their displeasure with Habibullāh’s rule, and the Emir’s two main rivals of Amānullāh and Nasrullah are at each other’s throats, each vying for their seat on Habibullāh’s throne. The aging Emir is growing desperate to keep his seat of power intact, and some whisper that he is even willing to start another war to do it. The nation of Afghanistan is once again on the edge of great change or utter collapse, and only Allah knows which way it will fall."

afghanredux.1.d.victory:0 "After our brilliant victory against the vile and treacherous British and their pawns of the Delhi Dominion, thus proving once again Afghanistan's nickname of Graveyards of Empire, the power and popularity of our great king has never been higher. The previously disunited tribes now find unity in the pride of the newfound Afghan power and the many plots against our sovereign seem to have dissipated. It was decided to organize a great and sumptuous parade in the streets of Kabul, with a huge crowd and all the tribal and political representatives of the country present during the event. At the end of the parade, King Ghazi Habibullah Khan delivered a speech to his people praising the merits of Afghanistan's modernization and its proud army during the Fifth Anglo-Afghan War. To the surprise of his people, the King announced the formation of a new Barakzai Empire, risen from the ashes of the Durrani and Mughals, and that he would lead it to greatness. He left the stage to the loud applause of both his people and the tribal leaders.\n\nMeanwhile in Delhi, news of the announcement of 'Mughal ambitions' has shaken the government to its core. Communications between Delhi and Ottawa are frantic. Fear of another invasion, one which could see the complete annexation of the Raj, has paralyzed the British administration. The Entente's grip over India seems to be at its lowest point yet."
afghanredux.1.d.defeat:0 "After our humiliating defeat against the British forces in the Fifth Anglo-Afghan War, the position of King Habibullah had never been so precarious and fragile, the numerous conspiracies against him by the tribal lords and even some members of the government intensified greatly. The tribal instability in our country has also greatly increased as Afghan national pride has been torn to shreds and a strong resentment against the King is felt among the population. Undoubtedly because of these factors, having failed to modernize Afghanistan and lead it to glory, and fearing for his life, our King fled the country in the early hours of the morning with some of his relatives and much of the treasury. This flight did not help the stability of the country, which is on the verge of chaos as conflicts spark between various political factions each wanting more control. The future of Afghanistan is grim."

The war is hotly contested right now, with both sides having a fair chance at victory. Our support could help tip the balance in favor of the Afghans, especially in the battle for the air. Since Afghanistan and the German Empire are on friendly terms, helping the Afghans out would reaffirm our ties and further improve relations. In addition, such a move would surely come as a snub to the Canadians, something that is always welcome by the German people. However, with Black Monday currently ravaging our economy and the Empire having bigger problems to deal with than Afghanistan's distant wars, perhaps it might be best to keep the planes and men to ourselves. Some have pointed out that while it would be nice to have a strong friend in the region, supporting the Afghans comes with the risk of upsetting the Canadians at a time when their new King provides an opportunity for renewed relations, and would undoubtedly hurt us in the long run should Delhi emerge victorious. We must choose carefully..."

The Emir is currently doing battle with the full fighting force of the imperial dogs in the Entente and is requesting our support. If we were to do this, loyal servants of Allah from around the world would rally behind the banners of the Barakzai dynasty. They claim if we do they would have both Allah and the faithful mujahideen on their side, meaning they couldn’t fail. The Caliph is wary of picking sides in the Indian subcontinent, but the rewards would be great if he were to gain a loyal ally at the crossroads of the World.

Some of our advisors say we should send them at once, as an Afghan victory would be a deep bruise to the Entente. The Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, after all, is still in the Graveyard of Empires, and increased funding and support to them wouldn’t be a gargantuan task. Others, however, remind the Kaiser that the Entente is currently in exile, and we have more present enemies just across the border to the West.

Delhi is rattled even more as their mandate shrinks even more with a relative blink of the eye. While this poses no real threat to us it does mean Nepalese troops are now on our borders.

The Queen of Cities easily lives up to her name. He is greeted by a government delegation with a smart and clean honor guard and is first taken around the city for a few hours as the Sultan is said to be asleep. He eats the best food he has in some time, visited numerous historical sights, answered questions asked by throngs of foreign reporters, and finally has his midday prayers in the Hagia Sophia. When he is done he is taken to the Sultan and the two hit it off well. The Sultan asks about the War and how Afghanistan is doing while Amanullah asks about how the Sublime Porte fares in turn. The Sultan pledged to provide support to the Afghan cause by any means necessary, and in turn, humbly requests support. Many in the Royal Court, the Caliph included, believe war may be coming to the Ottoman sphere of influence. The Emir’s son pledged to support the Caliph in any way he could. Amanullah then watched the Palace Guard execute parade maneuvers in the courtyard and appeared thoroughly impressed. Such discipline! Such fervor! He was seen off by the Sultan himself, and as Amanullah sits down in his plane, all consider the visit between the two as a great success. Hopefully, the friendship between our two great nations never dies!"

When he exits his plane he finds not a grand delegation as he met elsewhere, but a small group of politicians with a small guard. They explain that the government is tied up elsewhere and as such, they were all who could meet him. He is ferried around the city and enjoys it despite his company. Finally, he is flown to Qoms where he observes a grand military parade followed by an inspection. Amanullah notes the disheveled looks of some of the soldiers and their disorganization despite the shouts of their commanders. The men are all too sloppy; their uniforms are the wrong size and they conduct their military drills and maneuvers without tempo or panache. During his inspection of what was heralded as an 'elite' division, a soldier further down the line drops his rifle and it goes off, shooting himself in the foot. The Prince is insulted by such a shoddy reception but does his best to contain his dissatisfaction. When he returns to the plane he is all too happy to be out of Tehran."

He saw the magnificence of Istanbul and the squalor of Tehran and is ashamed to see Kabul looking like the latter rather than the former. He is also all too aware of the state of his military before the War and his visit to the Ottomans has given him some ideas as to how to improve his situation. While Amanullah is not first in line to receive the throne, should his father abdicate or be rendered incapable, he is a man of ambition. His uncle, Nasrullah, is a reactionary man, who would rather see Afghanistan wallow in the same troubles that have been affecting it for centuries instead of dragging it into the future. A foolish agenda! Amanullah Khan, one way or another, will have his throne, and he will force Afghanistan, one way or another, into the modern world."

Prized for its isolation, its pristine and unspoiled natural beauty, and its ample hunting grounds, this isolated and forgotten cut has long been the well-kept secret of Afghani nobles and royals seeking a bountiful foray into the wilds. First traveling here what must be years ago by now with Mohammed Zahir, who has long used this gorge as his own personal plot to hunt the varied beasts of our lands, our king Habibullah and his most trusted confidants have frequently used this strip of wilderness to clear the mind, to discuss politics or matters of the state in private, or even to just take an occasional break from the rigors of rule and statecraft. \n\nThis hunting trip was no different, with Habibullah and his retinue leaving their horses back at the entrance of the pass where a small rest shack stood, continuing deeper into the wilds on foot. Bringing with them only a small amount of survival supplies, their traditional jezails with ample shot and powder, and other various supplies needed for the hunt such as bait and skinning knives, the royal retinue embarked deep into the heart of this ‘Valley of the King’ in search of noble prey such as wild boar, ibex, antelope, markhor, and if they were so lucky, even snow leopard and Asiatic cheetah. As the sun rose high in the arid and crisply blue sky, their multi-day hunt began with their guards lowered and their spirits high, for it's not like anything ever goes awry this far from the causticness of civilization..."

afghanredux.14.t:0 "Disaster Strikes the Hunting Party!"
afghanredux.14.d:0 "It all happened so fast, and without any warning or time to think, but tragedy struck and now our glorious King Habibullah lies dead at the base of the Ajar Valley. \n\nWhile hunting through the rocky crag of the pass on the final day of the hunting trip, their party came across a fabled and magnificent snow leopard silently making its way up the rockface to some unseen cave or den. \n\nDespite the ample amount of antelope and other beasts the party had slain, this final quarry would be the perfect cap to an already amazing venture. However, fate had other plans, and as the retinue scrambled their way up the mountain, disaster struck. With the snow leopard finally catching the hunters’ scent as the wind shifted, the stark white feline bolted, causing the hunting party to attempt to chase after it. However, one of the nobles on the trip with Habibullah lost his footing on the rock face above the king, slipping down the cliff face by a few meters before regaining his grip. Thinking the worst was behind them and disaster was just avoided, the small sighs of relief and quiet cheers ended abruptly when the sound of gunfire cut through the valley. Turning back in horror, Habibullah’s men saw the jezail fall from the slipping noble’s back, hitting the sound of the mountain and misfiring directly into the face of their king. In an explosion of pink mist and grey smoke, a hole the size of a softball was blown through the head of Habibullah, sending the honored king tumbling down to the valley floor, leaving a red trail behind him as he plummeted lifelessly to the ground. As his men quickly repelled down the mountain rushing to the aid of their wounded king, it was far too late to save him by the time they reached his side. Managing to gurgle out a swift goodbye through the blood filling his lungs and throat before finally passing, Habibullah died on the floor of the valley surrounded by some of his closest allies. \n\nA tragic accident if ever there was one, the men wrapped the king’s body in gauze and prepared to take him back to Kabul, dreading having to break it to the nation that the king was well and truly dead. Though all in the retinue understood clearly that this was an accident in every sense of the word, the more cynical within the group believed that upon their return, accusations would begin to fly as rival groups vying for power each start to throw blame on one another. Whatever awaited them in Kabul, they would soon see, but the trek back was sure to be a solemn one."

While some attribute this to the new Emir's solemn personality, others suspect foul play. Nasrullah was never the power-hungry man, but a majority of the public is unaware of the man's personality. Yet, prominent figures in the military are divided in their support for the new Emir, and some fear another conflict so soon.

afghanredux.20.d:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah, a relative outsider in the Royal Family, has marched on Kabul and deposed Nasrullah. The purge backfired and rather than be killed or fired, the enemies of Nasrullah flocked to Shah’s banner. Many were unjustly targeted during the purge, and Nasrullah has more enemies than friends he can depend on. Now, the Afghan Wild Card is in control of the country and there are few left to challenge him. While his vision for Afghanistan is still hazy, many are hesitant to support him due to his old ties to the British. One thing is clear, however: Nadir Shah is here to stay with most of the military at his back."
afghanredux.20.a:0 "A new man for a new Afghanistan."

afghanredux.21.t:0 "The Luftexpedition Arrives!"
afghanredux.21.d:0 "The Germans have sent help! The so called Luftexpedition has arrived in Kabul to seemingly an equal amount of cheers and jeers. The roar of a regiment of the finest planes of the world is such a beautiful sound! These German air wings and volunteers have been drilled in desert warfare during a stopover in Aleppo and, as such, are not totally out of their element. However, there was a mishap, as a German bomber bounced off of the makeshift airbase in Kabul before crashing to the ground. The plane's landing gear was ripped off by the bumpy and uneven surface before the nose was sent careening into the dirt. \n\nIn any case, German advisors are already discussing with our military brass on how to best utilize the expedition. While a group centered around the remnants of the newly revitalized Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition have welcomed these pasty white men with open arms, traditional elements within our nation still regard them with suspicion. Habibullah has built the reputation of being the lapdop of the Hun, and the new developments within our Emirate seem to confirm such a tale. It remains to be seen whether the German elements within our nation will lead to victory or disgrace."
afghanredux.21.a:0 "Willkommen Waffenbrüder!"

afghanredux.22.t:0 "Jihad!"
afghanredux.22.d:0 "In an address from Constantinople, the Caliph has declared that our war against the Raj as a jihad to free the shackled faithful under British imperialism. To jubilant Ottoman crowds, the Sultan [OTT.GetLeader] unleashed a tirade against the centuries-long British yoke under the Indian subcontinent and demanded that self determination be granted to the Indian population. This has been an immediate boon to our efforts as pious Muslims from across the region and in fact the world have begun to arrive in Kabul to join our struggle. Our airports and travel stops are overrun by pilgrims and warriors who seek Allah's glory by supporting our struggle. However, a countermovement led by the Emir of Mecca have decried this as a purely political maneuver by the Sultan to gain influence in the region, and the Ottoman rivals in Cairo have condemned the Caliph's actions. Political play or not, the results are undeniable, as warriors from around the Islamic world come to our aid."
afghanredux.22.a:0 "Inshallah."

afghanredux.23.t:0 "German Resources Arrive!"
afghanredux.23.d:0 "Rifles by the crate, ammo by the box and artillery by the pallet. All arrive in Kabul airport aboard German planes. The almost state of the art weapons of war are a far cry from what we were using previously and as such our men will require a lot of retraining to properly use them. Despite this we can now fight on more equal terms with our enemy and have a greater chance of victory."
afghanredux.23.a:0 "Maybe, one day, we can repay them."

afghanredux.24.t:0 "The Turks Send Arms!"
afghanredux.24.d:0 "As our troops pour over the crates of rifles and masses of artillery they are awed by their craftsmanship. The Turks promised us weapons and they have delivered in spades. We have begun to immediately disperse them to our soldiers on the Front and with these weapons straight from the Caliph, Allah will surely look upon us favorably."
afghanredux.24.a:0 "Allahu Akbar!"

afghanredux.25.t:0 "Send in the Hounds!"
afghanredux.25.d:0 "Not all Indians accept the rule of the Raj. Within our nation resides the Provisional Government of India, a native resistance group dedicated to finishing the destruction of the Raj. We have given the refuge in our nation long ago; however, they have long wasted away in exile, never finding an opportunity to strike at the Raj nor return home. Now with war having broken out we have finally found a reason to use them. They shall be smuggled back into their homeland to commit acts of sabotage and riotous sedition to divide our enemies' attention. The Raj, for all their faults, are much bigger than us and with their undivided attention we will surely fail. With them feeling the heat of their new fire in the rear, however, we will surely gain our righteous victory. Who knows, maybe they will even gain power in the ruins of the Raj!"
afghanredux.25.a:0 "United against Imperialism!"



afghanredux.37.t:0 "The Departure of our Allies"
afghanredux.37.d:0 "With the war against the Delhi regime concluded, our Ottoman and German friends have begun packing up to return home. The Sultan has called off the jihad, and the Germans have left a fraction of their men to continue the expedition. With their departure, our military seems less confident and capable of dealing with the instability that yet remains."
afghanredux.37.a:0 "Oh well."

afghanredux.38.t:0 "Chaos Ensues in Kabul!"
afghanredux.38.d:0 "All hell has broken loose in Kabul as the Emir has left Afghanistan in his Royal Cadillac, proclaiming that Afghanistan has been lost to the enemy. Telegrams then reached the capital that the armies of the kingdom have been routed and are now retreating back to the safety of the mountains of Kabul and Herat. Bandits and brigands have emerged from their foxholes, raiding cities, looting and pillaging. Anarchy is now rampant in the once glorious Emirate. The cities of Peshawar and Quetta have been laid to waste by the invading armies and Wali of Swat, Miangul Abdul Wadud, a staunch supporter of the Afghan Kingdom, lays besieged in his fortress, Raja Gira, with no possibility of help from the outside. Seeing the sad state of affairs of the emirate, Nasir ul Mulk, King of Chitral, has declared his allegiance to the British and attacked the Afghan garrisons in his state with his famed Scouts and killed the local Afghan Governor. \n\nAll the while, blood now flows through streets of Kabul and into the river as people try to defend their property and family from looters and bandits as all law enforcement are either overwhelmed or destroyed. The new Emir, Nasrullah Khan, is missing and presumed dead as bandits descended upon the city and the Royal Palace. Meanwhile, the bandits have elected a Kohistani Tajik as their leader and now they march under their bandit king, Habibullah Kalakani, to the gates of Kabul to take the capital city for themselves. At the same time, British Expeditionary Forces under the command of Henry Page Croft have crossed the Khyber Pass once more and are now within reach of Kabul itself. Memories of the Second Anglo-Afghan war are still fresh in the minds of the Afghan populace who now look at the white invaders with fear and apprehension. On the other hand, many Afghans have flocked to the banner of Nadir Shah who has declared himself as the savior of the nation. After a bloody battle for the heart of Kabul, who has prevailed?"

afghanredux.40.t:0 "Nadir Shah, the Opportunist Prince"
afghanredux.40.d:0 "Muhammad Nadir Shah, leader of the Musahiban branch, was born in Dehradun, British India in 1883. Due to the Iron Amir, Habibullah's father, realizing that the branch family would never cease trying to seize the throne, he exiled them to India and told his heir to never allow the “Al-Yahya” family into the country again, or his dynasty will face the consequences. After ascending to the throne, Amir Habibullah paid an official visit to British India where he fell in love with Nadir’s sisters. Nadir realizing an opportunity had opened for him, took advantage of the Amir’s philandry, and had his sister married to the Amir. It was quick work to convince the king to let their family to return to Afghanistan. \n\nReturning to Afghanistan, Nadir immediately started to make contacts with previous friends of the branch family and using these contacts, became a general and led the Afghan Army in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. After distinguishing himself in the war, he was made Minister of War and set out to reform the army, a task which was made easier by the involvement of the German military attaché. Now as the country stands at the precipice of war, Nadir Shah looks to destabilize the nation and take over the throne from the decadent royal family. Rumors have reached the ears of the Amir that there have been shady dealings between the British and Nadir Shah about a possible coup but the Amir has turned a deaf ear to these concerns saying his brother-in-law would never harm him for he is like his own brother. Whatever his intentions, Nadir Shah has the influence and the men behind him to become a big name in the inevitable power struggle in Kabul."

afgnews.1.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened in the Indian subcontinent as the Kingdom of Afghanistan has won against the last remnants of British India! Emulating the conquerors of old by taking over Delhi, the invaders have thrown the entire commonwealth in disarray! The British forces and their Indian auxiliaries have been overwhelmed and routed, fleeing to the ports of Karachi and Ahmadabad to escape the collapsing nation. Massive concessions have been granted to the jubilant Afghans, ceding enough land to nearly double the size of the Emirate. The Entente has declared that the Afghan victory was a fluke and not a representative of its weakness, while the Princely States and the Commune look upon the lands with an opportunistic eye! Afghan newspapers have declared it to be the beginning of the end for infidel rule in India and the Amir appears to have consolidated his power. Meanwhile, the other major powers of the world have not released any statements regarding this development as they didn’t expect an Afghani victory. While the Entente is shaken, those in Paris and Berlin look in glee as their rivals of the former British Empire sink further into despair. Military officials, analysts, and journalists believe that if they cannot win against a backwater nation, what hope do they have to return home?"

afgnews.2.d:0 "News from Delhi has circulated that the Dominion of India has declared their victory over the invading Afghans who have been forced to cede the lands they conquered in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Parades have been organized throughout the nation while the rest of the Entente has sent letters of congratulations to the ruling governor-general. The King, after hearing news of the victory, has declared it to be a sign of changing times, promising that the citizens of the dominion will be rewarded in due time for their bravery and valor in the battle for the Crown. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Afghanistan has fallen into instability, with some even advocating for the Amir to step down after this embarrassing defeat to the “Infidels”. With the Amir’s rule openly questioned, more and more of the radical elements of Afghan society have started to spread their influence to try and destabilize the nation. The bandits under a Kohistani named Habibullah Kalakani have started to raid cities and engaging in looting and pillaging as they see fit with some even saying that the bandit leader eyes the Durr-e-durran throne itself. This is a big victory for the Entente, but many say this was a foregone conclusion, as the Emirate was all but cornered into war with the Empire."

afgnews.3.d:0 "It seems that the administration in Delhi saw an opportunity and seized it with both hands. Mere days after the Dominion of India had declared total victory in the war against the Afghani invaders, the British have once again invaded Afghanistan. Under near anarchy, the British strike force was met almost unopposed in Kabul, with Afghanistan to be incorporated into the empire as a subject of the British Crown. The Dominion has declared that Afghans will not be treated as equal citizens and will have dominion status to allow for more flexible British rule. Meanwhile, the Afghani nation has been in a frenzy and has watched in horror as British troops have marched into their towns and declared that the kingdom is no more. The Emir after signing the surrender has gone into exile to Holy cities to spend the rest of his time in front of God to beg his forgiveness for his rash decision to invade the British when he knew he couldn’t win. For the first time in history, Afghanistan is being ruled by the European imperialists and is now little more than another dominion in the commonwealth. The Graveyard has finally been conquered..."

While Afghanistan has had a martial tradition for milennia, modern war has no need for the valor of men. Instead, war demands brain and metal more than blood. Most of our standing army is reliant on levies from the various tribes under our rule, and almost all of them are severely lacking in equipment, with many preferring the ancestral jezail flintlock than a standard issue rifle. This stagnation means that our armies are often underequipped and will likely crumble in the face of a modernized adversary."

With the British resorting to mass arrests and displacements, many Muslims sought refuge in Kabul, to which the Emir has generously granted.

With the Emir seeing the blood in the water, Afghanistan joined Germany and the Ottoman Empire to shatter Entente influence in the Levant, Arabian Peninsula, and Indian Subcontinent. The war had been won 20 years ago, yet the expedition stays.

With every day that passes, support for the Young Afghans and a war to destroy the British Raj grows. With every day that passes, whispers of treason against the Emir become more and more common. They say that the Emir has grown fat, lazy, complacent. They say that he is no longer even Muslim, that he plans to subvert Islam and destroy Afghan traditions.

Inefficient and incompetent bureaucracy is rife throughout all ministries, and no meaningful change can be accomplished if the brightest and most honest Afghani has no place in our government."

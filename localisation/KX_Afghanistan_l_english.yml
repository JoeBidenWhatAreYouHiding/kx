### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_AMANULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Born in 1892, as the third son of Habibullah Khan, Amanullah Khan was, upon reaching proper age, installed as governor of Kabul and commander of the Army, gaining many important tribal allies. When the Weltkrieg broke out Amanullah, seeing this as a chance to seize lands on the other side of the Durand Line, joined Nasrullah in urging for joining into the Weltkrieg on the Kaiserreich’s side. When his father remained steadfast in his neutrality, Nasrullah and Amanullah, using mainly Amanullah’s tribal contacts, gathered up a force to invade the Raj. The initial push was a debacle and Amanullah was forced to retreat back into Afghanistan with the Raj hot on his heels. So began the Third Anglo-Afghan War. \n\nAmanullah was then forced to watch as his Army struggled to fight off the British and Indian invaders. However, when the Weltkrieg in Europe came to an end, Afghanistan was given its due. Since then, however, Amanullah has seen his father grow fat and lazy on the throne and angled his way to become his successor. Now having triumphed over Nasrullah, his uncle, and former ally, Amanullah stands as the unchallenged Emir of Afghanistan. Amanullah is not content with just sitting on his present victories, however. He sees a future Afghanistan shining like a beacon of modernity in the roughness of Central Asia. He sees a future free of imperialist influence and the meddling of outside powers and their ‘spheres of influence’. For too long has mighty Afghanistan been forced to hide in the shade of the Raj, and the King of the God-granted Kingdom of Afghanistan and its dependencies been regarded as the leader of a second-rate power. Only through blood and steel shall the Afghan people carve their place in the Sun from the corpse of the British Empire, just as the Germans did. Now it remains to be seen if he can achieve his dream."
POLITICS_HABIBULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Habibullah's reign has thus far been marked by reforms and attempts to modernize his country by working to bring modern medicine and other technology to Afghanistan. Born in 1871, in Uzbekistan, he would rise to power in 1901, upon the death of his father, the previous Emir. Habibullah’s early reign was one of reform, as he quickly issued a general amnesty to his father’s many enemies, allowing them to return to the country. He also began to import new technology and further modern science within Afghanistan. He also was a social reformer, repealing many draconian criminal punishments while making the legal system fairer in general. One of his principal reforms was dismantling his father’s internal intelligence system that oppressed huge swaths of the country. In 1903, Habibullah founded the Habibia school as well as a military academy. \n\nWhen the Weltkrieg broke out, Habibullah took great pains to keep his nation neutral in the War. Despite the insistence of the Sultan in Istanbul and the Kaiser in Berlin, his proximity to India and the British made any intervention seemingly doomed to fail. This all changed with the defeat of the British in Europe and the ensuing revolutions that ripped through their Empire, however. As chaos gripped the Raj and British rule faltered, Habibullah was initially hesitant to do anything. This meant little to his generals, who quickly crossed the Durand Line and seized border towns of the Raj. Habibullah, unable to reverse this without appearing fatally weak, was forced to go along with this fait accompli. This bolstered his popularity at home since the Raj, still battling for its own survival, was unable to resist.\n\nTwenty years after his victory, Habibullah has had to watch his grand dream of a powerful Afghanistan begin to wither. In the hinterlands, rebellion has once again reared its ugly head while members of his own family eye the crown hungrily. If Afghanistan is to be truly stable, Habibullah knows he must do something."
POLITICS_KALAKANI_DESC:0 "Habibullah Kalakani was born in 1891 in the village of Kalakan, north of Kabul. An ethnic Tajik, his father was named Aminullah and delivered water to people's homes. This heritage is how Kalakani gained the nickname ‘Bacha-ye Saqao’, or son of the water carrier. During his adolescence, Kalakani ventured out of his village and traveled to the city of Kabul. In the south, he met an old Sufi who told the young Habibullah that he would become king one day. He would fight with the Afghan Army in the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the Khost Rebellion. After being discharged from the army after attacking a superior officer, Habibullah escaped Kabul in the dead of night and once again returned to a life of banditry. Habibullah's exploits as a bandit gradually gathered him a small but loyal band of brigands, robbing caravans during the day and hiding out at night. Afghan Army units sent to round him up were routed or brought over to his cause and it was not long before Kalakani became the real authority in Eastern Afghanistan. While Habibullah grew fat and lazy in Kabul, Kalakani began to draw up plans to fulfill his destiny and become King of Afghanistan. However, despite his growing power and ambitions, he was reluctant to strike at Kabul and tear the heart out of the decadent regime he had come to despise. That time came eventually with the catastrophic war against the Raj, and despite all odds, Kalakani now has seized the reins of government. What he intends to do with his newfound power however only Kalakani and Allah know and neither of them seems interested in telling."
POLITICS_NASRULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Nasrullah Khan was born in 1874, the second of three sons to Emir Abdur Rahman. As a young man in his early 20s, Nasrullah was sent on a journey to the UK to pay his father’s respect to Queen Victoria. Since he spoke little English and did not make a good impression on the local press who described him as a 'stolid, impassive and bored youth'. Nevertheless, he paid his respects as demanded and after a detour through Paris and Italy, returned home. This experience, while considered a diplomatic failure, prepared the young man for life in statecraft. When his older brother Habibullah rose to the throne, Nasrullah was suddenly one of the most important men in Afghanistan, if not more so than before. \n\nFirst to court him were the religious authorities who languished under his father Abdur. Nasrullah was a deeply religious man by this point and quickly warmed to their influence. The second was his brother, the Emir, who saw him as a potential rival. To secure his loyalty, Habibullah made him Commander in Chief, President of the State Council, and later heir over his own sons. Nasrullah was also kept loyal by the fact that the Emir held their brother, Mohammed, and Mohammed’s mother as little more than prisoners. Nasrullah was no Claudius, for he was loyal to Habibullah throughout his reign.\n\nDuring this time Nasrullah also grew to despise the British, despite his early venture to the Isles. The British had, under an earlier treaty, kept the Afghan government from maintaining valuable alliances with the powerful tribes of the Afghan hinterlands. At the same time, British influence began to slowly creep deeper and deeper into Afghanistan, which Nasrullah saw as a threat to his family and his people. When the Weltkrieg broke out, Nasrullah saw his chance to strike decisively at the British. He, along with the Young Afghan movement, urged the Emir to join the war on the side of the Turks and Germans. To their frustration, Habibullah remained neutral. When the Niedermayer Hentig Expedition arrived in Afghanistan, Nasrullah found a new group of loyal allies. Along with the Expedition, Nasrullah proposed numerous ways to undermine the British but all of them were dismissed by the Emir. As the Germans’ victory seemed imminent, however, Nasrullah finally got fed up with waiting for his brother. Without orders Nasrullah helped round up a group of tribes on the border and invaded the Raj. He was beaten, decisively and the nation he loved was dragged into a devastating war. When the Weltkrieg ended, so did the Third Anglo-Afghan War and Nasrullah Khan had achieved his dream. \n\nTwenty years later, Nasrullah now sits at the helm of his beloved nation, having defeated usurper and conspirator alike.

Born to an exiled branch of the royal family in India, Mohammad Nadir Khan would return to Afghanistan only in the early 1900s, when Habibullah Khan married Nadir’s sister. He served admirably in Habibullah’s government until the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Afghan War. While faring decent against the seasoned British forces, he was never able to gain the successes needed to cripple the Raj. Instead, he was forced to fight on for years until an end to the war in Europe forced an end to the War in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile Afghanistan had triumphed, Nadir was left with a bitter aftertaste, and he was further enraged by radical proposals for the modernization of Afghanistan. While no traditionalist like Nasrullah, Nadir felt that some of Habibullah’s more ambitious reforms, no doubt suggested by his son Amanullah, were too far, stripping Afghanistan of its identity. During this era of peace, if not animosity, the British have appealed to Nadir Khan, promising him the throne in exchange for his cooperation. Now Nadir rules in Afghanistan with undeniable help from his former enemies, the British. While few expect him to kowtow to Delhi and Ottawa for long, even fewer see his reign as one of continuing reform. Nadir instead seems to want to propel Afghanistan into the future, but also pay respects to its admirable past. Whether or not he can continue this balancing act remains to be determined."
POLITICS_NISAR_MUHAMMAD_DESC:0 "Born in 1897 along the borderland between Afghanistan and the British Raj, Nisar Muhammad Yousafzai has always been a staunch advocate for the rights of his people. In 1919, Nisar joined the Royal Afghan Army to free Afghanistan from the clutches of the British Empire. Nisar served with distinction until his capture by British soldiers, where he escaped under the threat of execution. Nisar fled to Tashkent where he became closely involved with the Bolshevik cells operating within the area. As a member of the party, Nisar was a strong advocate for the rights of minorities by launching an education campaign in local villages and publishing a newspaper that advocated for reaching social reforms and autonomy for minority groups. Following his return to Afghanistan, Nisar has risen to be the leader of the moderate Parchamite faction, where he hopes to bring his message of gradual reform to bring forth an equal society for all Afghans."

afghanredux.0.t:0 "The Graveyard of Empires Stirs"
afghanredux.0.d:0 "Much has changed for the Emirate of Afghanistan since the turn of the century. Habibullāh Khan’s reign initially endeavored to push his once reformative agenda into practice despite resistance from the nation’s many entrenched conservative sources of influence. Despite this, Afghanistan has seen some progress, with its legal, economic and educational systems all receiving minorly beneficial reforms, but above all, no institution within our Emirate has flourished like our military has, with Habibullāh passing a slew of new laws to improve the Afghan Army. This military prowess was built up as the earliest years of the new century dragged on until the Weltkrieg broke out in 1914. \n\nAs the horrific Weltkrieg dragged on, Afghanistan was put under increasing pressure from both the Kaiserreich and the Ottoman Empire to join the conflict on their behalf. Initially, Habibullāh resisted these calls for war, instead turning inward as he focused on ruling his own kingdom sealed away from the wider world. However, this peace would be shattered in 1917, when a band of tribes rallied by Nasrullah Khan and Ghāzī Amānullāh Khān disobeyed all previous orders and took a secretive gamble to push into British India without informing their Emir. Without support from the wider armed forces, Amānullāh’s forces were disastrously beaten and quickly forced back into Afghani territory, dragging the nation into the Weltkrieg and sparking a third war between us and the Anglos ... \n\nTwo years prior, the Kaiserreich established the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition, a military attache aimed at training, supplying, and otherwise aiding the Afghani forces for a surprise attack against the Anglo-Indian forces. Eventually, the cacophony of the Weltkrieg drew silent, and Afghanistan stood on the side of the victors.\n\nAs the decades since that horrific conflict have worn on, Habibullāh’s rule has only drifted further from his original ideals as he grows lazier and more opulent with age. It is now 1936, and the German mission is still here, Habibullāh still lounges on his throne, and our Emirate is as unstable as ever. The constant meddling of the Kaiser’s expeditionary force has only driven up unrest, regardless of the military benefits it has provided, and this chaotic situation has only been stoked by the rising radicalism being proliferated within the Provisional Government of India which we have so generously harbored. The Young Afghans, a local nationalist movement, grow increasingly vocal over their displeasure with Habibullāh’s rule, and the Emir’s two main rivals of Amānullāh and Nasrullah are at each other’s throats, each vying for their seat on Habibullāh’s throne. The aging Emir is growing desperate to keep his seat of power intact, and some whisper that he is even willing to start another war to do it. The nation of Afghanistan is once again on the edge of great change or utter collapse, and only Allah knows which way it will fall."

The previously disunited tribes now find unity in the pride of the newfound Afghan power and the many plots against our sovereign seem to have dissipated. It was decided to organize a great and sumptuous parade in the streets of Kabul, with a huge crowd and all the tribal and political representatives of the country present during the event. At the end of the parade, King Ghazi Habibullah Khan delivered a speech to his people praising the merits of Afghanistan's modernization and its proud army during the Fourth Anglo-Afghan War. To the surprise of his people, the King announced the formation of a new Barakzai Empire, risen from the ashes of the Durrani and Mughals, and that he would lead it to greatness. He left the stage to the loud applause of both his people and the tribal leaders.\n\nMeanwhile in Delhi, news of the announcement of 'Mughal ambitions' has shaken the government to its core. Communications between Delhi and Ottawa are frantic. Fear of another invasion, one which could see the complete annexation of the Raj, has paralyzed the British administration.

Since Afghanistan and the German Empire are on friendly terms, helping the Afghans out would reaffirm our ties and further improve relations. In addition, such a move would surely come as a snub to the Canadians, something that is always welcome by the German people. However, with Black Monday currently ravaging our economy and the Empire having bigger problems to deal with than Afghanistan's distant wars, perhaps it might be best to keep the planes and men to ourselves. Some have pointed out that while it would be nice to have a strong friend in the region, supporting the Afghans comes with the risk of upsetting the Canadians at a time when their new King provides an opportunity for renewed relations, and would undoubtedly hurt us in the long run should Delhi emerge victorious.

He eats the best food he has in some time, visited numerous historical sights, answered questions asked by throngs of foreign reporters, and finally has his midday prayers in the Hagia Sophia. When he is done he is taken to the Sultan and the two hit it off well. The Sultan asks about the War and how Afghanistan is doing while Amanullah asks about how the Sublime Porte fares in turn. The Sultan pledged to provide support to the Afghan cause by any means necessary, and in turn, humbly requests support. Many in the Royal Court, the Caliph included, believe war may be coming to the Ottoman sphere of influence. The Emir’s son pledged to support the Caliph in any way he could. Amanullah then watched the Palace Guard execute parade maneuvers in the courtyard and appeared thoroughly impressed. Such discipline! Such fervor! He was seen off by the Sultan himself, and as Amanullah sits down in his plane, all consider the visit between the two as a great success.

Finally, he is flown to Qoms where he observes a grand military parade followed by an inspection. Amanullah notes the disheveled looks of some of the soldiers and their disorganization despite the shouts of their commanders. The men are all too sloppy; their uniforms are the wrong size and they conduct their military drills and maneuvers without tempo or panache. During his inspection of what was heralded as an 'elite' division, a soldier further down the line drops his rifle and it goes off, shooting himself in the foot.

He is also all too aware of the state of his military before the War and his visit to the Ottomans has given him some ideas as to how to improve his situation. While Amanullah is not first in line to receive the throne, should his father abdicate or be rendered incapable, he is a man of ambition. His uncle, Nasrullah, is a reactionary man, who would rather see Afghanistan wallow in the same troubles that have been affecting it for centuries instead of dragging it into the future.

Prized for its isolation, its pristine and unspoiled natural beauty, and its ample hunting grounds, this isolated and forgotten cut has long been the well-kept secret of Afghani nobles and royals seeking a bountiful foray into the wilds. First traveling here what must be years ago by now with Mohammad Nadir, who has long used this gorge as his own personal plot to hunt the varied beasts of our lands, our king Habibullah and his most trusted confidants have frequently used this strip of wilderness to clear the mind, to discuss politics or matters of the state in private, or even to just take an occasional break from the rigors of rule and statecraft. \n\nThis hunting trip was no different, with Habibullah and his retinue leaving their horses back at the entrance of the pass where a small rest shack stood, continuing deeper into the wilds on foot. Bringing with them only a small amount of survival supplies, their traditional jezails with ample shot and powder, and other various supplies needed for the hunt such as bait and skinning knives, the royal retinue embarked deep into the heart of this ‘Valley of the King’ in search of noble prey such as wild boar, ibex, antelope, markhor, and if they were so lucky, even snow leopard and Asiatic cheetah. As the sun rose high in the arid and crisply blue sky, their multi-day hunt began with their guards lowered and their spirits high, for it's not like anything ever goes awry this far from the causticness of civilization..."

However, fate had other plans, and as the retinue scrambled their way up the mountain, disaster struck. With the snow leopard finally catching the hunters’ scent as the wind shifted, the stark white feline bolted, causing the hunting party to attempt to chase after it. However, one of the nobles on the trip with Habibullah lost his footing on the rock face above the king, slipping down the cliff face by a few meters before regaining his grip. Thinking the worst was behind them and disaster was just avoided, the small sighs of relief and quiet cheers ended abruptly when the sound of gunfire cut through the valley. Turning back in horror, Habibullah’s men saw the jezail fall from the slipping noble’s back, hitting the side of the mountain and misfiring directly into the face of their king. In an explosion of pink mist and grey smoke, a hole the size of a softball was blown through the head of Habibullah, sending the honored king tumbling down to the valley floor, leaving a red trail behind him as he plummeted lifelessly to the ground. As his men quickly repelled down the mountain rushing to the aid of their wounded king, it was far too late to save him by the time they reached his side. Managing to gurgle out a swift goodbye through the blood filling his lungs and throat before finally passing, Habibullah died on the floor of the valley surrounded by some of his closest allies. \n\nA tragic accident if ever there was one, the men wrapped the king’s body in gauze and prepared to take him back to Kabul, dreading having to break it to the nation that the king was well and truly dead. Though all in the retinue understood clearly that this was an accident in every sense of the word, the more cynical within the group believed that upon their return, accusations would begin to fly as rival groups vying for power each start to throw blame on one another. Whatever awaited them in Kabul, they would soon see, but the trek back was sure to be a solemn one."

However, a countermovement led by the Emir of Mecca have decried this as a purely political maneuver by the Sultan to gain influence in the region, and the Ottoman rivals in Cairo have condemned the Caliph's actions.

Dropping the title of ‘King’, which had been used during Habibullah’s reign, Nasrullah has chosen to be crowned as Emir of Afghanistan.

In their meeting, the prince had assured his loyalty to the Emir and had informed him of a secretive plot by local chiefs to overthrow Nasrullah. To bring these plotters to justice, Nadir Khan has asked the Emir for the position of Chief of the Army and a generous endowment.

To ensure that only one Emir rules over Afghanistan, Nasrullah and his men traveled into the rugged Kohistan mountains to meet with the Bacha in his fortress. After a long conversation, the Emir discovered that he and the ‘bandit king’ shared many similar views regarding their Islamic faith and their vision for Afghanistan’s future. Impressed by the new Emir, Kalakani has offered to take up arms for the Emir in exchange for a lump sum payment for the Bacha and his men. Nasrullah knew that accepting the brigand king’s offer would enrage the elites back in Kabul, whose caravans and villages had been raided by the Bacha and his bandits. The Emir also knew that refusing this deal might set off the timid Tajik, and more blood will be shed in the countryside. Nasrullah considered giving Kalakani a counter offer where he would allow the Bacha and his men safe passage up north to join Ibrahim Bek and his Mujahideen in Turkestan, effectively putting an end to the reign of the bandit king.

This reception was a token of appreciation for the Ottoman assistance during the Fourth Anglo-Afghan war. Arriving by plane and landing at a small airstrip in Kabul, the Sultan was accompanied by his entourage and royal guard, accompanied by an Afghan army convoy. Upon arrival, he was warmly greeted by the Emir and the Afghan Royal Guard. Notably, the Afghan Royal Guard performed an impressive drill and salute in honor of the Sultan. Following this ceremonial welcome, both the Sultan and the Emir, along with their entourages, retired to the palace for dinner and entertainment. During this event, as the guests were engrossed in the generosity of their hosts, the Sultan and the Emir had an opportunity for a private conversation. It was during this private exchange that the Sultan revealed the mounting challenges facing the Islamic world, particularly within the Ottoman Empire. He described the Ottoman Empire as a "powderkeg" with increasing strength of the Cairo Axis and internal discord. Border disputes and skirmishes with Iran, along with escalating tensions in the Levant and the Arabian Peninsula, had reached unprecedented levels. The Sultan, feeling cornered, sought a favor from the Emir – to align Afghanistan with the Ottoman Empire. He emphasized that the fate of the Ottoman Empire depended on Afghanistan's support in case of a conflict. As they gazed out towards the rooftops of Kabul, the Emir delivered his response:"

Eager to use the modern rifles they seized from the Kabul arsenal, the bandits tested these weapons by indiscriminately shooting anyone who dared get in their way. Under the Bacha’s orders, all schools, palaces, and anything else deemed heretical were to be razed to the ground. Smoke plumed into the night skies as Kalakani and his men returned to the Arg with their newfound gains.

After ascending to the throne, Emir Habibullah paid an official visit to British India where he fell in love with Nadir’s sisters. Nadir, realizing an opportunity had opened for him, took advantage of the Emir’s philandry, and had his sister married to the Emir. It was quick work to convince the king to let their family return to Afghanistan. \n\nReturning to Afghanistan, Nadir immediately started to make contacts with previous friends of the branch family and using these contacts, became a general and led the Afghan Army in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. After distinguishing himself in the war, he was made Minister of War and set out to reform the army, a task which was made easier by the involvement of the German military attaché. Currently, Prince Nadir along with his son Zahir, are not in Afghanistan, as the old Prince is currently recovering from surgery in Europe. Now as the country stands at the precipice of war, Nadir Khan is making plans for his return, plotting to destabilize the nation and take the throne for himself. Rumors have reached the ears of the Emir that there have been shady dealings between the British and Nadir Khan about a possible coup but the Emir has turned a deaf ear to these concerns saying his brother-in-law would never harm him for he is like his own brother.

After a short manhunt, Ali Khan was found hiding in the home of a Hazara tribesmen along with his sons, making arrangements to flee to British India. The search party promptly shot both the tribesmen and Ali Khan’s sons while taking the pretender Emir prisoner. After waiting out his last days in the dungeon of the Arg, the day of Ali Khan’s execution finally came. Seeking to make an example of the false Emir, Kalakani ordered that Ali Khan be beaten, stripped naked, and paraded through the streets of Kabul on the back of a donkey. Ali Khan was then brought to the airstrip on the outskirts of Kabul, where Kalakani and his men were already waiting. Unwavering, the bloodied Emir said nothing to the Bacha, choosing instead to look to the skies. As a final act against the pretender, Kalakani ordered that Ahmad be executed by cannon to prevent a proper burial. Ali Khan was then tied to the mouth of the cannon, there was not much left of him after that."

To give the impression of a witless bandit that spread his forces thin, Kalakani ordered two of his commanders to launch an attack on Nadir’s strongholds while the soldier prince planned to meet with a local chief to win his support before his assault on Kabul. For weeks, Kalakani and his most loyal followers hid in the Logar Valley, awaiting the prince’s convoy. On the final day, Kalakani saw the horses riding into the valley and made his move. Knowing that the fate of both the Emirate and his very life depended on this shot, the Bacha aimed his rifle. Nadir Khan only caught a glint in the corner of his lenses before the bullet pierced his skull. To give the impression that they were up against a much larger force, Kalakani had placed his men in different positions across the valley to begin firing after he took the first shot. To add to the chaos, Kalakani has employed another stratagem from his marauding days of using hand grenades to paralyze the prince’s forces with fear. In a little under an hour, Mohammad Nadir Khan lay dead in the valley. Kalakani celebrated his victory by taking shots at the fleeing tribesmen before riding back to Kabul to bring the news of the Soldier Prince’s demise at the hands of the Bacha ye-Saquo."

Meeting at Nadir Khan’s encampment to the south of Kabul, the two Khans had finally met. After hours of tense negotiations between the two parties, two proposals have been put forth by the two Emirs. Ali Ahmad Khan has offered the Soldier Prince the position of commander of the new Royal Army if he is to accept the legitimacy of the government that elected him as Emir. The ‘Wild Card’, Mohammad Nadir Khan had presented Ali Khan with an offer of his own .

For the first time in the nation’s history, Afghanistan is ruled by a non-Pashtun, and most of the nation’s elite still chafe under Kalakani’s rule. Seeking to foster a sense of legitimacy, Kalakani has decided to formally crown himself as Emir Habibullah II, unofficially continuing the line of succession. With his coronation, the Bacha must begin the transition from a rugged band of brigands in the Kohistan mountains to governing an entire nation.

Seeking to gain the trust of those who only see their new Emir as nothing more than a bloodthirsty bandit, Kalakani has called for a grand feast to be held in the fortress citadel of the Arg. In just a few days, thousands of tribesmen poured down from the highlands and into the battle-scarred capital to partake in the festivities organized by the Emir. Among the crowd was Kalakani himself, joining his subjects in the revelry as they circled around a cockfight in the bombed-out private quarters of the Arg. For a moment, the Afghan people could forget about their uncertain future as Kabul once again flowed with life."

afghanredux.63.t:0 "Raiding the Treasury"
afghanredux.63.d:0 "As Kalakani and his men fought the desperate royal guards that defended Kabul to the last breath, the Bacha actually cared little for the city. For Kalakani, the real prize lay beneath the fortress of the Arg. Before they began their assault, an informant had informed the brigands that Habibullah’s treasury lies beneath the fortress, filled to the brim with gold and other treasures. Using a captured artillery piece, the Saqqawists blasted through the fortified walls and flooded into the palace, wiping out the remaining guards and princes. As Kalakani and his men descended into the dungeons of the Arg, they had finally arrived at the giant iron door. Using dynamite to blast it open, the bandits hungrily awaited their reward. As the dust settled, all that remained in the vault was a few coins scattered on the floor. Habibullah had already emptied the treasury before he fled Afghanistan. The Bacha was enraged, for that he had promised to repay his men in full. Not wishing to anger his loyal band, Kalakani set his men towards their new bounty, the city of Kabul."

afghanredux.64.d:0 "For the martial tribes of Afghanistan, most notably the Pashtun, the jezail is a beloved cultural icon as well as a dependable weapon. Handcrafted and passed down through generations, most of our young men are familiar with these flintlocks and prefer to use them above everything else. However, with the developments of the world around us, the jezail is quickly becoming more and more of a relic. While the craftsmanship cannot be denied, they cannot live up to their modern counterparts on the battlefield. This was shown in full display during our recent war against the Anglos, with our warriors’ weapons being outranged by the more reliable and standardized Lee Enfield rifles. While we may have triumphed against the British once, we cannot be complacent. \n\nWith our new reforms to our Afghan army, it is with a heavy heart that we must standardize our army’s weapons and do away with the jezail in our army. We are already being met with resistance, as senior military meetings explode into vicious arguments. Several tribe leaders and more conservative members of the army have been in uproar over these changes, pledging to resist such developments that ‘destroy the heritage of our nation’. Yet, we cannot control the world around us, and if we are to protect the sovereignty of our nation, we must ensure that every young man in our army has the tools he needs to defend our beloved country."

Standing on foundational pillars of tribalism, guerilla warfare and banditry, Sharia law and absolute dedication to Islam, Mujahideen loyalism, traditionalist fundamentalism and hyper-conservatism, this new domain stands more as the personal warlord state of Bacha-ye Saqao than it does any regal suzerainty, but it still stands nonetheless in defiance of all that seek to oppose Allah’s so-called chosen. A ‘true’ second Durrānī empire in name only, Kalakani’s new fiefdom shall obey its new master as a nightmare from of Ahmad Shah Durrani rises over the arid heart of Asia once again."

Even considering declaring himself Caliph, Kalakani often dreams of launching an invasion westwards to claim the title for himself by right of conquest. A curious proposition indeed, but there is no way he would go through with it...right?"

While it is indeed remarkable that the Sultan survived the challenging conditions of the territories they had to traverse to reach Afghanistan, we are honored that he has chosen our country as a refuge. Nevertheless, some advisors to the Emir have raised concerns. They suggest that this initial 'temporary' exile could potentially become permanent. To safeguard the Emir's authority, they propose that measures be taken to prevent the Sultan from gaining too much influence within Afghanistan, should Osman’s exiles attempt to do so."

Despite facing challenges like the initial vanguard of the Cairo Axis, Bedouin ambushes, and Iranian patrols, they have successfully reached Kabul and established a garrison on its outskirts. While their presence has helped reduce banditry in the surrounding villages, it has also led to an increase in begging and loitering.

A coup was launched against the current government, and the Emir has successfully been subdued. As a result, our forces have asserted full control over the entire state, and have moved to eliminate traitors that dare oppose Ottoman rule. Thus, the spirit of liberation has been lit aflame in the hearts of the exiles, as the new government under the guidance of Osman Fuad paves the way towards the glorious reclamation of our lost empire."

Despite that, through wise political juggling and maneuver performed by both of the dual administrations, it appears that a possible compromise that satisfies both parties has been reached. With that, a joint government was agreed upon between the exiles and our current administration, fusing into a proper Afghan-Ottoman government, forging a unique bond like no other, seeking to restore glories of the past."

From the Dardanelles to Baghdad, from Sinai to Ankara, the lands of the so-called Sick Man of Europe have been cleared of disease and brought back to life as the true scions of Allah grace the Fertile Crescent once more. Standing side by side, our allied forces of Afghanistan and the Ottoman government in exile were able to beat all the odds, and now we may bask in the sunlight together as brother-nations forevermore.

Amanullah has called a jirga to answer the question of the Indian nobility in our newly conquered territories. The traditionalist Pashtun chiefs have put forward a plan that would grant vast swathes of lands to Afghan princes while also letting the Islamic faithful keep their lands. Favoring neither side, many within the government have advocated towards a meritocratic solution that would seek out the most efficient administrators, whether they are Afghan or Hindus. Wishing to ease the strain on the administration and pursue more of his reforms at home, Amanullah has considered leaving the Hindu caste system in place to appease the princes and maintain order across the Khyber Pass."

These territories have more than quadrupled our population and have greatly added on to the administrative problems we face at home. Amanullah has called a jirga to build a framework that will relieve the administrative strain of our new Indian territories. The ambitious Pashtun chiefs have proposed a plan that would carve up the territories among Pashtun elites and collaborative princes. Young Afghan moderates have supported an initiative that would see the revival of the Subah system that was created during the administrative reforms of the Mughal emperor, Akbar the Great. These new provinces will enjoy a great deal of autonomy while the government can free itself from the administrative strain and focus on reforms.

These sacred lands are the birthplace of the Dharmic religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. In addition to these faiths, Islam, Christianity, and a variety of other religions have left a significant impact on India’s culture and history. In Afghanistan, Islam has been embedded in all facets of the region’s society for well over a millennia. With our recent conquests, we now rule over millions of new subjects belonging to various faiths and creeds. To mend this religious rift, Amanullah has once again called a jirga to solve the religious debate. Perhaps the most obvious solution, the traditionalists and their allies in the clergy have supported promoting the Islamic faith. Seeking to foster a new Islamic identity, religious leaders have supported providing aid to local mosques and collaborating with Muslim princely states. The Young Afghans have instead proposed a secularist approach by valuing the importance of all faiths throughout the empire. Taking inspiration from the Baha'i faith and the Din-i Ilahi of Akbar the Great, these moderates hope to focus on a shared national identity rather than that of a religious one. Wishing not to tread on any ideas of religion, some of Amanullah’s most fanatic supporters have urged the king towards endorsing a massive propaganda campaign throughout the empire that would exalt the achievements of the king"

Shall he look to the traditionalist legacy of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire? Or perhaps Babur’s great grandson, Akbar, whose syncretic policies brought prosperity for the Mughals. Looking further to the past, Amanullah has also found inspiration in Alexander the Great and the Indo-Greek legacy of his successors.

To facilitate his radical reforms, Amanullah Khan has sought out the rising star in the socialist scene, Nur Mohammad Taraki. While originally a journalist for the Awakened Youth, Taraki’s fate would change when he met with Abdul Ghaffar Khan, whose redshirts had fled to Afghanistan during the Hijrat. Through Abdul Khan, Taraki met with other Indian socialists and began his goal to bring socialism to the rugged mountains of Afghanistan. Taraki broke off with the Awakened Youth to form the People’s Party. Recently the People’s Party has merged with the other nascent socialist clubs to form the Eternal Flame.

It is no secret that our empire is already overstretched beyond comparison, so ceding some territory that will likely be a thorn in our side for decades to come is not the worst idea, but it would weaken our own plan to create a similar puppet administration across all of Persia instead. Doing so would limit our direct control over the region, but would do so by empowering one of our closest allies instead while still allowing us to reap the benefits and profits of Persia’s profitable oil industry, and while freeing us of the violent burden these new subjugated citizens will likely carry with them into the protectorate.

To ensure a stable transition, Shah Mahmud Khan has proposed the creation of a ‘Nonpartisan Bloc’ of sorts that would assist these political groups and proto-parties in running the nation and its new anocratic government. In the eyes of many traditionalists and conservatives, this is a no-brainer, for it would ensure that the new democratic government cannot go off the rails in its future reforms, keeping the new legislative body on a tight leash. However, believers in true, unfettered democracy - few as they are - see this nonpartisan bloc as a thinly-veiled attempt by deep-seated elitist elements to truncate the democratic process, mutilating it before it can be truly born and effectively rendering this new democracy a tool of the stable, yet possibly stagnating, status quo.

The Afghan people have mockingly referred to the young Daoud as ‘Sardar Savinkov’, paralleling his reverence of the Russian leader, a title that Daoud himself has come to enjoy.

However, Ghobar has other allies he could perhaps turn to in order to realize his pink dream. Inspired by the non-violent works of the Anjuman-e-Islah-e Afghania - or Society for the Reformation of Afghans - led by the great ‘Frontier Gandhi’ Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the personal correspondence between Amanullah Khan and the late Vladimir Lenin, by the Wäisi movement of the Tatars who rallied against the Russian Tsarists in a Leftist facsimile of the liberal Jadid movement, and by the legacy of Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī - Muhammad’s disciple and history’s first true Islamic Socialist, Ghobar has many sources of strength to pull from if he were to go at his reformist dream without the aid of the conservative Islamists of his colleague Iqbal. Instead, he could even strike up a coalition with the more moderate and non-violent members of Anjuman-e-Islah-e Afghania in order to have his Fatherland Party be able to stand largely on its own and dash towards the dream of democratic and egalitarian Islamic Socialism without obstacles.

Those who have come to visit are not united in purpose or idea however, for they are split between a camp of Liberal Kemalists under the command of Ahmet Ağaoğlu and Mahmud Celâleddin Bayar, and more basal Kemalists under Mustafa Kemal himself, and both groups have come to see if our interpretation of their ideology can be swayed to either of their camps. The Liberal Kemalists, of whom our own Abdul Hadi Dawi personally supports, call for free market capitalism, liberal reformism, guaranteed rights and liberties, civic nationalism, and even democratic republicanism in line with the Six Arrows. On the other hand, the original Kemalists - of whom Mahmud Tarzi, the late founder of our own Young Afghans, supported more - call for a more standard interpretation of the Six Arrows, dropping any Liberal pretenses in order to focus on cultural nationalism, nationalized economics, and other more radical views.

On matters of culture and society, the two could not be more diametrically opposed as Iqbal stands for tradition and the conservative status quo while Ghobar stands for reformism and societal evolution in tune with our Durrani past. However, both men are devout Muslims, allies of the imams, and quite interestingly, they share a large amount of their ideas on economic theory as well, both being populists seeking to uplift the masses while keeping them faithful and orderly. Both also curiously have spent much time personally studying figures like Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī and other early Islamic populists, though Iqbal adamantly stands against Ghobar’s position that Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī was a true Socialist. With this past relationship and the apparent similarities between our parties made apparent, we must now decide if the Muslim League should work with our fellow Islamists in the Fatherland Party for the good of all, even if it means making some compromises, or should we continue to walk our path under Allah all alone?"

To celebrate this divine revelation, past cultures and dynasties built great works dedicated to their new and sole God, with ornate mosques and other structures appearing all across our mountain paradise. However, none of these great works compare to the great Minaret of Jam and its similar contemporaries like the Ghazni minarets and others like them. Roughly 60 of these minarets and towers were constructed by the great Islamic conquerors of Central Asia between the 11th and 13th centuries to honor their victories and to mark their new lands, with many still standing today not only in our own Afghanistan, but in places like India, Persia, Bukhara, Kokand, and Khiva - the most famous of which being the tallest of them all, the Kutlug Timur minaret in Urganj near Lake Sarygamysh. Not just towers to be forgotten, these minarets have influenced architecture and art in Central and Southern Asia for centuries, with even the famous Mughal Empire of India copying their design in many of their great works. However, it seems this storied legacy was not built to last. \n\nAfter centuries upon centuries of arid weather, sandstorms, earthquakes, and violent conquest all across the region, these minarets - and especially the Minaret of Jam despite its extreme isolation in one of the most inaccessible regions of the nation - have begun to fall apart. As the verses of the Qur’an chiseled into the masonry begin to decay and as the intricate brick, glazed tile, and stucco all adorned in kufic and naskhi calligraphy continues to crumble into dust, we must decide on their final fate.

Surviving Greco-Buddhist art and relics like the gorgeous marble high relief carving ‘The Bodhisattva and Chandeka’ made in Hadda in the 5th Century, the massive Buddhas of Bamiyan, or even smaller pieces of gorgeous metalworking like the golden Bimaran casket are all great examples of the beauty, culture, and talent of our forgotten past, but these pieces are despised by many traditionalist Islamists who support Afghanistan’s practice of erasing the Greco-Buddhist past entirely as a sign of total devotion to Allah. Should we work to finally finish the total Islamization process, destroying and replacing the last of this potentially harmful Greco-Buddhist influence, or should we allow this portion of our history to remain as it is and always has been despite its heretical nature? Alternatively, we could work to fund a new wave of Afghan art both Islamic and Greco-Buddhist in design in order to revitalize this nearly-lost art form and uplift it as one of the many cultural facets of our nation at the crossroads that has always made Afghanistan unique.

The centerpiece of the Buz-baz is a handmade puppet of a markhor - or an Afghan goat both popular in Islamic imagery for their ability to eat devilish serpents and snakes and believed to have magic powers over man and nature - which is usually carved from wood and adorned in baubles or sequins. Tying the puppet to a string attached to his wrist, the puppeteer moves the goat in a rhythmic beat as they themselves also play music using a dambora/dombra (an Afghan string instruments similar to a guitar, a balalaika or a lute), syncing the puppeteers movement to the music at all times. This multitasking musical magic is possible because the goat puppet is on a platform that has a string connected through a pipe to the instrument, creating a one-man band and play that truly is a sight to behold. Wishing to spread this unique piece of Afghan artistic culture to the rest of the nation, [AFG.getleader] has announced the creation of an entire theater dedicated to Buz-baz performances now opening in the heart of Kabul so that all in the nation can experience this traditional artform.

Traditionally softer than burfis - another related dish that is served in a more fudge-like consistency - kalakand is basically the Central and South Asian version of Italian cheesecake, being made of strained and kneaded chhena/Indian cheese that is then mixed into a boiling concoction of whole milk and water until it forms a cohesive paste. Then thickened like burfis using sugar, the kalakand mixture is finally finished with the addition of ghee (clarified butter), set to cool, then cut into squares and garnished with pistachios for flavor and aesthetic. A lovely treat for all citizens that has begun to become one of the most popular desserts in the nation, there is one man in Afghanistan that loves these little delights more than all others - our own Habibullah Kalakani. Eating dozens of these little pastries a day, kalakand has taken on its own new nickname in our state as the masses begin to call them ‘Kalakanis’ after our own Emir. Whether it is a nickname of endearment or amusement at the expense of our Emir, Kalakani himself does not know, but that has not stopped him from accepting the name change with open arms. Declaring that kalakand is a name only to be used by those dirty Indians, all Indian, or now rather Afghan milk cakes in Afghanistan are to be called Kalakanis from here on out, even forcing the local halwai to all change their storefronts and signage to match the new decree.

The nicotine effect kicks in after about 5 minutes of chewing, producing a slight burn and numbing irritation on the upper lip and the tongue. The main powdered form is made by pouring water into a cement-lined cavity, to which slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and air-cured, sun-dried, powdered tobacco is added. Later, indigo is added to the mixture to impart its famous bright green color, and ash from the burning of juniper bark along with cardamom, oil, menthol, gum, sesame oil, and more can all be often added as flavoring as well, while the paste form is made by taking the prepared powder and adding water to it so that it may be rolled into little balls and set to dry, creating little chewable balls that cause the same effect. Frequently sold on platters alongside sunflower seeds and cigarettes, or in their own rolled packets, naswār and its derivatives are not only important to Afghan culture and our traditional way of life, for naswār sales both domestically and internationally help fund our economy in a major way as naswār is commonly exported to Russia and Eastern Europe, Iberia, and the rest of Central and South Asia. Cities like Herat, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Charsadda, and Mohmand are some of the largest producers of this snus-like compound, with their sale and production forming a large pillar of the urban economy while also enriching the lowly farmers that grow the tobacco in massive fields. \n\nWith all this in mind, banning naswār is out of the question entirely, despite its apparent health effects like its ability to cause cancer, but that does not mean we have no dog in this race. We can just continue to turn a blind eye to the problem in order to appease the masses, or we could actively tap into this commodity market, helping our domestic naswār business truly boom while taking a cut of the profits to further fund the state.

Pelwhani is one of the many names given to the local type of wrestling practiced not only in Afghanistan, but also across the Subcontinent. Also called belt wrestling or ‘the struggle’ in English, this form of traditional wrestling pulls both from Indian styles like Malla-yuddha, from Persian styles like Koshti  Pahlevani, and most recently from Mongolian Bökh and other similar forms from Central Asian and the Steppe, and was largely popularized across the region thanks to living titans like The Great Gama, Brahmdev Mishra, and Kodi Rammurthy Naidu to name a few, cementing Afghanistan as one of the hotbeds of traditional Asian wrestling. \n\nOn the opposite hand from these feats of human strength and skill stands our other national sport, called Buzkashi, in which two teams on horseback compete to toss a sheep or goat carcass into their respective goal. Common all throughout Central Asia, our former occupiers among the Anglos tried to replace this so-called ‘barbaric’ pastime with their own version they call Polo, but the latter never took off outside the wealthy elite and Afghan nobility while Buzkashi is played by the masses, especially among the tribal clans. Not only playing these sports on our own, both Buzkhasi and Afghan wrestling are included in the newest attempts at our nation to work diplomatically with the outside world as professional and minor leagues are created with our nomadic brethren in places like Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, and even as far as Eastern Europe and the Steppe in order to compete on an international level while strengthening our similar cultures among these foreign kin. Commonly practiced by young men and often seen as a right of passage, these sports are central pillars to traditional Afghan culture, and they shall stay in such an honored place thanks to our support and our continuing efforts to further popularize these sports not only across the nation, but our wider sphere of influence as well."

Some believe that the Western, secular connotation of the title could, on the contrary, be an element weakening our emerging national identity and disrespectful of our Islamic traditions.\n\nArguments on both sides are valid and understandable, it only remains for our sovereign to make a choice."

Facing this reality, our Amanullah’s partner and rock to rely on in these times is Soraya Tarzi, queen consort of Afghanistan and the beloved wife of our monarch. Originally born in the Syrian lands of the Ottoman Empire, she and her affluent family returned to Afghanistan after Habibullah allowed the many modernist Afghan exiles to return home, placing her in the court of Amanullah’s father and sealing their future fate together as a paired match. Daughter of the intellectual leader Sardar Mahmud Beg Tarzi of the Mohammadzai Pashtun tribe - a sub-tribe of the old Barakzai dynasty - who also founded the Young Afghans that serve a key role in Amanullah’s reformation and in his daughter’s own ideology, Queen Soraya is a central figure in our administration’s newest direction that strongly takes after her late father as a symbol of modernism and liberal reform. Well vested in women’s rights and humanitarian charity efforts, she has run her own women’s magazine - Irshad-e Naswan aka the Guide for Women - since 1921, which also stands as the first woman-owned intellectual property in the nation, along with her own woman’s organization the Anjuman-i Himayat-i-Niswan aka the Association for the Protection of Women: both created to champion ideas of women's suffrage both within the royal court and across the wider nation as well, along with providing information on the rights of women, child care, home economics and etiquette, social, political and international issues, and even fashion and household tips while also educating our women on Amanullah’s new laws and reforms created to protect women like the ban on polgamy or the new marriage and divorce laws. In addition to these organizations, the Queen has also worked with her Young Afghan allies to create the first women-only school and hospital in the nation in order to educate and care for women in need or at risk, in addition to numerous other ventures all the while she whispers in her husband’s ear as he plans the newly dawning age that shall soon grace our people.

There are the Islamists, dedicated to maintaining a truly Islamic government guided by Allah, uplifted by cultural reformation, and allied to the imams, with their loose coalition being split between the progressive populists of Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar’s Fatherland Party that seek to build a welfare state based on the proto-Islamic Socialism of Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī and the Tatar Wäisi, and and the conservative populists of Muhammad Iqbal’s Muslim League that seek to build a broad coalition of traditionalist and conservative Muslims across the Subcontinent. On the other hand stands the secularists which seek to distance Afghan governance from religion in different ways, with Abdul Rauf Benawa’s Awakened Youth looking towards the Religious Enlightenment in order to keep religion alive and well and respected, but wholly separate from government, and the Young Afghans of Abdul Hadi Dawi and his Liberal Kemalist nationalists that seek to divorce Afghanistan government from Islam completely.

The Disston itself is made up of one such simplistic armored chassis, anywhere from 6 to 13mm thick, affixed atop said caterpillar tracks that can move the vehicles along at a top speed of about 10kmph/5mph, while being fitted with a hull-mounted .30 cal Marlin machine gun all below a turret sporting a 37mm M1916 cannon, amounting to a slowly moving metal box as dangerous to any soft targets around it as it is to its own three-man crew inside - earning our new tankers the nickname of the new Jaanbaz, taken from the old Afghan cavalry in service of the Shah whose title meant ‘life gamblers’. \n\nNevertheless, these beasts are all we got, and after the Americans failed to find a buyer for these metal deathtraps anywhere else in the world, we were able to secure their entire stock - a whopping 5 tanks - of these experimental relics at a massively reduced cost in 1935, importing them through the Port of Karachi by boat from America and then by train the rest of the way to Kabul, and now after being fully integrated into our armed forces, we are ready to see the results. Though some international onlookers from our allied foreign attachés - whom have been training us on the Disston’s use and wider armored tactics - have laughed at the sight of such a vehicle while likening the Disston’s boxy and ‘scrappy’ appearance to something called a ‘Bob Semple’, whatever that is, we know the truth!

Members of the Jirga who are committed towards pursuing a confederation of Afghan tribes have put their faith in Ali Ahmad Khan. Loyal to the deposed Barakzai, an unsteady coalition of reformists and traditionalists have supported Inayatullah Khan, Emir Habibullah’s eldest son.

With our nation finally beginning to recover from the devastating civil war, many within the government have supported renouncing the Durand Line and pushing our claims to our former territories. This measure would be mostly symbolic, serving to demonstrate Afghanistan’s newfound strength and sow discontent among Pashtun communities who once again fall under the control of the Anglos. Some ambitious officers and government officials, however, hope to march across the Khyber and reclaim what was lost to the Anglos."

The Dominion was effectively crippled by their crushing defeat at the hands of Emir Habibullah’s army during the Fourth Anglo-Afghan War. Nadir Shah was not in Afghanistan during the war, as he was undergoing surgery in Europe. However, Nadir Shah has been looking forward towards fostering close ties with Afghanistan and the Entente, bringing together his allies that he found during his exile decades ago, and could possibly start negotiations with the Entente over the remaining provinces still loyal to the Crown. Nadir Shah has proposed offering Delhi protection, effectively putting them under Afghan suzerainty. This proposal has been met with fierce opposition by the tribal elite who wish to not make any sort of dealings with the defeated Anglos."

While this proposal seems completely absurd, members of the government are certain that Nadir Shah is a faithful ally of the Empire and that this offer is the only way to keep any semblance of British influence within India. While we have maintained close ties with the Nadir Shah, many see this move as nothing but a ploy for the Iron Emir to expand his influence across the entire subcontinent. Some government officials have proposed that we should instead foster close relations between our two nations and offer the emergent Barakzai Empire a place in the Entente."

Returning home, many Parchamites have become enamored by the revolutionary ideals espoused abroad, especially those of the Kuomintang. Seeking to foster the Three Principles of Dr. Sun within the rugged Afghan countryside alongside agrarian focused reforms, a new political faction has formed within Parcham. Led by Dr. Abdulrahman Mahmudi, these ‘Sinophiles’ have begun to form their own coalition within the United Front, gaining considerable traction among the agrarian voices who have felt alienated by Parcham’s more urban centered reforms. Hoping to unseat Nisar Muhammad Yousafzai from his position as chairman, Mahmudi’s coalition have launched their bid for power by calling for a Second Afghan Congress to vote for a new chairman. Confident in the support of his allies, Yousafzai has agreed to Mahmudi’s challenge and has called the Congress once more.

Emulating the conquerors of old by taking over Delhi, the invaders have thrown the entire commonwealth in disarray! The British forces and their Indian auxiliaries have been overwhelmed and routed, fleeing to the ports of Karachi and Ahmadabad to escape the collapsing nation. Massive concessions have been granted to the jubilant Afghans, ceding enough land to nearly double the size of the Emirate. The Entente has declared that the Afghan victory was a fluke and not a representative of its weakness, while the Princely States and the Commune look upon the lands with an opportunistic eye! Afghan newspapers have declared it to be the beginning of the end for infidel rule in India and the Emir appears to have consolidated his power. Meanwhile, the other major powers of the world have not released any statements regarding this development as they didn’t expect an Afghani victory. While the Entente is shaken, those in Paris and Berlin look in glee as their rivals of the former British Empire sink further into despair.

The King, after hearing news of the victory, has declared it to be a sign of changing times, promising that the citizens of the dominion will be rewarded in due time for their bravery and valor in the battle for the Crown. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Afghanistan has fallen into instability, with some even advocating for the Emir to step down after this embarrassing defeat to the “Infidels”. With the Emir’s rule openly questioned, more and more of the radical elements of Afghan society have started to spread their influence to try and destabilize the nation. The bandits under a Kohistani Tajik named Habibullah Kalakani have started to raid cities and engage in looting and pillaging as they see fit with some even saying that the bandit leader eyes the Durr-e-durran throne itself. This is a big victory for the Entente, but many say this was a foregone conclusion, as the Emirate was all but cornered into war with the Empire."

Under near anarchy, the British strike force was met almost unopposed in Kabul, with Afghanistan to be incorporated into the empire as a subject of the British Crown. The Dominion has declared that Afghans will not be treated as equal citizens and will have dominion status to allow for more flexible British rule. Meanwhile, the Afghani nation has been in a frenzy and has watched in horror as British troops have marched into their towns and declared that the kingdom is no more. The Emir after signing the surrender has gone into exile to Holy cities to spend the rest of his time in front of God to beg his forgiveness for his rash decision to invade the British when he knew he couldn’t win.

Racked by the sudden departure of Emir Habibullah and a failed putsch by the Crown Prince, Nasrullah Khan, the city of Kabul had been left to the wolves. Weeks prior, the Saqqawist forces led by the infamous Habibullah Kalakani, known to many as Bacha ye-Saquo, have circled Kabul like vultures, waiting for their moment to strike. Initially being repelled in previous skirmishes, the Bacha and his men had exploited the fallout of Nasrullah Khan’s failed coup and finally seized control of Kabul. In search of plunder, Kalakani and his bloodthirsty brigands have laid waste to the city, committing horrific acts of looting, rape, and murder. These atrocious acts have already led numerous tribal chiefs to begin mobilizing their levies to oppose the Saqqawists. With the Bacha declaring himself ‘Emir’, the world can only wonder how long these bandits can hold on to their ill-gotten gains."

While the Prince’s forces were equally matched in the early stages of his campaign, the diplomatic isolation of Kalakani’s ‘Emirate’ and a series of irrecoverable losses caused the collapse of Kalakani’s bandit army. Nadir Khan’s arrival in Kabul was met with celebration and an assembly of local elites elected Nadir Khan to become the next Emir, a position he initially refused, but graciously accepted.

Amanullah's death-marred path to the throne concluded when the investigation into the murder of his father revealed that Nasrullah Khan, the heir-apparent to the throne, was solely responsible for the Emir's death. Nasrullah was subsequently arrested by forces loyal to Amanullah, who was then proclaimed King. Amanullah, a die-hard reformist who has often taken inspiration from the Ottoman Empire's Mustafa Kemal, is determined to transform Afghanistan into a modern state. His objectives are easier said than done however, as Afghanistan is a nation seemingly trapped in the past, and it is clear that his attempts at reform will be bitterly resisted by Afghanistan's Pashtun elites. Whether Amanullah can persevere his administration, or if he will fail and succumb to the chaos remains to be seen as this renegade 'Reformist King' begins formalizing his grandiose plans for Afghanistan."

Fearing that the ambitious Nasrullah might’ve seized the throne from the former Emir, Habibullah had made Nasrullah both commander in chief of the Afghan Royal Army and designated heir to the throne, superseding even his own sons. With the Emir’s assassination, Nasrullah’s ascension was challenged by Habibullah’s youngest son, Amanullah Khan, who claimed that the Crown Prince was behind the late Emir’s death. Amanullah’s conspiracy was quickly thwarted by loyalists in the army and the defeated prince fled the nation in shame. Nasrullah Khan’s ambitions are only matched by his piety. Along with his allies in the clergy, the new Emir seeks to rule in adherence to Islamic doctrine, reverse the reforms of the late Habibullah, and restore the influence of the Islamic aristocracy over the government. Nasrullah’s anti-reformist direction has won the Emir the support of Afghanistan's conservative Pashtun nobility, who view the Crown Prince’s rise to power as a much-needed return to stability in the nation."

Returning to Afghanistan shortly after Emir Habibullah’s victory in the Fourth Anglo-Afghan War, Nadir Khan had been fostering ties among dissident officers in the Royal Army to undermine support for Nasrullah Khan. With the army’s support, Nadir Khan marched on Kabul and ordered the arrest of the Emir for the murder of the late Habibullah Khan and seized control of the throne for himself. The Soldier Prince has promised to greatly modernize Afghanistan while not abandoning its tradition and to restore law and order to the unruly Afghan countryside.

These disparate groups were able to form a loose coalition against Saqqawist rule under the leadership of Abdul Ghaffar Khan and the Khudai Khidmatgar. Known as the ‘Frontier Gandhi’ or ‘Bacha Khan’, Khan is an avowed pacifist who has long been an advocate for social reform among his fellow Pashtuns and the fostering of unity among all Indians, both Muslim and Hindu. What is unique to Khan and his Redshirts are their adherence to socialist teachings, a stark contrast to the traditionally conservative Afghan society.

AFG_young_afghans_victory_desc:0 "Amanullah and his cadre of ‘Young Afghan’ Officers have taken control of the government. The conservative elements in our government are outraged, and fundamentalists are wary of the flurry of reforms that will no doubt come from Amanullah's desk."

AFG_bandit_king_desc:0 "With the Emir fleeing the nation during its darkest hour, the entire nation has descended into chaos. Always sensing an opportunity, the bandit king of Kohistan, Habibullah Kalakani, has seized the chance and has marched his loyal army to besiege Kabul."

AFG_great_game_desc:0 "We have finally, after nearly an entire century, managed to win the great game against Russia in Afghanistan.

Let us use it well."

AFG_rally_allies:0 "Request Allied Support"
AFG_rally_allies_desc:0 "The Germans and Ottomans have always claimed to be friends with us against the imperialists, so we must request they hold true to that promise.

AFG_german_aces_desc:0 "Our friends in Germany are eyeing our war extensively, as top brass in their institutes of war study our engagements to better improve their doctrines.

AFG_kick_door_desc:0 "The Delhi regime is weak internally, with only the imperialist garrison holding the rotten structure up.

AFG_look_east:0 "Look East"
AFG_look_east_desc:0 "Across the Wakhan Corridor lies the remains of the once formidable Chinese nation. Instability and corruption has left the nation to the devices of the western powers and the rising sun across the pond. To vitalize Afghanistan’s influence on the world stage and gather allies in our battle against foreign oppression, we will look towards the east in China and forge diplomatic ties with these emergent nations."
AFG_tibet_plateau:0 "In the Tibetan Plateau"
AFG_tibet_plateau_desc:0 "While they are not our brothers of the faith, the mountainous kingdoms of the Himalayas serve as an important barrier against imperialist incursions into the eastern world.

AFG_look_north_desc:0 "Similar to Afghanistan, Turkestan is a rugged land deeply rooted in the Islamic faith. In addition, both lands have served as an intermediary for some of history’s greatest empires. If we are to lift Afghanistan to global prominence, we must first sort out the situation with our northern neighbors in Turkestan."
AFG_bukhara_contact:0 "Contact with Bukhara"
AFG_bukhara_contact_desc:0 "Among the nations in Turkestan, the government in Bukhara has emerged the strongest of the nations that have liberated themselves from the Russian yoke. While we offered the Bukharans material support during their independence war, our relations have been scarce so as not to provoke the Russians. With the shifting political climate, we will once again make contact with our northern neighbors in Bukhara."
AFG_bukhara_alliance:0 "The Bear Awakens..."
AFG_bukhara_alliance_desc:0 "With every passing day, the Russian bear eyes Central Asia with a hungry gaze. While they are still licking their wounds, it is evident that the Russian nation is rebuilding, and they once again seek to subjugate the free nations of Turkestan. In our move against Russian aggression, we will propose an alliance with the government in Bukhara."
AFG_united_front:0 "Establish a United Front"
AFG_united_front_desc:0 "While the nations that make up Turkestan have long been divided, they must realize that much more is at stake than petty squabbles.

AFG_bukhara_war_desc:0 "While we have maintained a cordial relationship with the state of Turkestan, we can no longer stand by as their nation descends further into chaos.

AFG_northern_war:0 "Establish our Control"
AFG_northern_war_desc:0 "Even with the rebellious Bukharan countryside finally under the proper rule of law, potential threats to the Afghan nation are still rife in these lands.

AFG_russia_agreement:0 "The Aral Agreement"
AFG_russia_agreement_desc:0 "While we set out to expand our influence across Turkestan, we must also recognize the designs of the Russians to the north. Wishing to prevent a prolonged war in our mountains against a hypothetical Russian invasion, our diplomats have devised a diplomatic solution to this issue. We will meet with the Russian government to begin talks about dividing the lands of Turkestan between our respective spheres of influence.

By strengthening our bond with our historic allies, we can greatly expand our nation’s global influence."
AFG_ottoman_alliance:0 "Sign the Topkapı Pact"
AFG_ottoman_alliance_desc:0 "War is looming in the Middle East. The old Ottoman order finds itself threatened by the emerging Cairo Axis. An upstart alliance of Egyptians, Iranians, and Arab tribes, these seemingly disparate groups have all united towards the destruction of the Caliphate. With each power having their own designs for carving up the Middle East, Afghanistan’s sovereignty finds itself threatened.

AFG_kabul_accords:0 "The Kabul Accords"
AFG_kabul_accords_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, our Ottoman allies have succumbed to foreign invasion and revolt but the resilient Afghan nation has held firm. While our mission is righteous, we must lick our wounds and rebuild. We will meet in Cairo to negotiate a truce with the Axis. This temporary peace should buy us enough time to refill our stockpiles and re-establish contact with our Ottoman allies."
AFG_continuation_war:0 "The Continuation War"
AFG_continuation_war_desc:0 "The Egyptians so foolishly believed that they could rule the Middle East better than the centuries old Ottoman Empire. Already, their alliance is beginning to crack at the seams as the differing plans of the Axis members have finally begun to clash. Capitalizing on this instability, we will launch our attack on the crumbling Axis and restore the Sublime Porte to its rightful place."
AFG_tehran_conference:0 "The Tehran Conference"
AFG_tehran_conference_desc:0 "Despite the near overwhelming odds, the Ottoman Empire and its stalwart Afghan ally have triumphed against a multi-pronged invasion by the Cairo Axis.

AFG_three_empires_desc:0 "With the ambitious Egyptians and Iranians finally put under the thumb of Afghanistan and the Ottoman Empire, we will work towards ushering in a new era of peace in the Middle East. While many decry our rule in Iran, believing that they were humiliated and reduced to a ‘rump state’, we will reassure the people that this is simply not true. The new Middle East is not only for the Ottoman and the Afghan, but the Persian as well. Let us celebrate our harmonious relationship as our three empires move to restore order and bring prosperity."
AFG_constantinople_kabul:0 "Konstantiniyye to Kabul Railway"
AFG_constantinople_kabul_desc:0 "Our triumph will be made evident by the construction of a railroad that spans from Constantinople to Kabul.

AFG_german_alliance:0 "Create a Lasting Friendship"
AFG_german_alliance_desc:0 "It was through the tacit support of the German Empire that we were able to free ourselves from the clutches of the British Empire and liberate our brethren across the Durand Line. In the years following, Germany has continued to be a valuable partner to the Afghan people, supporting us through the extension of the Hentig-Niedermayer mission and coming to our aid once again during the Fourth Anglo-Afghan War. By encouraging cooperation between both nations, we will strengthen the unique friendship between the German and Afghan people."
AFG_baki_conference:0 "The Baki Conference"
AFG_baki_conference_desc:0 "Across the Caspian Sea, our fellow brothers of the faith in Azerbaijan are threatened by Cossack brigands and Russian imperialists. If the rich oil fields of Azerbaijan are to be surrendered to the Russians, their conquest of the free peoples of Asia would be unstoppable.

AFG_expand_conspiracy_desc:0 "The Kaiserreich and Afghanistan have enjoyed a long history of diplomatic missions and expeditions between our two nations.

Let us celebrate these efforts and the innovations that came with them."
AFG_fleischer_khan_agreement:0 "The New Fleischer-Khan Agreement"
AFG_fleischer_khan_agreement_desc:0 "In 1893, Gebhard Fleischer, a Krupp engineer, secretly met with Emir Abdur Rahman Khan. Under the nose of the British Empire, we were able to greatly expand our nation's arms manufacturing capabilities. While our agreement began to bear fruit, the engineers were assassinated by agents of the British Empire.

AFG_renew_expedition_negotiations_desc:0 "First arriving in 1915, the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition has played a crucial role in fostering Afghanistan’s close ties with the German Empire and the development of our nation. Under the guidance of Oskar Niedermayer and Werner Otto von Hentig, our antiquated forces had begun to modernize along the lines of the Kaiser’s victorious army. To honor our historic agreement, we will ask Germany to extend the expedition, allowing us to reform our army further."
AFG_indian_ocean_mission:0 "Mission to the Indian Ocean"
AFG_indian_ocean_mission_desc:0 "Across the Indian Ocean lies one of the Reich’s most important colonies, Deutsch-Ostasien. The colony’s vast rubber plantations have made the colony one of the largest producers of rubber in the world. On the seas, the Ostasiatische Station is on constant alert against the imperialist ambitions of the Japanese Empire. Let us send a diplomatic mission to help build up our nascent naval force and get ourselves a stake in the production of rubber."
AFG_maf_mission:0 "Visit the Dar-Es-Salaam Regime"
AFG_maf_mission_desc:0 "The German colony of Mittelafrika is the most daunting colonial experiment that has ever been attempted. The colony’s vast riches are only equaled by the revolts that it faces on a daily basis. We will send a diplomatic mission to Mittelafrika to encourage closer cooperation between our two nations. The colony’s expertise in putting down insurgents could help us here at home and its natural resources would greatly bolster our economy."

AFG_mutual_defence_against_JAP_desc:0 "Not only Afghanistan but the independence of Asia as a whole remains threatened by the rising sun in the east. The Japanese Empire is plotting to enslave the entirety of the continent under the guise of ‘liberation’ from the west. The only way to contain the expansion of Japanese imperialism is through our close relationship with the German Empire. May the Kaiserreich and the brave fighters of Afghanistan stand as a bulwark against the formidable Japanese threat."
AFG_join_reichspakt:0 "A Toast to Loyalty"
AFG_join_reichspakt_desc:0 "While we have worked closely with the Kaiserreich for decades, we have always maintained an arms length agreement with the Germans.

AFG_influence_in_china:0 "Cast our Die into China"
AFG_influence_in_china_desc:0 "While foreign powers encroach on the sovereignty of China, the nation lies in a state of disarray. Corrupt warlords, foreign puppets, and drug pushers fight to the death while the Japanese and western empires look hungrily on the lands of the Middle Kingdom. With our homefront secured, the Afghan nation will throw its support into the Chinese struggle, and bring out a worthy ally in our shared struggle against imperialism."
AFG_hui_diplomacy:0 "Our Hui Brethren"
AFG_hui_diplomacy_desc:0 "While they have often preferred to take a pragmatic stance towards any sitting government in Beijing, the Ma Cliques of Northwestern China find their days of relative independence numbered.

AFG_favor_tokyo_desc:0 "While we have had our reservations regarding the Japanese Empire and the aims of its ‘Co-Prosperity Sphere’, we cannot deny the strength of the Rising Sun. In a few short decades, the Japanese have emerged from a chain of squabbling islands to a world power. Seeking to join the Japanese in their mission to free Asia from Western imperialism, we will send a delegation to Tokyo to discuss Afghanistan’s place in the emerging Japanese order."

### NASRULLAH KHAN ###

AFG_the_crown_prince:0 "The Crown Prince Ascends"
AFG_the_crown_prince_desc:0 "Finally! After decades of carefully planning and determination Nasrullah Khan now sits on the Afghan throne! His enemies still circle, waiting for their time to strike but they will be dealt with in time. It's up to the new Emir to decide the future fate of Afghanistan. While it's impossible to say what Nasrullah will do, his almost unmatched zealotry, love of tradition, and alliance with the conservative religious elements of society can give the world a hint as to what the future holds for the country."
AFG_mourn_habibullah:0 "Settle Tribal Feuds"
AFG_mourn_habibullah_desc:0 "The decadence of Habibullah and his push of Western reforms enraged the conservative tribes of Afghanistan’s hinterlands. They have been in rebellion for years now, left to run riot over the countryside while the Emir in Kabul counts his wives. Now however their only ally in the Royal Family, Nasrullah, has taken the throne and he has called a conference in Kabul to settle the Tribes' grievances and end their incessant fighting."
AFG_nasrullah_rules:0 "Finalize the Ascension"
AFG_nasrullah_rules_desc:0 "Nasrullah has done it and secured his position as Emir. With the Conservatives rallying behind the new Emir their great influence over the country has begun to be exerted in Nasrullah’s favor. Rival factions, claimants and disgruntled citizenry are slowly dispersing as their support evaporates behind this groundswell of support for Nasrullah. With his throne secure however, Nasrullah can really get down to business."
AFG_consolidate_rule:0 "Bring Unity to the Empire"
AFG_consolidate_rule_desc:0 "The instability that has plagued the Emirate has to come to an end if Afghanistan is to thrive. Various rebellions of equally various sizes still roam the countryside, taking advantage of the near-anarchy ushered in by the chaos of Habibullah’s death. While Nasrullah is kind to his friends, these rebels are not his friends. All available military force will be used to disperse these rebels and finally unify the state."
AFG_arrest_opposition:0 "End the Banditry"
AFG_arrest_opposition_desc:0 "The Afghan countryside is almost tailor-made for bandits. Most of the country is an elaborate labyrinth of caves and mountains. It will be hard work, but these mountains must be finely combed to smoke out any remaining bandits who wish to make an easy profit."
AFG_seize_press:0 "Oversee the Press"
AFG_seize_press_desc:0 "Afghanistan does not have a lot of press outlets already, and most of those we do have are printed. While Nasrullah respects the press and values their independence, he cannot let them run amok. If they print falsehoods, they could destabilize the Emirate and throw the nation into chaos. To remedy this, Nasrullah will invite the heads of the largest media companies in the country to meet with him. They won't be outright censored per se, but Nasrullah will make it clear that any falseness will be punished. Severely."
AFG_find_amanullah:0 "Put an End to the Young Afghans!"
AFG_find_amanullah_desc:0 "The so-called ‘Young Afghans’ don't know what's good for them! They seek progress and modernity in the face of all of its hazards! We saw what happened when their progenitor, the Young Turks, took over the Sublime Porte. The group is already reeling from the exile of their man in the Royal Family, Amanullah. Nasrullah has ordered the police and army to launch a series of raids on known Young Afghan hideouts and ordered its leaders arrested. With their leaders gone, the wayward souls will return to the fold and be welcomed."
AFG_reverse_secularization:0 "Reverse Secularization"
AFG_reverse_secularization_desc:0 "Habibullah made great strides in many things, and probably the most egregious was the increased secularization of Afghanistan. The Emirate is tied fundamentally to Allah, so Habibullah’s attempts to separate the two are simply laughable. Nasrullah, with the support of his cleric allies, will begin to undo these ‘reforms’ and make Afghanistan right once more. We will mesh our state into its fundamental religion so much that to try and separate the two once more would be impossible. "
AFG_the_afghan_journeyman:0 "Regarding the Brigand King"
AFG_the_afghan_journeyman_desc:0 "The most notorious of the bandit rebels is Habibullah Kalakani. He and his brigands continue to be a thorn in our side trying to pull our nation even further to the right. However, while some in our military and government want us to outright destroy him, Nasrullah remains hesitant. While Kalakani at his most radical is little more than a despot, some of his less radical positions are not too different from Nasrullah, and rumor has it that there are talks between him and the bandit king."
AFG_traditional_roles:0 "Re-establish the Darogha"
AFG_traditional_roles_desc:0 "Afghanistan is a land that almost refuses to be ruled. Its ruggedness and rural nature makes any central control difficult. Our additions in India only magnify this problem. To better control the rabble Nasrullah has returned to the past to reestablish the Darogha, a local police force in the Mughal Empire. They will be assigned to governors to be distributed as they see fit, within some parameters, and in more rural areas will effectively be the Government. As such, they shall undergo harsh vetting. In any case, we already have hundreds of them ready with thousands more on the way. "
AFG_mission_to_istanbul:0 "Reassert our Ties to Istanbul"
AFG_mission_to_istanbul_desc:0 "The Sultan in Istanbul is both Sultan of the last great Caliphate and the Caliph of all Islam. Nasrullah, as a deeply religious man, seeks to strengthen ties with the Porte. Not only is the Caliph a religious strongman, but his hold over the Middle East is tenuous but still undeniable. While the Dominion may be gearing up for another round of warfare, an alliance with Istanbul would strangle that hope in its cradle and make Afghanistan as peaceful as the Middle East!"
AFG_army_chief:0 "All for the Commander-in-Chief!"
AFG_army_chief_desc:0 "Most of the Army had long rallied behind their old Commander in Chief, however, the reformist officers and soldiers remained hesitant. However, with Nasrullah’s reign completely unchallenged and their leaders cowed or in hiding, more and more of them are switching sides. Now the Army stands totally united under their first Commander in Chief and devoted to the safety and preservation of Afghan sovereignty."
AFG_negotiate_with_the_wild_card:0 "Make the Wild Card Fold"
AFG_negotiate_with_the_wild_card_desc:0 "Nadir Shah is an outlier in the candidates for the throne. Having only lived in Afghanistan for a few decades, he spent most of his life in exile in India. That has made his true loyalties suspect. Until now he has made no real effort to take the throne but Nasrullah knows of his true ambitions, and the fact he plans on eventually acting on them. Nasrullah will bring Nadir to the table and get him to give up his claim and if he doesn't, who will miss one vanished exile?"
AFG_renounce_durand:0 "Thin out the Expedition"
AFG_renounce_durand_desc:0 "The German Expedition has remained in Afghanistan for too long. While the Kaiser’s help has been invaluable, his soldiers have begun to gather a clique of seditionists and fifth columnists around them seeking to draw Afghanistan closer to Berlin. This simply cannot continue. While it would be simple to expel them all, doing that would anger the Kaiser and alienate a good friend in times of crisis. Instead, Nasrullah will send a letter to the Kaiser and ask him politely to draw back most of the Expedition. The skeleton crew that remains will be useful to us while also being so hobbled as to not be a threat to Nasrullah’s rule."
AFG_the_soldier_emir:0 "The Soldier Emir"
AFG_the_soldier_emir_desc:0 "The Emir has and always will be closely tied to the military. He once ran it as its Commander in Chief, he led it in the battle against the decadent Raj while his elder brother drowned in decadence and now he leads it once more not as simply Commander in Chief, but Emir. His military victories and consolidation of the Army behind him have gained him the moniker, ‘the Soldier Emir’. While Nasrullah would have wanted a more pious decoration, even he is unable to say it's too far from the truth."
AFG_the_second_iron_emir:0 "The Second Iron Emir"
AFG_the_second_iron_emir_desc:0 "Nasrullah’s father Abdur Rahman Khan was called the Iron Emir for his harsh totalitarian rule. Under him there was no dissent, just determined citizens working to further Afghanistan. If Nasrullah is to achieve a lasting peace within his country then he must emulate his father in some respects."
AFG_aurangzeb:0 "Emulate Aurangzeb"
AFG_aurangzeb_desc:0 "The ancient Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb is known in the West as a religious tyrant and despot whose policies are looked upon...unfavorably. They are simply wrong, Aurangzeb was a pious man who wanted to bring his subjects eternal paradise by bringing them closer to Allah. Nasrullah knows this more than anybody and will seek to emulate him whenever possible. The spiritual health of the people is critical for the spiritual health of the nation."
AFG_aurangzeb_ornament:0 "Ornament of the Throne"
AFG_aurangzeb_ornament_desc:0 "Aurangzeb gained the nickname Ornament of the Throne for his successful economic policies that made India the largest economy on earth at the time, even surpassing Qing China. He even kickstarted a proto-Industrialization of Bengal. Nasrullah will emulate his success in Afghanistan. The economy is currently in tatters but Afghanistan is home to numerous valuable resources. By harnessing these resources and the various cottage industries across the nation the coffers will be restored and Afghanistan will not only know peace but prosperity."

AFG_aurangzeb_conquerer_desc:0 "Aurangzeb is noted for his conquests of southern India. While in abstract comparison Nasrullah’s conquests are small, Afghanistan had still nearly doubled in size and had gained hundreds of thousands of new citizens. Nasrullah has done the impossible and broken the Durand Line and humbled India itself! With enough manpower behind him, there would be nothing that can stop him from whatever he may desire!"

Imperialists of the British and Indian flavors, Indian nationalists, and general dissenters of the Emir’s rule have made the area their home. Nasrullah has finally decided to do something about this and has ordered the Darogha to sweep the New Territories for potential trouble areas with orders to ‘deal with all problems promptly’. Reports of executions in the streets are already pouring in and are only expected to get more frequent."
AFG_fatawa:0 "The Fatawa 'Alamgiri"
AFG_fatawa_desc:0 "The Fatawa Alamgiri is a set of Sharia Law put in place by Aurangzeb throughout his Empire. Nasrullah has put forward a proposal to adopt a modified version of this for Afghanistan. This has caused some debate among his advisors. Those loyal to Nasrullah point out how it led the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb to new heights economically and militarily while also keeping resistance to the Mughals repressed. They also point out that the Raj still uses a version of this as their own law. The proposal's enemies condemn it as too restrictive, too open to interpretation, and therefore unable to be properly enforced. However, it’s up to Nasrullah to decide."
AFG_sharia_administration:0 "Reimpose Sharia?"
AFG_sharia_administration_desc:0 "A proposal has come from Nasrullah to impose Sharia Law across all of Afghanistan. This has been met with both celebration from the Conservative elements of society and clerics while simultaneously enraging more liberal elements, particularly among these are the Hindus, an outspoken minority who has opposed Nasrullah since he took the throne. If we go through with this they will surely fight back. Ultimately, it’s up for Nasrullah to decide."

AFG_return_of_jizya_desc:0 "For any state to function it must collect its taxes. The ruggedness of Afghanistan has made this an issue for every one of its rulers. Nasrullah is determined to overcome this hurdle. A new system of tax collection will be instituted to ensure all of Afghanistan’s subjects pay their due to the Crown so the state may be properly maintained. This will cause considerable grumbling, especially among the tribes who were able to slip away from taxes for so long, but that is the price we must pay."

AFG_patronize_works_desc:0 "Afghanistan is a mix of Indian, Central Asian, Islamic, and even remnant Greek culture. This cultural disunity cannot stand if Afghanistan is to continue to function. Nasrullah will set up a Department of Islamic Culture to promote and encourage Islamic culture in the areas it is weakest. New Islamic newspapers will be printed, Islamic will replace local languages, and monuments to non-Islamic heroes will be replaced or overshadowed by new ones. This is a heavy step to take, to suppress dissenting cultures in favor of our own, but the hardest choices take the strongest wills."

AFG_temperance_in_rule_desc:0 "Aurangzeb was a deeply pious man, much like Nasrullah, and he cut down on the pomp and circumstance of the Mughal Court to donate more to charity and local mosques. Nasrullah, emulating this great man, will do the same. The decadence of his predecessor will be curtailed and the money saved will be donated to the newly established Afghan Prosperity Fund and to mosques. Some will accuse Nasrullah of donating to Mosques to reward his cleric allies. Nasrullah has no comment on such baseless accusations."

In Baghdad, Islamic scholars had brought great strides in law, art, economics, mathematics, science, and philosophy to name just a few fields of study. Under the just and pious rule of Nasrullah Khan, scholars will arrive in Kabul and usher in a second Islamic Golden Age. Our government will provide incentives to these scholars, allowing them to conduct their studies here in Afghanistan. Through our efforts, we will become the shining light of the Islamic world. "

These displaced soldiers, officers, and administrators are loyal to Osman Fuad Efendi, the ‘Warrior Prince’, who has refused to give up any claims to the Sultanate despite Abdülmecid’s abdication.

AFG_ottoman_ex_army_refuge_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, the Ottoman Army was the most feared force in all of Europe and the Near East.

Those within the Ottoman Army who are still loyal to the rightful Sultan have finally arrived in Afghanistan. With their expertise, the Royal Afghan Army will reach new heights!"

AFG_ottoman_ex_navy_refuge_desc:0 "Despite the near impossible odds, a small contingent of the Ottoman fleet have outmaneuvered the Egyptian navy and have found  their way to our ports. The Ottoman Navy was a force of Strength for the empire but now it lacks a homeland. With our ports and economy ultimately incapable of supporting such a large fleet, we will scuttle these ships to prevent them falling into the wrong hands."

AFG_ottoman_ex_iraq_war:0 "Seize the Levant"
AFG_ottoman_ex_iraq_war_desc:0 "The Levant has always been an important part of both the Sultanate and the Islamic world. The historic city of Baghdad was once the capital of Islamic science and culture, and to this day it still remains a crucial point for global trade. More recently, the rich oil deposits in this region have caught the attention of the global powers of the Reichspakt and the Entente. We must reassert our control before any foreign power takes the oil fields for themselves."

Originally a corsair, Hayreddin and his brothers rose to prominence by launching raids on Spanish and Portuguese ships, halting European efforts to assert their rule over Algiers and Tunis. Hayreddin’s efforts caught the attention of Suleiman the Magnificent, who made him Grand Admiral of the Ottoman Navy. We will follow in Hayreddin’s footsteps and bring Ottoman dominance back to North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea. Once again shall the Europeans fear to traverse the Barbary Coast!"

### AMANULLAH KHAN ###

AFG_amanullah:0 "The Prodigal Son"
AFG_amanullah_desc:0 "Amanullah will not be denied his rightful rule over Afghanistan! Having ousted all competitors, Amanullah sits on an unstable throne. Advancing a reformist agenda, Amanullah undoubtedly will now shoulder the monumental task of reforming the Afghan nation. Whether his vision of a modernized Afghanistan comes to fruition, or if his dream will come crumbling down remains to be seen."
AFG_western_ways:0 "Learn from Western Reformers"
AFG_western_ways_desc:0 "While the Middle East and Central Asia as of now is stuck in something of a backwater compared to Europe, there are no shortage of reformers in the Muslim World who have managed to gradually yet substantially modernize their own nations. Amanullah, seeing in such great men like the Ottoman Empire’s Mustafa Kemal and Persia’s Reza Khan a model for a better future, will accordingly take influence from these visionary and often radical thinkers in matters of state."
AFG_continuing_habibullah_reforms:0 "Advancing Habibullah's Reforms"
AFG_continuing_habibullah_reforms_desc:0 "While Habibullah was a visionary and a modernizer, his reforms were not expansive enough to pull Afghanistan out from the muck which envelopes it. Amanullah, in turn, has elected not only to push the reforms of Habibullah, but to also advance them, ensuring that Afghanistan will advance to the future; much to the dismay of the traditionalist Pashtun elite. The people of this country will breathe the fresh air of modernism, even if we must drag our populace into modernity kicking and screaming."
AFG_free_press:0 "Emancipation of the Press"
AFG_free_press_desc:0 "The concept of a ‘Free Press’ is alien to the good people of Afghanistan. While some meager freedoms exist, the legacy of the press controls instituted under Habibullah still exist. To aid in our transformation into a truly free state, Amanullah has called for the full freedom of press in addition to establishing Afghanistan’s first public radio station: Radio Kabul."
AFG_2nd_islamic_golden_age:0 "The 2nd Islamic Golden Age"
AFG_2nd_islamic_golden_age_desc:0 "Amanullah’s modernizing outlook has led to an influx of academics and students to Afghanistan, leading to what some would call a ‘Second Islamic Golden Age’, right here in Afghanistan. No longer shall our nation be known as a backwater, instead Kabul will become the new Baghdad as the center of scientific advancement in the Islamic world. "
AFG_womens_rights:0 "The Push for Women's Rights"
AFG_womens_rights_desc:0 "Any modern King needs a modern Queen; accordingly, alongside the great Amanullah Khan is his wife and queen consort: Soraya Tarzi, the daughter of the great Mahmud Tarzi and a tireless advocate for the rights of women. A great influence behind some of her husband’s reforms, Tarzi and Amanullah have pushed for the greater emancipation of Afghan women, and have embarked on a campaign against the veil, against polygamy, child marriage, and to encourage education of girls and women."
AFG_emancipation:0 "The Emancipation Proclamation"
AFG_emancipation_desc:0 "While Slavery was officially banned in 1923 during the Reign of Habibullah Khan, it has unofficially persisted in more limited ways since then. In accordance with our platform of aggressive modernization, Amanullah will fully crack down on slavery while drafting a modern bill of rights to be included in the new constitution."
AFG_bank:0 "Bank-e-Millie"
AFG_bank_desc:0 "Afghanistan is a land fundamentally not used to financial institutions; with even the concepts of physical currency being alien to most of our nation. To help our finances along, King Amanullah has created the Bank-e-Millie, an organized financial institution that will be able to help our infantile economy flourish."
AFG_tax_code:0 "Reform the Tax Code"
AFG_tax_code_desc:0 "Part of what has helped the great Empires of Europe flourish was the ability to effectively gather funds to pay for government expenses. While we have tried to maintain a proper taxation system, most government funds have been stolen by errant tribesmen or skimmed off the top by corrupt bureaucrats. Under Amanullah’s watch, our outdated tax code shall be massively overhauled under the guidance of the central government alone."
AFG_new_bureaucracy:0 "A Modern Bureaucracy"
AFG_new_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Long has our nation’s bureaucracy been filled with corrupt lackeys and tribal warlords; useless yes men who serve to do nothing but fill their own pockets. This unofficial system of secondary governance shall come to an end under Amanullah’s watch. Instead of bickering warlords, we will hire dedicated administrators and civil servants, and will move towards the creation of a modernized administration that can steadily lead the nation towards the future."
AFG_national_assembly:0 "Establish the National Assembly"
AFG_national_assembly_desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest hallmark of a truly modern state is an independent legislature; with our modernization campaign well underway, the creation of an independent parliament is finally in order. Drifting away from the outdated system of tribal courts that has ruled the nation for centuries, Amanullah has pushed for the creation of a modern Bicameral National Assembly to meet the needs of the Afghan nation."
AFG_pluralist_imperialism:0 "A Truly Pluralist Empire"
AFG_pluralist_imperialism_desc:0 "Afghanistan is not one people, but rather the makeup of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, and dozens of other tribes, all residing within our mountain home. To complicate the situation further, our recent Indian conquests have only added to the countless tribes living within our new domain. Taking influence from the ambitious reformists of the Habsburg Empire, King Amanullah will foster the creation of a pluralist Afghan society that meets the needs of all of the nation’s people. While many Pashtun chauvinists within the ruling elite grumble at the King’s decision, these reforms will bring much needed unity and stability to our realm."
AFG_meritocratic_governance:0 "The New Aristocracy"
AFG_meritocratic_governance_desc:0 "Our newly conquered Indian territories are home to countless local Princes and Chiefs who continue to hold great sway over their subjects.

AFG_reformed_subahs_desc:0 "While we are grateful for our newly acquired lands, our Indian conquest has caused quite the strain on our nation’s resources. To solve this question of administration, must come to a formal decision on how to administer these new territories. Shall we reform the Subah system? Delegate to Tribal Princes? Or shall we simply trust the locals with their own administrative matters. "
AFG_question_of_religion:0 "A Question of Faith"
AFG_question_of_religion_desc:0 "While our new conquests are inhabited by many of our Islamic brothers of the faith, there are equally as many adherents to other religions such as Hinduism or the esoteric Baháʼí faith. With this pressing question on everyone’s minds, we must decide what our stance on organized religion should be,if we are to have one at all."
AFG_babur:0 "The Legacy of Babur the Founder"
AFG_babur_desc:0 "Seeking to preserve stability within the Afghan nation, King Amanullah has carefully heeded the words of the influential conservative nobility. Alongside his traditionalist Pashtun allies, Amanullah rules over Afghanistan’s new territories along the Indus through a traditionalist, Islamic lens. Seeking to build legitimacy among his new Islamic subjects, King Amanullah has begun drawing comparisons to himself and the founder of the Mughal Empire, Babur the Great. This decision, however, will certainly provoke the powerful Hindu princes that reside within our frontier provinces."
AFG_akbar:0 "Memories of Akbar the Great"
AFG_akbar_desc:0 "Continuing to cooperate with his time-honored Young Afghan allies, King Amanullah has decided to walk a moderate path in regards to administering the new Indian territories. With the modernist Young Afghans, the new government has promised the creation of a secular constitutional monarchy that meets the needs of all of its subjects. Taking influence from history, Amanullah has paralleled his policies to that of Akbar the Great. While many are satisfied with this change in course, the traditionalist Pashtun nobles and skeptical Hindu princes have shown hostility against the King."
AFG_alexander:0 "In the Footsteps of Alexander"
AFG_alexander_desc:0 "In a surprising turn, King Amanullah has decided to co-opt his more radical reforms with his pro-Indian stance towards the administration of the new territories. Seeking to create a new society that is neither wholly Afghan nor Indian, the King has begun his attempt to syncretize Afghan and Indian culture. Looking to the past for inspiration, Amanullah has taken influence from Alexander the Great and his legacy. While his new Indian subjects cautiously support the King, both the Pashtun nobility and Amanullah’s Young Afghan allies are furious with this decision."

AFG_AMN_destroy_reactionaries:0 "Quiet the Reactionary Voices"
AFG_AMN_destroy_reactionaries_desc:0 "The cries of reactionaries have often drowned out Amanullah’s calls for aggressive reforms and modernization. While we wish to advance into a more stable future, the incessant tribalists have dragged their heels, and continue to delay our advancement into the future. To help keep our government running smoothly, we shall institute a massive propaganda campaign slandering these groups, ensuring that responsibility for the death of Habibullah Khan is placed squarely on their de-facto leader :Nasrullah Khan."
AFG_AMN_quell_countryside:0 "Quell the Countryside"
AFG_AMN_quell_countryside_desc:0 "The countryside and vast mountains of Afghanistan still echo with the voices of discontent. The fact that strife and bandits are more commonplace than forces loyal to the King in our hinterlands is a cause for serious concern. The only way to pacify these wild outlands is with the use of excessive force. There will be no negotiation, these monsters will only respond to a display of brutality and will."
AFG_AMN_young_afghans_thrive:0 "A New Age of Afghan Patriotism"
AFG_AMN_young_afghans_thrive_desc:0 "Emulating the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire proper, the Young Afghans will begin ushering in a new era of Afghan patriotism and nationalism, while also supporting pan islamic and modernist ideas.

AFG_AMN_expand_habibia_desc:0 "In 1903, Emir Habibullah ordered the construction of the Habibia High School. Habibia has already educated the new generation of Afghanistan and we must continue its mission. King Amanullah will greatly expand the Habibia School in addition to providing financial support to the school. Seeking to continue in his father’s legacy, Amanullah will also establish his own namesake school. the Amani High School. Utilizing our close relationship with the Kaiserreich, the Amani School will specialize in a European styled curriculum as well as German language courses. While we educate Afghanistan’s young minds, the Amani School in turn helps us draw closer to the Reich." 
AFG_AMN_draft_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
AFG_AMN_draft_constitution_desc:0 "With the political crisis averted, Amanullah and the Afghan government can finally begin drafting the new constitution. This document will allow us to define the future of our nation, as well as allowing us to codify the reforms of the King and his allies. The constitutional framework will allow us to provide funds to our run down ministries and finally put an end to corruption within the old administration."
AFG_AMN_gradual_1:0 "Compromise with the Heart of the Nation"
AFG_AMN_gradual_1_desc:0 "King Amanullah, while undoubtedly a progressive reformer, is still an Autocrat at heart, and thus has decided that the best path forward is one of compromise. While we wish for rapid and far-reaching reform, we must remain realistic in our ambitions. We shall reach common ground with reactionary elements to ensure continued stability, while making gradual reforms that will slowly yet surely transform the very face of Afghanistan. While the prospect of Afghanistan becoming a Constitutional Monarchy any time soon is dead in the water, our pragmatic stance will ensure that Afghanistan will not be consumed by the furies of instability."
AFG_AMN_moderate_1:0 "Only the Young Afghans!"
AFG_AMN_moderate_1_desc:0 "While Amanullah has managed to stay afloat through the storms that surround us, he has not persevered without generous aid. With the Young Afghans firmly winning out as the most influential faction in the Government, Amanullah, with the Young Afghans by his side, will continue the modernizing mission. The good people of Afghanistan will soon be able to breathe the fresh air of freedom while staying shielded from some of the King's more 'radical' ideas. The Young Afghans will thrive as the installer of democracy to this chaotic land, transforming Afghanistan into a true European-style Constitutional Monarchy, which will allow all Afghans to have a say in their own futures."
AFG_AMN_ultra_1:0 "Only Me."
AFG_AMN_ultra_1_desc:0 "The King, while cautioned against making his more 'radical' ideals into concrete policy, has nonetheless advanced an agenda consisting of his wills alone. This radical approach has cost him the support of the Young Afghans, who until now have been his most ardent backers; in their stead, Amanullah has gained the support of one Nur Muhammad Taraki and his 'Party of the Eternal Flame'. With the pseudo-reactionary Young Afghans turning their backs on Amanullah, we can finally indulge the most radical of Amanullah's policies, throwing out any pretense and allowing Afghanistan to thrive as a truly Socialist State. Untrammeled, we will destroy all the malefactors of Afghanistan with a fist of scarlet steel, bringing our nation into the future and deposing the legacy of Imperialism forever." 
AFG_AMN_facilitate_trade:0 "Facilitate Trade through the Crossroads"
AFG_AMN_facilitate_trade_desc:0 "Historically Afghanistan was at the crossroads of the old Silk Road, serving as an intermediary for traders arriving from the East and West. For centuries, our nation greatly profited from this trade but recent conflicts have dried up these once profitable routes. Striving towards the creation of a modern Silk Road, our government will encourage foreign capital to invest in the nation’s growing financial sector. Through our cooperation in a new economic world, the gold will once again flow into Afghanistation."
AFG_AMN_10_year_plan:0 "Begin Planning 10 Year Plans"
AFG_AMN_10_year_plan_desc:0 "Our compromise with the nobility has led to some of our detractors accusing King Amanullah of being a spent force in Afghan politics. While we ensured stability instead of rapidly reforming, Amanullah will prove that his reforms will arrive one way or another. Amanullah has laid the foundations of what would be the first of many Ten-Year-Plans. This careful planning will allow us to promote massive improvements over a long amount of time. These economic plans have won the support of both traditionalist and reformist elements of the government as it allows for gradual, but meaningful, change."
AFG_AMN_aristocracy:0 "The New Afghan Aristocracy"
AFG_AMN_aristocracy_desc:0 "While we may not reap the rewards initially, the gradual economic reforms brought upon by King Amanullah has already guided the nation towards a positive trend. Our economists have speculated that within a few short years, a uniquely Afghan business sector will emerge thanks to our careful economic planning and foreign investment. With our vast resources and growing economic base, Afghanistan will one day become an economic powerhouse in Asia!"
AFG_AMN_prepare_future:0 "Preparing Afghanistan for the Future"
AFG_AMN_prepare_future_desc:0 "While change might not come as fast as King Amanullah had initially anticipated, Afghanistan is now stable and ready for the future. Our economic planning will ensure that our nation will steadily grow year after year, and the King’s gradual reforms will carefully guide Afghanistan to modernity. Over time, these reforms will aid us in becoming a global player on the world stage."
AFG_AMN_nationalism_and_modernity:0 "Nationalism and Modernity"
AFG_AMN_nationalism_and_modernity_desc:0 "The ideals of nationalism and modernity have always been the two cruxes of the Young Afghans. Originally formed by Amanullah’s father in law, Mahmud Tarzi, the Young Afghans have long sought to emulate the success of Mustafa Kemal in the Ottoman Empire. With the coalition between Amanullah and the Young Afghans secure, we must embrace their revolutionary ideas and become unified in our goals and shared love for Afghanistan!"
AFG_AMN_abandon_autocratic_ambitions:0 "A Graceful Step Down"
AFG_AMN_abandon_autocratic_ambitions_desc:0 "As a sign of goodwill between King Amanullah and the Young Afghans, the government has requested that the King relinquish some of his powers. With the political crisis over and the nation finally secure, Amanullah has agreed to the demands of the Young Afghans and has given up his royal prerogatives. This move will greatly increase the popularity of the King and legitimize the promises of the government to bring democracy to the nation."
AFG_AMN_afghani_middle_class:0 "Creating an Afghani Middle Class"
AFG_AMN_afghani_middle_class_desc:0 "Afghanistan, if it is to survive as a democracy, needs a middle class to act as the lifeblood of our economy. The reality of the situation, however, is that most of the population lives in poverty. King Amanullah and his Young Afghan allies have authorized the creation of a welfare program to uplift the forgotten people within Afghan society and help the foundations for a new social strata."
AFG_AMN_prepare_elections:0 "Islamic Liberalism in Kabul"
AFG_AMN_prepare_elections_desc:0 "With Afghanistan’s first election coming soon, we must work diligently to protect the nation during its careful transition to democracy. The populace will be educated on participating in the electoral system and the nation’s political clubs will be formalized into official political parties. After a long fought effort against its tribalist past, Amanullah and the Young Afghans have transformed Afghanistan into a beacon of liberty in the storms of Asia."
AFG_AMN_cult_of_personality:0 "Cult of Amanullah"
AFG_AMN_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "It was Amanullah who bravely led his armies across the Durand Line to free the Afghan people from British imperialism in 1919. During the chaos following his father’s death, Amanullah revealed the wicked plot of the tyrannical Nasrullah Khan, and secured the throne. All of Afghanistan must recognize the selflessness of their King, who had sacrificed everything to free the nation from the shackles of reaction and foreign imperialism."
AFG_AMN_cleric_hostility:0 "Destroy Clericism and Traditionalism"
AFG_AMN_cleric_hostility_desc:0 "Reminiscent of the reign of his father Habibullah, the early years of Amanullah’s rule were constantly impeded by tribal chiefs and the Islamic clergy. As Amanullah attempted to bring Afghanistan from a feudal backwater to a modern functioning state, these snakes only tried to pull the nation back into the shadows of religious zealotry and tribalism. With the Pashtun elite finally humbled and put under the thumb of Amanullah, we can destroy the pervasive influence of these reactionaries once and for all! To combat their influence, the government has moved to nationalize the assets of the clergy and the tribal elites."
AFG_AMN_economic_collectivization:0 "Complete Economic Upheaval"
AFG_AMN_economic_collectivization_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Amanullah’s new Prime Minister, Nur Muhammad Taraki, Afghanistan’s antiquated economy will be overhauled along the lines of a true socialist nation. The cities of Kabul and Herat will become new centers of industry thanks to extensive economic planning by Amanullah and the party leadership. In the countryside, the government has approved a massive land reform effort, seeking to limit the amount of land a family can own. These excess lands will be seized by the government to which they are to be redistributed to the local populace." 
AFG_AMN_the_red_emir:0 "The Red Emir Rules Alone!"
AFG_AMN_the_red_emir_desc:0 "While he was betrayed by his so-called ‘allies’ among the Pashtun elite and the Young Afghans, Amanullah knew that ditching these traitors would be a blessing in disguise. Unshackled by their selfish ambitions, Amanullah is free to pass even the most radical of his reforms with no opposition. With the King’s new alliance with Nur Muhammad Taraki and the Party of the Eternal Flame, many within Afghanistan have begun to call Amanullah the ‘Red Emir’, a title which he now carries with pride. Long live the Red Emir! Long life to the Emirate of the Eternal Flame!"
AFG_AMN_darul_aman:0 "Begin Construction of Darul-Aman"
AFG_AMN_darul_aman_desc:0 "With Amanullah’s reforms finally passed, the Afghan nation shall enter a new golden age. To symbolize this new era, Amanullah has laid down plans for the construction of Darul-Aman, a modern district within the city of Kabul. The plans for Darul-Aman are as ambitious as the King’s reforms, with beautiful palaces, intricate city planning, and modern skyscrapers being just a few of what Amanullah has planned to commemorate a new era for both his reign and the nation as a whole."

AFG_croft:0 "The Anglo Over Afghanistan"
AFG_croft_desc:0 "Nearly two decades ago, the scheming Afghans took advantage of our Empire at its weakest and invaded our Crown Jewel at the insistence of the villainous Turks and Huns. Attempting to repeat their success, the Afghans so foolishly crossed into India and their ‘nation’ descended into chaos while their pitiful army crumbled. Following in the footsteps of the great Sir George Pollock, empire loyalist Leo Amery alongside army officer Charles Howard Foulkes have victoriously led a ‘Second Army of Retribution’ to secure Kabul for the Empire."

AFG_gemstone_mines:0 "Jewels for the Royal Crown"
AFG_gemstone_mines_desc:0 "Long have we sought the vast gemstone deposits that litter the Afghan countryside. Precious gems such as rubies, lapis lazuli, and sapphires are plentiful while the Panjshir Valley has garnered world renown for its high quality emeralds. To fund our glorious reclamation, we will send an expedition to scout out these resource rich valleys to help turn a profit in our new Dominion."

AFG_new_wealth:0 "Graverobber of Empires"
AFG_new_wealth_desc:0 "It has often been said that Afghanistan is the ‘Graveyard of Empires’, whose unyielding mountains led to the fall of history’s greatest conquerors. Here we stand where they have failed, the defeated Afghans now humbled by the victorious British Empire. No longer a symbol of our defeat, we shall make these mountains a symbol of our triumph! We will dig deeper into the mines, foster closer economic ties with our Entente allies, and march our armies to where the sun never sets."

AFG_for_the_liberation:0 "Everything for the Liberation"
AFG_for_the_liberation_desc:0 "While some fervent imperialists within our government wish to throw lives away in pointless wars across the Near East, we must never stray away from our true mission. The Home Isles are still under the control of the Syndicalist menace and the former Raj lies divided. We must focus our attention towards this righteous crusade before we can consider expanding our influence elsewhere."

AFG_afghan_railway_connection:0 "Charter the Afghan Railway Company"
AFG_afghan_railway_connection_desc:0 "Much of British dominance over India can be accredited to the vast system of railways that were constructed across the subcontinent. English companies helped lay the tracks that moved resources and armies across India, transforming a rural backwater to the Crown Jewel of our great Empire. Seeking to emulate this success, we will cooperate with Delhi to create a separate Afghan Railway Company to prop-up the nascent rail lines constructed during Habibullah’s reign."

AFG_british_garrison_force:0 "Bolster the Garrison Force"
AFG_british_garrison_force_desc:0 "While the Second Army of Retribution was successful in taking Kabul amidst the Emir’s departure, we now face the herculean task of holding on to the unruly mountains of Afghanistan. Our expeditionary force has already been stretched thin, falling prey to the insurgents that stalk the countryside. We will once again call upon our allies in the Dominion to send additional resources and manpower to reinforce our dwindling forces."

AFG_british_army_model:0 "A British Model Army"
AFG_british_army_model_desc:0 "The Afghan ‘army’ is a generous term used to describe the roaming rabble of bandits and tribal levies that were once under the service of the Emir. While our expeditionary force has been useful in facing off against rebels, we cannot solely rely on them forever. Our top military minds have already drawn plans for a complete overhaul of what existed of the Afghan armies. Our instructors will work tirelessly to forge an army worthy of marching with our Entente allies to reclaim our birthright."

AFG_connection_to_delhi:0 "Our Ties to Delhi"
AFG_connection_to_delhi_desc:0 "With our sister colony across our Eastern border, it’s only natural for us and Delhi to maintain close relations, as we are surrounded by potential enemies. However, we must decide the degree of cooperation between our two nations. While we are loyal to the crown, the last thing we need is a war in the South while our regime is still unstable." 

AFG_churchill_relations:0 "Meeting with Viceroy Churchill"
AFG_churchill_relations_desc:0 "The recent ascension of Winston Churchill to the position of Governor-General could not have come at a more opportune time for our Dominion. A founding member of the Indian Empire Society, Churchill and Governor-General Amery share the same ideals of returning Britain to its rightful position as the master of the Indian subcontinent and beyond. We will arrange for Viceroy Churchill to make an official state visit to Kabul where he and the governor-general can better discuss their commitments to the Empire and draw up plans for future endeavors in the Near East."

AFG_diehard_victory:0 "Continue the Civilizing Mission"
AFG_diehard_victory_desc:0 "The Afghans are not so easily governed. They have fought like rabid dogs against us in our previous wars, and even in lieu of their defeat, they still struggle against us. We understand this defiance, but we will not be deterred. Come time, the Afghans will learn to appreciate the benefits of being a loyal servant of the British Empire."

AFG_closer_ties:0 "Reach Out to Imperial Loyalists"
AFG_closer_ties_desc:0 "Across all reaches of the Entente exists organizations that share our firm adherence to the monarchy and the ideals of the Empire. In Delhi there is the Indian Empire Society, in Australasia exists the New Guard, and in Canada lies the United Empire League. If we are to thrust ourselves into the political scene of the Anglosphere, we must reach out to these various groups to better spread our ideas of preserving the Empire."

AFG_edward_relations:0 "Stick to the Status Quo"
AFG_edward_relations_desc:0 "While the Dominion of India is our trusted ally, we should tread carefully with our relations. We will continue our normal relations with Delhi, as we should prioritize the governance of the Dominion of Afghanistan before gazing elsewhere."

AFG_loyal_empire:0 "March With the Dominion"
AFG_loyal_empire_desc:0 "It is only natural for us two neighbors to cooperate and grow closer bonds! We will work closely with our brothers in Delhi, fostering closer economic ties between our two nations to help mend the centuries of historic divisions that exist between these two nations. Together, we can restore South Asia under the British Crown once more."

AFG_king_loyalty:0 "Loyalty to the Dominion"
AFG_king_loyalty_desc:0 "Only the skilled administrators in Delhi have the experience and knowledge that comes with governing over such a varied land as India. It is imperative that we continue our close relationship with the Dominion if we are to bring Heaven’s guiding light back to this divided land. Our government will forge an unbreakable bond with the Dominion through further military and economic cooperation. "

AFG_crown_loyalty:0 "Loyalty to the Empire"
AFG_crown_loyalty_desc:0 "Our loyalty lies solely with the Crown and the Empire, not with the conniving bureaucrats and princes across the Durand Line. We will begin making diplomatic overtures with His Majesty’s government in Ottawa to unshackle ourselves from the failures in Delhi and allow our Dominion to enjoy a higher degree of autonomy within the Empire."

AFG_maharajah_relations:0 "A Cold Shoulder with the Dominion"
AFG_maharajah_relations_desc:0 "Under the new administration in Delhi, Indian demagogues are allowed to spread propaganda about Home Rule and even independence from the Empire. If left unchecked, these harmful ideas can lead to the undoing of nearly a century of development that our Empire has worked towards. We will slowly begin to phase out our ties with Delhi to become a separate and self-sufficient dominion that is wholly loyal to the Empire rather than scheming princes or corrupt politicians."

AFG_conflicting_interests:0 "A Conflict of Interests"
AFG_conflicting_interests_desc:0 "Despite the urgings of pro-Dominionist politicians, we have vastly different plans regarding the direction that India must take towards preserving British domination of the subcontinent and abroad. While the narrow-minded princes in the Dominion can only think about saving their palaces from squatters, we are planning for the next war and the war after that. India shall only be a starting point for expanding our influence across the Near East."

AFG_battle_of_delhi:0 "Save the Dominion from Sedition"
AFG_battle_of_delhi_desc:0 "Our patience with the Dominion of Delhi has finally worn thin. Once loyal citizens of the Empire have been poisoned by independence activists who only seek to destroy our Empire from the inside. Left with no other options, the Governor-General has decided that only our loyal government can restore order to Delhi and save India from itself. While many are reluctant to fight against our own brothers, it is imperative that the Crown Jewel must not fall into the hands of the enemy."

AFG_gun_grabbing:0 "Disarm the Rebels"
AFG_gun_grabbing_desc:0 "One of the biggest hurdles towards securing our rule over the Afghan tribes has been the prevalence of arms trafficking within the region. Located within the Khyber Pass, these crafty gunsmiths have used scavenged metals to create convincing copies of our own weaponry. While not particularly reliable, these smiths can easily mass produce and hand-me-down ‘Khyber Pass copies’ that could easily fall into the hands of dangerous insurgents. To prevent a future revolt, an expeditionary force will be sent down the Khyber to seize any and all counterfeit weapons."

AFG_bribe_local_leaders:0 "Pay Off Tribal Leaders"
AFG_bribe_local_leaders_desc:0 "Afghanistan has never been a unified nation in any sense of the word, it is a loose band of tribal chiefs operating under the nominal rule of the former Emir. For centuries these warlords have vied for wealth and power, scheming against one another to come out on top. We shall make contact with any willing local collaborators to bring them under our wing. These tribal leaders will be provided with expensive gifts and lofty administrative positions as long as they affirm their loyalty to the Empire."

AFG_guaranteed_loyalty:0 "Ensure Local Loyalty"
AFG_guaranteed_loyalty_desc:0 "While we continue to reap the benefits of collaboration with loyal chiefs, there remain dissidents who still foolishly fight against our rule. We  must make an example of these unruly tribes before they can band together against our administration. We will play into the divisions prevalent within Afghan society and pit the squabbling tribes against each other while propping up our loyal allies."

AFG_british_code:0 "Enshrine Common Law"
AFG_british_code_desc:0 "As we move to eradicate lawlessness in Afghanistan, we must acknowledge that the Afghan nation has barely known law. In 1880, Abdur Rahman Khan, the father of Habibullah Khan, had established the nation’s first codified law and justice system. The Afghan justice system, however, plays second fiddle to Sharia courts and that is prevalent throughout the countryside. Habibullah’s attempts to expand the legal system were quickly stamped out by traditionalists within Afghan society. We will replace the Emir’s attempts at judicial reform with the time-tested methods of English law. While not phasing out the Sharia courts entirely, the reaches of our jurisdiction will be greatly expanded upon."

AFG_no_reforms:0 "A 'Hands Off' Approach"
AFG_no_reforms_desc:0 "Let it be known to the average Afghan that their way of life will not be altered by being under the administration of the Empire, in fact it will only improve. Afghanistan’s deep rooted tribal structure will remain in place (if they remain loyal to us) and we will make no attempts to hamper the Islamic faith in the region. In addition, we will show the Afghan people the potential benefits of collaboration through promoting military service and work opportunities."

AFG_part_of_the_empire:0 "Our Place in the Empire"
AFG_part_of_the_empire_desc:0 "We stand at a critical point for the future for not only Afghanistan but the Empire as a whole. As we come to decide our Dominion’s destiny, two vastly different approaches have emerged within our administration. Most within our government have supported using what resources Afghanistan has to aid in the reconquest of India and the reclamation of the Home Isles. Some influential imperialists, however, have drafted up their own proposals to bring the entirety of the Near East under the British boot, drawing in new resources to bring prosperity to the Empire. We must decide carefully how to best use these mountains to serve the Empire."

AFG_gateway_of_east:0 "Gateway to the Near East"
AFG_gateway_of_east_desc:0 "With our rule over the nation absolute, we now stand in a position to carry out our plans to use Afghanistan as a springboard to expand the Empire’s influence throughout not only the Near East, but Asia as a whole. In the north, the Russians have lost their grasp over Turkestan. In the west, the crumbling Ottoman Empire is threatened by revolts and an all out invasion by neighboring states. This chaotic situation will be played to our advantage, allowing us to quickly expand our influence across Asia and bring an end to the Great Game once and for all."

AFG_kalakani:0 "The Man Who Would Be King"
AFG_kalakani_desc:0 "Habibullah Kalakani, known to many as the Bacha Saquo, has fulfilled his lifelong destiny and has led his army into Kabul in the wake of Nasrullah’s failed putsch. The brigand king already faces numerous challenges to his rule as the entire nation appears to be cracking at the seams. Kalakani must act quickly if he is to hold on to the throne of Afghanistan."

AFG_support_clergy:0 "Court the Mullahs"
AFG_support_clergy_desc:0 "During Habibullah’s reign, the Emir’s reformist streak earned him a number of enemies with traditionalist members of the clergy. In search of allies for our Saqqawist cause, we will make contact with these dissidents to try and gain their support. With their backing we could greatly improve the legitimacy of our government in the eyes of the Afghan people."

AFG_basmachi_allies:0 "Contact our Mujahideen Allies"
AFG_basmachi_allies_desc:0 "Our Saqqawist movement has always maintained close ties with Ibrahim Bek and his ‘Mujahideen’ in Turkestan. Merely called bandits to the outside world, our armies have both bravely waged war against modernity and foreign imperialism. With our rule contested by agents of the British Empire and the lackeys of the Pashtun nobility, we will ask Bek to aid us in our struggle and send his Mujahideen fighters to help us in the war for Afghanistan’s destiny."

AFG_islamic_appeals:0 "Defender of the One True Faith"
AFG_islamic_appeals_desc:0 "Before our armies marched on Kabul, we bravely faced off against Emir Habibullah’s attempts to destroy our movement. But what were we fighting for? Many would tell you that we were just bandits trying to fill our pockets, but that is simply not true. We were fighting to save Afghanistan from falling prey to the demonic Habibullah Khan who tried to separate Islam from the government. Through Kalakani’s alliance with the traditionalist members of the clergy, Kalakani and his band will take on the image as righteous defenders of Islam."

AFG_jalalabad_emir:0 "Deal with the Jalalabad Emir"
AFG_jalalabad_emir_desc:0 "As our forces blasted through the fortified gates of Jalalabad and reconquered the city, the cowardly Ali Ahmad Khan had already left, attempting to flee across the border into British India on horseback. After one of his own men defected to our cause, the traitorous Khan was captured and brought to our forces. After being beaten and dragged through the streets of Jalalabad, Ali Ahmad Khan is now being sent to Kabul, where he will have to answer to the new Emir."

AFG_assure_merchants:0 "Squeeze the Sarrafs"
AFG_assure_merchants_desc:0 "In his native village, Kalakani could vividly recall the pleas of starving mothers and their screaming children while the apathetic Sarraf would demand their tithe. For too long, these brokers have forced the people of Afghanistan to be victims of their unjust loans. With the treasury emptied, we will summon these money-lenders to the Arg to ask for what the nation of Afghanistan is owed. We will see if these thieves can make excuses while they are pleading for their lives!"

AFG_ally_minorities:0 "Rally the Minority Tribes"
AFG_ally_minorities_desc:0 "Kalakani has garnered the ire of the ruling Pashtun elite due to the fact that he is the only non-Pashtun leader of Afghanistan in centuries. An ethnic Tajik, Kalakani has gained blanket support among the minority tribes throughout Afghanistan, who have played a crucial role in the Saqqawist movement. As Emir, Kalakani has called upon the support of these minority tribes to band against the ruling Pashtun class."

AFG_pay_the_men:0 "Repay the Loyal Band"
AFG_pay_the_men_desc:0 "With the capture of the Arg, we have discovered that the bastard Habibullah had emptied the royal treasury. Promised riches and wealth, Kalakani will still carry out the payment that was promised to his men. The Bacha and his men turn their sights to the city of Kabul, eager to lay waste to the capital. This action, however, will certainly catch the attention of those who plot against our rule."

AFG_anti_reformism:0 "Wage War Against Reformism"
AFG_anti_reformism_desc:0 "While westernizers and agents plot to destroy the nation and sell the remains to the British and Germans, Kalakani and his loyal Saqqawists heroically waged a full-scale war against reformism. While most of the country sees us as little more than unwashed bandits, we will let the people of Afghanistan know that we are actually fighting to preserve our traditional way of life and to remain free from foreign powers."

AFG_discredit_nadir:0 "Move Against the Musahiban"
AFG_discredit_nadir_desc:0 "With the revolt of Nadir Khan raging throughout the countryside, it is time we tell the Afghan people the truth about this old fool. We will use the airforce to distribute leaflets that reveal the true intentions of Nadir Khan.The false Emir is nothing more than a pawn in the game of the British Empire, who only seeks to sell the Afghan people into slavery. In addition to our propaganda campaign, we will also imprison members of Nadir Khan’s family as a show of force to that British lapdog."

AFG_nadir_campaign:0 "Fold the Wild Card"
AFG_nadir_campaign_desc:0 "With Ali Ahmad Khan’s forces utterly crushed and our newfound allies providing much-needed legitimacy to our new government, we can now direct our full attention towards stopping Mohammad Nadir Khan’s attempt to take the throne. Kalakani and his loyal band will set out of the Arg and face off against Nadir’s forces in the south of Afghanistan, where we will play our hand against the so-called ‘wild card’ and make him fold."

AFG_the_tajik_emir:0 "The Tajik Emir"
AFG_the_tajik_emir_desc:0 "Following the defeat of Mohammad Nadir Khan’s forces, his remaining loyalists are now being hunted down as they attempt to escape across the Durand Line. Kalakani has proudly declared that his enemies have been vanquished and has begun preparations to plan an official coronation to help legitimize his rule. Taking up the royal title of Habibullah II, Kalakani wishes to build a sense of continuity by ruling as emir rather than merely an illegitimate brigand king."

AFG_enforce_sharia:0 "Enforce Sharia Law"
AFG_enforce_sharia_desc:0 "Emir Habibullah’s father, Abdur Rahman Khan, so foolishly tried to create a code of law to supersede the law of Islam in Afghanistan. These laws were mostly ignored in the countryside, with Sharia courts still remaining the law of the land. Using our close ties with traditionalist mullahs, we will remove the former Emir’s laws and ensure that Sharia will remain the law of the land forevermore."

AFG_no_education:0 "End Wasteful Departments"
AFG_no_education_desc:0 "With the treasury emptied by Habibullah, it’s hard to imagine if it was ever full in the first place. Our financial minister has found that the former Emir’s government has been wasting the treasury on useless departments such as education, justice, trade, and health. We will put an end to these attempts to replace the Quran and Islamic law and remove these ministries entirely. These cuts will greatly relieve the economic strain of governing and divert more funds towards financing the Royal Army."

AFG_appease_nobility:0 "Appease the Pashtun Nobility"
AFG_appease_nobility_desc:0 "While we took a strong stance against the Pashtun nobility during the revolts of Nadir Khan and Ali Ahmad Khan, Kalakani and his cabinet is well aware of the political influence that they still hold over the nation. To win over their trust, Kalakani will meet with the Ghilzai chief, Sher Khan Nashir, to negotiate and discuss a compromise between the Emir and the Pashtun elite."

AFG_loyal_administrators:0 "Hire Loyal Administrators"
AFG_loyal_administrators_desc:0 "While our loyal followers have enjoyed the administrative roles granted to them by the new Emir, it is obvious that they are unaware in the matters of statecraft. To help create a government of action, we will seek out local governors and hire loyal administrators to help run the day-to-day matters of government for us."

AFG_control_trade:0 "Caravansary of the Near East"
AFG_control_trade_desc:0 "Kalakani gained his fortune as a highwayman, harassing trade caravans as they made their way through the rugged Afghan hillside. Well aware of Afghanistan's critical role as a crossroads for trade, Kalakani will transform the entire nation to act as a toll booth for trading with the rest of the eastern world. By getting a cut of all trade that passes through Afghanistan, we will reap the newfound profits and finally be able to fill our treasury."

AFG_end_reforms:0 "End the Former Emir's Reforms"
AFG_end_reforms_desc:0 "Following our reshuffling of the reform-minded governments to one that honors tradition, we have finally snuffed out the remnants of the late Habibullah’s dangerous modernist agenda. These efforts have begun to bear fruit as our hardline anti-modernist stance has been a powerful tool to unite the disparate tribes towards our traditionalist Islamic government."

AFG_end_politics:0 "Free the Minds"
AFG_end_politics_desc:0 "It was in Kabul where Kalakani first heard of the word ‘politics’, where men had formed clubs to discuss the ideas of the West. Like a plague, these ideas spread throughout the cities. Even worse, these clubs have the audacity to twist the words of the Prophet to their western beliefs. To save the nation from these seditious groups, Kalakani has decided to enact a decree that will outlaw any and all political clubs."

AFG_habib_ul_islam:0 "Circulate Habib-ul Islam"
AFG_habib_ul_islam_desc:0 "While Kalakani never saw the need to take up the pen (or to even read), he is a pious man with conviction. Kalakani’s religious views on faith and governance will be transcribed and published into the nation’s sole legal newspaper, Habib-ul Islam. This paper will be distributed throughout the nation to spread the word of Kalakani and the Saqqawist government."

To alleviate these concerns, Kalakani and the government will undertake a massive effort to revise the history of Kalakani and the Saqqawist insurgency. We were not brigands at all! We simply acted as Islamic warriors who waged holy war against the atheist Habibullah Khan and his cabal of westernizers who sought to sell Afghanistan to the German and British Empire. With these truths revealed to the people, they will understand the necessary sacrifices we needed to make to save the nation from the western imperialists."

Under the rule of Ahmad Shah Durrani, the Afghan tribes were united and formed the first cohesive Afghan state. The Durrani Empire became one of the most powerful Islamic empires of the east, extending their influence across Turkestan and forcing the Mughal Empire to submit to their rule.

The once great  Ottoman Empire, however, has slowly begun to fall to decadence. Urged by demonic westernizers such as Mustafa Kemal, the empire has fallen to the foreign vices that almost destroyed Afghanistan as well. These concerns have forced Kalakani to contemplate Afghanistan's future regarding the sultanate. Will Kalakani support the Caliph in Constantinople or shall he take up the sword once again and declare himself as the rightful protector of the Islamic faith?"

We must make concessions to the various conservative factions within this big tent and work to build a stable pan-Conservative government based on Islamic Traditionalism and other sources of conservative influence like Germany’s Zentrum coalition in order to ensure stability and unity under Allah for the good of the League and all Afghanistan."

Seeking to utilize cultural nationalism, classical liberalism, and free market capitalism to save Afghanistan from the stagnating forces of traditionalism and Islamic supremacy, the Young Afghans have their work cut out for them as they seek to divorce Allah from Afghanistan in order to replace his guidance with the genius of Turkish-inspired Western-style liberalism."

No longer shall the various mosques, imams, and other religious forces have control over Afghanistan’s political destiny, though Kemalist principles like freedom for religion and freedom from persecution shall still stand, for a secular, nationalist, and temporally-focused nation of liberalized equals shall be ushered in by force if we must, all thanks to the brilliance of the Young Afghans."

Patriarch and founder of the Young Afghans that now emulate Kemal’s Young Turks under the leadership of Tarzi’s own son-in-law Abdul Hadi Dawi, our movement shall honor our founder’s modernizing mission along with the works of other liberal Kemalists like him like the great Ahmet Agaoglu, continuing Tarzi’s work of dragging Afghanistan kicking and screaming into a more Western, Urban, Modern, Secular, and Nationalist existence, partially modeled on the French inspirations that Kemal himself was inspired by as well."

Instead, our modern Young Afghans look to the true hegemon for guidance - the Kaiserreich. By pulling ideas from the centers of German Liberalism like their German Democratic Party (DDP) and the Nationalliberale Partei (NLP), we shall bathe the nation in the cleansing waters of modern Liberal ideology and free market economics fused with our own Nationalist ideas, creating a Western-inpired but Afghan-grown form of National Liberalism fit for our unique, and heavily conservative, masses."

No longer shall imams and clergymen keep the truth from the masses, and no longer shall obscuring sources like the Church or our Quranic schools be allowed to lead our people astray into ignorant bleakness.

United under our new national identity that sees us not as Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, or other disparate tribes and clans, but as one and united Afghan people, we shall embrace modernity and all the wonders that come with it thanks to the herculean efforts of these reformers.

By taking notes from Descartes’ Rationalism, Locke’s Empiricism, and Kant’s concept of religion born from the innate morality of mankind while still believing in a God that cannot be proven empirically, we shall create a Liberal system that is still foundational in the Islamic truth while still inching closer to a truly modern and rational society not held back by traditionally conservative religious forces within the clans or among the Imams."

At odds with the Ulama or the guardians of traditional or ‘authentic’ Islam like we here are at odds with Afghanistan's massive conservative majority, we shall give the Jadids a new hold here in Afghanistan, taking from their works and working together to breed a new form of humanitarian, progressive Islam here for our faithful."

To achieve our particular goals, our growing force of civilian activists and politicians within the Wesh Dzalmian aim to affect political policy on a national scale and across all of society, building new institutions and reforming old organizations while encouraging the masses to change their behaviors directly with the aid of our party’s journalistic arm and the growing news network we building for the nation."

AFG_durrani_populism:0 "True Heirs of Wäisi Populism"
AFG_durrani_populism_desc:0 "Our Fatherland Party takes heavy inspiration from the works of the father-son duo Bahawetdin Wäisiev and Gaynan Wäisiev and their militant Wäisi Movement (a socialist revolutionary movement in 19th and 20th century Russia that served as a Tatar-based Leftist version of the liberal Jadids) that banded together various Tatar groups throughout Russia and Central Asia against the Tsarist regime on a platform of pan-Islamic civic nationalism, class struggle, and proto-Socialist ideology in order to pit the Tatar farmers, crafters, and petty bourgeoisie against the nobles and military men that oppressed them. Eventually their movement shifted to true Islamic Socialism as opposed to simple anti-elitist struggle, but regardless they stayed dedicated to the teachings of the Qur’an and Sharia law while refusing to take part in a civilization run by the Kafir. In their image, we shall create the nation the Wäisi dreamed of here in Afghanistan - an Islamic Socialist paradise rooted in tradition and closely adherent to Islamic laws and customs while still upholding egalitarian democratic socialist principles for all within our nation, and all in tune with Afghan culture. By their design and our interpretation, we shall liberate Allah’s chosen from earthly oppression while keeping us in tune with the one, true faith unlike those other godless forms of Leftist thought that have taken hold of the decadent West."

By the Fatherland Party, this shall end. In line with the writings of our party leader Ghulam Muhammad Ghobar, we shall work to amalgamate the various ethnic groups of our land into one united Afghanistan identity built off ideas of civic nationalism and egalitarian multiculturalism.

With modernized healthcare paired with the expansion of new free clinics and hospitals, a system of temporary welfare to help those in need get back up on their feet, and other modernizing missions in regards to mental health, womens’ rights, progressive socioeconomics, and more, we shall shine Afghanistan into the pink pearl of Central Asia it was always meant to be without falling to violent radicalism, revolutionary acts, anti-democratic sympathies, and other cancers that have long plague the Left."

Although many doubt his claims and call them pseudo-historical nonsense, that has not stopped our Fatherland Party from posturing ourselves as the true heirs of Durrani’s so-called progressive legacy. Spreading an aesthetic culture based on the old Durrani Empire’s legacy fused with ideas taken from the Tatar Wäisi movement while modeling himself on the founder of the Durrani Empire, the elected emperor Ahmad Shah Durrani, along with some inspiration from the first Islamic Socialist Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī, our party leader Ghulam Muhammad Ghobar has worked to create a social democratic and modern Afghanistan that still holds dear its own historic and Islamic past. By fusing the triumphant legacies, theo-nationalism, aesthetic culture of the Durrani and these other sources with the progressive, egalitarian, and social capitalist ideas to fully socialist politics our Fatherland Party have come to cherish, we shall continue our long labor of love that is bringing the benefits of modern progressivism to Afghanistan without losing sight of our heritage, our past, and our faith."

AFG_bacha_khan_desc:0 "Aided by his anti-colonial and vaguely socialist resistance movement the Servants of God - or the Khudai Khitmatgar, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, known as Bacha Khan or the King of Chiefs, has mobilized the vast majority of the Pashtun tribes into open revolt against the tyranny of Habibullah Kalakani. Though this is a breach of their non-violent principles, Bacha Khan and his Servants of God shall temporarily break their vow of non-violence, justified as a form of self defense against the Bandit King Kalakani’s savagery and wanton violence, in order to save Afghanistan and perhaps all of the Indian Subcontinent, from racial and religious disunity."
AFG_finish_saqqawists:0 "Drive Out the Saqqawists"

We will drive out these brigands from the nation with a focused eradication effort, exterminating these violent and savage bandits in order to save Afghanistan."
AFG_secure_the_coalition:0 "Secure the Socialist Coalition"
AFG_secure_the_coalition_desc:0 "In order to help secure and organize a new Leftist republican government, Bacha Khan has formally reached out to the Khalq faction of hardline revolutionary communists under Nur Muhammad Taraki and the moderate democratic socialists and syndicalists of Parcham under Nisar Muhammad Yousafzai, as these small but ambitious movements are our only allies on the Leftist prevalent within Afghanistan. By creating a big tent coalition, Bacha Khan can save Afghanistan from the brink of destruction."
AFG_islamic_pacifism:0 "The Pious Pacifism of the Frontier Gandhi"
AFG_islamic_pacifism_desc:0 "Nicknamed Sarhadi Gandhi, or the Frontier Gandhi, due to his close friendship and similar ideology to the famous Mahatma, Abdul Ghaffar Khan is similarly committed to ideals of Pacifism, though through an Islamic lens as opposed to the Hindu lens of his contemporary to the South, only resulting to violence as a last resort as we have now in our revolution to save the Pashtun people from annihilation when all forms of peaceful protest and passive resistance failed. While seemingly contradictory in the eyes of the outside world, our Frontier Gandhi shall continue to combine nonviolent protest and Islamic teachings built on a foundation of vaguely Socialist and populist ideology aimed at uniting and uplifting the varied people of our region regardless of religious affiliation or ethnic origin."
AFG_secure_agrarian_support:0 "Aid Afghan Agriculture with the Anjuman-e Zamidaran"
AFG_secure_agrarian_support_desc:0 "Before founding the Khudai Khidmatgar, Bacha Khan founded the Anjuman-e Zamidaran - an organization that aimed to support farmers in Afghanistan. Finally at the helm of Afghanistan's destiny, Bacha Khan has moved to restore this organization in order to aid the rural backbone of Afghan society through subsidies and easy loans, emergency relief, and modernizing and mechanization efforts in line with tradition."
AFG_mobilize_redshirts:0 "Mobilize the Surkh Posh"
AFG_mobilize_redshirts_desc:0 "The Surkh Posh, or Redshirts, are the driving force behind the Khudai Khidmatgar. Identified by their distinctly colored shirts, these highly disciplined volunteers are far more than just a militia force as they aid people in local villages as a public works and relief force while helping to establish schools and spread the charitable tenets of Bacha Khan far and wide. With the amount of devastation caused by Kalakani and his brigands, the Redshirts shall be sent out to undo the damages as we work to heal our communities and the wider Afghan nation."
AFG_peoples_jirgas:0 "Establish the People's Jirgas"
AFG_peoples_jirgas_desc:0 "Named after the traditional Jirgas, or tribal leader assemblies used by Pashtun elders, the Redshirts too are able to organize their efforts through a close-knit network of Jirgas of their own organization and design. Within this network, individual villages and settlements run by the Redshirts are designated to its own small representative Jirga while wider authority rests in a larger and much more centralized Provincial Jirga, of which there is one for each major Pashtun province. To meet the needs of all of our rural communities, we shall apply this unique fusion of tribal customs on a nationwide scale. These local jirgas will allow those within the countryside to assemble and work with the Redshirts and the government to address local issues."
AFG_red_pashtunwali:0 "The Pashtunwali Dyed Red"
AFG_red_pashtunwali_desc:0 "The Pashtunwali is a tribal code of law that has guided the Pashtun people for centuries in matters of honor, justice, faith, and loyalty. In his aim to reform Pashtun society, Bacha Khan had long sought to uplift his people through education and social reforms. Through the elimination of tribalist practices such as blood feuds, this ancient Pashtun code shall be transformed and modernized along the lines of Bacha Khan’s extensive social reforms without losing touch with our past and traditions."
AFG_secure_the_countryside:0 "Liberate the Countryside"
AFG_secure_the_countryside_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, the rule of the new government has effectively been limited to major cities and the largest Pashtun settlements, while the vast majority of Afghanistan’s rugged and rural outlands - particularly to the North and West - have largely fallen back to lawlessness and non-enlightened tribalism. With our position secure, we will march out from our strongholds like Kabul to bring our new and modernized rule of law across the rugged mountains once and for all."
AFG_hindu_muslim_unity:0 "Foster Hindu-Muslim Unity"
AFG_hindu_muslim_unity_desc:0 "Much like India, Afghanistan is a land of many diverse faiths and ethnicities. For centuries, Hindus have long played an important role within our merchant class, though most fled from the nation in order to flee the brutality of the mad king Kalakani and his Islamic extremists. Partially inspired by his personal friend and mentor across the subcontinent whom Bacha Khan even takes his honorific name from - the great Mahatma Gandhi, Bacha Khan will promote unity among the two faiths and between all ethnicities in order to build the cooperative and peaceful melting pot of brotherly love and pious faith that Afghanistan was always meant to be."
AFG_aid_from_commune:0 "Aid from the Bharatiya Commune"
AFG_aid_from_commune_desc:0 "Bacha Khan and his allies within Parcham and Khalq have always maintained a close relationship with the prominent socialists in the Bharatiya Commune, with our own Frontier Gandhi being close to the Mahatma while Parcham and Khalq both find friends across the various wings of the INC.

AFG_peace_with_clergy:0 "An Accord with the Mullahs"
AFG_peace_with_clergy_desc:0 "While the traditionalists that surrounded the Mullah clergy were quick to mount a resistance to Bacha Khan and his stubborn adherence to socialist principles, their power and influence has waned considerably due to recent events. A far cry from the once powerful clergy that opposed the reforms of Emir Habibullah, the fallout of the Saqqawist insurgency and the death of Sher Khan Nashir have effectively left these bickering clerics disorganized,  leaderless, and weaker and more desperate than ever. To assuage the fears of the Islamic elite, Bacha Khan will use his credentials as a devout Muslim and an advocate for the advancement of the Pashtun people to make peace with these hard headed traditionalists."
AFG_rebuild_the_nation:0 "Healing the Wounds"
AFG_rebuild_the_nation_desc:0 "Kalakani and his bandits have left untold amounts of devastation throughout the nation, with many settlements and sections of major cities left in utter disrepair while large swathes of the population still nurse their wounds and hide the scars both physical and mental that the Mad King wrought before his downfall. With the support of our allies and the wider coalition, we will begin a massive campaign to help the nation heal and rebuild as Abdul Ghaffar Khan ushers in the new Afghanistan."
AFG_begin_land_reform:0 "Introduce Land Reforms"
AFG_begin_land_reform_desc:0 "Presented primarily by members of Khalq and Parcham, these two parties have advocated for land reforms to redistribute the land held by wealthy landowners to the poor proletarian masses. Though far more overtly revolutionary and socialist a policy than Bacha Khan was originally comfortable making, fearing retribution from the clergy and nobility that share his faith and heritage while holding great influence over the nation, most of these concerns have been eliminated or greatly reduced thanks to our recent successes. As such, Bacha Khan has yielded to the radical desires of his allies, and so the redistribution process shall begin in earnest, though Bacha Khan has vowed to oversee the process in order to ensure it proceeds as peacefully as possible."
AFG_legacy_of_hijrat:0 "Legacy of the Hijrat"
AFG_legacy_of_hijrat_desc:0 "Bacha Khan and his followers were one of the first political refugees to arrive in Afghanistan following Emir Habibullah's decision to welcome Muslims fleeing oppressive policies in British India. Called the Hijrat, the Emir graciously allowed these exiles to find a new home in Afghanistan. A rift has grown between the native Afghans and these displaced Hijrat communities. We shall move to mend this divide and celebrate the legacy of these exiles in addition to promoting Afghanistan as a safe haven for our wayward brothers in India and abroad."
AFG_emancipate_the_forgotten:0 "Emancipate the Forgotten Half"
AFG_emancipate_the_forgotten_desc:0 "Despite making up half the population, women in Afghanistan have virtually no rights as it stands now, with whatever meager reforms Habibullah managed to squeeze through before his fall being erased and reversed by Kalakani. Bacha Khan and the socialist coalition shall right this wrong as we begin to enact sweeping reforms and progressive advancements aimed at greatly improving the status of women's rights within Afghanistan. By ensuring their right to a sound and comprehensive education, banning forced and child marriages, making women more involved within politics with the right to vote and hold office within the Jirgas, and generally ensuring them equal rights on the whole while protecting them from violent crime and unjust harm, we shall uplift every last citizen in the nation so that all can support our revolutionary metamorphosis."
AFG_educate_the_masses:0 "Enlighten the Masses"
AFG_educate_the_masses_desc:0 "In his fight for social reform within Pashtun society, Bacha Khan firmly believed in education as a way to elevate his people. We will begin a massive education campaign to eradicate illiteracy within twenty years while preparing a new generation of future leaders and academics, or at least that is our goal. We shall get every Afghan an unbiased, comprehensive, and free basic education even if they have to walk uphill both ways through the deserts and snowy mountains to get there!"
AFG_a_necessary_militia:0 "Establishing a New Afghan Army"
AFG_a_necessary_militia_desc:0 "Going against Bacha Khan’s strict adherence to pacifism, members of the Parcham and Khalq factions have gone behind his back by supporting a proposal geared around establishing a new Afghan army. Though the Frontier Gandhi has howled and hollered against such a move, the coalition has overpowered him by appealing to the masses who fear outside invasion, imperialism, and retribution at the hands of the British and Indians in Delhi, and so our first organized and officialized state-run armed forces shall rise to defend the Revolution, for better or worse."
AFG_awaken_the_pashtun:0 "Saving the Pashtun from Ruin"
AFG_awaken_the_pashtun_desc:0 "Under our far-reaching socio-economic and cultural reforms, we have awakened the political awareness of the Pashtun people and have invigorated their spirit. Under Socialist and Islamic teachings hinged around progressive populism, egalitarianism, modernism in tune with our long history of tradition, and the pacifism of the Frontier Gandhi, the Pashtun people have unshackled themselves from stagnant tribalism as we all dash together to our new future stronger and more united than ever before."
AFG_first_congress:0 "Assemble the First Afghan Congress"
AFG_first_congress_desc:0 "With our initial reforms successful and our rule secured, members of Parcham and Khalq have called for a congress to decide the future of the coalition and the wider nation. With the moderate Parcham and their Islamic allies, the extremist radicals within the Khalq faction, and the Khudai Khidmatgar of Bacha Khan himself all in attendance and vying for the top spot, the coming meeting of this First Afghan Congress will determine the destiny of revolution going forward."
AFG_kk_victory:0 "The Khudai Khidmatgar Secure the Mandate"
AFG_kk_victory_desc:0 "Rallying most of the nation against his radical rivals, Bacha Khan and his Khudai Khidmatgar have handily maintained their rule, having been elected in their own right fair and square. With the nation behind them and with their extremists allies weaker than ever, and rapidly losing their usefulness to boot, the Frontier Gandhi and his Redshirts shall bring about peaceful, moderate socialism to all Pashtuns and the wider subcontinent while spreading their tenets of pacifism and Hindu-Muslim unity for all to behold and benefit from."
AFG_expel_party_radicals:0 "Expel Radicals from the Coalition"
AFG_expel_party_radicals_desc:0 "While they have helped us to lay out the foundation of the socialist government we now largely run alone, the division between the Khalqists and Parchamite factions have nearly brought the nation to ruin with their endless bickering and refusal to cooperate or compromise. With Khudai Khitmatgar's dominant position within the government fully secured by mandate of the congress and the masses, we will finally move to expel these more radical, problematic, and unpredictable elements within the party in order to secure a stronger, more united, and more obedient coalition."
AFG_towards_india:0 "Towards Indian Unification"
AFG_towards_india_desc:0 "While a tireless advocate for the Pashtun cause, Bacha Khan had fought tirelessly for India's independence from the British Empire before India descended into chaos, leading to his exile in Afghanistan as one of the Hijrat. With the homefront secured, Bacha Khan will pursue his ambitions towards uniting all of India, both Muslim and Hindu, under one banner in order to stop the senseless violence that has long dogged our great peoples for centuries so that together we may walk into a brilliant and peaceful utopia."

AFG_securing_pashtunistan_desc:0 "Marching against the tyrant Kalakani and saving the nation from near ruin, Bacha Khan has done much to elevate the Pashtun people.

Hu, Hu!"

AFG_courting_the_commune_desc:0 "The Indian socialists within the Bharatiya Commune find themselves in the ultimate battle to free the subcontinent from the remnants of British India and the selfish ambitions of wealthy princes.

AFG_complete_land_reform:0 "Comprehensive Agrarian Reforms"
AFG_complete_land_reform_desc:0 "Utilizing the moderate remnants of the Khalqists and Parchamites still within the coalition, we shall force these former rivals to work together in order to accomplish the land reforms they both rabidly supported during our rise, and that Afghanistan so desperately needs if the revolution and our own people are to survive."
AFG_rural_urban_divide:0 "Bridging the Rural-Urban Divide"
AFG_rural_urban_divide_desc:0 "The Parchamites had used their support among the urban cities while the Khalqists appealed to the poor farmers within the countryside.

AFG_parcham_victory_desc:0 "The Parcham faction led by Nisar Muhammad Yousafzai has emerged victorious among the delegates within the congress. Realizing and respecting that Afghanistan's close knit ties to tribalism can never be truly severed, the Parchamites have supported a gentler and more cautious path towards revolution within the nation through the use of democratic reform and the gradual implementation of future policies on a platform of Islamic ‘Afghan Socialism’ that pulls from similar movements in the Arab world and Asia."

With our mandate secured by the mandate of the congress and the masses, we will begin the creation of this big tent coalition. From the Islamic social democrats of the Fatherland Party to the progressives within the Awakened Youth, Parcham will lead the torch towards a new Afghanistan fully united behind our enlightened might."

AFG_urbanite_support:0 "Ensuring Urbanite Support"
AFG_urbanite_support_desc:0 "The moderate policies of the Parchamites found wide support among those living within Afghanistan's urban centers such as Kabul and Herat, especially among the urban academia and intelligentsia. We will ensure their continued support with urban support measures and agreeable policies, allowances, and privileges geared to their wants and needs to continue on our smooth and slow path to revolution through reformation on their backs."
AFG_uniting_all_afghans:0 "Pursuing Pan-Afghanism"
AFG_uniting_all_afghans_desc:0 "With the Saqqawist terror a memory of the past, many still wonder how the brutal bandit king was able to find any support among Afghans. While his reign was cruel and despotic, he provided the minority groups within the country a chance to uplift themselves within society. The chauvinistic Khalqists, and to a lesser degree Bacha Khan's Khudai Khidmatgar, mainly serve the interests of the Pashtun ruling class. While a Pashtun himself, Nisar Muhammad has previously worked tirelessly to aid minorities such as the Tajiks and Uzbeks. With the Parchamite government in control, we shall foster an all-encompassing Pan-Afghanist nationality as we work towards uplifting all Afghans regardless of ethnicity under the watchful eye of Allah."
AFG_moderate_land_reform:0 "Moderated Land Reforms"
AFG_moderate_land_reform_desc:0 "Initially initiated under Bacha Khan's interim government, land reforms were introduced as a way of gaining popular support among the rural class while appeasing both we Parchamites and our rivals among the Khalqists as one of the few policies our rival factions both agreed on. While promised, the growing rift between the Parcham and Khalq factions stalled the completion of these reforms. With our rule secured and our united front solidified, we will finally complete these much needed land reforms in a moderated form as to now disrupt our new alliances while still giving back to the farmers that form the backbone of Afghan society."

AFG_careful_course:0 "The Careful Course Towards Revolution"
AFG_careful_course_desc:0 "Nisar Muhammad and the Parchamites are aware of the realities of Afghanistan's situation. Despite the grandiose promises of the Khalqists, their violent and uncompromising ideas of revolution would prove disastrous for Afghanistan. Knowing better than their shortsighted and impatient rivals, the Parchamites have decided to continue their gradual, semi-democratic push towards socialism along with their allies within the united front through carefully calculated reform, for the best path towards proletarian paradise is the most stable path, no matter how long it takes to get there."

### KHALQ ###

AFG_khalq_victory_desc:0 "The Khalq faction led by Nur Muhammad Taraki has emerged victorious and has been able to form a new and highly radical government built on Leninist influences from Russia and France. Although young, the ambitious Taraki has pushed himself to the forefront of Afghan socialist circles with his fiery revolutionary rhetoric and refusal to allow compromise or the lazy moderate to ruin Afghanistan’s one shot a proletarian paradise. Despite the rumblings of his detractors within Parcham over Khalq’s use of militant violence, their harsh antitheist stance, and the usage of other extreme measures, Taraki promises a rapid and uncompromising push to modernize the antiquated Afghan nation and bring Communist utopia to our lands."
AFG_radical_land_reform:0 "Root Out the Archaic Economy"
AFG_radical_land_reform_desc:0 "While Bacha Khan's government made the first steps towards land reform, the government's ineptitude and Parcham's weakness left these plans on the shelf largely unfinished. Our government will not toy with mere moderate reforms and concessions, for we shall uproot the entire rotting system for it has been allowed to fester for far too long. Through extensive economic planning and a massive land reform campaign that knows no compromise or moderation, Afghanistan will rise as a shining star of socialism for all of Asia to witness as quickly as feasibly possible. Let the mass wealth redistributions begin!"
AFG_rural_support:0 "Call Upon the Agrarian Masses"
AFG_rural_support_desc:0 "Our call for imminent action and rapid reform found its largest share of support within the disenfranchised farmers in the countryside. To ensure their support for our future revolutionary policies, we shall capitalize on this popularity by freeing the farmers from the feudalist practices that they have long suffered under so that we may replace it with a cooperative system based on Leninist and Jacobin principles that truly puts the people first while still ensuring efficiency and produce from the fields."
AFG_empowering_pashtuns:0 "Maintain Pashtun Dominance"
AFG_empowering_pashtuns_desc:0 "It was we the Pashtuns who have aided in creating the modern Afghan nation, and it was we Pashtuns who managed to put an end to the tyrannical reign of the villain Kalakani as well. This position of dominance was not by some sheer coincidence or run of good luck, for we alone had the will, the skill, and the cunning to be able to do what needed to be done, and it is by this earned right that we Pashtuns alone shall guide the new Afghanistan into our future proletarian paradise."
AFG_finish_the_clergy:0 "Sever the Traditionalist Cancer"
AFG_finish_the_clergy_desc:0 "When Bacha Khan saved the nation from the villainous Kalakani, the clergy was quick to rally against the new government. A pious man, Bacha Khan so foolishly bended forwards to the traditionalist clerics who cower behind religion to keep Afghanistan in the darkness. Without the bickering of the Parchamites or the shortsighted piousness of the Redshirts, we can finally free Afghanistan from the chains of the Mullahs and the opiate of the masses that dared to impede our revolution."
AFG_orthodox_line:0 "Following the Orthodox Line"
AFG_orthodox_line_desc:0 "We must stay true towards our adherence to Leninist principles and affirm our support towards the Internationale and their struggle against Imperialism.

AFG_mass_party:0 "Towards a Vanguard Party"
AFG_mass_party_desc:0 "The foolish Parchamites believed that they could dilute the revolution with the idea of a popular front. The PDAP - our new vanguard party led by the all-powerful Taraki - shall serve as the sole revolutionary political force in order to unite Afghanistan's proletariat as we work to transform this once-archaic backwater into a true socialist paradise."
AFG_great_leader:0 "The Revolution Secured by the Great Leader"
AFG_great_leader_desc:0 "Utilizing the mass influence of the PDAP and its revolutionary council, our vanguard will extoll the greatness of Taraki and his goal of transforming Afghanistan into a pure bastion of Communism in Asia. Planting the seeds of a growing cult of personality around our ‘Great Leader’, Taraki shall be uplifted as the national father and hero of modern Afghanistan as he tightens his grip on power and rises to become the sole voice of authority and justice within the nation. By his hand, the revolution shall proceed no matter the cost, all for the good of the proletariat."

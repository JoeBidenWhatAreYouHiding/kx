## El Salvador ##
POLITICS_MAZIMILIANO_HERNANDEZ_MARTINEZ_DESC:0 "Maximiliano's political career has been tough ever since it began. With his coup against the civilian government in December of 1931, he's been bombarded with tough decisions which led to the Salvadoran Uprising in 1932. This has proven to be a stain on his political career, with sentiment against him being rampant not only among the general populace but also in some elements of the army. However, the United States aligns with him which is the only thing keeping his political career safe for the time being."
POLITICS_OSMIN_AGUIRRE_Y_SALINAS_DESC:0 "Osmin Aguirre y Salinas has been a military officer for since he came of age, and as such, has dwindled little in the local Salvadorian politics. This changed in the 1931 coup d'etat led by Martinez, where Salinas became General Director of the National Police, War Minister and provisional leader of the Civic Directory, which gave supreme power to General Martinez. However, mounting unrest in the army have turned Salinas into the voice of opposition against Martinez. With Martinez' mistakes during the Second Western Uprising have made the army choose to overthrow Martinez for Salinas, but whether Salinas will be able to secure El Salvador and reform it effectively remains to be seen..."
POLITICS_Salvador_Castaneda_Castro_DESC:0 "Salvador Castañeda Castro, elected as the headmaster of the Gerardo Barrios Military Academy and Minister of Government by Martinez after his coup in 1931, has kept a rather low profile in the country overall. Having defected from Martinez' forces during the Second Western Uprising, it almost seemed like the General was a defender of democracy. Apparently, He has other plans for the Salvadorian democracy, ones that differed greatly from the PL and the PND. Seeing the Red Menace looming over Central America, Castro took advantage of the government's refusal to crack down on rebellious military elements and secretly allied with them, waiting for the Laboristas to make a wrong move to take over El Salvador. Now that he is in control of the nation, he'll purge the Syndicalists from any position of power, all while trying to provide some semblance of democracy to the populace to avoid a new uprising, even if this 'Democracy' will prove to be nothing but a ruse..."
POLITICS_ALFONSO_MOLINA_DESC:0 "Alfonso Quiñónez Molina has had a long political career by Salvadorian standards. He had been learning the ropes of governance from his time as Vice-President for his Brothers-in-law Carlos Meléndez and Jorge Meléndez from 1915 to 1918 and then from 1919 to 1923 respectively; becoming Provisional President in 1914 and 1919 first and then being elected as Constitutional President in 1923. Public outraged ensued after his election, with plenty of media outlets considering his rule as a pseudo-monarchy which came to be known as the Meléndez-Quiñones Dynasty. Despite the bad press though, his rule saw the greatest coffee boom ever registered in El Salvador's history, making the nation reach record levels of economic prosperity and catapulting Molina's popularity to new heights. However, many episodes of repression during his rule had severely damaged his reputation and was forced to step down when his term was over. The hardships El Salvador has been forced to endure in his absense have made many miss the times of prosperity that he brought, and with a lack of any other strong liberal candidates, the PND decided to contact Molina once again to lead the liberal coalition, to which Molina has gladly accepted. Now that he's back in power, he has promised to do anything in his power to deliver prosperity back to the Salvadorian nation and its people."
POLITICS_ARTURO_ARUAJO_DESC:0 "Arturo Araujo Fajardo studied to become an engineer in England, where he became a strong follower of the British Labour Party's policies before the Weltkrieg. Upon his return to El Salvador, he quickly became a follower of Alfredo Masferrer and his ideology, 'Vitalismo' and in 1930 he made up his mind to finally take part in Salvadorian politics officially and formed his own party, the Partido Laborista, which received immediate support thanks to Masferrer's endorsement. The Laboristas won the 1931 election, and Araujo's career seemed to have practically skyrocketed overnight. However, economic hardship, social instability and opposing the interests of the army and the rural oligarchy only weakened Araujo's position further and further. His presidency came to an end when his Vice-President and Minister of War, Maximiliano Hernandez Martínez made a successful coup d'etat in December 2nd, 1931, sidelining Araujo from any politically relevant position and ending democracy in El Salvador. However, with the Second Western Rebellion being successful and Araujo having been chosen to lead his country for the transition to a full democracy once again, he has become a beloved figure in El Salvador, and his rule is bound to see progressive reforms and welfare be introduced to the nation."
POLITICS_FELICIANO_AMA_DESC:0 "José Feliciano Ama, a chieftain of the Pipil tribes in Izalco that successfully escaped the 1932 massacre, has managed to become the Head of State of El Salvador. Ama, lacking any sort of formal education and ideology, will delegate most of his work to his ministers and will work mostly to uphold the status quo and improve the overall situation of El Salvador's natives and peasants, regarldess of language, ethnicity or religion."
POLITICS_AGUSTIN_FARABUNDO_MARTI_DESC:0 "Agustin Farabundo Martí started his political career protesting against the Meléndez-Quiñones Dynasty and taking part in the first worker's organisations in El Salvador. He'd later volunteer to help the Zapatista forces after the Plan of Agua Prieta came into effect, where he would meet who would be one of his closest friends for years, Augusto Cesar Sandino. He would continue his career of political activism, and would later help Sandino with his fight in Nicaragua. However, with time, Martí grew further and further apart from Sandino, with them disagreeing more and more often on the fate of their countries should their revolutions succeed. Martí eventually gew further and further appart, and their relationship reached a breaking point in 1929 where Martí tried to punch Sandino in a drunken rampage. Despite having apologized formally with Sandino several times, he decided to return to El Salvador in 1930 and start leading the revolutionary movement by himself. His time would come in 1932 where he tried to lead the First Western Uprising, but after being delivered a crushing defeat by Martinez, he fled to Mexico to continue preparing for the revolution in El Salvador. Now that he's in power, he'll do his best to brind about the European-style Syndicalist Utopia he has dreamed of, even if this dream may seem far off for an agrarian region like Central America..."

## Emilia ##
POLITICS_DUKE_ROBERTO_DESC:0 "Roberto D'Asburgo-Este, Archduke of Austria, was promised while he was still an infant the position of Duke of Modena. He never even set foot in his duchy, as it was one of the first places where Federal forces were forced to withdraw from during the chaotic Civil War in Italy. The second son of Karl I, Roberto grew up in Austria alongside the royal family, and despite having learned Italian, seldom thought about his duties as head of the house of Austria-Este for most of his life. But now, he is Duke, and few can argue that his position isnt exactly enviable, as recovering the land ravaged by Syndicalism while having to deal with a brand new political landscape, having essentially no political experience, is quite the dauting task."
POLITICS_DUKE_ELIAS_DESC:0 "Born in 1880, Elias of Bourbon-Parma has never sat on a throne, for like most monarchs of the Federation, he never was in a position to return during the trumoil of the war on the wake of the Treaty of Rome. Having lived in exile in family estates for most of his life, he was forced to leave his birthplace in France following the Revolution, but even before that the french state harried his family for their ties to Austria-Hungary during the Weltkrieg. While he technically acted as a regent for his demented brothers, Elias has been long the de-facto head of the house, and his ascension to the throne of the now restored throne is little more than a fait-accompli of dynastic politics. However, there is no shortage of criticism for what some see as brazen ambition being put ahead of his own brother's well being."

## Eritrea ##
POLITICS_WOLDE_SELLASSIE_DESC:0 "Son of Italian father and Eritrean mother, the Tigray Wolde Selassie also goes by his Italian name, Domenico Mondelli. Having been adopted by Italian officers during the first Italo-Abyssinian war, he never held the Ethopians in high regard. A soldier with great distinction, he served with great honours during the losing fight of Italy against the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg, but was forced to return to his homeland during the trumoil that followed the Civil War there. His mixed ancestry and well known competency and bravery in battle make him the ideal leader for the fledgling Eritrean state, a role the military-minded man may not be fully prepared to in state terms. But he is prepared to fight against the Ethiopians once again, and to defend his home, for he already lost his former one."

POLITICS_HAILE_SELASSIE_DESC:0 "Following the death of Zauditu on 2 April 1930, Ras Tafari Makonnen was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia on 2 November 1930 at Addis Ababa's Cathedral of St. George. Upon climbing the throne the new Emperor, eager to wield the power he had finally obtained, started a series of sweeping political reforms to bring Abyssinia 'into the west'. In 1923 he toured Europe, inspecting schools, hospitals, factories, and churches, and the contact with the European way of life had greatly impressed him, for he intended to modernise Abyssinia to the European standard. These reforms, however, were fiercely opposed by the powerful conservative elements of the nation and have been delayed by the economic problems affecting the Empire, especially the debt he inherited from Zewditu's reign, and the pervasive and invasive German economic influence"

POLITICS_ZHANG_ZUOLIN_DESC:0 "Born to an impoverished family near Shenyang, Zhang Zuolin began his meteoric rise as a bandit exploiting the chaotic military situation of the late Guangxu Era. After securing governorship of Manchuria, Zhang went on to fight a series of wars with the Anhui and Zhili Cliques, at times extending his influence as far south as Shanghai. Despite Zhang's best efforts an economically unstable home front, German intervention, and Wu Peifu's military genius have seen him again contained to the provinces north of the Great Wall. He has been stoking old ambitions ever since, converting his formerly regionalist administration into a bastion of republicanism, claiming direct lineage from the Xinhai Revolution. His actual commitment to democratic principles remains to be seen.\nDespite his poor literacy and lack of a formal education, the 'Old Marshal' is capable and self-aware leader, happy to seek advice and delegate where necessary to cover his deficiencies. However, he is also known for a short temper and an unforgiving nature, readily holding deep grudges. Zhang is also sometimes greatly self-centred, formerly crashing the entire Northeastern economy to support his war efforts, and so in ideological terms he could be called staunchly 'Pro-Zhang'."
POLITICS_ZHANG_XUELIANG_DESC:0 "Zhang Xueliang joined his father's army in 1917, and soon become a close friend to Guo Songling at the Fengtian military academy. His combat record has been mixed, having suffered an honourable defeat during the First Zhili-Fengtian War, performed exceptionally during the Second, and again experiencing defeats in the Third and Fourth Wars.\nAlthough previously considered to lack ambition, he has slowly risen to become his father's political heir, and an informal leader of the so-called 'Zhang Clique'.\nHowever his political career has been frequently undermined by problematic personal habits, supposedly coping methods for war-related trauma.\nHe has been known to frequent the Legation Cities, especially Shanghai and Tianjin, where has spent days smoking, gambling, and carousing with women. Despite his father's best efforts, and those of some close friends, his attitude has yet to change."

He began his career as a cavalry commander, at first suppressing uprisings and defeating Mongol incursions, and later playing a major role in Zhang Zuolin's rise to governor of the Three Northeastern Provinces. Wu himself was appointed governor of Heilongjiang province in 1921 and remains so even in 1936, but his great age and faltering health have driven him to begin considering his succession. Although he has an adopted son, his sponsorship of subordinates Ma Zhanshan and Wan Fulin could see his position go to any of these three.\nHe is known to be clumsy in domestic politics but likes to disguise himself as a scholar, often creating tiger calligraphy and paintings despite his relative lack of skill.\nHe is particularly fond of raising animals, and it is said that he has raised more than 3,000 horses, in addition to owning a large number of monkey houses behind his residence.

Although he is no longer the governor of Jilin Province, he still has great influence there. He remains an important member of the Grand Marshal's inner circle, and he is often regarded as the true leader of the informal Zhang Clique, composed of loyalists.\nHe has proven instrumental to the Fengtian Clique's stablity, and after the failure of Guo Songling's revolt he protected Guo's subordinates, preventing the Clique from falling into disorder.\nMany people think that Zhang Zuoxiang and Zhang Zuolin are actual brothers, but their shared surname is purely coincidental."

Inaugurated not by coronation, but by swearing an oath on the constitution, Adelbert, who also converted to Catholicism to align himself with his nation's populace, has long sought the respect, if not admiration, of his people. Years of oppression under the German regime and a tendency for Adelbert to cling on to a more absolutist type of monarchy than the Belgian system have led to great anti-German sentiment among the populace, making Adelbert despised and hated amongst the common folk."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_DESC:0 "Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the king who trounced the invading Germans at the Yzer, has returned to Belgium from exile in Canada. When his motorcade entered Brussels for the first time since the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, church bells across the nation rang, and many Belgians weeped with joy. German collaborators and syndicalists, however, lament the restored king, and plot to undermine the new Belgian government. Albert must now mend the deep wounds which have marred Belgium, and create a renewed sense of hope among its people."
POLITICS_JORIS_SEVEREN_DESC:0 "Joris Van Severen, Flemish leader who begrudgingly cooperated with the occupying Germans, has assumed control of the country. His Verdinaso has a radical vision for the direction of Belgium, including territorial expansion and the promotion of Catholicism in all aspects of society. Under van Severen, a new Belgium will certainly arise; though that new nation may be incredibly different from the one that came before it."
POLITICS_PAUL_ZEELAND_DESC:0 "Paul van Zeeland and the Catholic Party led Flemish resistance to German control. With electoral victory in the now restored Belgium, van Zeeland endeavours to establish Christian Democracy in Belgium, and reconcile that which divides Belgium's people, Flems and Walloons alike. Principle among his policy goals is the betterment of working conditions for both farmers and industrial laborers."
POLITICS_BELGIAN_PARLIMENT_DESC:0 "The Belgian Parliament, successor to the Flemish Council which advised the German controlled government of Flanders-Wallonia, has assumed power in the recently restored Belgium. While the Government is restructured and elections prepared, Parliament acts not just as a legislature, but collectively as interim head of state."
POLITICS_HENRIK_MAN_DESC:0 "Henrik de Man, a moderate social democrat, has consolidated his leadership of the Belgian Workers' Party, and now achieved victory in Belgium's latest national elections. De Man advocates limited economic nationalisation and the empowerment of union leaders to a governmental advisory role. Belgium, De Man believes, must actively serve its people and promote fair competition; his reforms, though controversial, may yet decrease economic hardship and political radicalisation in Belgium."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_JACQUEMOTTE_DESC:0 "Joseph Jacquemotte, creator and editor of the leftist pre-Weltkrieg newspaper 'L'Exploité', and his Syndicalist faction of the Belgian Workers' Party have achieved victory both within the party, and now, Belgium itself. Jacquemotte advocates rural industrialisation and the collectivisation of industry and agriculture alike. A Belgium led by Jacquemotte is certain to see drastic societal and economic upheaval."
POLITICS_PAUL_HENRI_SPAAK_DESC:0 "Paul Henri Spaak, once a prominent lawyer, believes that, above all else, to truly serve the people, government bureaucracy must be efficient. Spaak is now in control of the Belgian Workers' Party, and the party's subsequent victory in the most recent Belgian national elections has elevated him to head of state. Spaak has already begun to greatly decrease the bloated Belgian civil service and introduced new incentives to prospective entrepreneurs; as a result, optimism seems to be steadily increasing in Belgium."
POLITICS_PAUL_EMILE_JANSON_DESC:0 "Paul-Émile Janson and his Liberal Party has achieved victory in Belgium's latest national elections. Janson is an advocate of laissez faire economics and free trade; all aspects of society, to Janson, have been far too regulated by past administrations. Belgium, under Janson, is quickly becoming one of the most economically free nations in Europe and the world."

POLITICS_ANTONIO_SOTO_FOP_DESC:0 "Antonio Soto Canalejo was born in 1897 in the city of Ferrol, La Coruña province, Spain. His father died when he was very young, and he was forced to move to Argentina with his brother when he was just thirteen years old. Already as a teenager, he was exposed to the anarchist ideals by the people he met while he travelled with the 'Serrano-Mendoza' traveling theater company. He participated in a strike of trade employees in Trelew, Chubut province, that turned into an open rebellion, with him fighting alongside the strikers. Although the revolt was crushed, he gained valuable experience for his future uprising.\n\nWhen the second Patagonic strike came about, after wealthy landlords decided to ignore the requests that had been agreed between the strikers and the government, he decided to join up with the strikers and organize their insurrection. The strike led up to a stand-off at the 'La Anita' farm, where Soto rallied the disillusioned workers with a fiery speech and managed to hold back an army detachment lead by Lieutenant Colonel Varela. His forces began growing with simple workers who wanted better working conditions and eager idealists alike, and would later join up Alfredo Fonte's forces in 1923 in the events that lead to the creation of the FOP. 'El Gallego' has become a legendary figure for the workers in the FOP and anarchists worldwide, and he'll strive to bring the anarchist ideals of justice and equality into Argentinean society, in a peaceful way if possible and in a violent way if necessary."
POLITICS_MANUEL_BALDOMERO_UGARTE_DESC:0 "Manuel Baldomero Ugarte was born in 1875 in the Argentinean Capital, Buenos Aires City. Born to a wealthy family, he attended the 'Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires', where he became an avid reader and enthusiast writer. In 1897, he travelled to Paris in order to continue his studies. He assisted Philosophy and Sociology courses and began following Jean Jaurés after the US's intervention of Cuba in 1894, where he began manifesting his hatred towards imperialism. He joined up a group of young writers in Argentina and they all affiliated the Partido Socialista. However, the Partido Socialista's conservative leadership by Juan B. Justo quickly antagonized the young group, which formed its own more combative faction within the PS.\n\nWhen the FOP broke off, Ugarte couldn't stand Justo's inaction, and decided to leave towards the newly-born nation. While Ugarte has shown devotion to the revolutionary ideals, he also has many differences with his fellow revolutionaries. He staunchly defends freedom of religion and the concept of nations, reaffirming his love for the Argentinean nation and culture. However, he also believes in joining forces with other socialists in order to stop imperialism into South America, and as such, he'll strive to unite America under his banner."
POLITICS_FANNY_JABCOVSKY_DESC:0 "Fanny Jabcovsky was born in 1911 in San Francisco, Cordoba, Argentina. She began working in 1925 in a textile workshop when she was just fourteen years old, but would later drop off her job to become a music teacher. She then met journalist Eduardo Edelman, with whom she'd meet writers Leónidas Barletta and Álvaro Yunque, who convinced her to become a communist in 1934. Finding her new ideals now clashing with her life, she decided to go to the FOP with her husband. Her trip was long and hard, and they barely managed to cross the Rio Negro as the Argentinean Border Guard closed in on them. An FOP's border guard patrol that was passing by intervened, and Fanny survived the subsequent skirmish.\n\nSince then, she has joined up the border guard of the FOP in order to help other revolutionaries escape to the FOP and help protect it from reactionary aggression. She became an active member of the force, participating in plenty of border skirmishes between 1934 and 1936, which have granted her a lot of experience and popularity amongst the FOP's populace. Now that she leads the FOP, she'll use her military experience to fight off imperialism, and try to unite South America under the banner of internationalism."

A French nobleman, who inherited the self-proclaimed title of King of Araucania and Patagonia from his father, who rules over a population that is rather apathetic to him. While the Mapuches had agreed on a French king a few decades past, things have changed a lot since then. The people he rules are as foreign to him as he is to them, which makes his legitimacy doubtful at best."
POLITICS_VARELA_PATA_DESC:0 "Héctor Benigno Varela was responsible for suppressing the Patagonian Strikes during the 20's. During his first encounter with the strikers, he was lenient and allowed them to continue, considering the strikers were right in reclaiming better rights from their employers. However, during the second Patagonian strike, his ruthlessness shined through, as he demanded the strikers to surrender unconditionally, even executing the messengers Soto sent to reach an agreement. However, he failed to contain the uprising, and his failure gained him a demotion in the army. However, since then he has worked closely with the Liga Patriotica, gaining valuable experience in anti-insurgency tactics, and now that he's military governor of the Patagonia, he will rule with an iron fist and hunt down those who once dared to humiliate him"
POLITICS_FONTE_FOP_DESC:0 "Alfredo Fonte, better known as 'El Toscano', was the leader of a group of anarchist bandits which roamed the Patagonia, attacking isolated farms, homesteads and even villages back in 1921, at the time of the Second Patagonian Strike. He met up with Micaela Feldman de Echebéhère during those years, who taught him military strategy, and turned the brigand into a proper general. In 1923, he met up with Soto in Paso Ibañez, as the Patagonian uprising was growing out of control, where they both agreed to work together and settle their differences. Soto would lead the FOP, but Fonte would lead its armies, in one of the events that marked the creation of the FOP. However, he hasn't abandoned his old ways, and was seen pillaging villages across the border several times. Now that he's in power, his psychotic and violent attitude and totalitarian views are bound to change the face of the FOP forever."

A French nobleman, he inherited the self-proclaimed title of King of Araucania and Patagonia from his father. While the Mapuches had agreed on a French king a few decades past, things have changed a lot since and as a result. As a result, the republican Brazilian government, though willing to press his claim to Patagonia to ensure its Argentine rival remains divided into the future, forced Bernard to accept a republican form of government, albeit with power firmly concentrated in his person."

Since the Weltkrieg, Germany has eclipsed its rivals, and its drive to acquire a place in the sun has been fulfilled.

However as the war progressed it became clear to Grigol that he was fighting a losing war, seeing his homeland independent he felt a restored sense of patriotism. Leaving for Georgia along with other Bolsheviks he established himself in the nation’s politics. As the Mensheviks realised the great task that lay ahead of them, Grigol proposed a coalition government with him and his former Bolshevik allies.

POLITICS_LEONIDAS_MATOS_DESC:0 "Leônidas Antero de Mattos is a native of Cuiabá, born in 1894 and as all so usual for the upper class then, graduated in law school before moving into politics, while his brother João Antero de Mattos joined the military. A staple figure in state governments of Mato Grosso since the Interstate War, he has been awarded many varying stations and administrative positions, some say all the while lining his pockets. While the role of leading the newly founded Republic of Goyaz is an unpleasant one, especially with the powerful Caiado family jostling for power constantly, Leonidas certainly believes that cooperation, at least for now, is the best way to ensure the prosperity of his home."
POLITICS_RAMIRO_NORONHA_HOS_GOY_DESC:0 "While a relatively low ranking officer before the beginning of hostilities, Ramiro Noronha has since established himself as one of the most well known service men in the lands now controlled by Goyaz. As to seek a quick pacification of the hinterlands, his expertise as many times garrison leader and interventor in the region is now at the service of the newly founded republic, in a role that he certainly did not predict when he enrolled into military service as a young man. Now having to deal with grumbling oligarchs and syndicalist protests, Noronha himself fears he may no be entirely qualified to the task laid before him, but is determined to establish order first, before any reconsidering of strategic options."
POLITICS_JARI_GOMES_GOY_DESC:0 "Born in 1913 in the riverine city of Corumbá, Jari Gomes graduated in medical school, but has been more active as a poet and politician since then. After following the all to familiar climb of city councillor, state and then federal representative, Jari is one of the most influential politicians in what is now the Goyaz Republic, and has been chosen as it's first president, in a move some claim is a direct attempt to curtail the influence of the Caiado family in regional politics. The stage is set for a new chapter in the ever changing landscape of this land's politics, and few can predict if President Jari will come out on top internally, but his foreign backing certainly has most oppositors moving cautiously."
POLITICS_TOTO_CAIADO_DESC:0 "The recent political history of the state, and then the Republic of Goyaz is almost entirely the history of the extremely wealthy and powerful Caiado family, and those few and brave enough to oppose their immense political power. Even as it transitioned into an independent nation, Antônio José Caiado, also known as Totó, is by far the most powerful man in the land, as the head of the family and all its properties and influence. While some could call dealing with foreign occupiers dubious, there are few things the family would not do to maintain its grip on local politics, which has admittedly weakened ever since the democratic reforms in the wake of the interstate war. Now assuming direct control of government and with powerful foreign backers, few can even see a future where the Caiados don't rule Goyaz."
POLITICS_CANDIDO_RONDON_HOS_GOY_DESC:0 "Almost a living legend in Goyaz's northern reaches, and all of the former Brazilian lands as a whole, Candido Rondon is a die hard republican who spent decades of effort to connect, explore and map the large western reaches of Brazil. Usually not one to meddle in political affairs, Rondon knows these lands better than any man ever has in history, and he will not give up the fight for his republican values, even in the dire situation all of former Brazil finds itself in. Some, however, claim him to be broken and tired man, that gave up his fighting spirit for the safety of the people in the region."
POLITICS_CHICO_AQUINO_GOY_DESC:0 "His Revered Excellency Francisco de Aquino Correia was born in 1885 in Cuiabá, and is the chief religious authority and intellectual in the region. Having dabbled in politics since 1917, Francisco knows that the role of the church in the hinterlands is more than a spiritual one, but one of guidance and guard against the ever present threats of the material world, such as the temptation of atheism and discrimination. While he was at a point had something of a common cause with integralists in Brazil, his relative lack of enthusiasm for the monarchist movement caused him to fall into the wayside of that movement, but has since admitted that dealing with those radicals was a mistake borne of fears of a rise in syndicalism. While he is respected among both the people and his peers, he will have much to endeavour in stabilizing the newly established republic, especially when it comes to curbing the ever growing influence of the Caiado family of the capital."
POLITICS_PEDRO_LUDOVICO_GOY_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the city of Goyaz, Pedro Ludovico Teixeira completed his studies in Rio de Janeiro before returning to his home, where quickly began a political career, positioning himself against the state oligarchs, the Caiado family. While initially left leaning politically, the failures of the ED and the street violence that even reached his city during the 1936 elections have drifted him towards a more liberal-democratic point of view. His main goal while at the helm of the republic is one that has defined his political career, his long standing desire for a better and more developed Goyaz, even if his ideas on how to reach said goal have changed quite a bit over the years. As he now takes the helm of an independent and free Goyaz, he can finally set his development plans into motion, and while some powerful families will likely stand in his way, naturally including the Caiado, he has confidence that his foreign backing gives him a secure position to negotiate."
POLITICS_PONCE_ARRUDA_GOY_DESC:0 "A civil engineer by trade, João Ponce de Arruda is not exactly the kind of man who typically takes on the protagonist role in socialist states. While he always was a left winger, he never saw himself as a radical, but as a moderate, and this position and his influence in the region have allowed himself to present himself as the best possible head for a transitional government as the newly established republic gets back on its feet, as the war demolished what little infrastructure remained. Born in Cuiabá in 1904, he also both blood and friendship ties to many of the states notables, and seeks to ensure a stable transition; but many of the powerful families in the region still believe themselves in a position above the new government, which is bound to cause issues for the young nation."
POLITICS_APOLLONIO_GOY_DESC:0 "Apolônio de Carvalho is one of the most notable military servicemen to have joined political life in the left wing, having had a long and distinguished career in the Brazilian military after he left his home in Corumbá to serve. He joined the ranks of the ED around the time of the 1936 elections, urged by fellow officers to act on his desire to bring meaningful change to the nation. With the war that devastated the former nation now in the past, Apolônio certainly is a proactive politician, as he and many other fellow left-leaning officers feel that the changes in the structure of the country must be done in a swift and decisive fashion, and not doing so risks both lives and the safety of the future success of the newborn republic. His political stances also are a lot closer to traditional french ideals than the general heterodoxical ideas of most officers in the army. As a military man, he also believes in a proactive foreign policy to safeguard the interests of world revolution."
POLITICS_HEITOR_LIMA_GOY_DESC:0 "Heitor Ferreira Lima was born in the city of Corumbá in Mato Grosso, but he moved to Rio de Janeiro while still relatively young, in 1922. He started working as a tailor and joined the local syndicalist movements, and became one of the three youngsters chosen there to study in Paris under the auspices of the Third Internationale. There he turned into a true scholar of economic and social theory, and has since dedicated his life for the workers of the world. Now tasked with the role of leading his birthplace to a better future, he has to face off not only against the elements, but the quasi-feudal resistance against any kind of modernization efforts that is well entrenched within the newly formed state. However, the internationalist nature of the man means he will not hesitate to call in foreign help to deal with any open unrest, a fact the wisest members of the opposition to the communard government recently established have to always keep in mind."

He is however more well known for his multiple tenures as an administrator in the state, as he is the leader of the local military faction in that state that supported São Paulo in the interstate war. His tenures were usually stable, even during election year he often found himself at odds with other major political factions and actions, such as his main rivals in the Sodré family, who accused Barata of voter fraud on multiple occasions, but the political union with Amazonas and other northern states should give him some more room to maneuver. As president of Pará, Barata is also commander-in-chief, and his influence with the newly formed military should not be underestimated, for he has taken a close attention to the formation of this military force. Having for so long struggled to maintain political control of the region, Barata now finally has Pará marching under the beat of his drum."
POLITICS_LAURO_SODRE_HOS_AMA_DESC:0 "Lauro Nina Sodré e Silva had left political behind him after the interstate war, but the current situation of Pará as an independent nation brought him back to the forefront, this time as its head of state, not merely as its governor. Born in Belém in 1858, the old man is more than just a powerful and veteran politician, but also perhaps the oldest active politician in Pará. Also a military man, like many of the leaderships in Brazil during the times of the old republic, he took part in the Vaccine Revolt in Rio, being arrested in the process, and after that, continued his career as a multiple time representative for his state in that city. While his years may be running out, he is preparing the new republic's political system to stay aligned with his family and allies, while also balancing foreign demands and repairing wartime damage to the vital portuary infrastructure across the states he now rules over."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_FACIOLA_AMA_DESC:0 "A true captain of the old guard, Antônio de Almeida Facióla's political career all the way back in the 1880s, and has not left the game since, even at his advanced age. While some opposition members claim that having a president with ''one foot in the grave'' is dangerous for Parense democracy, the multiple times state president of Pará political power cannot be denied, even if his body fails him more and more frequently in the past few years, as with any man in his eighties. While he wields significant clout at his former political arena, the ''old man president'' doesn't really have a strong degree of influence in Amazonas or the smaller territories, and may find himself having issues actually ruling the nation's disparate political factions; as his position as it's first president is to a great degree based on foreign appointment rather than his own efforts."
POLITICS_ALVARO_BOTELHO_MAIA_AMA_DESC:0 "Born on the edge of Rio Madeira in the outskirts of the city of Humaitá, Álvaro Botelho Maia moved while still young the provincial capital of Manaus to finish his studies, and quickly found himself involved in local newspapers and later followed on into politics, but he is also a poet and a writer in his free time. While his career so far has been a string of relative unimportant appointed positions in smaller territories of the defunct Brazilian government, his growing frustration of his lack of power to properly reform the northern reaches of the country was immense even before the war, and now he sees himself in a prime position to modernize Grão Pará's still young economy, education and political infrastructure. However, being both a reformer and not of a traditional political family puts him in a collision course with powerful landowners and rubber barons, and he will have to spend significant effort to see these changes through even with foreign backing."
POLITICS_EFIGENIO_SALE_AMAS_DESC:0 "Hailing from the town of Serro in Minas Gerais, Efigênio Ferreira de Salles was at the helm of the state of Amazonas at the start of the interstate war, and when the news of the war reached the north, he opted for a 'wait and see' stance, which resulted in him being ousted from office after the rebels successfully ousted president Bernardes on that occasion; since then, he occupied relatively minor positions as a representative and worked as a teacher, his primary job for much of his life. However, the result of the war Brazil found itself in has made his political destiny take another unexpected turn, as he is now the president and head of state of the newly founded republic of Grão Pará, a position both powerful and precarious, as his influence in Belém and outside of Amazonas in general is severely limited, especially after so many years out of the upper echelon of the great game. However, his experience, allies in Manaos and foreign backing almost ensure that in any contentious matters, his voice will be the last one heard and the one truly heeded in the young republic."

While did flirt with the AIB during the rise of that party, he since has adopted more classical liberal stances in detriment of militarism political thought, and has been elected president with great support from fellow officers in campaigning. His outlook towards politics also changed over the years, and he is more in favour of de-escalating tensions and a generally less active role of active officers in political affairs. While he is not a native to the lands of the north, he spent most of the past decade occupying administratie posts in Pará, and thus has chosen it as his hope for the time being, while also fostering good relations with the republic of his birthplace to the west. He has a big task ahead of him, as the already diminutive amount of infrastructure of these riverlands may take decades to repair, but Landry is used to both the harsh life of the barracks and the ever shifting loyalties of politics."

He started to act politically at age thirteen, supporting the rebel cause in the interstate war quite publically, but later on he moved further and further left as he reached adulthood, becoming a full blown socialist by age 20; he spent these youth years studying for medical school, and as a part time footballer for Clube do Remo. A calm and collected man, Pedro often remains quiet in political gatherings, only occasionally inferring in rare points, and has a usually positive and likeable demeanour, which resulted in his relative popularity among trade union members, despite his somewhat young age; now, he is faced with the immense challenge of leading a nation that is just as young as him, and faces immense hurdles of infrastructure and budget. While these concerns are certainly worrisome, he believes that with the support of the people, socialism can flourish even here, in the banks of the Amazon basin."
POLITICS_CLAUDIO_SANTORO_AMA_DESC:0 "Claudio Franco de Sá Santoro was born in Manaus in 1919, and is an extremely renowned musician and composer. His career in music began while still young, but his involvement with the Internationale is just as old, as he often found his colleagues involved with syndicalist and leftist organizations even from very early. His appointment to the position of first head of state of his new country is a recognition of his career in both of those fields, but also an immense responsibility, as the riverine republic has to repair the immense wartime damage, both administrative and in infrastructure, while also dealing with the powerful and avaricious landowners who see Claudio as a foreign collaborator, and will stop at nothing to keep the people ignorant and to ransack of the world's greatest forest of its riches. Dealing with these opponents may well be a complicated matter for the young socialist, who is still seen as excessively hopeful and naive, and perhaps may require foreign intervention."

While initially a social democrat, as the years went by he drifted further left, frustrated with the power the landowners had over democratic institutions and growing more and more cynical of the capacity of democracy to bring real change to his home. Now, he is in a position to do much more after the liberation of Brazil, as the head of state and chairman of his homeland, and bring the modern age to Pará as a whole; and this time, it's the landowners who are at the mercy of the proletariat, and not the other way around. In due time, he hopes, the lands around the river he was named for will become known as a shining example of socialist success and prosperity."

His political career began as early as 1936, where he partook in the street battles in Recife against syndicalist rabbles, and has since become one of the key agitators of Integralist ideology in the region. While he, like many integralists in the northeastern part of Brazil, never held any significant monarchist beliefs, the movement enjoyed his support as he saw the republic as little more than a failed experiment in its current state. Being a law graduate, Osvaldo wishes to re-establish the rule of law cross the Confederation; and to do so, he prepares an extensive plan of investigations and arrests against traitors and terrorists, some of whom have roamed the nation freely for decades.

While his position as leader of the Confederation is none one he picked himself, he is determined to establish the rule of law by any means necessary, and he enjoys widespread support for this endeavour in the recently organized national army, as the military in the region has traditionally shifted towards the right wing. The main issue while he is president however will be the many differing powerful political factions and oligarchs that have traditionally wielded power in each individual states; these coroneis will stop at nothing to increase their influence, even if this damages the overall goals of self sustainability and army reform the president defends."
POLITICS_WHITECASTLE_HOS_GRP_DESC:0 "Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco was born in Fortaleza, the capital of Ceará, in 1897, and completed his military studies in Porto Alegre, in the far south. He occupied the post of a military instructor in Rio during the Interstate War, and sided with the rebels like many other mutinous officers. Being on the winning side brought him many political advantages, and by 1936 he was an army major and one of the most influential servicemen in the nation. His most standout political belief is the strong opposition to any kind of syndicalist or socialist principles, and he always defended open war against any kind of internationalist regime as necessary to maintain peace and order. To him, syndicalists are enemies of freedom no matter what treaties they sign, and they seek to undermine the values of the nation as a way to replace them with the beliefs of Marx. This disposition might have had him in friendly terms with the AIB, were it not for his relatively strong republican beliefs. Now as the appointed president of the newly formed federation, the most pressing matters of rebuilding the administrative and transport infrastructure must at least for now take precedence over the enforcement of his planned anti-socialist and anti-union legislation."
POLITICS_COFFEE_JR_GRP_DESC:0 "Born in Natal in 1899, João Fernandes Campos Café Filho performed as a young man the typical path of Brazilian politics, working on journalism and studying law before managing a spot in local legislatures, but with the key difference of having played football professionally for Alecrim FC during the waning years of the Weltkrieg. Having positioned himself strongly in favour of the opposition in the interstate war, Café holds a strong belief in modernizing the country, but also in demoratic principles he often found were seldom respected by his peers in the old brazilian legislatures. A presbyterian protestant, Cafe Filho is a part of a minority in the intensely catholic Guararapes, but despite what foreign observers might infer, it's an extremely secondary matter, for his biggest issue when taking the rulership of the federation will be the local elites, the coroneis, whose influence and wealth made them historical political kingmakers in the region. He, however, counts as his ally the extremely influential João Pessoa, and has significant, even if broad, popular support for his democratic and liberal ideals."
POLITICS_CAVALCANTI_HOS_GRP_DESC:0 "While born in the small town of Palmeira dos Índios, Newton de Andrade Cavalcanti moved away from home quite young to pursue a military career, and he was quite successful in it. A distinguished and talented officer, he had already become a high ranking officer by the time of the interstate war, and by that point was an army major and one of the most respected servicemen nationwide. His respected position and political moderation compared to most high ranking officers made him a natural choice for leader of the federation, as the war left a wake of lawlessness, anarchy and damaged infrastructure that may take decades to repair without intense foreign aid, something that doesn't seem quite likely. His republican beliefs frequently put him at odds with some radical integralist officers; while he today denies any ties with the movement, he did have some slight sympathy for their actions against syndicalist movements, even if not for their monarchism. While he usually distanced himself from political stations, he is now the guardian of democracy in the region, as the coroneis, disgruntled integralists and the ever looming syndicalists all threaten the fragile federal order in the states of Guararapes."
POLITICS_JOAO_PESSOA_GRP_DESC:0 "João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque is perhaps the most powerful man in all of the states that forms Guararapes, his career, popularity and political clout all almost unparalleled. Having led what is considered by many to be the most successful presidential term in the history of Brazil's republic, being multiple times state president of Parahyba and led the state governors of the region as a bloc for a decade. Born in the small town of Umbuzeiro, João later moved to several different major cities, having graduated in law in the University of Recife, and lived for times in places such as Rio. He rapidly climbed the political ladder, and soon rose to the prominent position is is now widely known for. His immense credibility is why he leads the confederation; while legally could not be president of Brazil again after his term, this is an entirely different entity, and he hopes to stabilize the newly founded republic, but also secure its prosperity and repair the extensive wartime damage across the country; but he will have to face stiff opposition from coroneis and other oligarchs across the nation, even if most state presidents of the federation are his allies."
POLITICS_JOSE_AMERICO_DE_ALMEIDA_GRP_DESC:0 "José Americo de Almeida was born in the small town of Areia, Parahyba, in 1887, and became a public prosecutor in the city of Souza, in that same state, shortly after graduating from law school, and became state prosecutor at the age of twenty four. Such a rise is notable and uncommon in the usually long climb politicians have in Brazil. Americo is one of the many more established political figures to join the party, after their cooling of relations with more radical left elements after the 1936 election cycle, and lends to the administration his notable experience and gravitas as both a navigator and a talented author. While his appointment as head of state may be seen as surprising, it is in no doubt due to these new connections the party developed with important leaders, perhaps Americo's reputation as unlucky will finally turn around. Now at the helm of the entire union of Guararapes, he finds himself having to face the great challenge of managing the disparate political forces in the nation, a fact especially exacerbated by his relative lack of clout in his home state, where João Pessoa, his rival, is far more influential."
POLITICS_RACHEL_QUEIROZ_GRP_DESC:0 "Perhaps better known for her activities as an author, journalist, teacher and translator, Rachel de Queiroz mostly represents the interests of her unions than that of any established political movement in the modern post revolutionary landscape, as she never had a very deep connection with leftist cliques. Often bothered by what she considers ideological orthodoxy standing in the way of eradicating poverty, especially in her home state of Ceará, she was something of a consensus candidate among the several disparate groups that have arisen in the newly founded socialist congress, with the backing of several cearense delegates behind her. This position also may complicate her situation in executive matters, but she believes that working with a focus on the education of the lower orders will bring about greater prosperity than simple industrialization programs, or building huge railways across the nation."
POLITICS_CRIS_CORDEIRO_GRP_DESC:0 "Hailing from the small town of Limoeiro, Cristiano Cordeiro started his career in public services early, working at the state treasury while still a law student at the University of Recife. A veteran of the syndicalist movement in Brazil, Cristiano was one of the founding members of the PSB, and worked in organizing strikes both big and small in Recife for decades, while also acting in defense of the workers as a city councillor and other minor legislative positions. While he himself always positioned himself against a revolution enforced by military means, he nevertheless is the greatest syndicalist leadership in the states that form the federation, and thus was selected by it's unions as it's first chairman, while also receiving support from foreign syndicalists. His key policies are centred against combating hunger and extreme poverty that have devastated the states of the north ever since colonial times, but he also holds stances in favour of defending the rights and lands of the native peoples, who were the primary victims of the feudalistic practices of the local powerful landowners, the coroneis."
POLITICS_DJALMA_GRP_DESC:0 "A relative newcomer to the political scene, Djalma Maranhão has been involved with the worker's movement since the early 1930s in his hometown of Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, even attempting to run for a mayoral position under the ED umbrella, albeit that endeavour did not succeed. While also a teacher and journalist, his dedication to the political cause has been intensified since the liberation and break-up of the states, as real change finally arrived to Brazil. Having gained significant support from his fellow northeastern union representatives, Djalma now prepares to take the helm of Guararapes's new, socialist government. His main goal is to improve the living standards of the people of this historically poverty-stricken land, especially those of the peasantry, who's ever growing vulnerability to droughts and food shortages caused mass migrations throughout the last four decades. Time will tell whether these extensive reform programs will be successful or not."

He witnessed the tragic end of Vietnamese syndicalist movement and fled to France. In exile, he developed an interest in the ideology of French Jacobins, Vanguardism. The idea of a vanguard group of disciplined intellectuals leading the revolution captured him. After the split of the League in 1931, he founded Tan Viet party and started infiltrating the colony. Most of his colleagues find him forever diligent and energetic, a reliable and loveable person as well as an ideal organiser and administrator.

Ta Thu Thau became a prominent activist in Saigon in the mid-1920s and joined the League in its darkest days. After the split in 1931 gave another heavy blow to the League, Ta Thu Thau rose to power. This sharp intellectual has intentionally modelled Ho Chi Minh's leading style since his assuming of the title of Chairman, trying to calm factional tensions and strengthen solidarity.

Nguyen An Ninh returned to Indochina in 1924 and was arrested by German police for radical agitation. After witness the crackdown of Indochinese syndicalism, Nguyen An Ninh decided that Indochinese revolution must rely on the spontaneous uprising of peasants. Since then, he started the Aspiration Society, modelling on traditional secret societies. He often personally travels from village to village under the disguise of a monk or herbist, selling his self-made ointment, and secretly recruit members to sow the seeds of revolution. He thus won great popularity among peasants in the Mekong Delta.

Convinced by the revolutionary ideas of this new movement, Musso hosted a reading and translation of the Totalist Charter among Insulindian exiles in Calcutta, subsequently forming the Partai Totalis Insulindia (PTI) that was to be the successor of the PKI.

As his trade union was becoming more and more popular with Malayan immigrants, distance support from Sarekat Islam dried up.

Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists and took control of the Labour Party, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand and the Labour Party was banned, leading Larkin to go into hiding with the help of the Commune of France.

Thus, it was Ghazi's triumphant return to Mecca after the fall of the Ottomans that restored the greatness of his name."
POLITICS_SAEED_DUBAI_DESC:0 "Where war and rivalry only led to the stagnation of Arabia, trade and deleation will restore. This came from a speech given by the Emir Saeed al Maktoum upon receiving his office. His term as Emir of Dubai was one of exemplary diplomacy and a care for his peoples' wellbeing. Submission to the Sauds over a bloodbath in the 1920s, creation of economic ties to India when pearling failed the emirate, and finally a promise of peace. His dynasty being unilaterally more wealthy than the Rashids or Hashmitie may of helped as well."
POLITICS_SHAKBUT_IRQ_DESC:0 "The House Al Nahyan was stuck in the crossroads of the Saud Rashid war. Their cities taxed cruelly by the Sauds, and thier commerce stunted. This destruction resolved Shakhbut Al Nahyan to formulate an economic plan for recovery involving western economists. This plan was presented to the Emirs, and early successes paved the way to Shakhbut's election. Al Nahyan weaves in his speeches the tales of how his ancestors of the Bani Yas migrated to the coast and found a land suitable to grow. Shakhbut's personal reputation among the Emirs is outstanding, and is only corrupted by the schemes of his own family. Shakhbut is confident that his reputation can save him from the machinations of family politics."
POLITICS_ABTAN_IRQ_DESC:0 "Atban was the one-time rival and now successor to the famous soldier and Sheikh Auda abu Tayi. When Auda's ambitons failed, he retreated from Aqab into the Al Nefud. The Howietat's livestock starved, wells were denied to them. In desperation Atban ibn Jazi choose to again put aside his rivalry for the sake of thier people and seek aid from the Rashids. This bid was successful, and Atban became the representative of the Howietat. Auda's and his reputations for joining the Arab Revolt and facing the harshest of the Turkish reprisals made Atban a surprisingly good candidate for Emir. Atban challenged the Emirs to live among their own, and was rewarded with cooperation."
POLITICS_SABAH_IRQ_DESC:0 "The Emirs of Kuwait began the century by setting the Rashid Saud conflict in motion, and it has finally paid off for them with the ascension of Jabe Al Sabah. It was Jaber's father who gave the Sauds arms and men in 1906 to retake Riyadh, a decision that would come back to haunt his son. The Ikhwan, Ibn Sauds frenzied soldiers attacked Kuwait when the British left, leaving devestation along the 1st Ring Road. Al Sabah prostrated himself to the Rashids, who forgave him and announced their protection of Kuwait. Now the Sabah are owed favors from the Rashids accrued during wartime, who exchanged this debt for a promise to elect Jaber al Sabah. Jaber himself reminding the emirs that he was first into battle on his horse against the Sauds, and that he alone could lead the charge against the Ottomans."

POLITICS_BAKR_SIDIQI_DESC:0 "Unlike many Kurds that joined the Ottoman Army's special Hamidiye units, Bakr Sidqi joined the general army alongside Arabs in after training in Istanbul. This slot allowed him to gain allies within the Ottoman command throughout the Weltkrieg. After many divisions of the Ottoman 4th Army were discharged in 1921, Sidqi managed the welfare of both Arab and Kurd troops in Kirkuk. Sidqi cultivated a loyalty in his men towards him above official orders, which only increased when military pensions were cut in 1922. When the Assyrian rebelled in 1925, Bakr personally led his troops through towns killing soldiers and civilians alike. It was this ruthless efficiency and the recent desertion of the Hamidiye that gave Bakr an informal rule as military governor of the Mosul Vilyet. Bakr's aim is to subordinate the Kurdish tribes under his military clique with the help of Arab and Turkish soldiers."
POLITICS_BARZANJI_DESC:0 "Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî is the leader and patriarch of the Berzincî clan living to the north of Mosul. Although Mehmûd himself is Sunni, his ancestor Musa Kazem of the Twelver Shia gives him authority over Kurds in Ardelan. Mehmûd has spent the last decade gathering arms and supporters from Iranian Kurdistan for revolt. This revolt is planned the same way prior Kurdish revolts have, and the incredible success has bolstered Kurdish claims that their dynasty is as legitimate as the Qajars or Osman."
POLITICS_BABA_SHEIKH_DESC:0 "Nominally a citizen of Iran, Haji Bana Sheikh was a religious leader for the Mahabad province of Persia before the Weltkrieg. His position as a Sheikh only recognised by the Kurds in Mahabad, in which he was considered a moderate Shia leader. When the Russians entered Kurdistan, he formed the Alliance of Islam Committee to seek cooperation with Iran and Azerbaijan. Haji cultivated an ally in General Reza Khan, which has finally paid dividends in Persia's triumph. Haji collaborated with the exiled Mistefa Barzanî in 1932 to establish the PDK, although they soon clashed over whether the party would support Iran's claims or not. Haji's pro Iran position and Reza's support led to a breakdown of this coalition in 1935, though both leaders stay in touch."
POLITICS_MIHEMED_DESC:0 "It was only after the failure of the Russian socialist revolution that Qazi Mihemed had realised his calling was socialism. Born into a rare Kurdish aristocracy and destined to be a poet, Qazi published his poems in Kurdi and Farsi, drawing the ire of the Qajars. His poems never reached the West, as the Khoyboun refused to publish his work. When internationalism finally came to Kurdistan, his works were found in the hands of socialists and he was found and uplifted from a jail in Sanandaj to realise the Kurdish destiny. Unlike most Levantine socialists, he rallies the Kurds in a united faith in Allah instead of nationality."
POLITICS_MUSTAFA_BARZANI_DESC:0 "A relative of the Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî, Mistefa was only five when his family was imprisoned by the Ottoman military. Spending the majority of the Weltkrieg in hiding with his remaining family, Mistefa first became involved in his brother Ehmedê's milita in the 1920's. Ehmedê's militia attempted to steal arms from the Ottoman 4th Army in 1925, leading to Ehmedê's capture and execution. Mistefa fled with the remainder to Azerbaijan, where he joined Haji in establishing the PDK. Mistefa was disturbed to find the Haji had allies in the Persian military, and lobbied for the party to turn away from secularism and cooperation with Iran towards total autonomy and Barzanî tribal laws. Officially Mistefa and his allies are the leaders of the PDK."

Those soldiers returned to find the Sidqi clique had slandered them as traitors. The Hamidiye moved into the Turkish side of Kurdistan, among the Zaza Kurds and Alevi. Among them was the Azadi Sheikh Said, an adept soldier who felt that the Ottomans were betrayed by secularists. His anti-secular position may have alienated the Iranian and Iraqi Kurds, but the Zazas rallied around him. Said reorganised the Hamidiye along with even Turkish volunteers into a fighting force to restore the Caliphate. Said himself was a Naqshbandi Sufi, who felt that Egypt had abandoned the path, and Salfis posed a threat to Sufi existence."

Compared to many other Kurdish nationalists, Kamuran had traveled to Britain prior to their revolution to establish a support group for Kurdish immigrants. His experience in Turkish law allowed him to arrange for people to leave Kurdistan for Britain until 1924. Following the revolution, Kamuran worked in the Commune of France developing new alphabet based on French to enable Kurds to spread their message internationally. This work was allowed despite his dealings with the former empires, until 1929 when his residency was revoked. This turned him against socialism, and his publications made out of Turkey reflected this. He is brought in as a competent economist and intellectual President of Kurdistan, in order to give dignity to the post."

After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Song decided to stay in China as an outlaw in southern Fujian out of a strong feeling of patriotism. Despite her lack of initial credentials aside from marriage ties, she has proven herself to be an inspirational leader to the Insurgent Zone and has become the head of the pro-democratization Minquan Faction."
POLITICS_CHI_WANG_JINGWEI_DESC:0 "Wang Jingwei is a divisive figure within the KMT that has nevertheless maintained his control over the party leadership for over a decade. His rise to national prominence started shortly before the Xinhai Revolution in 1910 when he failed to assassinate the Qing Regent Zaifeng (Puyi's father), but became a sensationalized revolutionary hero while in captivity.\n\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution, Wang was released and his radical political writings became more famous. Though refusing to sign an oath of personal loyalty to Sun Yat-Sen after his refounding of the KMT, Wang would later become a member and a prominent official in the Guangdong government. Aligning himself with the growing left-radical factions of the KMT and the army’s ‘New Guard’, Wang outmaneuvered Hu Hanmin in 1925 to become Sun Yat-Sen’s successor.\n\nShortly afterwards, the Northern Expedition and the German Intervention shattered the Guangdong Government. Wang and the other radicals were immediately attacked by Sun Fo and other moderates for the failures of the expedition, but his control over party positions and personal alliances prevented his deposition.\nWang survives to this day by these factors, but he is highly aware that his future leadership rests on what happens in the next attempt at revolution.\n\nIn terms of personality, Wang Jingwei is a flamboyant, blustery character who is a natural orator. His penchant for wearing military uniforms when acting in a position as Commander-In-Chief makes many of his opponents see him as megalomaniacal, but he usually lets actual officers take the lead when it comes to military decisions. His insistence at maintaining an alliance with the Syndicalist powers is only surpassed by his desire to avoid another intervention by Germany or Japan at all costs until China is unified and ready to fight them."
POLITICS_CHI_SUN_FO_DESC:0 "The eldest son of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, Sun Fo has been a constant presence within the Kuomintang, though not always a prominent or powerful one. While respected because of his father, Sun Fo is not a charismatic or exceptional person himself. The centrist factions in the KMT that have come to be represented by him rely on his familial name and his 'iron neck' to keep their criticisms of the Minsheng program represented within the party's discourse. With control of the Nationalist Government returned to its moderate factions, Sun Fo is in the unenviable position of both having to reconcile with non-syndicalist powers while scaling back the social aspects of the National Revolution."
POLITICS_CHI_CHEN_DUXIU_DESC:0 "Chen Duxiu is an odd figure in the Kuomintang, as he is both an insider and outside to the party itself. While a member of the KMT, Chen is also the chairman of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, a heretofore minor player even within the syndicalist politics of urban China. The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. A prominent intellectual and Xinhai- era revolutionary, Chen's anti-traditionalist bent and background in Marxist theory colors his views of the future development of China."
POLITICS_CHI_HU_ZONGNAN_DESC:0 "Hu Zongnan was one of Chiang Kai-Shek's most trusted protegés and an exemplary young commander during the Northern Expedition. After the German Intervention, Hu's distrust of the dominant civilian factions and close friendship with Dai Chunfeng led him to resent the politically-motivated meddling by the Left KMT's leadership in matters of war. Hu's ties to both the NRA and the ZhongTeJu made him a critical figure in the growth of the bureau and the later success of Dai's coup against the civilian government. Because of his political indispensability and loyalty, Hu was appointed as Acting President for the duration of the \"state of emergency\" that Dai Chunfeng and the ZhongTeJu now govern through. While not an especially charismatic or skilled politican, he and Dai are close friends and his prominence ensures that the army maintains loyalty to the current regime."

The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. Fang is a dogmatic and charismatic leader who acts as an shaky bridge between the growing radical syndicalist movement and the order established by the KMT."

Facing him was a series malicious accusations by other officers, as well as his own subordinates, who blamed on him for not securing Guangzhou. Li retained his position in the Central Committee as several of his detractors went into exile abroad with their misgivings towards him alive and well. Despite his efforts to aid the leftist cadres and commanders trying to escape to the Commune of France, he was still being isolated and nominally assigned as the Chief of Army Staff in China. Inspired by agrarian movements and supported by Soong Ching-ling and Deng Yanda, he gathered the remnant of his forces, establishing Jiangxi-Fujian guerilla zone.

After the failure of the Northern Expedition however, Deng Yanda decided to cooperate with Wang Ching-wei.

In 1916, he was sent to the United States to study aircraft and submarines, and to observe the war in Europe. When the Northern Expedition broke out in 1926, Chen Shaokuan, who supported the revolution, turned his back on Sun Chuanfang and joined the National Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately, with the arrival of the German Navy, Chen Shaokuan had to abandon his ship and follow the Kuomintang central committee to exile in the Commune of France.

With virtually nonexistent infrastructure and few direct paths to the coast, the city of Nanchang and its surrounds are the planned terminus of the new Zhegan Railway, linking the city to Shanghai, opening up significant new markets and resources in the Chinese interior. Of particular interest to the Germans is the city of Jingdezhen, the porcelain from which has been able to fetch high prices in Berlin, along with other less-legitimate pursuits such as the stolen antiquities trade.

As a member of the brief Guangdong Provincial Assembly, formed in 1909, Chen quickly made a name for himself as a successful and enthusiastic, albeit radical, reformer, with his republican and anti-Qing leanings being an open secret to local officials.\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution began in 1911, Chen, as a member of the Revolutionary Alliance, became commander of the Guangdong Army and was instrumental in helping Sun Yat-sen of the KMT set up the Constitutional Protection Movement. However, the two men developed a fierce rivalry, having very different opinions on the future of China, which boiled over in 1922 when Chen revolted against Sun. Chen would be forced to surrender and flee after Sun's ships indiscriminately bombarded Guangzhou. The KMT's Central Committee never forgave Chen for his \"betrayal\", ensuring severe tension between the two most prominent republican movements in China.\nChen Jiongming returned to Guangdong after the failure of the Northern Expedition, which he had predicted, and he was quickly asked to become governor of the province once more. Through unprecedented cuts in military spending, Chen was not only able to rebuilt the province, devastated by a decade and a half of conflict, but make it one of the most prosperous despite the German's dubious concessions in the provincial capital.\nAs governor of Guangdong, Chen has been able to put his ideals into practice.

His division would participate in the failed Northern Expedition in 1926, with the Fourth Army decimated by the German intervention force. After a brief exile in Hong Kong, Chen returned to Guangdong, where he would reorganise the KMT remnants in the province under the auspice of Governor Chen Jiongming. With these remnants, he founded his own party, the Productive People's Party (ostensibly little more than a KMT front), participating in the province's burgeoning provincial democracy, supporting a shaky alliance with the Governor despite the latter being widely seen as a traitor by the KMT.\nChen Mingshu would prove to be an able politician, maintaining the KMT's presence in the southern province and ties with Soong Qingling's faction of the Party.

The Merchant Corps would ensure stability in the city through the Republican era and, later, increasing expropriation and mismanagement from the KMT rebels.\nChen Lianbo's Merchant Corps rose up against the KMT in 1924 in an attempt to overthrow them, but failed, and the remnants would flee to Hong Kong, where they would ally with Chen Jiongming's Federalists to preserve Guangdong's stability and autonomy.\nThe Merchant Corps, after the failure of the Northern Expedition, would work with both the Germans in Guangzhou and Chen Jiongming's provincial government, ensuring a Chinese presence and protection from both German encroachment in the city and increasingly radical reforms in Guangdong.

In 1925, Chen would return to lead the Guangdong Army against the KMT, but would be defeated and forced into exile. The Kuomintang was then defeated by the Zhili with German help, making Chen's earlier caution rather prophetic as he returned to a Guangdong sapped of its wealth.

Compliance with the Ottoman Caliphate was never fully embraced by the many Sufis in Tripolitania. The Weltkrieg broke the Senussi solidarity, and Ahmed Sharif fell out of favour to his cousin Idris, who was declared Al Mahdi as Senussi during the crisis. Thanks to an army raised by Ottoman General Nuri Killigil, Ahmed Sharif was able to oust Idris and force him into exile in Egypt. Italy's dissolution provided the prextext to invade Fezzan, and thus Ahmed Sharif became the first King of Tripolitania under Ottoman protection.

Ma Wanfu founded the Yihewani, a Hanafi Islamic fundamentalist sect that opposed the qabbalistic aspects of Suifsm. Ma Wanfu was made a pariah when he supported the Dugan revolt in 1895, and was forced into hiding for decades. Yang Zengxin arrested and attempted to humiliate Ma Wanfu before his execution in 1915, but Qinghai Governor Ma Qi rescued him, and boosted the Yihewani's power in Qinghai. Ma Qi made Ma Wanfu tutor Ma Bufang sternly, which it is rumored fostered an interior hatred for Ma Wanfu in Ma Bufang."

POLITICS_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "Emiliano Zapata, hero of the Mexican Revolution, achieved victory in Mexico's 1932 Presidential election. Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through political compromise, fostered closer diplomatic ties with the Commune of France. Zapata, however, faces strong opposition from other socialist factions, as well as remnants of the old regime."
POLITICS_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "General Plutarco Calles has seized control of the Mexican government. While the totalitarian and rabidly anti-clerical tone of Calles's rhetoric are typical of Mexican socialist politicians, his rejection of agrarianism and support for full integration of indigenous Mexicans could represent a radical new direction for Mexico if implemented."
POLITICS_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "Francisco 'Pancho' Villa's military victories against the armies of dictator Victoriano Huerta, such critical steps on the path to socialist revolution in Mexico, remain legendary in Mexico and abroad. Villa, while often at odds with Zapata, is similarly an agrarian socialist."
POLITICS_PABLO_GONZALEZ_GARZA_DESC:0 "General Pablo Gonzalez Garza was once a steadfast ally of former president Carranza. With the death of Carranza and the ascent of Alvaro Obregón to the Mexican presidency, he went into hiding, waiting for the opportune moment to cleanse his beloved Mexico of socialist corruption; with the success of a military coup in Mexico, he is poised to do just that."

POLITICS_STERNBERG_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', and officially referred to by his noble title, Darkhan Khoshoi Chin Wang in the degree of Khan, had a troubled upbringing, constantly moving and with a father who was committed to an insane asylum. His family estate in Estonia was burned down in 1905, which confirmed his anti-peasant and eventually anti-communist beliefs. He eventually joined Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg, where he became interested in the occult and buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia, where he became known for his heavy drinking and dangerous moods. In 1913 he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as and officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after not being allowed to fight for Mongolian independence. \n\nIn the First Weltkrieg, Ungern fought first in Galicia then, after a 2 month prison stint following attacking another officer in a drunken rage, in the Caucasus. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently against the communists. Ungern eventually travelled through China where he married Manchu Princess Ji. Eventually, he moved to Urga, and defeated the Chinese garrison stationed there, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne and proclaiming Mongolia independent. \n\nUngern himself did not get too involved in Mongol problems, but he kept the peace through force. After narrowly defeating a socialist revolution in 1921 and 1924, he was forced to get more involved. His forces prowled the streets as he hunted out dissidents and purged Mongolian society, including in temples. When the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu was brought to Urga in 1933, Ungern promised he would rule as regent until the boy came of age. However, with Ungern’s grip dependent on his russian military clique, there are fears he will keep the power for himself."
POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DESC:0 "Born in Chahar, Demchugdongrub was the only son of Namjil Wangchuk, Duoluo Duling Junwang of Sönid Right Banner and Chief of the Xilingol League. After the death of his father at only 6, Demchugdongrub inherited the title of Duoluo Duling Junwang. Under Yuan Shikai in 1912, he was promoted to the title of Jasagh Heshuo Duling Jinong. In Chahar he remained for many years, becoming a de facto leader of the province during the chaos following the end of the First Weltkrieg.\n\nDemchugdongrub didn't join Ungern-Sternberg's side until 1926, following Ungern's seizing of Chahar Province from the Guominjun. Ungern met Demchugdongrub in Chahar, and allowed him to keep his titles and to lead Chahar Province. Under Demchugdongrub, Chahar Province grew in military industry, and became far less rebellious against Ungern. In Chahar he remained for many years, funding Pan-Mongol movements throughout Inner Mongolia. In 1932, Demchugdongrub, with a number of other Inner Mongolian nobles, moved to Urga, to get more involved in its politics. Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Rebellion, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Yazgurtan Survaljtan, seized power. Now, Demchugdongrub's dream of a united Pan-Mongol state can be fully realised."
POLITICS_UNENBAYAN_DESC:0 "Much like many of the nobles who dominated Mongolian politics for many years, Ünenbayan was born in Inner Mongolia. Also known by his Chinese name, Wu Heling, he graduated from school in Chengde, and afterwards studied law in Peking University while also working at the Minister of Interior in the Beiyang government. There, he worked with Prince Gungsangnorbu of Harqin Right Banner at the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. After he graduated from university in 1926, he got more involved in Mongolian affairs, getting into contact with Prince Demchugdongrub and Yondonwangchug in Chahar. Eventually he decided to travel there, to work under Demchugdongrub in Chahar Province. Later, when Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga with many Chahar nobles, he left Ünenbayan there to effectively rule the autonomous province. He proved rather effective at this, only eventually leaving Chahar during the Western Rebellion, so that he could assist Demchugdongrub in Urga. Following the successful democratic revolution lead by the Mongol Ardīn Nam, Ünenbayan lobbied to stop the discrimination against the aristocrats of Urga. Being a younger man now in power of Mongolia, Ünenbayan sees an opportunity to mend the rift between the rich elite and the poor peasants, while defending the democracy that Mongolia has become."
POLITICS_7TH_CHANGKYA_KHUTUKHTU_DESC:0 "Born Lobsang Pelden Tenpe Dronme, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu is an extremely important figure in Mongolia. During the Qing Dynasty and the short lived Beiyang Government, the Changkya Khutukhtu’s were the head of the Gelug line of Tibetan Buddhism in Inner Mongolia. After Ungern-Sternberg took the province of Xilingol from the Guominjun, the 7th Changkya Khutuktu declared his loyalty to Ungern-Sternberg, and travelled to Urga to work in Gandantegchinlen Monastery. After regularly holding speeches outside of the monastery, he became a very popular and important figure in Urga.\n\nHowever, his intentions changed in 1930. Ungern-Sternberg, after a small peasant rebellion in Urga, blamed multiple high ranking lamas, and purged them. This caused massive uproar in the highly buddhist society, especially in the upper echelons. The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu therefore decided to form the Buddyn Zövlöl, a secretive group of high ranking lamas who lobbied for increased theocracy in Mongolian society. After the Western Rebellion, the Buddyn Zövlöl were able to seize power, and fully begin to implement their plan to reform Mongolian society to a Gelug Buddhist centre."
POLITICS_JAMSRANGIIN_TSEVEEN_DESC:0 "A central figure in Mongolian politics, Jamsrangiin Tseveen was born in Transbaikal during the Russian Empire. He went to a Buryat private school in St. Petersburg, and eventually began visiting Buryat tribes in Irkutsk. In 1902, he became an auditor at St. Petersburg University. While there, he went on many research trips across Transbaikal and Outher Mongolia. After a few years he began to teach Mongolian Language there, and also visited Inner Mongolia and Ordos. When the Bogd Khaanate became independent in 1911, Tseveen supervisied a secular Russian school there and was editor for two newspapers, the Shine toli and Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig.\n\nAfter Mongolia was occupied by Xu Shuzheng in 1919, Tseveen became a professor at Irkutsk University. He also travelled around the area and met with many discontent Mongolias, who eventually founded the Mongol Ardīn Nam. At their founding congress in 1921, Tseveen wrote the Ten Aspirations, the party’s platform. Following their failed revolution in 1921, Tseveen went into hiding in Transbaikal, helping continue to organise the MAN. After the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, Tseveen helped rally Buryat rebels in joining the MAN rebels in once again trying to overthrow Unger-Sternberg. After this failure and the death of their leader, Damdin Sükhbaatar, the MAN went back into hiding. Since then, Tseveen has travelled across the more empty regions of Mongolia, educating the people and conducting research.\n\nFollowing the Western Rebellion and the MAN takeover, Tseveen began to see the problems in the party. Over the years he grew more disillusioned with the more radical elements of the party, and saw it as corrupt. Following a power struggle in the party, Tseveen created the Mongol Libyeral Nam, as an opposition to the MAN."
POLITICS_SOLIIN_DANZAN_DESC:0 "As a young man, revolutionary Soliin Danzan was a living as a horse thief, poor and struggle to survive. He lived like this for many years, until he went to Urga to work as a customs official in the Ministry of Finance. In 1919, he, Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, and Damdin Sükhbaatar formed the nationalist group Züün Khüree, which later merged with the Konsulyn Denj group, led by Dogsomyn Bodoo. For a few years after this, the MAN worked with Russian bolsheviks in trying to take over Mongolia. This culminated in the 1921 revolution against Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, which barely failed. Danzan went into hiding after this, as did the rest of the MAN. Danzan was one of the key organisers of the 1924 revolution, another failed mission which led to the death of Sükhbaatar. Following a dangerous power struggle with Dambym Chagdarjav and Dogsomyn Bodoo, Danzan became chairman of the party, once again in hiding. For the years since, Danzan helped push the MAN to a more nationalistic and less bolshevik group, completely disavowing from the failed bolsheviks from Russia.\n\nAfter the Western Rebellion in 1936, Soliin Danzan and the MAN were able to seize power, finally allowing him to implement his policies. However, there are still many threats to his rule. The party is still very split, with power hungry members ready to strike. Also, the introduction of democracy, though something the party promises, could be a threat to the party’s rule."

Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga in 1932 with Altanochir, and got quickly involved in its politics.

He had never expected to see mutiny from his own ranks, never expected to see the red flag rising on top of fair Paris, and he had never expected to flee from France in a beat-up old steamboat to Algiers. The French National State is less than a shadow of the glory of the Republic of France that stood before, but something still lived in the hearts of the Marshal and all of those that lived in this France, and that was the insatiable desire for revenge and a return to their homeland.

Born in Belgium, his family fled to England shortly after his birth, before fleeing further to Switzerland after the British revolution. This allowed him to join the French army, where he quickly rose through the ranks during the war thanks to his heroic deeds, followed by our people with bated breath. Napoleon VI Bonaparte is now the symbol of a France renewed.

Tribhuvan, however, was born king in name only, in reality, the boy-king was nothing more than a figurehead for the powerful Rana family. As he has grown into a man, Nepalese politics have become increasingly defined by the antagonistic relationship between the king and the Ranas. Time alone will reveal the victor of the struggle both politically and economically."

## Nicaragua ##
POLITICS_AUGUSTO_CESAR_SANDINO_DESC:0 "Sandino's emergence as a minor guerilla leader fighting in the 1926 Liberal Revolution was completely unexpected, with his presence not really being noted until the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro, which he disagreed with. Beginning with a small guerrilla force of 300 fighting in the south, he intensely fought in the jungles, slowly weakening the United States Marines. However, he kept being pushed further and further south until he was forced to leave his force with Francisco Sequeira Moreno and retreat to Mexico. There, he met with socialist leaders such as Zapata and became known in the international community. He also became a member of the EMECU, a spiritualist organisation which believed in the founding of a universal commune under god. Returning to Nicaragua in 1931 with Zapata coming along, many rallied to his side and his forces grew bigger than ever, until he and his men managed to liberate Managua in January of 1932, forcing the United States to retreat. Now slowly gaining a mass following, his presidency is loved by many with some even going as far as to create groups in his name to promote him and his rule."
POLITICS_FRANCISCO_SEQUEIRA_MORENO_DESC:0 "Francisco Sequeira Moreno was born into a poor family like much of the families of Nicaragua, and has spent the majority of his life illiterate. Following the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro between the 'Liberal' revolutionaries and the United States, he emerged as a guerrilla leader fighting within the north of Nicaragua. Him and his regiment of 400 men killed many, but were forced to retreat south and fight on with Sandino. While Sandino was in Mexico, he bravely fought in in the south against the United States occupation until Sandino returned, and became one of the leaders in the push northward and the eventual liberation of Managua. Once the revolution ended, he ended up forming his own party known as the 'Partido Campesino de Nicaragua', focused on rights for the lower class and improving the education system. While also learning how to read starting in 1932(Something he still struggles with), he is an adored individual among many of the Nicaraguan lower class."
POLITICS_JUAN_BAUTISTA_SACASA_DESC:0 "Juan Bautista Sacasa was Vice-President of former president Carlos José Solórzano until he was overthrown in a coup by former president Emiliano Chamorro Vargas. After Adolfo Díaz rebelled, he was sworn in as president by Liberal revolutionaries in the south led by José María Moncada Tapia and assisted in the liberation of Managua. However, after the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro, he stepped down as president due to his disliking of United States influence and went back to exile in Mexico. Serving mainly as an observer in Sandino's revolution, he decided to return to Nicaragua around the same time as Sandino and was present for the liberation of Managua. With him and Sandino finding themselves agreeing on basic principles, Sacasa was able to form his own party known as the 'Partido de la Revolución Liberal'. Mainly supported by those who prefer traditional democracy compared to Socialist and the small higher class, he has surprisingly managed to gain a decent base of support and some dedicated followers of his cause."
POLITICS_ELILIANO_CHAMORRO_VARGAS_DESC:0 "Serving as President from 1917-1921, Vargas is a military man with an extremely controversial reputation. Initially supported by the United States in his first presidency and helping to negotiate a treaty that allowed the United States to build a canal through Nicaragua. His presidency was largely looked over besides succeeding to pay off a significannot portion of Nicaragua's debts. However, despite his efforts, he failed to win the presidency in 1923. Following the 1926 election of Carlos José Solórzano, he couped the government, setting off the chain of events that led to Sandino's government. For this, some credit him as the beginning of the revolution while others discredit him as power hungry. All that matters now however is that his dream of returning to the presidency has finally come true."
POLITICS_ADOLFO_DIAZ_DESC:0 "Adolfo Díaz has been one of the main targets of a smear campaign from Sandino, and for not entirely wrong reasons. Helping put down liberal president José Santos Zelaya in 1910, he was sworn in as president with much help from the United States. Leading the presidency first from 1911-1917, he was the definition of an American puppet furthering the goals of American companies like the Tonopah Mining Company. In 1914, he suffered a liberal revolt which one part in many long years of the 30 year long US military occupation, with marines being forced to suppress the revolt. These marines stayed in Nicaragua for over a decade to keep order while also giving the US permission to build a Nicaraguan canal. However, after Chamarro's coup in 1926, the 2nd Marine occupation force swore him in as president. His attempts to suppress unrest failed, and he was forced to concede for new president José María Moncada. Ever since he lived in the US, until now. A foreign force has occupied the country, and he is once again needed to suppress the unrest that plagues the region."
POLITICS_ANASTASIO_SOMOZA_GARCIA_DESC:0 "Somoza started a humble life in Nicaragua like many others, gaining the rare opportunity to go to business school in Philadelphia, and there he married his future wife Salvadora Debayle Sacasa, niece of Juan Bautista Sacasa. From there he was able to work his way up the ladder until the liberal revolution in 1926. Unremarkable overall in battle, his real attention getter was his excellent English from America itself, working as the broker of peace between the liberal rebels and Americans. From there he managed to get further relations with the Americans, joining the newly formed Guardia Nacional until just before the expulsion of the Americans, he was named head of the organisation. However, once Sandino reached the capital, he was forced to retreat to Honduras who accepted him and the leftover of the Guardia with open arms. To his dismay, Juan Bautista Sacasa due to joining the Sandino regime forced his wife to divorce him. Wishing to reclaim his homeland and his wife, he has finally succeeded in his goals."

Despite being respected and supported by the Norwegian people, and his declaration in 1928 that he is also the king of the syndicalists, this republican movement renders Haakon's position all but secure."

During this period, he contributed to several humanitarian projects, but was horrified by the syndicalist revolutions which erupted over all over Western Europe. Returning home to Norway, he saw the rising popularity of socialist parties. Determined to prevent his beloved country from falling into the hands of the Reds, he founded the Nasjonal Samling in 1933, a populist nationalist organization which split into two factions, a reactionary one more favorable to the monarchy and a populist one calling for Germanic morality and replacing the decadent monarchy with Quisling as the Fører. After the Socialists' victory in the 1936 election, Quisling was compelled to intervene to save Norway. Now wielding the power necessary to restore Greater Norway, Quisling and his people look forward to a radiant future."

## Palestine ##
POLITICS_RAGHIB_DESC:0 "The rival of the Husayni family for decades, Raghib was a student of Istanbul University until the end of the Weltkrieg. Upon returning to Jerusalem, he saw that the Husayni family's aim for an independent Palestine was based on a conflicting promises and antisemitism. Although he himself was Muslim, he believed that the prevailing Palestinian nationalism would be hijacked by a foreign power. Thus, Raghib established his own branch of the Watani party in Jerusalem to counter this movement and the Husayni ambition."
POLITICS_AWNI_DESC:0 "A member of the Al Fatat since before the Great War, Awni assisted in the relief efforts in the Jordan Valley during the Officers Revolt of 1918. While other groups in the Jerusalem Vilyet rallied in the streets, Awni ensured that Yildirim never uncovered the Al Fatat members in Palestine. Now Awni finds himself in control of a vastly unprepared nation that barely knew of his work in the struggle for independence."
POLITICS_MUSA_AL_ALAMI_DESC:0 "Musa Al Alami was the son of the Mayor of Jerusalem, Faidi al-Alami. His upbringing in Jerusalem where Jewish and Muslim converge geve him an appreciation for a government that expedites trade and promotes economic prosperity. The waning power of the Ottomans made his continued allegiance to them impractical to these goals, so in 1926 Musa established Al-tanmiat to prepare cooperation with Zionist groups. Non-aggression agreements were honoured, and subsequent votes propelled Musa into office."
POLITICS_MUFTI_DESC:0 "The son of Jerusalem's mufti and a mortal enemy of the Nashashibi clan, Amin was always quick to deal. The Husayni family's ongoing anti-Zionist position was on the decline until Abraham Antebi was arrested by the Turks. Then sentiment began to turn in Amin's favour. Through deal making in Syria, Amin was able to provide homes for survivors of the 1918 Officers Revolt. The return of Antebi proved to be another boon, as the Yildirim that accompanied Antebi began a campaign to destroy all political dissident in Palestine. Arabs in Palestine flocked to Amin, and he continued to make deals on their behalf all the way into office."
POLITICS_ANTEBI_DESC:0 "Albert Antebi spent the first 40 years of his life trying to mediate the Muslim Jewish divide in the Jerusalem Vilyet. When the Jewish Colonisation Association told him to buy land in Jerusalem for Jewish settlements, he always paid the Arab landowners a fair price. His goal of a peaceful creation of Israel was destroyed when he joined Mustafa Kemal in the Caucasus. After nearly dying in an Istanbul prison, Antebi was released as a bargaining chip of the Yildirm Army Group. He was given the ceremonial title of General Governor of Palestine, the first Jew to be honoured by the Ottomans in centuries, and held in Turkish custody as a virtual prisoner."
POLITICS_HILUPAL_DESC:0 "Radwan became General Secretary of the Palestine Arab Workers Society after the Third Internationale voted for and funded it's reestablishment. Before this, the PAWS was in severe danger of bankruptcy in Jerusalem, as the Yildirim had seized their assets following the return of Antebi. Radwan has suggested to the Internationale that the Yildirim would crumble without Antebi if he were to disappear. This became unnecessary as he died along with the Yildirim Officers in the liberation of the Near East."

He graduated military school in 1906 and was sent to France to take part in their manoeuvring exercises. On his return to Perú in 1910, he became involved in the 'Campaña del Caqueta', which allowed him to climb through the ranks until becoming Chief of Staff in 1913. In 1914 he joined the coup against President Billinghurst, becoming provisional president until 1915, where he called for elections after securing stability. He was then sent to Europe as an observer during the Weltkrieg, but resigned his post when Leguía couped the democratic government.\n\nLeguía was quick to react to Benavidez return, imprisoning him and sending him along with other political prisoners to exile. However, Benavidez managed to organize a successful mutiny in the ship that transported them, escaping to Central America, where he'd support Sanchez Cerro's uprising and later taking an important role in Sanchez Cerro's government.\n\nWith Sanchez Cerro's death, Benavidez took advantage of the anarchy that ensued and became Cerro's successor, suspending elections and becoming Perú's new Caudillo. Benavides has adopted the motto 'Order, Peace and Work', rewarding generously displays of loyalty and punishing severely any display of dissent..."
POLITICS_VILLARAN_DESC:0 "Manuel Vicente Villarán Godoy was born in 1873 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated with a PhD in jurisprudence in 1895 from the 'Universidad San Marcos'. He became a teacher in that same university and would return to his educative role many times during his political career. He was named Minster of Justice, Cult and Instruction during President Leguía's first regime, and would become an active member of Peruvian politics until Leguia's coup in 1919. He was chosen as Principal for the San Marcos University, but rejected his position in protest of Leguia's takeover, and began writing three Manifestos, all of them praising the youthful fighting spirit of his students and warning of the danger that entailed having a Caudillo leading Perú. He was exiled in 1925, but would return in 1927, trying to stay away from politics. During Sanchez Cerro's government, he took part in the subsequent constitutional reforms, although he didn't defend some points that the new constitution brought up. Now that he's president of Perú, he'll take a pragmatic approach to the issues Perú faces, trying to compromise with the UR and focusing on investing in better services and education for the nation."
POLITICS_JOSE_DE_LA_RIVA_DESC:0 "Jose de la Riva Agüero y Osma was born in 1885 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. The grandson of the first Peruvian president, José de la Riva Agüero y Sanchez-Boquete, he graduated from the 'Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature, philosophy and law, and managed to get a PhD in jurisprudence in 1911. His first political move was to write an article criticizing Leguía's government in that same year, for which he was arrested, triggering the first ever student protest in the history of Perú, which demanded Agüero's release. Agüero was released, where he became a teacher in San Marcos, but when Leguia took over the government in 1919, Agüero wrote a manifesto defending the constitutional order and left in a self-imposed exile towards Europe.\n\nThat travel to Europe changed him, as he was forced to witness the European recovery from the Weltkrieg, as well as the Syndicalist uprisings. It's in these circumstances that he meets D'Annunzio and Italo Balbo, whose far-right philosophy began influencing the once liberal Agüero. He returns in 1927 to Peru, after Cerro deposed Leguia, and began working as a history professor at the 'Pontificia Universidad Catolica'. He at first saw in Cerro just another dictator, but a meeting he had with the Caudillo changed his mind, as his experience in Europe and relation with thinkers like D'Annunzio and Carlés quickly turned him into a friend and close advisor of Sanchez Cerro. Although the hispanist ideals Agüero had were too extreme for Cerro, he was named head of ministers. With Cerro's death, he became his legal successor in the UR, although Benavides took over the real power upon his death. Now that Agüero is in power, he'll try to take Perú in a radical new direction and return the old glory of the Virreynato back to Perú"
POLITICS_EGUIGUREN_DESC:0 "Luis Antonio Eguiguren was born in 1887 in the small town of Piura, Perú. He graduated as bachelor in literature and jurisprudence in 1913 and in Political Science and Administration in 1914. In 1930 he became the Mayor of Lima, but resigned a year later after discrepancies regarding the autonomy of the city's Instruction ministry, and his differences regarding Benavides's Autocratic rule. He left to Ecuador in a self-imposed exile after death-threats towards his family from radical UR members, only to return after Benavides gave signs of wanting to restore democracy to Perú, where the contacts he had gained him a place in the Partido Socialdemocrata. Now that he's President of Perú, he'll do his best to bring peacefully a welfare-system into Perú, trying to compromise with the APRA and the other democratic parties wherever possible."
POLITICS_UGARTECHE_DESC:0 "Jorge Prado Ugarteche was born was born in 1887 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. Son of Mariano Ignacio Prado, who was President of Perú twice in his life, Jorge studied in Law in the 'Universidad de San Marcos' from 1904 to 1909, and then joined the military academy after graduating, becoming lieutenant by 1914. He joined with his brothers to the Partido Civil in 1914, where they helped in the coup d’état that overthrew President Billinghurst. He would later become deputy for the Dos de Mayo province, but would be exiled with his brothers for opposing Leguia's regime.\n\nAfter the assassination of Sanchez Cerro, Benavides, who was a childhood friend of Jorge, recalled him from exile in order to help him in his rule. Jorge began a reform to free political prisoners and recall political exiles that were punished by Sanchez Cerro and Leguia's regimes. However, Ugarteche would be forced to resign due to internal pressure, and Jose de la Riva Agüero would take his place, reinstating the hardline policies against detractors of the regime. Disillusioned with Benavides regime, he formed the Movimiento Democratico with the support of his brothers. Now that Jorge has managed to become President, his belief in the free-market and pro-entente leanings will surely lead to a liberalisation of the Peruvian economy, ushering in a new era of economic prosperity to the nation."

He signed up for 'Facultad de Letras de la Universidad de Trujillo' when he finished high-school, but would later decide to study to become a Lawyer in the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in Lima. There he met Manuel Gonzalez Prada, whose anarchist thoughts influenced the young Raul. He joined several protests against the Leguia regime, which would decide to get rid of him by granting him a scholarship to France. However, this move would backfire on Leguia, as the revolutions in Europe would influence young Raul and his friend, Mariategui, towards Syndicalist ideals.\n\nHe would go to Mexico in 1924, and with other Peruvian syndicalist exiles formed the 'Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana' or 'APRA'. The APRA would focus on pan-Americanism (or as Raul liked to call it, 'Indo-Americanism') and fighting imperialism and the burgois oligarchy that had settled in the continent. He'd return to Perú in 1925, settling in the north of the country with his fellow Apristas. In 1929, Raul led the Trujillo takeover, when APRA forces took over the city and proclaimed a Trujillan commune that would be lead by Raul, and executing the local garrison. When the revolt was crushed, he managed to escape to Chile, where he'd join forces with Churata and González Prada in order to strengthen the APRA for a new revolution in 1931.\n\nNow that Raul Haya de la Torre leads Perú, he'll bring about his dream of a worker's utopia for Perú, whatever the cost may be."
POLITICS_CHURATA_DESC:0 "Gamaliel Churata, whose real name is Arturo Pablo Peralta Miranda, was born in 1897 in Puno, Perú. Churata formed several culturalist groups in his youth, through which he met Manuel González Prada, Raul Haya de la Torre, and most importantly, José Carlos Mariategui, who would become a close friend of Churata. He was exiled to Bolivia in 1917, but would return to Perú in 1925, joining up Mariategui in Moquegua as the first group of left-wing indigenist thinkers was formed. When Mariategui finally died in 1930 in Chile, Churata was appointed by his friend in his dying wishes as the leader of the 'Frente Tupacamarista'. In his new role as leader, he'd later gather in 1931 with Raul Haya de la Torre and Alfredo González Prada in order to form a United Front from which bring about the Peruvian revolution. Now that Churata leads Perú, he'll focus on restoring the Andinean cultural identity and purge the Spanish-descendant bourgeoisie from the government, bringing about a new culture and society for the now new country of Piruw."

The son of known Peruvian anarchist Manuel González Prada, he'd graduate from the 'Universidad San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature in 1910, and would later graduate as a bachelor in Jurisprudence, later achieving a PhD on said career. In 1919, Prada would become the intellectual leader of the newly formed 'Frente Armado Obrero', which would fight for better working rights in its most moderate form and for an outright revolution in its more radical members. Seeing the violence this group generated in Lima, Leguia decided to send the military to suppress the movement, ending the first Peruvian Syndicalist experiment. He then decided to retire from public life temporarily, gathering with other anarchists in Peru until the failed Trujillo rebellion forced him to go to Chile. There he joined forces in 1931 with Raúl Haya de la Torre and Gamaliel Churata with the goal of bringing the revolution to Perú. A staunch believer of Anarchism, now that Prada is in power, he will focus on bringing about his father's vision for a descentralized and free Perú."

Now that Miró-Quesada is in power, he's bound to continue the status-quo Agüero created and keep working forward for Agüero's vision of a glorious Hispanic Perú."
POLITICS_FLORES_DESC:0 "Luis Alberto Flores Medina was born in 1899 in the small town of Ayabaca, Perú. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in the late 1910's. He staunchly opposed the government of Augusto B. Leguía, for Flores would be imprisoned. He was freed after a decree by Sanchez Cerro, quickly gaining Flores's loyalty, who joined the Union Revolucionaria soon after. He accompanied Sanchez Cerro in his tour through Arequipa, Puno, Cusco and Ica, and would later become deputy for the UR. After the resign of Francisco Lanatta, Flores becomes the president of the council of ministers. During his time as president of the council, the crews of the Peruvian navy ships 'Almirante Grau' and 'Coronel Bolognesi' mutinied with apparent APRA influence. While Flores didn't believe the crews deserved the death penalty, the martial court determined they were traitors and had to die, so he came to the island of San Lorenzo with the prisoners, where he'd lead the execution personally. It is said that Flores himself forced each sailor to dig his own grave before being shot, earning him a reputation for cruelty in the UR.\n\nFlores became a close follower of Agüero, although he considered the latter to be too conservative in his approach against the APRA. Now that Flores is in power, he'll bring about his vision for a corporatist and totalitarian Perú, free from the influence of the decadent APRA which he'll hunt down relentlessly. However, his rejection of all races outside of the Spanish-descendant Criollos is bound to shine through in his policies, and might upset the local native and Asian population..."

After beginning studies in the Escuela Superior de Guerra, he'd be sent to Italy and France to perfect his ability as an artillery officer. A decorated officer, he joined the UR due to his ultra-conservative views and admiration for Agüero, even if they both had their differences.

He continued perfecting his military ability throughout his career, taking an important role in the war against Ecuador, but he never truly prepared to be a politician. As such, now that he's in power, he'll seek to restore the Peruvian democracy, but not before restoring stability to the country and enacting laws to prevent future Caudillismo.

POLITICS_BUSTIOS_DESC:0 "Reynaldo Chukiwanka Ayulo Choquehuanca, better known by his regnal name, Pachacutec II, was born in 1914 in Lampa, Puno Province, Perú. The son of Francisco Chukiwanka Ayulo and considered one of the descendants of the Incan emperor, Huayna Capac, he has taken advantage of his father's popularity to rally the Indians to his cause. His father graduated as a lawyer in 1908 from the 'Universidad de Arequipa' and would go to Puno, Perú, where he began fighting for better rights for natives and created an alphabet in which natives could write Aymara, Quechua and Spanish, helping the native population to improve its literacy rates as these languages conflicted with the latin alphabet. Reynaldo became involved in French émigré circles and was influenced by the writings of Charles Maurras. Seeing the government mistreating the native populations, Reynaldo took over his father's institutions and began going from village to village rallying the natives for an insurrection to finally be free of the Criollo oppression."

POLITICS_DUARTE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "As agreed in the Pact of Dover signed by royalists in exile before the Restoration, Duarte II inherited the throne from the heirless Manuel II. Since he was crowned in 1932, King Duarte has looked to strengthen ties with the Brazilian Imperial Family and with the British in exile in Canada, while at home keeping an amenable relationship with the Integralists, who fully control his government; a situation he will seek to change if possible."
POLITICS_MARIA_ADLEAIDE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "Having taken up the crown after the second Regicide in 30 years, Maria III has dauting tasks ahead of her. The young Queen has always been popular when she was a princess, always looking to help people in need whenever possible. Her gentle and good demeanour may make her aggressive anti Integralist position seem surprising, but since taking the throne she has denounced excesses from that party, and her fearless attitude only helps her popularity"
POLITICS_MARIA_PUPPET_DESC:0 "As the recently installed Queen of Portugal and the Algarves, Maria Ana I seems content in her role of doing little actual ruling. Her priority is ensuring the preservation of the Monarchy and in restoring ties with the deposed royal family. Her husband's German nationality, once a liability that essentially locked her out of inheritance, may very well help in this endeavour"
POLITICS_ALEXANDRE_VIEIRA_DESC:0 "Alexandre Vieira is perhaps Portugal's most prestigious and respected leftist leader, which a marked and distinguished career dating back to the early years of the Republic. After being forced into exile in France after the Integralist takeover in 1926, said respect and former contacts, especially among anarchists and syndicalists, may be key to forming a stable coalition as the dust settles from the fall of the monarchy"
POLITICS_JOSE_CARLOS_RATES_DESC:0 "A veteran in the harsh struggle for Portugal's workers, Jose Carlos Rates entered the political scene in the first years of the republic as a syndicalist leader; however one that strayed far from the anarchist mainstream of Portuguese Syndicalists. Founder of the Portuguese Maximalist Federation, Rates believes in cooperating against imperalism in a wide front, but will likely have issues implementing Totalism in Portugal"
POLITICS_BENTO_ANTONIO_GONCALVES_DESC:0 "Bento is a long-time syndical leader, entering the political arena in the waning years of the Weltkrieg as the conditions for Portuguese workers worsened. As syndicalist repression grew, in 1925 he was forced to flee Portugal after a failed strike, which sought to emulate the English Revolution in Portuguese soil. Now returned after decades of exile, Bento has the daunting task of recovering Portugal ahead of him"
POLITICS_ANTONIO_RESENDE_DESC:0 "A staunch republican, Antonio was aggressive in its attacks against the restoration in 1922, which forced him into exile after he allegedly advocated for regicide, an accusation he to this day claims to be false. Exile has not been kind to public memory of the Porto politician, but no leadership arose in the PRED that can claim his ideological intensity or credibility, even as he is thankful for those who kept the flame of Republicanism alive in these dark years"
POLITICS_AFONSO_COSTA_DESC:0 "A leading figure in the First Republic, Afonso Costa has been long been deeply involved with the republican cause in Portugal, and he was one of the architects of that first revolution. The last leader of the former Republic, his prestige was kept intact even after decades of exile in multiple countries, and there is hope that this republic learns from the mistakes of the past. However, the man's advanced age and failling health may very well put said plans in jeopardy"
POLITICS_ANTONIO_GRANJO_DESC:0 "Antonio's current leadership of Portuguese Liberal Republicans very well stems for his actions, for he was one of the few who actively attempted to stop the Restoration by taking up arms and urging others to do the same. The years in exile have not been kind to the politician, whose sexagenarian appearance may very well be unfamiliar to those used to the image of the man who attempted to defend the Republic."
POLITICS_JOAO_CANTO_CASTRO_DESC:0 "The aging admiral's beliefs may seem paradoxical to foreigners, as he has far more in common with monarchists than republicans in Portugal's political arena.

With day-to-day governance largely handled by the civil government in Beijing, he has spend the last decade idly sitting in the Forbidden City, occupying his days with tennis matches and calligraphy.

POLITICS_PUYI_RESTORED_DESC:0 "Restored following what has now been deemed the Manchu Coup, Aisin-Gioro Puyi now sits at the helm of a government scrubbed clear of warlord influences. While some observers fear a return to traditionalism, the new Qing government seems to push for a much more modern style of rule. Puyi himself still lacks much power, but this is of his own design. Fearing a tyrannical descendant of the same type that doomed his predecessors, the Emperor and legal scholars have drafted a constitutional structure of monarchy where Puyi exercises spiritual and patriotic power while only having an advisory role in legislature and day-to-day governing. While this new structure of government is untested, it seems strong, and many in China and around the world are hoping Puyi can lead the nation into this brave new world."
POLITICS_PUYI_RESTORED__YIGUANDAO_DESC:0 "While many around China and the world hoped that the so-called Manchu Coup would restore some semblance of constitutional monarchy to China, the scheming machinations of Honored Teacher Zhang Tianran have buried any and all aspirations for modern imperial rule. With religious devotees rapidly filling all governmental posts and seizing control of the military, Puyi has been pushed back into a position of irrelevance, now answering to the beck and call of a religious cult rather than a military clique. His role remains relatively unchanged from the days of Wu Peifu, only now with more obscure religious rituals and less military reviews. Puyi himself seems to not mind very much, having completely fallen under the sway of the teachings of Zhang and the Yiguandao."
POLITICS_WU_PEIFU_DESC:0 "Narrowly escaping death at the hands of Puyi, Pujie, and the other Manchu noblemen who plotted to overthrow the Zhili clique, Wu Peifu has now dropped any facade of Imperial rule over China. Naming himself ‘interim head of the nation’, he is now tasked with building a legitimate system of government for his nation. A military man for his entire life, Wu is not expected to remain in power for long, and transfer control of the country to a hand-picked successor."
POLITICS_HU_SHIH_DESC:0 "A political philosopher and intellectual, Hu Shih may seem like an odd choice for first president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’. Yet the political philosophy he developed, ‘pragmatism’, was deeply influential to Wu Peifu during the years immediately following the restoration of the Qing, and the two frequently met in Hu’s office at Peking University, discussing how both men, former republicans, could and should dedicate themselves to the imperial project as the ‘least bad’ option for China. But with the Manchu’s tyranny revealed, Wu has selected Hu to lead the new government, hoping that the philosopher’s writings and public persona can lend an air of legitimacy to a government seen by most as a sham and a front for the Zhili clique."

Following the collapse of the Republic of China in 1916 he aligned himself with Feng Guozhang’s Zhili clique, and following Feng’s death in 1919 he rose to dominate the clique, leading it to victory over its main rival, the Fengian clique, in 1928, despite being betrayed by his former ally Feng Yuxiang. During these turbulent years he was mentored by Cao Kun, former and future president of the Assembly, who taught him the intriguing and scheming skills he used to seize control over the government. Although opposed to the reimposition of the Manchu monarchy by Germany, Wu has quickly adapted the Zhili clique to China’s new governmental structure, sidelining the Manchu and ensuring that he and his allies dominated nearly every facet of government. A token opposition was allowed to exist, but Wu truly controls the government.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nWu reportedly owns the world's largest diamond, but has refused to allow anyone to verify this claim.\nWas once renowned for hang a photograph of George Washington behind his desk, but due to the ongoing political turmoil in the United States he has replaced this with a photograph of Bismarck.

He studied in Japan, returning in 1910 for a brief stint in governance before going abroad again, this time to Germany. He served in Yuan Shikai’s government before he declared himself emperor, a decision Jiang strongly opposed. Following the collapse of Yuan’s ‘Empire’, he began working with Wu Peifu, becoming a close confidant and assisting him in defeating the Fengtian clique in 1928. He has become a close ally of Wu, and has spent most of the early 1930’s attempting to prepare the country against the threat of Japanese invasion, something he sees as an inevitability.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nSkilled military theorist, and has written several works on defensive strategy, though several have criticised him of stealing ideas from his subordinates."

Wang left his family and joined the military at a young age, helping suppress revolts in 1905 and becoming a confidante of Yuan Shikai. When Shikai’s restoration fell apart, Wang allied himself with the Zhili clique, becoming a close confidante of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. Though he nominally commands several divisions of troops under the Qing command structure, he essentially uses these armies as thuggish extortionists, demanding outrageous 'protection' fees from towns near his troops garrisons.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nKnown affectionetly as the 'toilet general' by his troops. There are two theories for this unique monicker: The first is that he loves his own toilet so much he orders it to be carried with him on campign at all times, where it served as a makeshift standard. In one story of dubious veracity, he launched an attack on a mountain fortification sitting atop his toilet, stamped with the Chinese character for 'Wang'. His troops faltered once the toilet vanished in the chaos of battle, but Wang and his men lifted the toilet aloft, ralling his troops and (supposedly) inspiring them to climb up a sheer cliff and sieze the bastion. Furthermore, he apparenty even uses a toilet in lieu of an office chair at his desk. The second (and more plausible) explanation for the nickname is that his troops are unwashed and smell like toilets, as Wang believes peasant soldiers taken right from the fields are more honest and loyal."

Appointed head of the Imperial Guard upon his return, Zaitao served until 1912, when Puyi was overthrown. Briefly restored to the position in 1917, he was immediately removed once Zhang Xun’s restoration attempt failed. He finally returned to the post in 1927 with the German re-imposition of Puyi to the throne. One of the founding members of the Manchu Party, Zaitao is more open to reform than most older Manchu nobility, having travelled around the world extensively in his youth.

A well-known incident recounted how Puyi threw a tantrum when he saw that the inner lining of one of Pujie's coats was yellow, because yellow was traditionally a colour reserved only for the emperor. Following the Restoration in 1927, Pujie attended university in Berlin, where he was given the nickname 'Peter' by his classmates, as they found Pujie too difficult to pronounce. Despite growing up in the shadow of his brother, Pujie rarely envied the Emperor, who was confined to pointless ceremonial duties and lacked much of an education beyond court formalities. Pujie, on the other hand, was exposed to the latest Western science, education, and culture. Dismayed by the moral laxness he found in Germany that sprung up following the horrors of the Weltkrieg, he returned to China impressed by Western science and industry, but wary of the libertine culture flourishing in Berlin. Furthermore, he was dismayed at the level of German control over the country, and especially despised the Zhili clique, whom he viewed as essentially holding his brother hostage. Largely resigned to a ceremonial position within the military, he plots to one day help his brother return to the rightful position on the throne, with him serving as a ‘guiding hand’, of course.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe has not married, despite rampant suspicion that the Emperor is infertile."

Interested in engineering as a child, Runqi entered adolescence as the German intervention in China reached its zenith. One of his most distinctive childhood memories was attending the wedding of his sister Wanrong to the exiled Emperor in the Tianjin concession at the age of 10. After the German intervention placed his brother-in-law back on the throne, Runqi learned German from the horde of businessmen and military attaches that descended on Beijing in the economic boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s. This culminated in him attending the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin, where he picked up the German name ‘Ruprecht’. Returning to China in 1935 following a tour of Europe, Runqi developed a fascination with armored warfare and mechanization, inspired Heinz Guderian, an instructor at the Akademie. He is somewhat more sympathetic to the Germans than other Manchu, but the decadence and moral laxness he observed in Berlin during the boom years of the late 1920s and early 30s prevented him from becoming a full Germanophile.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nIn Berlin he became obsessed wih American cinema, and he introduced the genre to his brother-in-law, the Emperor, also a fan of cinema in general.\nHas quite the media presence, and his dalliances with various Beijing opera singers have made him a favorite of tabloids."

He consolidated his rule over the province, and helped organize the ‘Hubei Generals’, an informal group of textile manufacturers, the main industry of Hubei. He narrowly survived an assassination attempt in 1926 carried out by enemies of Cao Kun, and was drawn further and further into the Zhili sphere during and after the German intervention.

Du's exact role in the events of 1911 have been heavily disputed, with some claiming he was initially loyal to the Qing, and other accusing him of being a key figure in organizing the Wuchang Uprising. The story as told by Du himself and his Zhili allies has been heavily revised to put him on the right side of history. From 1926 and forward he served as Wu Peifu's handpicked governor of Hubei province, initially struggling to oppose the Kuomintang's invasion of Zhili controlled territory during the Northern Expedition. After the Zhili Clique managed to turn the tide of the war, Du assumed full control of Hubei, managing to stabilizing the war torn province into a loyal stronghold of Zhili influence. His ties to Japan kept him from being promoted too highly within the Zhili command structure, but following the reforms enacted by Wu in the wake of the LEP collapse he has been promoted to the high command."

In 1917, Guo Jiyu entered the Qinghe Army's First Preparatory Officer School. Two years later, he was assigned to the First Division of the Frontier Defence Artillery Corps and the Northwest Frontier Defence Second Mixed Brigade. In 1921, Guo transferred to the Baoding Army Military Academy, and graduated with full honors in 1923. There, he became involved with the Zhili clique, though his young aged prevented rapid promotion. He became allies with Liu Menggeng during this period as well, and with Liu being chosen to spearhead his national defence plan, Guo was promoted to full General status.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nA secretary once told a visiting author an anecdote about Guo's hectic work ethic: '... (At his table) there are four or five telephones as well as telegrams and official documents. Guo went to work every morning at 8:00 A.M., retired in the afternoon to go home to eat two meals, then returned, and worked furiously until 11:00 in the evening, holding a telephone in one hand to listen to battlefield reports, while holding a pen in other.

Following the Fall of Washington and the widespread exile of many former Federalists, Stillwell and his men initially escaped to Canada. Disliking the intercine bickering in the Republic in Exile, Stillwell utilized his connections in China to secure a position with the Beijing government.

He graduated from the Nanjing Jiangnan Naval Academy in 1902, before going on to further education in the United Kingdom. This was followed by a career in the modernizing Qing navy, where Du served on and captained some of the largest ships under Chinese control. During the Wuchang uprising, he deserted the Qing Empire, and aligned himself with the Zhili Clique. During the Zhili-dominated government of 1923/1924 he served as Minister of the Navy. During the KMT’s Northern Expedition a large number of his sailors nearly convinced him to desert, but the presence of German warships kept him in line, and he supported the German Navy in their coastal bombardment missions. Restored to his position of Minister of the Navy, Du has little time left for active ship command.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHad an extensive opium and drinking habit in his youth.

He held a variety of teaching positions at the Baoding military academy throughout the 1910s, including as a teacher of both French and English. Here, he became acquainted with many future Zhili Clique generals. Quickly promoted through the ranks, Wu stayed largely isolated from many of the political turmoils that ensnared fellow naval officers, and has a reputation of being somewhat ‘apolitical’ - or the closest to apolitical one can get in this period in Chinese history.

Returning home, he participated in the Sino-Japanese war, where as the youngest commander in the Qing Navy he was forced to surrender to the Japanese after the Battle of Wehawei after all his commanding officers committed suicide. Leading the naval reforms after the peace treaty was signed, Sa was largely oblivious to the larger political maelstrom brewing in China. During the Wuchang uprising he faced a full-scale mutiny, and retired to Shanghai rather than either fire on his own men, or betray his country. He briefly served as Acting Premier in 1920, before taking the largely ceremonial position of the Governor of Fujian in 1922, where he essentially planned to retire. Here, he became acquainted with the Zhili clique and began to advise Wu and other, junior members of the Navy on modernizing the aging fleet.

In 1900, Zaixun's predecessor, Zaiyi, who succeeded Yizhi as 'Prince Rui of the Second Rank' (later renamed to 'Prince Duan of the Second Rank'), was stripped off his title of nobility and exiled to Xinjiang for his role in the Boxer Rebellion. Two years later, Zaixun succeeded Zaiyi as a beile of the Prince Rui peerage. In 1908, he was made an acting junwang (Prince of the Second Rank) but remained nominally a beile. In 1909, Zaixun was appointed as an acting Navy Minister in the Imperial Cabinet headed by Prince Qing. Later, he was sent to Europe and the United States to study the navies of the Western powers. After returning to China, in 1911, he became a full Navy Minister. Following Puyi's autocoup, he has come out of retirement to serve again as Navy minister. Despite never holding a battle command in his life he has been granted an admiralship. It is yet to be seen if he can competently command a warship in battle."

Only 17 during Puyi's restoration, the corruption and scandal that plagued the new empire greatly dismayed the impressionable young man, and on the suggestion of a friend he attended clandestine meetings of the Young China Party. From those meetings he attended the Baoding military academy, where he quickly stood out as both politically and militarily shrewd. Along with Fang Zhejian he assembled a group of young cadets dedicated to reforming the Empire.

Cobbling together a small sum of money, they sent the young boy to the local provincial secondary school. Unfortunately for Fang, warlord soldiers arrived in the provincial capital and burned the school, nearly killing Fang. The young man was left with a scar running down his leg and a burning hatred for warlords and the chaos they inflicted on the poor of China. After taking the entrance exams to Baoding Military Academy, he joined the Young China Party branch at the campus, though his sympathies lay more with the NCERA. He led one of the squads that arrested and executed senior Zhili leadership during the coup, and the command experience he picked up there made him stand out so much to Li Bingzhi that he promoted the young man on the spot."

For a brief time, after the October Revolution, he worked with Pavlo Skoropadsky's Ukrainian State and still remembers the Hetman fondly, but resigned from his post to not serve the German occupation and volunteered for the Volunteer Army instead. It is here where the legend of the so-called "Black Baron" began - the air of nobility and respectable loyalty around his persona built up gravitas among his men and his enemies, who started singing songs about the evil baron restoring the Tsar's throne. \n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Vrangel remained in the army and rapidly climbed up in command thanks to the talent he showed during the war. Though generally apolitical, he vividly remembers the Russian Civil War and is willing to do anything it takes to prevent such a travesty from befalling Russia again - even if it means taking control of the nation and directing it with an iron fist.

A second in command to Lavr Kornilov, he escaped to Southern Russia alongside him and helped form the Volunteer Army which would ultimately put an end to the Bolshevik revolution. It was Denikin who commanded the units which seized Moscow, and thus gained great adoration among his peers.\n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Denikin returned to military matters, creating plans for army reforms and pushing forth a proposal to transform the Russian army into a "people's army" via mass mobilization and modernization of recruitment.

POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "To talk about modern Russian politics is to talk about the life of Aleksandr Kerenskiy, the Republic's founding father to some and a symbol of its decay to others. A noted lawyer and legal professor, Kerenskiy sympathized with the radical socialist movement in his youth and served as legal counsel to several revolutionaries imprisoned after the Revolution of 1905, he was even a childhood friend of Vladimir Lenin. Eventually, however, he accepted that socialism can only be achieved through reform, and by the time the Great War began, he was a leading member of the socialist opposition in the State Duma. This propelled him to lead the republican Provisional Government after the February Revolution - briefly, before he was overthrown by the Bolsheviks. Kerenskiy returned to power in 1921, as the first President of the Russian Republic, a man changed by years of exile and the damage which the Russian Civil War dealt to the country.\n\nIn 1936, Kerenskiy marks his fifteenth year as President, a feat achieved thanks to a lack of competent opposition, plenty of political manipulation, fearmongering over the everpresent Kolchak putschist threat, and often just downright luck. In all these years in power, Kerenskiy established land reform, helped rejuvenate the Russian economy with the New Economic Policy program, and recognized his country's territorial losses in the west. Recent political crises, corruption scandals, and growing opposition to his rule have turned his rule shaky, however. As time went, Kerenskiy has turned more and more towards the right, his socialist credentials now practically non-existent and his bitterness growing, which is eroding the last of his allies in the SR-Kadet coalition. The President remains certain, however - his rule will end either by constitutional decree or by a bullet."
POLITICS_IRAKLIY_TSERETELI_DESC:0 "A noble from the famous Tsereteli lineage, Irakliy Tsereteli turned towards socialism during his childhood, when he came to recognize the vast difference between his wealthy family and the impoverished citizens of Kutaisi, and swore to fix this imbalance. As a law student in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in student protests, was imprisoned, and willingly chose to be deported to Siberia instead of returning to his home. There, he became acquainted with Marxism and joined the RSDRP, although he came to conflict with Lenin and joined the Menshevik faction instead. In 1906, he was elected to the Duma despite being only twenty five years old, and became one of the most prominent leaders of the Menshevik faction. He was once again arrested and deported after the Stolypin coup, but by then, his status as the champion of social democracy was solidified.\n\nIn exile, Tsereteli developed the idea of Siberian Zimmerwaldism - internationalist social democracy - and he returned to Petrograd after the February Revolution. He took a leading role in the Menshevik party, the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government, but broke with the Soviets after the Bolshevik takeover and fled to Georgia. Though he worked in the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania for some time, he became disillusioned with its growing nationalism, which clashed with his internationalism, and thus Tsereteli returned to Russia after the Civil War. The Mensheviks, with the destruction of their former Bolshevik allies, took the RSDRP mantle solely for themselves, and thanks to Tsereteli's leadership, they have managed to return to prominence from the clutches of death. For the longest time, he has served as Leader of the Opposition. In Russian politics, Tsereteli represents innocence and optimism which has long since been lost - he refuses to partake in dirty politics, violence, and concerns himself with eradicating inequality above anything else."
POLITICS_VIKTOR_CHERNOV_DESC:0 "Viktor Chernov was born to the old Russian nobility in Saratov and turned towards revolutionary politics after getting acquainted with the works of the Russian Populist movement in his gymnasium. Studying in Tartu and later in Moscow, Chernov was inducted into a circle of revolutionary friends which included Vladimir Lenin, Vasiliy Maklakov, Pavel Milyukov and numerous others who later ended up moulding Russian history. He vehemently rejected Marxism and its hostility towards the peasantry, and saw a potent revolutionary force in the impoverished, enserfed Russian villages - this ultimately drew him to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. By the turn of the century, he was a prominent member of the Tambov Zemstvo, a leading theorist of agrarian socialism, and a founding member of the PSR. He convinced his party to participate in electoral politics after the Revolution of 1905, until the 1907 Stolypin Coup, which shattered any hopes of a democratic Tsarist regime and convinced Chernov that only revolutionary methods will establish democracy in Russia.\n\nIn 1917, a bitter Chernov returned to Russia, joined the February Revolution and the Petrograd Soviet, only to witness that a decade of exile has shattered the unity of his party. He maintained a centrist position between the Right and Left SRs, but ultimately turned to the Right when the party broke, and became one of the most powerful allies of the Russian Republic. After the restoration of the Republic in 1921, Chernov and Kerenskiy formed a tandem which dominated Russia for the last fifteen years. While Kerenskiy was a gifted speaker and an excellent scapegoat, Chernov worked behind the scenes, forming increasingly unstable and big-tent coalitions to maintain the Socialist-Revolutionaries in power. The left hates him for betraying the October Revolution and the right despises him for being a leftist, but Chernov plays the two sides off to stay in power as long as he possibly can."
POLITICS_PAVEL_MILYUKOV_DESC:0 "Pavel Milyukov came from the affluent, educated upper urban class and has represented it for his entire life. A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War and a philosophy professor, Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Herbert Spencer and the Positivist thought of Auguste Comte. To compete in the constitutionally empowered Duma after the Revolution of 1905, he founded the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), which he has run for the next forty years of his life. A party of intellectuals, liberal Zemstvo men, officials and Jews, the Kadets campaigned for a federal, constitutional solution for the Russian nation - if it's republican or democratic, doesn't matter. The Weltkrieg saw Milyukov heavily lurge to the right - he became a nationalist and a supporter of territorial expansion into the Balkans, which gave him the nickname "Milyukov of the Dardanelles".\n\nMilyukov was arguably one of the reasons for the collapse of the Provisional Government - as Kerenskiy's Minister of Foreign Affairs, he staunchly opposed even the discussion of peace with the Central Powers. Despite this, he and the Kadets were too influential to sideline, and after the Russian Civil War, they became one of the most influential political parties in the country. Milyukov has served in several governments and held the position of Prime Minister numerous times, most notably during the assassination of Aleksandr Kerenskiy. His age is catching up to him, but his mind is still sharp - and though Milyukov may be a constitutional democrat, he is a more vehement Russian imperialist than even the average NRPR-er."
POLITICS_NIKOLAI_TRUBETSKOY_DESC:0 "Prince Nikolay Trubetskoy represents a new generation of Russian nobility, an educated, ideologically driven upper class which is opposed to radicalism from the right and from the left. A notable linguist and researcher into phonology, he spent much of his life working with Roman Jakobson to develop the foundations of modern phonetics and started the Prague School of linguistics research. He returned to Russia in the 1920s, however, in charge of the "Russian Union", a conservative monarchist party which declared itself to be a bridge between the increasingly anti-democratic right and the weakening moderate left.\n\nAlongside Pavel Savitsky, Nikolay Trubetskoy developed the ideology of Eurasianism, one which he and his party ascribe to. Trubetskoy's Eurasianism decrees that Russia is intrinsically tied to the peoples of Asia as well as Europe, and that their geopolitical position and history creates an exceptional role for Russia in world history. Russia should lead the fight against what Trubetskoy perceives as "the Europeanization of the world" - Romano-Germanic culture, which, having developed its set of values and moral beliefs, drilled into its head that they are somehow universal. Russia should be at the forefront of a crusade against this cultural imperialism and create a world where each nation is able to develop independently of others. This ideology places Trubetskoy as a nationalist, Russian exceptionalist, and conservative staunchly opposed to Western ideals."

A talented cavalry officer from a family which gifted several commanders to the Imperial Russian Army, Vrangel distinguished himself during the Brusilov Offensive, where he showed himself as an aggressive yet trustworthy commander. For a brief time, after the October Revolution, he worked with Pavlo Skoropadsky's Ukrainian State and still remembers the Hetman fondly, but resigned from his post to not serve the German occupation and volunteered for the Volunteer Army instead. It is here where the legend of the so-called "Black Baron" began - the air of nobility and respectable loyalty around his persona built up gravitas among his men and his enemies, who started singing songs about the evil baron restoring the Tsar's throne. \n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Vrangel remained in the army and rapidly climbed up in command thanks to the talent he showed during the war. Though generally apolitical, he vividly remembers the Russian Civil War and is willing to do anything it takes to prevent such a travesty from befalling Russia again - even if it means taking control of the nation and directing it with an iron fist.

POLITICS_VASILY_MAKLAKOV_DESC:0 "Born to the Muscovite intellectual upper class, Vasiliy Maklakov was practically destined to become a member of the Constitutional Democrats, the party which represented the interests of his class. His political career started while studying law - as a part of his thesis on ancient Greek democracy, he visited Paris and left impressed by its political system, one which he has sought to replicate in Russia since. He gained prominence as a briliant legal mind and an orator, the high point of his legal career was the defense of Menahem Mendel Beilis, a Russian Jew wrongfully accused of committing ritual murder in 1913. He was one of the founding members of the Kadets and represented the party's conservative wing - he sharply criticized Pavel Milyukov, but never to a point of destroying party unity.\n\nSome claim that Maklakov supplied Feliks Yusupov with the poison to murder Grigoriy Semyenov, but he himself denied it - however, Maklakov was opposed to Rasputin and declared the Tsarist regime a vehicle with no brakes, driven by a mad chaffeur. During the Russian Civil War, he maintained Russia's embassy in France, first in Paris and then in Algiers, and returned to his homeland in 1921 to restore the Kadet party. Though calling himself a liberal, Maklakov is a staunch opponent of socialism in all of its forms, and a believer that Russia's fragile democracy needs to be protected from domestic insurrection or foreign invasion at all costs - as long as the price to pay is not liberty."
POLITICS_TYRKOVA_WILLIAMS_DESC:0 "Ariadna Tyrkova was born to the landowning nobility in Novgorod and studied in Saint-Petersburg, where she became acquainted with the liberal reformist publications of Pyotr Struve and thus shifted towards the liberal cause. She was a founding member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, a notable member of its right wing and a proponent of an alliance with the Octobrists. Her defining political stance, however, was her unassailable fight for the rights of women, which got the Kadets to add women's suffrage to their party platform. The Russian Civil War radicalized her, however. After a brief exile to Britain, she returned to Rostov in 1919, where she declared that liberal democracy has failed Russia and a strong, uniquely Russian government form must take charge instead. \n\nThis got her associated with Eurasianist circles after the Russian Civil War, and ultimately concluded in her becoming a founding member of the Russian Union.

He graduated as an artillery officer and tasted warfare in the Russo-Japanese War, where he gained the nickname of "Leather General" - named as such for his style to wear black leather from head to toes. Already, his tendency for recklessness and unconventional, yet brilliant tactics began to show. After his service in Manchuria, Markov became a teacher in the prestigious Pavlovsk military academy, but duty called him to war once again when the Weltkrieg began. There, he served in the same unit as Anton Denikin, as one of his closest aides, and the two officers developed a mutual feeling of respect. \n\nAfter supporting Lavr Kornilov in his coup attempt, Markov was arrested, but escaped in the chaos after the Bolshevik takeover and escaped to the Don, where he joined the Volunteer Army. There, he distinguished himself as a legend among the White commanders, who would often take matters to his own hands, defeat numerically superior Red forces with the craziest tactics (such as standing on the tracks to stop an armored train, yelling curses at the Bolsheviks as he bombed it with grenades), and saved the White cause from an early defeat. After the end of the Russian Civil War, Markov, a committed republican, remained in the army, and began crafting a new form of warfare based of his experiences of surprise engagements, armored vehicles and maneouvre in the war - though his ideas are radical, the potential behind them is incomprehensible."
POLITICS_LAVR_KORNILOV_DESC:0 "One of the most famous military commanders in modern Russian history, Lavr Kornilov is nevertheless a man of surprising mystery. Even his ancestry is a mystery - however, he is definitely of Siberian Cossack birth, and was raised in the harsh militaristic culture of his people. His military career began before the Weltkrieg and culminated in him being appointed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army in 1917 - briefly, before the Kornilov affair. In an event which still stumps researchers, Kornilov marched troops on Petrograd, presumably under Kerenskiy's orders, and yet was removed from his post for this treason and escaped to the Don. There, he volunteered for the White Army and became one of its most talented commanders.\n\nKornilov's conflict with the government flared up after the end of the civil war, but at this point, it was him who had the upper hand, and he remained at his post. To those who believed that he might be a traitor, Kornilov proved himself by valiantly standing against Kolchak's coup attempt and helping save the Republic from destruction. Still, he remains one of the most ambitious, and yet at the same time most disillusioned of the White generals. It is no secret that he has formed an alliance with far right forces in the Russian republic, and once in power, he will not shy away from enabling them."

Devoted to trade unionism and the struggle of Russian labor for control of their means of production, he allied himself with several radical leftist parties before finally joining the Bolsheviks, although he always pronounced his goals above any of their ideological designs. Because of this, though he participated in the October Revolution, Shlyapnikov constantly came into conflict with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and constantly criticized their authoritarian tendencies when the rights of workers should be their primary concern. \n\nAs a less prominent Bolshevik, Shlyapnikov escaped the gallows, but continued his political crusade. Alongside his lover Aleksandra Kollontay, he founded the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, and started drifting towards Syndicalism after seeing the success of the French revolution - the TUSP proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."
POLITICS_KARL_RADEK_DESC:0 "Karl Radek would struggle to count the number of socialist movements he's had a hand in over the years. Born in Austria-Hungary to a Jewish Litvak family, he joined the Social Democracy of Poland and Lithuania and participated in the Revolution of 1905 in Warsaw - only to get expelled a few years later as a part of an anti-semitic and anti-Leninist campaign within the party. Briefly, he worked for the German SPD, before getting expelled as well. He worked for the Bremen Left, attended the Zimmerwald Conference in Zurich, and ultimately left for Petrograd in the same sealed train as Lenin to join the October Revolution. He did not stay in Russia either, however - in late 1918, he crossed borders in secret to join the revolutionary events taking place in Germany, moments before they were crushed by the Kaiser. \n\nThis brief adventure is what saved his life, however - instead of executing him like what the Whites did to all Bolsheviks they could find, Radek was kept in prison by the Germans and was eventually released in the late twenties, at which point he once again moved to Russia, "the weakest link in the capitalist system". An ardent revolutionary and a radical even among radicals, Radek stresses the need for Russia to quickly develop itself through use of extensive state planning, in order to prepare for the coming world revolution."

After returning from exile in Siberia in 1917, he joined the October Revolution, although he disagreed with the radical inclinations of the Bolshevik movement, and was put in charge of the fledgling Soviet state's industry. During this period, he organized the policy of War Communism, although he later regretted its most brutish measures and the peasant resentment it sparked.\n\nRykov survived the end of the Russian Civil War and joined Nikolay Bukharin in exile to form the People's Socialist Party - the two men found a lot of common ground in their call for caution while transforming the Russian economy and for moderation among the radical factions of the Central Committee."

During this time, she became an ardent supporter of women rights, and trade unionism, these views of hers were further driven towards Syndicalism by her lover, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov. \n\nKollontay was a Menshevik until 1915, when she broke over the issue of the Great War, and joined the Bolsheviks instead. During the botched October Revolution, she was a member of the Central Committee and sought to use her position to put her feminist ideology into practice, but the Russian Civil War put an end to her designs. Alongside Shlyapnikov, she helped found the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, the movement closest to orthodox French syndicalism on Russian soil - it proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

There, his political thought was influenced by the European Left, the Austrian Marxists and non-Marxist scholars such as Aleksandr Bogdanov, and he constantly came into ideological conflict with Vladimir Lenin despite remaining a loyal Bolshevik. \n\nBukharin played a key role in the botched October Revolution and emerged as a member of the Soviet republic's left wing - he vehemently opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and believed in the prospect of a world revolution, especially when revolutionary events in France began to break out. After the revolution was suppressed, Bukharin was one of the few who managed to escape the gallows, and organized the underground Bolsheviks in the following years into the People's Socialist Party.

An avowed monarchist, Kappel remained silent at first, hoping for a restoration of the Romanov order once the situation stabilizes, but soon began to plot with other future White generals. When the Bolsheviks seized power, he was in Perm, and travelled to Samara in order to join the People's Army of Komuch, a republican socialist force which avowed to restore the Constituent Assembly - a monarchist leading a socialist force was a sight to see. \n\nKappel performed his duties with spectacular results - he showed his skill as a calculating tactician and an expert at winter warfare, which allowed him to rout Bolshevik forces several times larger with little difficulty. Bolshevik newspapers even dubbed him "little Napoleon" - the nickname which stuck, however, was "Soldier-General" - a commander who always stayed by his men and fought side by side with a rifle and grenade. After the end of the Bolshevik uprising, Kappel remained in the army and became one of the most important generals in its infantry corps.

In the years that followed, he tried several prospective careers, including submarines and aircraft, but ultimately decided to stick to ground forces. His real career began after the February Revolution, when he was the first to denounce the authority of the republican government in Moscow and disobeyed orders. Stationed in Romania, he watched the Bolshevik takeover from afar and formed a military unit of his own, the Drozdovites, which marched off to join Mikhail Alekseyev's Volunteer Army in the Don.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he gained the reputation of a talented and strict, if reckless commander, who always made sure to assert that he was fighting for the holy House of Romanov.

Though a talented commander, he was blunt, sharp and never minced his words, shooting down ideas he thought unacceptable and berating those who proposed them in the general staff, which meant that he ended up hated by every single officer in the army corps except for Denikin and Kornilov. Republicans suspected him of being a monarchist and monarchists believed him to be a republican, but once the Civil War came to an end and he had to choose, Romanovskiy stood by the Republic.

Shaposhnikov's most famous contribution to the Russian army is the three volume military theory work named 'The Brain of the Army', in which he detailed his view on the future of warfare. \n\nDrawing from his experience of the Weltkrieg, he asserts that wars following it will be even more deadly than before, and require mass mobilization never once imagined, the 'opium of war'. For a country to prevail in modern warfare, they must subordinate military matters to political imperative and a some sort of overarching ideology, which would be able to justify mass mobilization and maintain the morale of the average soldier during years of war.

POLITICS_ANTON_DENIKIN_DESC:0 "Born to a Russian father and Polish mother, Anton Denikin chose to embrace the patriotism of the former, and tied the rest of his life with the Imperial Russian Army. By the Great War, he was a major general and a chief of staff in Kiev Military District, and a prolific writer who analysed the shortcomings of the Russian army. A second in command to Lavr Kornilov, he escaped to Southern Russia alongside him and helped form the Volunteer Army which would ultimately put an end to the Bolshevik revolution. It was Denikin who commanded the units which seized Moscow, and thus gained great adoration among his peers.\n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Denikin returned to military matters, creating plans for army reforms and pushing forth a proposal to transform the Russian army into a "people's army" via mass mobilization and modernization of recruitment. Politics are the last thing on his mind, but should he end up in power one way or another, Denikin's experience in the Russian chief of staff will lead to him commanding the nation like he used to command his regiment."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "To talk about modern Russian politics is to talk about the life of Aleksandr Kerenskiy, the Republic's founding father to some and a symbol of its decay to others. A noted lawyer and legal professor, Kerenskiy sympathized with the radical socialist movement in his youth and served as legal counsel to several revolutionaries imprisoned after the Revolution of 1905, he was even a childhood friend of Vladimir Lenin. Eventually, however, he accepted that socialism can only be achieved through reform, and by the time the Great War began, he was a leading member of the socialist opposition in the State Duma. This propelled him to lead the republican Provisional Government after the February Revolution - briefly, before he was overthrown by the Bolsheviks. Kerenskiy returned to power in 1921, as the first President of the Russian Republic, a man changed by years of exile and the damage which the Russian Civil War dealt to the country.\n\nIn 1936, Kerenskiy marks his fifteenth year as President, a feat achieved thanks to a lack of competent opposition, plenty of political manipulation, fearmongering over the everpresent Kolchak putschist threat, and often just downright luck. In all these years in power, Kerenskiy established land reform, helped rejuvenate the Russian economy with the New Economic Policy program, and recognized his country's territorial losses in the west. Recent political crises, corruption scandals, and growing opposition to his rule have turned his rule shaky, however. As time went, Kerenskiy has turned more and more towards the right, his socialist credentials now practically non-existent and his bitterness growing, which is eroding the last of his allies in the SR-Kadet coalition. The President remains certain, however - his rule will end either by constitutional decree or by a bullet."
POLITICS_IRAKLIY_TSERETELI_DESC:0 "A noble from the famous Tsereteli lineage, Irakliy Tsereteli turned towards socialism during his childhood, when he came to recognize the vast difference between his wealthy family and the impoverished citizens of Kutaisi, and swore to fix this imbalance. As a law student in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in student protests, was imprisoned, and willingly chose to be deported to Siberia instead of returning to his home. There, he became acquainted with Marxism and joined the RSDRP, although he came to conflict with Lenin and joined the Menshevik faction instead. In 1906, he was elected to the Duma despite being only twenty five years old, and became one of the most prominent leaders of the Menshevik faction. He was once again arrested and deported after the Stolypin coup, but by then, his status as the champion of social democracy was solidified.\n\nIn exile, Tsereteli developed the idea of Siberian Zimmerwaldism - internationalist social democracy - and he returned to Petrograd after the February Revolution. He took a leading role in the Menshevik party, the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government, but broke with the Soviets after the Bolshevik takeover and fled to Georgia. Though he worked in the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania for some time, he became disillusioned with its growing nationalism, which clashed with his internationalism, and thus Tsereteli returned to Russia after the Civil War. The Mensheviks, with the destruction of their former Bolshevik allies, took the RSDRP mantle solely for themselves, and thanks to Tsereteli's leadership, they have managed to return to prominence from the clutches of death. For the longest time, he has served as Leader of the Opposition. In Russian politics, Tsereteli represents innocence and optimism which has long since been lost - he refuses to partake in dirty politics, violence, and concerns himself with eradicating inequality above anything else."
POLITICS_VIKTOR_CHERNOV_DESC:0 "Viktor Chernov was born to the old Russian nobility in Saratov and turned towards revolutionary politics after getting acquainted with the works of the Russian Populist movement in his gymnasium. Studying in Tartu and later in Moscow, Chernov was inducted into a circle of revolutionary friends which included Vladimir Lenin, Vasiliy Maklakov, Pavel Milyukov and numerous others who later ended up moulding Russian history. He vehemently rejected Marxism and its hostility towards the peasantry, and saw a potent revolutionary force in the impoverished, enserfed Russian villages - this ultimately drew him to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. By the turn of the century, he was a prominent member of the Tambov Zemstvo, a leading theorist of agrarian socialism, and a founding member of the PSR. He convinced his party to participate in electoral politics after the Revolution of 1905, until the 1907 Stolypin Coup, which shattered any hopes of a democratic Tsarist regime and convinced Chernov that only revolutionary methods will establish democracy in Russia.\n\nIn 1917, a bitter Chernov returned to Russia, joined the February Revolution and the Petrograd Soviet, only to witness that a decade of exile has shattered the unity of his party. He maintained a centrist position between the Right and Left SRs, but ultimately turned to the Right when the party broke, and became one of the most powerful allies of the Russian Republic. After the restoration of the Republic in 1921, Chernov and Kerenskiy formed a tandem which dominated Russia for the last fifteen years. While Kerenskiy was a gifted speaker and an excellent scapegoat, Chernov worked behind the scenes, forming increasingly unstable and big-tent coalitions to maintain the Socialist-Revolutionaries in power. The left hates him for betraying the October Revolution and the right despises him for being a leftist, but Chernov plays the two sides off to stay in power as long as he possibly can."
POLITICS_PAVEL_MILYUKOV_DESC:0 "Pavel Milyukov came from the affluent, educated upper urban class and has represented it for his entire life. A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War and a philosophy professor, Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Herbert Spencer and the Positivist thought of Auguste Comte. To compete in the constitutionally empowered Duma after the Revolution of 1905, he founded the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), which he has run for the next forty years of his life. A party of intellectuals, liberal Zemstvo men, officials and Jews, the Kadets campaigned for a federal, constitutional solution for the Russian nation - if it's republican or democratic, doesn't matter. The Weltkrieg saw Milyukov heavily lurge to the right - he became a nationalist and a supporter of territorial expansion into the Balkans, which gave him the nickname "Milyukov of the Dardanelles".\n\nMilyukov was arguably one of the reasons for the collapse of the Provisional Government - as Kerenskiy's Minister of Foreign Affairs, he staunchly opposed even the discussion of peace with the Central Powers. Despite this, he and the Kadets were too influential to sideline, and after the Russian Civil War, they became one of the most influential political parties in the country. Milyukov has served in several governments and held the position of Prime Minister numerous times, most notably during the assassination of Aleksandr Kerenskiy. His age is catching up to him, but his mind is still sharp - and though Milyukov may be a constitutional democrat, he is a more vehement Russian imperialist than even the average NRPR-er."

A notable linguist and researcher into phonology, he spent much of his life working with Roman Jakobson to develop the foundations of modern phonetics and started the Prague School of linguistics research. He returned to Russia in the 1920s, however, in charge of the "Russian Union", a conservative monarchist party which declared itself to be a bridge between the increasingly anti-democratic right and the weakening moderate left.\n\nAlongside Pavel Savitsky, Nikolay Trubetskoy developed the ideology of Eurasianism, one which he and his party ascribe to. Trubetskoy's Eurasianism decrees that Russia is intrinsically tied to the peoples of Asia as well as Europe, and that their geopolitical position and history creates an exceptional role for Russia in world history. Russia should lead the fight against what Trubetskoy perceives as "the Europeanization of the world" - Romano-Germanic culture, which, having developed its set of values and moral beliefs, drilled into its head that they are somehow universal. Russia should be at the forefront of a crusade against this cultural imperialism and create a world where each nation is able to develop independently of others. This ideology places Trubetskoy as a nationalist, Russian exceptionalist, and conservative staunchly opposed to Western ideals."
POLITICS_PYOTR_WRANGEL_DESC:0 "Among Russian generals of Baltic German birth, of which there are many, Pyetr Vrangel is perhaps the most famous. A talented cavalry officer from a family which gifted several commanders to the Imperial Russian Army, Vrangel distinguished himself during the Brusilov Offensive, where he showed himself as an aggressive yet trustworthy commander. For a brief time, after the October Revolution, he worked with Pavlo Skoropadsky's Ukrainian State and still remembers the Hetman fondly, but resigned from his post to not serve the German occupation and volunteered for the Volunteer Army instead. It is here where the legend of the so-called "Black Baron" began - the air of nobility and respectable loyalty around his persona built up gravitas among his men and his enemies, who started singing songs about the evil baron restoring the Tsar's throne. \n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Vrangel remained in the army and rapidly climbed up in command thanks to the talent he showed during the war. Though generally apolitical, he vividly remembers the Russian Civil War and is willing to do anything it takes to prevent such a travesty from befalling Russia again - even if it means taking control of the nation and directing it with an iron fist.

POLITICS_VASILY_MAKLAKOV_DESC:0 "Born to the Muscovite intellectual upper class, Vasiliy Maklakov was practically destined to become a member of the Constitutional Democrats, the party which represented the interests of his class. His political career started while studying law - as a part of his thesis on ancient Greek democracy, he visited Paris and left impressed by its political system, one which he has sought to replicate in Russia since. He gained prominence as a briliant legal mind and an orator, the high point of his legal career was the defense of Menahem Mendel Beilis, a Russian Jew wrongfully accused of committing ritual murder in 1913. He was one of the founding members of the Kadets and represented the party's conservative wing - he sharply criticized Pavel Milyukov, but never to a point of destroying party unity.\n\nSome claim that Maklakov supplied Feliks Yusupov with the poison to murder Grigoriy Semyenov, but he himself denied it - however, Maklakov was opposed to Rasputin and declared the Tsarist regime a vehicle with no brakes, driven by a mad chaffeur. During the Russian Civil War, he maintained Russia's embassy in France, first in Paris and then in Algiers, and returned to his homeland in 1921 to restore the Kadet party. Though calling himself a liberal, Maklakov is a staunch opponent of socialism in all of its forms, and a believer that Russia's fragile democracy needs to be protected from domestic insurrection or foreign invasion at all costs - as long as the price to pay is not liberty."
POLITICS_TYRKOVA_WILLIAMS_DESC:0 "Ariadna Tyrkova was born to the landowning nobility in Novgorod and studied in Saint-Petersburg, where she became acquainted with the liberal reformist publications of Pyotr Struve and thus shifted towards the liberal cause. She was a founding member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, a notable member of its right wing and a proponent of an alliance with the Octobrists. Her defining political stance, however, was her unassailable fight for the rights of women, which got the Kadets to add women's suffrage to their party platform. The Russian Civil War radicalized her, however. After a brief exile to Britain, she returned to Rostov in 1919, where she declared that liberal democracy has failed Russia and a strong, uniquely Russian government form must take charge instead. \n\nThis got her associated with Eurasianist circles after the Russian Civil War, and ultimately concluded in her becoming a founding member of the Russian Union. Russia's first democratically elected female head of state has a deeply conservative society to resist against, but she is no pushover, and will not shy away to assert Russia's role as the harbringer of Eurasia."

He graduated as an artillery officer and tasted warfare in the Russo-Japanese War, where he gained the nickname of "Leather General" - named as such for his style to wear black leather from head to toes. Already, his tendency for recklessness and unconventional, yet brilliant tactics began to show. After his service in Manchuria, Markov became a teacher in the prestigious Pavlovsk military academy, but duty called him to war once again when the Weltkrieg began. There, he served in the same unit as Anton Denikin, as one of his closest aides, and the two officers developed a mutual feeling of respect. \n\nAfter supporting Lavr Kornilov in his coup attempt, Markov was arrested, but escaped in the chaos after the Bolshevik takeover and escaped to the Don, where he joined the Volunteer Army. There, he distinguished himself as a legend among the White commanders, who would often take matters to his own hands, defeat numerically superior Red forces with the craziest tactics (such as standing on the tracks to stop an armored train, yelling curses at the Bolsheviks as he bombed it with grenades), and saved the White cause from an early defeat. After the end of the Russian Civil War, Markov, a committed republican, remained in the army, and began crafting a new form of warfare based of his experiences of surprise engagements, armored vehicles and maneouvre in the war - though his ideas are radical, the potential behind them is incomprehensible."
POLITICS_LAVR_KORNILOV_DESC:0 "One of the most famous military commanders in modern Russian history, Lavr Kornilov is nevertheless a man of surprising mystery. Even his ancestry is a mystery - however, he is definitely of Siberian Cossack birth, and was raised in the harsh militaristic culture of his people. His military career began before the Weltkrieg and culminated in him being appointed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army in 1917 - briefly, before the Kornilov affair. In an event which still stumps researchers, Kornilov marched troops on Petrograd, presumably under Kerenskiy's orders, and yet was removed from his post for this treason and escaped to the Don. There, he volunteered for the White Army and became one of its most talented commanders.\n\nKornilov's conflict with the government flared up after the end of the civil war, but at this point, it was him who had the upper hand, and he remained at his post. To those who believed that he might be a traitor, Kornilov proved himself by valiantly standing against Kolchak's coup attempt and helping save the Republic from destruction. Still, he remains one of the most ambitious, and yet at the same time most disillusioned of the White generals. It is no secret that he has formed an alliance with far right forces in the Russian republic, and once in power, he will not shy away from enabling them."

Devoted to trade unionism and the struggle of Russian labor for control of their means of production, he allied himself with several radical leftist parties before finally joining the Bolsheviks, although he always pronounced his goals above any of their ideological designs. Because of this, though he participated in the October Revolution, Shlyapnikov constantly came into conflict with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and constantly criticized their authoritarian tendencies when the rights of workers should be their primary concern. \n\nAs a less prominent Bolshevik, Shlyapnikov escaped the gallows, but continued his political crusade. Alongside his lover Aleksandra Kollontay, he founded the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, and started drifting towards Syndicalism after seeing the success of the French revolution - the TUSP proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

Briefly, he worked for the German SPD, before getting expelled as well. He worked for the Bremen Left, attended the Zimmerwald Conference in Zurich, and ultimately left for Petrograd in the same sealed train as Lenin to join the October Revolution. He did not stay in Russia either, however - in late 1918, he crossed borders in secret to join the revolutionary events taking place in Germany, moments before they were crushed by the Kaiser. \n\nThis brief adventure is what saved his life, however - instead of executing him like what the Whites did to all Bolsheviks they could find, Radek was kept in prison by the Germans and was eventually released in the late twenties, at which point he once again moved to Russia, "the weakest link in the capitalist system". An ardent revolutionary and a radical even among radicals, Radek stresses the need for Russia to quickly develop itself through use of extensive state planning, in order to prepare for the coming world revolution."

During this period, he organized the policy of War Communism, although he later regretted its most brutish measures and the peasant resentment it sparked.\n\nRykov survived the end of the Russian Civil War and joined Nikolay Bukharin in exile to form the People's Socialist Party - the two men found a lot of common ground in their call for caution while transforming the Russian economy and for moderation among the radical factions of the Central Committee."

During this time, she became an ardent supporter of women rights, and trade unionism, these views of hers were further driven towards Syndicalism by her lover, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov. \n\nKollontay was a Menshevik until 1915, when she broke over the issue of the Great War, and joined the Bolsheviks instead. During the botched October Revolution, she was a member of the Central Committee and sought to use her position to put her feminist ideology into practice, but the Russian Civil War put an end to her designs. Alongside Shlyapnikov, she helped found the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, the movement closest to orthodox French syndicalism on Russian soil - it proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

When the Bolsheviks seized power, he was in Perm, and travelled to Samara in order to join the People's Army of Komuch, a republican socialist force which avowed to restore the Constituent Assembly - a monarchist leading a socialist force was a sight to see. \n\nKappel performed his duties with spectacular results - he showed his skill as a calculating tactician and an expert at winter warfare, which allowed him to rout Bolshevik forces several times larger with little difficulty. Bolshevik newspapers even dubbed him "little Napoleon" - the nickname which stuck, however, was "Soldier-General" - a commander who always stayed by his men and fought side by side with a rifle and grenade.

Though a talented commander, he was blunt, sharp and never minced his words, shooting down ideas he thought unacceptable and berating those who proposed them in the general staff, which meant that he ended up hated by every single officer in the army corps except for Denikin and Kornilov. Republicans suspected him of being a monarchist and monarchists believed him to be a republican, but once the Civil War came to an end and he had to choose, Romanovskiy stood by the Republic.

He joined the Red Army as a volunteer and rapidly rose in rank, becoming a close associate to Leon Trotsky and achieving the rank of General not long after Lenin's assassination. The Fifth Army he commanded was one of the Red Army's finest units and pioneered the concept of motorized concentration warfare, but was ultimately defeated by Vladimir Kappel.\n\nAlongside several high ranking Bolsheviks and Red Army leaders, Tukhahevskiy escaped to France, a nation he was already familiar with, and offered his service to the newly established Commune. In the following years, he dedicated his time to essay after essay on the reforms which he believed the French army needs - his close associates said that he owns over a hundred volumes on military tactics and has read every single one. Tukhachevskiy expressed dismay at the decentralized, Syndicalist structure of the Commune, believing it unfit for modern warfare, and proposed the creation of a unified, centralized, apolitical army. Because of this, he came into constant conflict with the Faure government, but the CGT could not simply remove him from the academy - even they understood that Tukhachevskiy was the best general which the Internationale has available.\n\nTo resolve this, he and the other Bolsheviks were sent to Patagonia to lead a military mission to help the Argentinean Revolution."

Born to an impoverished Georgian family, Ioseb was physically disabled from young age and had a troubled childhood, marked by fights, abuse and alcoholism. Early in his life, he got drawn to Georgian nationalist poetry and enrolled in the Tiflis Seminary, but abandoned his previous calling when he came into contact with socialist literature. He dedicated himself to Marxism, joined the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, and raised money for the revolution with protection rackets, counterfeiting and bank robberies. He was a loyal follower of Lenin and represented the party in the public by running the newspaper 'Pravda', and his articles there helped make a name for himself as well.\n\nDuring the fateful months of 1917, Dzhugashvili helped organize the July Days uprising and the October Revolution, and gained a seat in the Sovnarkom. He, Lenin and Trotsky formed the informal troika which controlled the state - as a result, Dzhugashvili was sent to Tsaritsyn to organize resistance against the Whites, where he showed himself as an okay, if reckless commander. Once Lenin was assassinated in August 1918, it was Trotsky who took charge and not him - but the Soviet state was not one to last, eventually collapsing. Dzhugashvili, unlike Trotsky, managed to escape, making his way to France with the rest of the Bolshevik remnants, and helped reestablish the Party in exile.\n\nTo support the Patagonian Syndicalist revolution, Dzhugashvili was sent to the Southern Cone alongside a mission of other Bolsheviks, and alongside Tukhachevskiy, he is one of the highest ranking Internationale officials in Patagonia, albeit unlike Tukhachevskiy, representing the political interests of the Internationale.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Aligned with the Communist faction."
POLITICS_VASILY_CHUIKOV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§LFebruary 12th, 1900, in Serebryanye Prudy, Tula Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nVasiliy Chuykov was born into nothing - an impoverished peasant family deep in Central Russia, struck by hunger, unable to maintain twelve children. At the age of twelve, he left his family home and travelled across the country, ending up in Petrograd - there, he became a child labourer in a military factory, producing spurs for cavalry officers. The Revolution of 1917 left the seventeen year old Chuykov unemployed, but thanks to the contacts of one of his older brothers, he was recruited into the Red Guards, and from there, into the Red Army.\n\nChuykov achieved the rank of company commander, showing off skill at commanding troops, but ending up fairly inconsequential in the grand events beyond his understanding. He did, however, manage to escape to France alongside the remnants of the Red Army. Separated from his home, his family and whatever was left of his ordinary life, he had only one path left to pursue - join the Bolshevik remnants, enroll for officer training and become a commander in the French army. As a close associate of Mikhail Tukhachevskiy, he was assigned to the Internationale mission to Patagonia, where he hopes to prove his worth."

Then the Weltkrieg came, and with it, Zhukov was conscripted to the Imperial Russian Army. Here, he found his calling, displaying skill, bravery, and finishing server as a non-commissioned cavalry officer. After the October Revolution, he briefly went back home, but once again returned to the frontlines, this time as a junior commander in the Red Army.\n\nZhukov's service was rather brief, however, but once the Soviet regime collapsed, he escaped his homeland with numerous other Red Army commanders, and landed in France. Getting accustomed to a completely foreign country was difficult, but Zhukov had fully dedicated himself to the Bolshevik course by then and pushed forward with dedication - he completed officer training courses, maintained contact with Mikhail Tukhachevskiy and studied modern strategy from his superior, and voluntarily joined the Internationale mission to Patagonia. Dutifully loyal to the cause of the Revolution, he is often seen as the most trustworthy and reliable of the Bolshevik quartet, even if his inexperience holds him back from promotions."

POLITICS_MLACERDA_SPO_DESC:0 "Hailing from inner Minas Gerais and born in 1887, Maria Lacerda de Moura was raised by her anticlerical, spiritist parents in the somewhat larger paulista town of Barbacena, and began her political and social history shortly after becoming a full time teacher, campaigning for nationwide education reform and literacy efforts. She was publishing books as early as 1918 and started to author articles 8 years before that, and during this period that she began to be influenced by anarchist and syndicalist thought. Despite issues with suffragette movements, whom she saw as 'not fighting for enough change', she has always been one of the foremost feminist activists in the country, something that no doubt influenced in her choice as Chairwoman by progressive minded delegates, but she also has held a position among the most respected lefitist academics and authours on São Paulo. Now, São Paulo's first head of state has the daunting task of leading the continuing socialization of the government, rising demands of officers and the ever contentious Congress of Trade Unions, as some still rose issues regarding her birthplace, but her experience and fame seem to indicate she is more than prepared for the task; or so the nation hopes."
POLITICS_ISIDORO_DIAS_SPO_DESC:0 "One of, if not the most, respected military officer in all of former Brazil, Isidoro Dias Lopes has always been held in high regard in his adoptive home of São Paulo. While his task as President is a thankless one, he is one of the very few men to be respected all across the political spectrum, and thus has the gravitas necessary to ensure that São Paulo's transition into a sovereign state goes as smoothly as possible. However, time stops for no man, and a cloud of uncertainty looms overhead, as the power vacuum Isidoro will leave behind when he dies will certainly have colossal consequence for the young republic and its people's hopes."
POLITICS_JANIO_QUADROS_SPO_DESC:0 "Born in Mato Grosso do Sul in 1917, Jânio da Silva Quadros is one of the leading members of the new generation of Social Democrats that grew up and lived through the worst of the Black Monday crisis and its damaging fallout. The volatile years that followed allowed for the relatively young law school teacher to firmly establish himself in the political scene in São Paulo, decrying the corruption and inefficiency that has always plagued the state's government even before independence. His populist, aggressive campaign, that didn't even spare members of his own party, resonated with the people, who gleefully sang along to his slogans of ''Brooming'' the Paulista politics of the old, decrepit elites of Brazil. Despite all his ambitious plans, he still a democrat and constrained by constitutionale limits, but that has not stopped his enemies accusing him of Syndicalism and treason alike."
POLITICS_MANUEL_TOLEDO_SPO_DESC:0 "Perhaps the oldest political actor of great relevance in the nation, Pedro Manuel de Toledo has a long and rich political career that began almost concurrently with the rise of the republic itself. A staunch defender of liberty and the republic, he was involved in numerous revolts and conspiracies against the status quo, and wrote extensively on matters from secret voting to state autonomy. Of these revolts, his role in the large scale uprising in São Paulo is of great importance, as he saw the federal meddling as a direct attack on republican principles; he does not make great effort to hide his satisfaction on São Paulo having finally ''gotten rid of the dead weight pulling it down'', as he comptemptly calls the other former Brazilian states. Having somewhat recently ended a term as president of São Paulo, Toledo decided he was ready to become president of a sovereign, independent state now, even while well into his eighties. His age is seen as his main obstacle by the people, but politics is rarely that simple, and his presidential victory did not grant his party full control of the lower house, which might very well be an issue unless he is willing to work with some of the more virulent opposition politicians. A lawyer but chiefly diplomat by trade, he personally opposes any kind of foreign military adventures by São Paulo, but intends to respect all existing treaties regardless."
POLITICS_CARDOSO_MELO_SPO_DESC:0 "A paulista born in 1883, José Joaquim Cardoso de Melo Neto has always been an accomplished law and policy-maker. His terms as teacher of law were left behind when he joined politics more intensely after the revolt against Rio in his state in 1927, but he was active in a minor scale for a full decade prior in minor legislatures and activities. Having since been a staple figure in the Brazilian parliament, he has found himself now as President of São Paulo, albeit not in the way he expected this to pass; for São Paulo is now an independent state, instead of being primus inter pares of Brazil. As he has to juggle the ever scheming paulista elites and the demands of foreign nations, his task may seem daunting at first, but popular support for the new republic and the plans to modernize the nation have granted him plenty of political capital to deal with domestically."
POLITICS_JULIO_PRESTES_SPO_DESC:0 "A representative of a powerful and traditional family in São Paulo, Juilio Prestes debuted in the political arena in 1909 as a state representative in the parliament of São Paulo. He quickly distinguished himself, and even led troops into battle against mutinous military men twice before becoming a federal representative, where his liberal character gave him admiration from many. A friend and supporter of Washington Luís, Prestes was devastated by his sudden assatination and rallied behind the cause during the coming crisis and conflict, but was glad that it ended as quickly as it did. He gained renewed political vigour afterwards, and claims to be trying his best to uphold the legacy of his friend Washington, even if his dream of a united Brazil seems now forever condemned. Following the defeat of Brazil's military and the establishment of the Republic of São Paulo, Julio found himself as the clear frontrunner to become the first president, and his victory in these snap elections again renewed his vigour to uphold the liberal and positivist principles he defended throughout his life, despite claims of fraud and foreign interference by some of his opposition."
POLITICS_BERTOLDO_HOS_SPO_DESC:0 "Bertoldo Ritter Klinger, like many officers currently living in São Paulo, was born in the then Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, and garrisoned several locations across that country, including Rio. His actions and service during the Interstate War are quite noteworthy, as is his is exemplary record of always standing up for what he believed was the right thing, as his career was often set back by his participation in a variety of mutinies with an even greater variety of motivations, from opposing mandatory vaccination to better conditions in the barracks for infantrymen. His position at the forefront of such popular causes, and his staunch replublican beliefs, have been decisive factors on making the officer the first president of the Republic of São Paulo, where he is seen a stabilizing factor amidst the constant bickering of the nation's oligarchs and powerful families."
POLITICS_SALGADO_HOS_SPO_DESC:0 "Júlio Marcondes César Salgado was born in Pindamonhangaba. São Paulo, to family with a long tradition in military duty and Paulista politics, he himself a relative of Inácio de Siqueira Salgado, the baron of Itapeva. He has a long service record, started at age 16, and has fought both in the Interstate War and against the ever frequent Syndicalist and Tenentist uprisings in his state, and his veterancy has put him in a condition of being the commander-in-chief and nominal head of state of the newly declared Republic of São Paulo, at least until 'order is properly restored', but few doubt his tenure will hardly be a short one. Having led his state's forces in battle against the rest of Brazil before, Julio isn't exactly phased by the rapid changes brought by the break up of Brazil, and sees São Paulo's freedom as a positive happening for its people. However, unrest is not yet over in the state, and few can predict what foes the new republic might face abroad in such dangerous times."
POLITICS_LOBATAO_DA_MASSA_DESC:0 "A native of Taubaté, José Bento Renato Monteiro Lobato is among São Paulo's foremost intellectuals and authors, and has always had a penchant for getting his nose into politics since a young age. While he is known by most younger Paulistas as the author of beloved children's books and his escapades while campaigning for nationalization of the Brazilian oil sector, the political class knows his radical and often erratic rhetoric dates back many years before he was thrust into power. A member of the São Paulo Eugenics Society, he has always advocated for harsh measures to maintain what he views as a pure society, and has even written books with highly prejudiced concepts behind them, and now openly praises the activities of the KKK, something he had previously done in private. His economic stances are no less extreme, defending radical nationalization and industrialization programs; he has for decades argued against foreigners getting access to his nation's wealth. His belief in a harsh, 'dog eat dog' view of diplomatic affairs also is his north when dealing with other nations,especially his so called 'benefactors', whom he sees as a necessary ally to rid São Paulo of its 'worst elements' through an intense immigration incentive program. Said abrasive rhetoric has certainly not fallen in deaf ears, but has also led to an escalation of social and racial violence across São Paulo, but it remains to be seen if this dog is all bark, or if Lobato's bite will truly leave its mark."

Following the assault on Zhang Xun in Beijing, Song deserted Yuan to join the KMT, and threw in his loyal divisions under their government. In 1925, Song requested Chiang governorship of Shandong should the province be claimed. The subsequent Northern Expedition fell apart for Song in 1929, and he held Linyi in Shandong against Zhang Zongchang. Any hope of reinforcements were dashed by 1930, depriving Song of legitimacy. A solution to this crisis in confidence came when Song heard the Duke Yansheng was in mortal danger. Living in the Mount Tai Miao, the descendant of Confuicius was threatened by the newly-arrived Yiguandao, which desputed his orthodox religion.

Arriving in Shanghai to pledge allegiance to the Republic, he fell in with Feng Guozhang and joined the Zhili Clique when they emerged in 1917. When the Fengtian and Zhili Clique turned on each other in 1920, Zongchang was withdrawing his forces from across Northern China back into Shandong. This allowed Zongchang to commit most of his forces to the Fengtian Clique when Zhang Zhoulin made peace with Sun Yat Sen in 1926. Zongchang ordered his army again to retreat into Shandong when the Fengtian Clique needed him most. This retreat made Shandong into his prison as well as refuge, where he was an illegal but tolerated occupying force under the shadow of the Qing. An ability to utilize railroads effectively as well as the unusual charisma of a man referred to as “filthy” by even his allies carried him through to victory. As medicine was out of his reach financially, a bout of sickness drew him up the 6,600 steps to a Yiguandao doctor. Zongchang eventually met the Yiguandao’s Honored Teacher, Zhang Tianran. Whether it was his sickness or the lack of anything else to do up on Mount Tai, Zongchang promised Tianran that he would follow the esoteric lifestyle espoused by the cult for his health."
POLITICS_ZHANG_TIANRAN_DESC:0 "Tianran aspired to nothing in his life until he was introduced into the cult of Lu Zhongyi. Lu Zhongyi was the leader of a small group of religious syncretists called the Yiguandao in 1918. Lu Zhongyi had always planned for his sister Lu Zhongjie to succeed him to lead the Yiguandao, and had even recognized her supposed divinity as the reincarnation of the Buddhist God Guan Yin. A theological schism occurred after the passing of Lu Zhongyi in 1930, wherein Lu Zhongjie took followers loyal to her out of the Yiguandao and relocated to Henan, where they remain to this day. Tianran, having the full trust of his members as well as a newly divined wife Sun Suzhen, began to tell startling revelations. In 1922, Tianran had built a shrine on Mount Tai, which grew until it encompassed the other monasteries on the mountain. By 1924 Mount Tai had become the year-round home for Zhang Tianran and his inner circle. A spirit writing session that same year foretold Emperor Puyi was in danger of being poisoned, and a trip to Beijing was planned. Tianran amused and flattered Emperor Puyi with promises that the Yiguandao would reinforce loyalty to the Qing through charity and warfare if need be. The first Red Spears and Big Swords arrived to Mount Tai in 1925. The greatest catch was Tianran’s supposed conversion of Zhang Zongchang in 1935."

Like Qu Tongfeng, who was cast out of the Anhui Clique for corruption, Li was set adrift and found his way into the Fengtian clique in 1924. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin reassigned Li that year to Zhang Zongchang, who was fighting in Zhili. Li was initially impressed with Zhang Zongchang's ability in spite of his lack of manners, but this appreaisal turned sour by 1928, when Zongchang became entrenched in Shandong. Li, despite his history of corruption, could not properly pay his division on taxes collected honestly in Shandong.

Sun also joined the Temple Road Society, a folk religion, and eventually rose into a leadership position within the society. Sun convinced the society to join the Mount Song Pacification Force, an anti-bandit group composed of former bandits. After being routed and witnessing Han Yukun's suicide in 1925, Sun deserted with loyal soldiers. These soldiers entered Bozhou, Anhui, and swore alligence to the KMT as cover. When the Northern Expedition crumbled in 1927, Sun took his men into Ningxia. There the soldiers showed extreme prejudice in raiding the countryside, attaching religious significance to their banditry. The Ma Clique retaliated, and Sun's bandits retreated to Shandong in 1928. Sun Dianying was pardoned by Zhang Zuolin as part of an agreement to join Zongchang's clique."

Qu returned to China and served as instructor at the Wuyang Academy of Military Sciences in 1910. Initially cooperating with the Republicans in the Wuchang uprising of 1911, Qu bounced around to different posts in the Republic, eventually returning to Yuan briefly before running the Shandong Military Affairs Office in 1916. Qu made an agreement in 1917 with Li Yuanhong to sell mineral rights to an aluminum mine in Shandong to Japan, and allow shipments out of Yantai. The Anhui Clique in 1920, feuding with Li Yanhong, rescinded this right and requested Qu to Nanjing to stand trial. Rather than stand trial, Qu faked illness and postponed his trip until the Anhui Clique became disinterested in 1925. A letter from Sun Yat Sen, requesting Qu rally himself against Wu Peifu stirred him into action, attempting to organize a force in Shandong to join. This force choose to fight Zhang Zongchang upon his arrival to Shandong in 1926, being soundly defeated, and Qu went into hiding. The lack of central authority, and the idea that Sun Yat Sen ordered him to fight but he failed weighed heavily on Qu. Qu was then invited to Fengtian by Zhang Zuolin, who offered to redeem Qu if he joined the Beiyang Navy. Qu, distrusting the Japanese presence in Manchuria, refused and left. Qu is recalled once again, when the current leader of Shandong asks to rebuild the Beiyang Fleet in earnest in Shandong, motivated by a promise to Sun Chuanfang to fight Wu Peifu. "

POLITICS_RICCARDO_LOMBARDI_DESC:0 "Born in Regalbuto, Sicily, on August 16th 1901, Riccardo Lombardi lived in the region long before the Socialist takeover. However, he does identify himself with that government. Specifically, he considers himself a part of the Christian-Socialist faction within the S.R.I., the Fasci. This does not mean he has always been this way; Lombardi and close friend Guido Mignoli hopped from party to party until hedging their bets with the Socialists, and have now founded their own faction in the form of the Fasci. His ideology can be described in many ways, and his recent popularity is probably best explained by the fact that his supporters can project their beliefs onto him. Syndicalists, Socialists, Communists, and even some Liberals who identify with the Crocean faction can identify with the man, and this combined with his political talent has made him a formidable force within Italy. With this support, he has sharply criticized the government's inability to provide for it's people, drawing on a combination of populist, religious, and socialist rhetoric to energize his supporters, who come from every walk of life. Now that he has taken power, he hopes to move forward with his agenda of Christian-Socialism, providing for his people and dealing with his enemies in the Mafia and elsewhere. One of the largest threats to Lombardi's power will certainly come from Julius Evola, who has been a rival to Lombardi for years and whom Lombardi has energetically opposed. The two mostly recently clashed when Lombardi and his men defended a socialist newspaper hub from Evola's men, and only time can tell what the outcome of this rivalry will be. One thing is clear though: with Lombardi in charge of the Socialist Republic of Italy, its people know their interests will be represented at last, and the country will prosper because of it."

A savvy political navigator, Maxamuud has united the sultanates of Somalia under a federal monarchy under his nominal leadership; but can a man who declared war against his own father for power be trusted not to infringe on constitutional prerogatives?"
POLITICS_BARRE_DESC:0 "A Marehan Darod hailing from the Ogaden, Siad Barre has always been a competent and enthusiastic officer.

However, just two years before Gustaf's ascension to the throne, in 1905 his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament.\n\nWhen Gustaf first took the throne in 1907 he also ended a Swedish tradition of roughly 700 years when he refused a coronation. As such, during his reign as a king, he never wore a crown. While at first ambivalent about the Swedish politicians he angered in February 1914, when the Swedish liberal government wanted to cut in military spending. After holding a speech condemning their actions, the liberal government stepped down and was replaced by civil servants appointed by Gustav himself. In the following 1917 elections the Liberals and Social democrats made heavy gains, but Gustaf still attempted installing a conservative government. However, they were unable to form a coalition and Gustaf realised he could no longer appoint governments of his own choosing. During the following reforms, he found himself forced to act upon his minister's advice, and not the other way around."

politics_nils_flyg_desc:0 "The figurehead of Swedish totalism, Nils 'Nisse' Flyg, is considered by many to be a colourful character. Born in the Stockholm working-class neighbourhood of Södermalm, Flyg has been active in the Swedish radical left since a young age. In 1917, he split off from the SAP with Zeth Höglund and Karl Kilbom to form the Swedish Communist Party, a brief experiment that soon failed when the Russian revolution was crushed. Nonetheless, the young Flyg would prove to be a force to be reckoned within the Swedish left.\n\nIn more recent years, Flyg distanced himself from his less radical comrades and took on the doctrine of total commitment to the Revolution propagated by the Sorelians in the Commune of France and Oswald Mosley in the Union of Britain, though adding his own unique values to it as well: Flyg is known to oppose notions of an indigenous socialist revolution in America and, ironic to his previous positions, Russia, believing that the revolution has to originate in Europe as it would otherwise take the shape of anti-European imperialism, noting on the side that neither Russia nor America harbours an orthodox totalist movement."

After living half of his life abroad in the west, Antoun returned to his homeland in 1925 to find the dream of democratic Lebanon dead. In Lebanons's rubble, Antoun founded an organisation called Natural Syria, dedicated to a non-sectarian independent Syria that could stand against Ottoman and Western Imperialism. Sharing only a distaste for imperialism, Antoun rejected the message of the syndicalists as divisive and rejected the Ba'ath ideals. Antoun sees Natural Syria as the homeland of ally Syrians, Kurds, Iraqis and Lebanese regardless of race. In his writing, Antoun claims that he will merge the best parts of socialism, nationalism, and patriotism under the Zawbaa."

Where many heard the call of Faisal's Arab Revolt, Fawzi heard only the commendations from General Otto von Kreiss. When the Turks were victorious, they made Fawzi a Pasha. Although showered with praise, Fawzi refused to call himself a Pasha. His current role as military governor is unique among the vilayets as he exerts considerable control over the soldiers in his command."
POLITICS_ADIB_BIN_HASSAN_SYR_DESC:0 "Sami Al Hinawi has spent his career avoiding the easy paths to power. Never renouncing his Arab name in the Ottoman Military, his loyalty earned him the right to use his birth name. The allure of the Arab Revolt never reached him in during his time in the Jerusalem Vilyet. A possible alliance between his officers and the emerging SSNP was rejected on the same basis that the easy way to power is a trap. Time will tell whether this stalwart commitment will pay off."
POLITICS_SHUKRI_QUWATILI_DESC:0 "Among the several branches of Al Fatat in the Arab world, none would be as successful as Syria's. This is due to the careful manoeuvring of their leader, Shukri al-Quwatli. Despite his exile from Syria twice, he has again returned and collects his allies in preparation for a new type of Republican government. Shukri's position in Syria is an intermediary between the liberal burghers and conservative landowners that hold judicial power in Syria."

He may be out of touch with the common Syrian, but his commitment to economic ties with the Arab world set Sabri apart from his peers."
POLITICS_MICHEAL_AFLAQ_DESC:0 "Michel Aflaq was in Paris during the Syndicalist revolution. Swept up in the socialist organisations, he joined the Commune's government as an informal student. There he studied trade unionism with Saladin al Bitar, and they both decided that Syria was ready for revolution in 1925. The revolution to be, a renaissance or Ba'ath, never materialised. Michel was unable to form trade unions in Damascus or Mosul, so he returned to Paris in 1930 abandoning the Ba'ath party. His return as of late as an emancipator and the forced creation of a trade union council in Damascus means his power is backed up by his superiors in the Internationale more than it is backed by Syrian supporters. This will not stop Aflaq from realizing the dream of Ba'ath however, a united Syrian proletariat."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A Sheikh is not the first person the International expected when they asked Syria to elect their first leader among the syndicates. While it is true that Muhammad al-Ashmar's first station was a Mufti, he is now a leader of the people. His influence within the mosques in reinterpreting Islamic law and rejecting Secular syndicalism in favour of voluntary Zakat from all sets him apart from any other branch of socialism in Syria."

POLITICS_NICHOLAS_ROERICH_DESC:0 "Raised by the aristocratic Roerich family of St. Petersberg, Nicholas has expressed interest in both the aesthetic and spiritual side of socialist revolution. This interest led Nicholas first into the Arts, where he graduated from St. Petersberg University and the Imperial Academy of the Arts in 1897. Nicholas became immersed in Russian avant garde art, which included working with the legendary Igor Stravinsky and Vaslav Nijinsky. The October Revolution ended the social peace that Nicholas had known, and set Nicholas closer to social conservatism and orientalism in opposition to Vladimir Lenin.\nNicholas Roerich fled to the United States and joined the Theosophical Society, a spiritual movement that shared Roerich's admiration of undeveloped nations as 'more spiritually pure' than westernized counterparts. Roerich visited the Theosophical Society in both the Bhaatiya Commune and British Dominion in 1930, and had a startling conversation with Gandhi. Gandhi expressed to Roerich that Vladimir Lenin was not against traditional culture, but against corrupt leaders of traditional institutions.\nNicholas Roerich decided to take his family to visit Tibet through the Shimla mountains, and received a second calling in the mountains. A sherpa guiding Roerich remarked 'Is it true, that Lenin was not against Buddhism?' This led to a religious experince in Nicholas, which ended the expedition when he spoke of this in Lhasa. Nicholas began describing Vladimir Lenin as 'Mahatma Lenin' and was forced to leave Tibet by the Ganden Phodrang for this heretical idea. Back in Bharatiya, Nicholas was alerted to a possible revolution in Tibet eminating from Sikkim. In Sikkim, Nicholas Roerich combined his revelations with an endorsement from Gandhi to form the Sacred Union Party, a revolutionary party dedicated to saving Tibetan Buddhism through esoteric leninism."

Raised and educated by the prestigious Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, the young Choekyi Nyima was predestined to be the 'Great Scholar' under the Dalai Lama, and was for a time well respected by the Ganden Phodrang. As a young scholar, the 9th Panchen Lama met with radical lama Agvan Dorzhiev, who taught him the Prayer to Shambhala. This prayer was intended to collect the allies of Buddhism together to the center of the world, the fictional city of Shambhala. Political realities came in 1924 when the 13th Dalai Lama was modernizing his army. The Dalai Lama demanded more taxation from the Panchen Lama as part of his feudal duties. When the Panchen Lama refused, The Dalai Lama cut off the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and confiscated the Panchen Lama's property. The resulting conflict forced the Panchen Lama to flee Tibet to Mongolia in 1924.\nThe Panchen Lama, seeing Mongolia as unable to aid in his return under Baron Ungern, left for Bharatiya in 1931. In Bharatiya, the Panchen Lama connected with the other exiled Tibetan nobles Pandatsang Rapga and Thubten Kunphela. These two exiles had connection in Kham, and had aligned themselves with exiled KMT generals to form the Tibet Improvement Party. The Panchen Lama, seeing no othr way to return to Tibet save for an invasion, joined the Tibet Improvement Party and began publishing commentaries of Sun Yat Sen's Three Principles of the People. The storm of the revolution saw the Panchen Lama promise to preserve the existence of the Ganden Phodrang while removing their ability to choose the Kashag."

Lungshar stood in between the more radical nobles like Thuben Kunphela and Trimön in the early years of the Regency. It was Lungshar who accused Thuben Kunphela of orchestrating a foreign infiltration of Tibet in 1933, leading to his exile. However, Lungshar also opposed the power of the Regency, especially their strongman Trimön. Trimön orchestrated a trial where Lungshar was accused of being a socialist, then blinded before being exiled to Sikkim.

Tsarong previously had a very successful career leading the Dob Dobs in defending Tibet from the Qing during the Xinhai revolution. Defeating the Qing earned Tsarong the name 'Hero of Chaksam', and he used his popularity to increase the national budget for Tibet's army. This indirectly caused the expulsion of the Panchen Lama in 1924. The death of the 13th Dalai Lama left the country in the control of the Regency, led by the 5th Reting Rinpoche and Trimön. Tsarong was demoted from Commander-In-Chief to Civil Engineer and Treasurer, but this failed to stop his popularity. Trimön was initially happy when Tsarong left for Utsang, along with his Young Tibet movment, but now Trimön sits in the Potala prison while Tsarong has effectively assumed his position.

In the final year of the 13th Dalai Lama, Trimön happend upon the macinations of Lungshar, and personally persuaded the aging Dalai Lama to order Lungshar blinded for his liberal schemes. Trimön used this political affair to become a close confident with the regent, the young Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen.

How did he come to such a life?\n\nWhen the civil war was raging in the vast expanses of Russia, Kolchak, in many ways suddenly for himself, was proclaimed the Supreme Ruler of Russia during the putsch in November 1918. Having first arrested the SRS and declared martial law, the imminent catastrophe was stopped by Boris Savinkov, who agreed with Kolchak on the adoption of the SR agrarian reform. The Whites were united and strong. The Siberian army soon merged with other white armies and by the end of 1919 the Bolsheviks surrendered. Having made a difficult choice in favor of Russia, Kolchak made an equally difficult choice, renouncing the supreme power and approving the Second Constituent Assembly in 1920.\n\nHowever, his relations with the newly created Russian Republic's government were quite hostile due to the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, which they had agreed to and signed, the Japanese Intervention in Transamur and Eastern Karelian Revolt. These relations only worsened in 1925 after Kolchak's unsuccessful coup d'etat against the government of Kerensky's "German lapdogs". The rogue admiral managed to escape from Russia and, ironically, found refuge in the pro-Japanese state of Transamur, the power in which belonged to the Kwantung army and the richest Merkulov family. Having enlisted the support of the ataman of the Trans-Baikal Cossacks Semenov and the East Siberian Oblastniks, as well as the support of Tokyo, Kolchak again found himself in the chair of the Supreme Ruler, but this time with a clear goal - to finish what he had started and overthrow the Petrograd regime."

This incident has stuck with Shumyatsky, continually reminding him of the corruption within the Tsarist government based in Petrograd. A former Bolshevik, Shumyatsky was forced to leave Russia upon the conclusion of the Russian Civil War and has become an influential politician within Transamur. Despite his political views shifting towards the right, Shumyatsky continues to pursue the goal of turning Transamur into a welfare state.

Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after six years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many others work to maintain, the matters of the constant syndicalist threat and the lack of a male heir of his body, weigh heavily on him. The nascent feelings of powerlessness, even in his current position as a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."

BBR_WEB_DUBOIS_POLITICS_DESC:0 "From an early day, William Edward Burghardt Du Bois would fight for equality, fight against intolerance, and go to any means for his beliefs. He grew up in a small integrated community in Massachusetts and attended university and eventually became a professor. Du Bois was one of the founders of the NCAAP, and one of the leaders of the Niagara Group, a group that opposed Booker Washington’s Atlanta Compromise. However, this would be just a page in his lifelong fight for equality, as throughout he fought against Lynchings, Jim Crow laws, and other discriminatory practices. He used his prominence as an author to spread his message to the wider world, with many regarding his work as cornerstones in the fight for Civil Rights all across America. Yet as the nation fell apart, the civil rights dilemma fell on deaf ears to the establishment. And with the outbreak of Civil War, it became clear that equality would not be came by peacefully. As the Black Belt uprising took hold over the South, Du Bois took hold over the new state, and will now call upon his countrymen to fight for equality, justice and their lives. "
BBR_FATHER_DIVINE_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Even to his supporters, Reverend M. J. Divine comes off as a strange man, a man who claimed to be God Himself. Yet, despite all of his various eccentricities his Peace Party is now in charge of the Black Belt Republic, were he seeks to unite the nation under tolerance and peace. Little is known about his early life, with people only being able to guess at his date and location of birth, as well as his birth name. Throughout his life he was sentenced to prison many times, committed to mental asylums, and declared as a madman, though most of these arrests were on baseless claims. Yet he and his followers persevered, following Father Divine and his unique church around America, even as the nation collapsed. His charisma and style of preaching turning his congregation from a disorganized and small group of Black Patrons to a massive interracial congregation. And along with James F. Jones, he founded the peace party, the party that eventually took over the Black Belt Republic. Now he will lead his countrymen to the future, no matter what it may bring. "
BBR_CHARLES_YOUNG_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Charles Young was born into slavery yet would go on to free many from oppression. Young attended an all-white high school and graduated at the top of his class, then became a teacher himself before he became a cadet at West Point. While at West point, Young was faced with a slough of discrimination from his peers, yet despite it all he persevered and graduated. He later served with Calvary troops and in various National Parks across America. He was also sent as a Military Attaché to Haiti and Liberia. Young was close to being the first Black Man promoted to Brigadier General, but many white troops did not want to be outranked by an African American. Due to this, president at the time Woodrow Wilson vetoed his promotion; throughout the following years white officers attempted to deny Young his promotion. Throughout the rest of his life Young was faced with discrimination, and when his brethren rose up against oppression, Young was quick to offer his services to the new Black Belt Republic. Now, Young is in charge of the young state and will guide it forward under Rooseveltian and Americanist principles. "
BBR_ELIJAH_MUHAMMAD_POLITICS_DESC:0 "The Honourable Elijah Muhammad came from humble beginnings; he had little education, going to work in the factories after age 3. While living in Detroit, he attended rallies for various Black Nationalist organizations, including one with Wallace Fard Muhammad. He taught that African Americans could reclaim their culture and history through self determination, something that a young Elijah Muhammad agreed with considering his own struggles in the South. He became an ardent follower of Fard and his ideology. Eventually Fard turned leadership of the Detroit Chapter over to Muhammad, and had the organization renamed to the “Nation of Islam”. When Fard disappeared, Elijah Muhammad was quick to take leadership of the NOI. As America collapsed and the Black Revolt begun, Muhammad declared to his followers to rise up alongside them. And along with other Black Nationalists, he took over the young state. Now, he will ensure that Black America is gods land, and his people will never again be oppressed by the White Devil. "
BBR_MARCUS_GARVEY_POLITICS_DESC:0 "The Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey is one of the most fervent black nationalists around. The founder of UNIA has some reservations about the Black Belt Republic. But, seeing our willingness to pursue closer ties with Liberia, he has returned to claim the mantle of leadership for our young nation. A separatist at heart, Garvey hopes to create a Pan-African state. Even if he does accomplish this, he still hopes to retain the lands we have fought so hard for. He certainly will not give up the country to socialists, who he loathes more than almost anyone else. His ideology, fittingly termed "Garveyism", has caught on in the Black Belt Republic. Many of our citizens hope to migrate to Africa eventually, but this is a long term goal, and for now, there is still the issue of other American factions to contend with. "
POLITICS_DUSE_MUHAMMAD_DESC:0 "Duse Mohamad Ali is an Egyptian black nationalist who believes in the concept of a Pan-Africa. His mentor, George Wells Parker, has died and left his legacy to Ali, who promised to continue it. Their ideology of social nationalism has caught in the Black Belt Republic, and now Ali stands poised to make his long held dream come true. With the Hamitic League by his side, Ali will hold power for years to come, and one day, perhaps Africa will be free from outside control."

Though the ultimate struggle against the Syndicalists has been won, Edward now faces the challenges of trying to hold both Britain and the Empire together.

POLITICS_ARTHUR_HORNER_DESC:0 "Born in the mining town of Merthyr Tydfil in Southern Wales, the young Arthur Horner was very much a working-class lad. As the eldest surviving son of seventeen children, of whom only six lived past infancy, his career began in the mines of Wales, and the idealistic young man came into contact with the mining unions of Southern Wales, becoming a member.\nHe would continue his low-level political activism in Welsh mining unions until the British Revolution of 1925, when the Monarchy was forced out and the Union of Britain was declared by the Trade Union Congress.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Horner was a key organiser of Miner's strikes in Wales and played a large role in guaranteeing the support of Miner's unions of Wales. After the death of the revolutionary leader John Maclean, Horner became involved in the emerging factionalism of the TUC, becoming an important leader of the status quo Federationist faction, favouring the Unions and the status quo established after the 1925 revolution.\n\nHorner's big moment came when Philip Snowden retired from the position of General Secretary of the TUC, and Horner captured and canvassed enough votes to become the new General Secretary of what is the vanguard of Syndicalism in Europe. Socialist Britain stands united under its General Secretary, for better and worse times to come!"
POLITICS_PHILIP_SNOWDEN_DESC:0 "The mild-mannered Viscount almost shouldn't have been the Chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, yet somehow he is, and he is well liked by the factions of what is a viciously factional body. Snowden's victory is largely credited to his decision to avoid the fractional politics of the Trade Union Congress and how he showed himself to be an unaligned and neutral candidate, free of partiality. Since his assuming of the title of Chairman, Snowden has seen old faces go and new faces come in the TUC, but he has always remained a symbol of British post-revolutionary unity, always calming factional tensions wherever they come, and seeking to maintain a balance between all four factions- which is perhaps why he unopposed Mosley's bid for Exchequer. The former Liberal-turned-Syndicalist is perhaps the most normal figure in these strange times, always staying above and refusing to occupy his time with petty insults. As the 1936 Congress of Trade Unions approaches, Snowden has given many hints to his possible retirement- an uncomfortable reality to say the least."
POLITICS_TRADE_UNION_CONGRESS_DESC:0 "Until the next year, the Trade Union Congress will have to work without a Chairman."
POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralisation, and aggressive foreign policy."
POLITICS_NICLAS_GLAIS_DESC:0 "Niclas Y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural laborers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem "The Red Flag" is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."
POLITICS_ANNIE_KENNEY_DESC:0 "Annie Kenney, imprisoned by the old regime of Britain for militant women's suffrage activism, convinced many of the working women of Britain to join the Trade Union movement in the prelude to the British Revolution. Her advocacy massively inflated support for the revolution, and subsequently pressured the new socialist government to grant political rights to women.\n\nOriginally run as candidate for TUC chair by the pacifist Congregationist faction in protest of the TUC's alleged failure to secure equality between men and women, through cooperation with the more orthodox Federationist faction, Kenney has become the first chairwoman of the TUC."
POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following electoral gridlock. Mann, though a Leninist, has shown great historical commitment to the Trade Union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service. Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."
POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "To some, Lawrence is a New Cromwell, hellbent on shaping England in his dictatorial image. To others, Lawrence is the protector of British Democracy, and the savoir of the nation. Many things can be said about Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg. However, despite people’s views on him, one thing is a fact: His power over Britain is undeniable. Lawrence, charismatic yet reserved, has made ambiguous promises to the British people regarding Britain's future. While his past dedication to the Syndicalist cause is undeniable, many now fear that his power may go to his head; and he could end up being no better than the man he deposed. "
POLITICS_CLEM_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Clem Attlee, shocked and disgusted by the poverty he witnessed while working at youth charity, became a prominent figure within the Independent Labour Party, and eventually the Trade Union movement. His activism, however, was cut short by the Weltkrieg.\nAttlee served on multiple fronts during war, and was eventually promoted to the rank of major. While Attlee's army service did instill in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."
POLITICS_BARBARA_CASTLE_DESC:0 "Barbara Castle, as a girl of only fifteen, led the children of her secondary girls' school in a rising in support of the British Revolution. The quirky red-haired girl quickly became a cultural icon throughout the newly established Union of Britain.\nAs she grew into a young woman, Castle again came into the public eye as the first female leader of the Oxford Students' Union, and never again left it. She became an increasingly vocal Congregationist, and eventually challenged the leadership of the admittedly magnanimous Annie Kenney.\n\nAs chairwoman of the TUC, Castle has vowed to fight the injustices that still plague the Union of Britain, especially inequities between men and women."
POLITICS_ERIC_BLAIR_DESC:0 "Eric Blair, the famous writer who helped propel his long-time ally Oswald Mosley to political prominence, came gradually to oppose Mosley. At every opportunity, Mosley seemed to tread upon the principles of the Union of Britain and the revolution which created it.\n\nBlair, with political triumph over his old friend, has vowed to restore to the people of Britain the freedoms Mosley so egregiously stripped from them."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_GALLACHER_DESC:0 "William Gallacher founded the Labour Withholding Committee in opposition to the Weltkrieg era Munitions Act. Jailed in his native Glasgow for undermining the war effort, Gallacher became increasingly radicalised. Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nGallacher, though initially opposed to Niclas y Glais's devolution efforts, has become satisfied with the current state of affairs."

## Uruguay ##
POLITICS_URG_CNA_DESC:0 "With the 1917 constitutional referendum and a constituent assembly in 1918, a new constitution was enacted in 1919 by President Baltasar Brum, which stated that the executive power has to be shared between the President of the Republic and the 'Consejo Nacional de Administracion' ('National administration Council'). The council is made by nine members that are elected every six years, which generally are six from the ruling party and three from the opposition. The role of the president belongs to the council candidate with the most votes, but he can be only responsible for Foreign Affairs, National Security and Agriculture, whereas the NCA is responsible for the rest of the executive branch responsibilities."
POLITICS_GABRIEL_TERRA_DESC:0 "José Luis Gabriel Terra was born in 1873, in Montevideo. He graduated as a lawyer in 1895, where he later became a minister for President Claudio Willman, where he proved great expertise in economic and diplomatic affairs. Later on, he became one of the members of the Constituent Assembly in 1917 and was a minister during Baltasar Brum's rule. He is affiliated to the Partido Colorado, although he has proven to have opposing views with the leader of the party, Jose Battle Ordóñez. He's a known conservative and authoritarian, and now that he rules Uruguay, he'll try to centralize his power, balance the state's budget and avoid liberal and progressive reforms."
POLITICS_ALFREDO_FERRARI_DESC:0 "Alfredo Baldomir Ferrari was born in 1884, in the small town of Paysandú. He graduated from the Military academy in 1905, and later on he studied to become an architect, alternating between his two careers until reaching the rank of general in 1935. Now he's been named military governor of Uruguay, and while he has shown leniency towards his rebellious citizens, he still has to maintain order in the country, and will suppress any group that might dare disturb it."
POLITICS_EMILIO_FRUGONI_DESC:0 "Emilio Frugoni Queirolo was born in 1880, in Montevideo. He was already a political activist when he was in highschool, and took part in the 1904 civil war defending the government of José Battle y Ordoñez. When the war was over, he formed the 'Centro Obrero Socialista' which would start the process of creating the 'Partido Socialista de Uruguay' in 1910, with Frugoni as its general secretary. He became deputy for that party in 1916 and 1920, however, with the fall of Britain and France to syndicalism, many of his party became to radicalize, turning his party into the 'Partido Sindicalista de Uruguay', whose advocation of violence forced Frugoni to leave the party he created, and has since then been rebuilding the Uruguayan Socialist Party.\n\nIn his words, 'Socialism is not violence, nor dispossession, nor redistribution', and now that he is in power, he shall respect the Uruguayan constitution and political system while at the same time trying to peacefully lead it to the revolutionary ideals he champions."
POLITICS_PAULINA_LUISI_DESC:0 "Paulina Luisi Janicki was born in 1875, in Colón, Entre Rios Province, Argentina. Born to an Italian father and polish mother, they moved shortly after to Paysandú and then finally settled in Montevideo in 1887. She became the first Uruguayan woman to study medicine when she began her career in the 'Universidad de la Republica' in 1900, where she graduated as a physician in 1908.\n\nShe afiliated the Partido Socialista de Uruguay when it was founded in 1910, where she found the place to fight for cultural and civil rights for women in a political platform, and then went on to create the 'Consejo Nacional de la Mujer Uruguaya' and the 'Alianza Uruguaya de Mujeres' in 1919. She later went on to France to specialize in Dermatology and venereal diseases. She then witnessed the events of the French Syndicalist revolution herself, which inspired her to take those ideals back to Uruguay. Now that she is in power, she plans to follow the example of her European Comrades."
POLITICS_JUAQIN_ILLA_DESC:0 "Joaquin Secco Illa was born in 1879, in Montevideo. He graduated the 'Universidad de la Republica' as a Lawyer and was designated professor of civil rights of that university in 1906. He formed the 'Union Civica del Uruguay' in 1912 as a christian democrat party, but rejoined with the 'Blanco Party' later on. A known conservative and Christian, now that he sits in the Palacio Estevez, he shall lead Uruguay prioritizing christian values and stability over progress."
POLITICS_LUIS_ALBERTO_DE_HERRERA_DESC:0 "Luis Alberto de Herrera y Quevedo was born in 1873, in Montevideo. He graduated with a doctorate in Law and Social sciences from the 'Universidad de la Republica'. He participated in the 1897 revolution by the Partido Blanco in and left for the US in 1901, where he served as ambassador for Uruguay. In 1920 he was chosen as director of the Partido Nacional and was the president of the CNA from 1925 to 1927.\n\nWhile his reputation is far from perfect, with multiple conflicts with more radical and progressive factions within the PN, he has proven in the past that he has a genuine concern for the well-being of the Uruguayan citizens and workers. Now that he leads Uruguay, he shall focus on reducing government intervention on the economy, improving the agrarian economy instead of industrializing Uruguay and, inspired by Alexis de Tocqueville's writings, increase the local autonomy of each city and town within Uruguay."
POLITICS_LUIZ_CONRADO_BATLLE_BERRES_DESC:0 "Luis Conrado Battle Berres was born in 1897, in Montevideo. He became an orphan when he was eleven, and went to live with his uncle, Jose Battle y Ordoñez. While he was living with his uncle, Jose managed to become president of Uruguay, and inspired Luis to sign up in the 'Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de la Republica', where he graduated as a lawyer and joined the Partido Colorado, and thanks to his uncle's connections, has remained a popular choice in the party as a deputy, and now even managing to become a presidential candidate.\n\nDespite his young age and inexperience, the legacy of his uncle, which many regard with having transformed Uruguay into the 'Switzerland of South America', is still alive in the memory of many Uruguayans. As his uncle, he'll champion the ideals of his new 'Batllismo', an interventionist state which shall guarantee social plans for the poor and progressive reforms for the disenfranchised."
POLITICS_JUAN_DE_AMEZAGA_DESC:0 "Juan Jose de Amézaga Landaraso was born in 1881, in Montevideo. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad de la Republica' in 1905, and traveled for a year and half between Germany and France. His experience in Europe brought him closer to the ideals of Batllismo, and joined up the Colorado Party as soon as he had returned. He became a deputy for the town of Durazno in 1908 with only twenty-seven years, receiving praise and support from Jose Battle y Ordoñez himself. He has since then climbed through the ranks and now that he sits in the Palacio Estévez, he's bound to continue the old Batllist policies."

POLITICS_LACERDA_TOT_RJM_DESC:0 "Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda was born in 1914, the year the weltkrieg started, and his very name is significant to understand him; Carlos comes from Karl Marx, Frederico from Friedrich Engels, as his father was a socialist activist as well who greatly admired the duo; In time, he followed in his father's footsteps, and joined the CGT and became a full time leftist activist as early as 1932, when he put his law degree on the backseat to focus on the political realm entirely. Long involved in the Demoratic Left and before that the CGT, he found himself rapidly rising in the ranks of brazilian syndicalist circles, thanks to his no nonsense attitude and oratory talent; albeit some claim this is due to his father's influence, not his own talent. His faith in syndicalism is unabated by the crises that followed the past decade on the world, and he took an active part on bringing it to his home. Now, has taken up the great responsibility of leading his new nation, and to finish the fight against the capitalist rot of former Brazil for good, and seeks to implement extensive reforms on almost all matters of state. However, his somewhat aggressive demeanour may result in issues both domestically and abroad when it comes to close negotiations."
POLITICS_MINERVINO_OLIVER_RJM_DESC:0 "Like many of Brazil's poor, Minervino de Oliveira began to work as a child, and from his earliest years of adulthood he already was an influential union member, and also was an early member of the Brazilian Syndicalist Party and contributed to leftist newspapers. By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defense of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key point in the ideologically charged and contentious race. Thrusted into his new position by the liberation of his land, Mangabeira is the first of hopefully many leaders of this relatively young nation, and hopes to create a legacy of equality and prosperity that will contrast with the terrible legacy left behind by Brazil and its political cronies."
POLITICS_CARLOS_LUZ_RJM_DESC:0 "Carlos Coimbra da Luz was born in 1894 in a small town in the state of Minas Gerais, but later moved to the capital of Belo Horizonte to study, but the man always considered the town of Leopoldina, where his residence is located and where had had multiple terms as mayor. Having only recently joined the national stage of politics, Luz became a federal representative only recently in the 1936 elections with the ED, but since then has managed to maintain a steady political career, but always distrusted the further left members of that alliance, whom he saw as spies for foreign countries at best. An accomplished man who has performed varied roles, such as teachers, police captain and bank manager, Luz both understands the economic realities of the nation's hinterlands and the poverty that it's small towns have to endure, and has always positioned himself in favour of a less centralized taxation system, which is an oddity in his own party."
POLITICS_JK_RJM_DESC:0 "Hailing from the city of Diamantina in Minas Gerais, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira is the mother of a Mineiro father and a Czech mother, his middle name being the germanized spelling of Kubícek. After his father's death very early on his life, he began his studies, and eventually graduated from medical school and volunteered to aid in medical service during the Interstate War, and began his by now very long political career. Now faced with the challenge of ruling a nation wracked by war and in dire administrative straits, JK, as he is known by the people, has to not only deal with the ever competitive oligarchic politicians, but also with the ever looming threat of debt, as most taxation infrastructure did not make it past the war. But he also has big plans for both Rio and Belo Horizonte, cities in dire need of extensive public works, but already many in his opposition call these planes a ''hurricane of spending'', and yet he remains undeterred. Opposition to said remodeling is going to be especially complicated in Rio, where many attempts to do so have been thwarted in the past decades by numerous mayors and presidents."
POLITICS_TANCREDO_NEVES_RJM_DESC:0 "Born in 1910 in the city of São João del-Rei, southern Minas Gerais, Tancredo de Almeida Neves started to take an interest in politics as early as age nine, and already as a young man he opposed the then ruling party of his home state in the crisis that sparked the Interstate War. While he at first tried to volunteer for opposition militias, his remarkably poor aim and physical disposition had him rejected, and he spent the war at home, while having difficulties finding a job during the economic depression that hit the nation. Some years after the  interstate war, he joined the Republican party and began the slow climb through it's ranks, becoming a representative at city hall and the state legislature before heading to Rio's parliament. While his loyalties certainly lie with the Republicans, his somewhat moderate stances on key issues gave him a meaningful leg over other candidates, in what was a fairly contested election, even if the wanton violence of the war has been long left behind. His stances on economic and social issues are also why he has a relatively stable control of the upper and lower houses, but the complicated landscape left by the war may well surprise even the most skilled of politicians."

Even though he is a very successful liberal and a respected literary intellectual, he always had to deal with the looming shadow that his father, former President of Brazil Afonso Pena, whose achievements and legacy always seemed difficult to deal with, but now he too has become a head of state and a president of his own right, but unlike his father, who was frustrated at every turn by powerful landlords and political opponents, Junior is determined to advance and modernize this newborn nation nation to the standard enjoyed by European powers, especially in its farthest reaches, both in terms of education and infrastructure development. However, said endeavours are certainly easier planned than followed through, even with a relative control over the ever turbulent politics of Rio and Minas, there is no shortage of opposition for the so called radical ideas put forward by Afonso."
POLITICS_ARAKEN_OLIVEIRA_HOS_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Araken de Oliveira has always had the interests of Brazil at heart throughout his distinguished military career. A war veteran and respected officer, his current position as head of state is in no doubt due to the fact that only the remnants of the brazilian army can maintain law and order throughout Vera Cruz. While the suspension, at least for now, of any kind of elections for executive power is indeed a harsh measure, harsh measures have to be taken if this young nation is to succeed in re-establishing the rule of law in both its cities and hinterlands, a task Araken has to undertake for the sake of his home."
POLITICS_BELISARIUS_PITY_DESC:0 "Belisário Augusto de Oliveira Penna was born in Barbacena, Minas Gerais, in 1868, and began his political career as a city councillor in Juiz de Fora, and only in the 1920s he projected himself outside of his home state, positioning himself in favour of right wing tenentist uprisings. For most of his life, he was a doctor and has a belief in scientific principles being applied to politics and governments. While a supporter of radical integralism, he often found himself marginalized even among that radical movement due to his beliefs regarding eugenics, a concept which he pioneered in Brazil, and he was for many years a member of the Central Eugenics Committee. These viewpoints have also granted him many allies and admirers that share similar beliefs, and now he and his associates are in a prime position to apply their ideas as practical principle, to ensure the great cities of the land like Rio are finally cleansed of its poverty and superstition that hide under the guise of 'local culture'. Belisário is also a supporter of utilizing political prisoners as a workforce, a controversial and divisive viewpoint even among the right winger clique that now form his cabinet."
POLITICS_BIG_MOURA_JR_DESC:0 "Olympio Mourão Filho was born in 1900, in Diamantina, Minas Gerais. Having followed a fairly standard military career, his first active combat duty was during the interstate war, where he was among the defeated officers that sided with the federal government. He has since completely and utterly lost faith in the very concept of liberal democracy, and has written books on the subject of a new kind of state, an ''Integral Democracy''. His republican beliefs have kept him somewhat distanced from the AIB, even if they did enjoy his full support in their ideals of dismantling the carcass of the republic as it currently stood. To him, an organic democracy is the conclusion of his studies and ideology, which also changed as the war took a turn for the worse. Now in a position to truly rule and liberate the lands of Vera Cruz from the blight of marxism and liberalism, Mourão leads the newly formed integralist movement in conjunction with similarly minded officers, even if many of the more monarchic elements have been tossed to the wayside, and will do everything in his power to ensure that his political mantra, where the Army, Navy and Paramilitary Militias sustain a united and strong integralist state where faith in God and in the nation are the principles to be maintained, instead of idolatry of wealth and syndicalism."

POLITICS_SIR_EUSTACE_FIENNES_DESC:0 "Sir Eustace Edward Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes was given the title of Governor-General of the West Indies Federation on June 26th of 1925. Having previous experience with war, governorship of the West Indies, and politics within the United Kingdom itself, he's known for not being silent on his political opinions regarding the Federation. Some rumours have flown by stating that he plans on intervening in politics himself if the 1937 election gets out of control, but no substantial proof of these rumours has been supplied yet."

Born in Grenada, Butler was unable to find work after completing his primary school education at the Anglican School, and chose to join the British West Indies Regiment when he was 17, fighting for the United Kingdom in the Weltkrieg and stationed in Egypt.\n\nAfter returning home in 1918, he became active politically, being influential in the establishment of the Grenada Representative Government Movement and the Grenada Union of Returned Soldiers.\n\nIn 1921, he moved to Trinidad, where he was exposed to the political thought of Marcus Garvey. He came to prominence in 1935, when he led a Hunger March in Port of Spain, and became an incredibly influential figure in West Indian socialism. Now, he leads the British Citizens' and Workers Home Rule Party and hopes to elevate the position of trade unions."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_LAGROSILLIERE_DESC:0 "Joseph Lagrosillière was born in Martinique on the 2nd of November, 1872. A very active French politician, Lagrosillière founded the Socialist Federation of Martinique (a branch of the SFIO on the island), and its newspaper Le Prolétaire.\n\nLagrosillière broke with the Parisian socialists in 1913, however, as they did not support the assimilation of colonies. Lagrosillière is a strong proponent of turning colonies into Departments, and the Federation of Martinique, without Lagrosillière, fell apart. It was revived in 1924 as the Second Federation. However, Lagrosillière continued his socialist advocacy in the Caribbean, continuing to become a politician in the West Indies Federation after the Weltkrieg.\n\nIn 1919, he made an electoral alliance with Fernand Clerc, a Béké industrialist on the island, which alienated him from his old socialist allies that criticized his 'alliance with capitalists'. He was arrested in 1925 for inciting trouble and violence, and again in 1931 for influence peddling.\n\nNow, Lagrosillière leads the PA and the West Indies into a new era of social democracy."
POLITICS_AIME_CESAIRE_DESC:0 "Born in 1913 on the island of Martinique, Aimé was from an early age greatly inspired by his grandfather Fernand Césaire who had been the first black teacher in the French colony who passed down a great deal of literary and scholarly aptitude to his grandson. After working his way through high school, Aimé Césaire journeyed to the Commune of France in 1931, disgusted with the colonial system of the West Indies and seeking to pursue the kind of higher education he had been unable to attain on his home island. During his sojourn at the Sorbonne University, he joining with a cadre of other black students, eventually founding a newspaper dubbed "L'Étudiant Noir" which promoted anti imperialist ideals and railed against the exiled French Republic's treatment of their colonial subjects. Aimé also coined the term Négritude, a literary movement promoting a revitalisation of African and Caribbean culture, as well as condemned the irreparable damage caused by the "decadent, morally degenerated parasites" who had oppressed his people. Due to his increasing conflicts with fellow students and teachers in the Commune, which he attributed to racial tensions and prejudice, Aimé eventually chose to return back to the West Indies Federation, just in time to bear witness to the people of the Caribbean cast off their chains. Invigorated by the struggle for liberation, he directed his revolutionary zeal and anti colonial fury towards building up and impressive line of credentials, penning radical treatises and holding fiery speeches on what he desired and demanded the new socialist government must due for the victims of imperialism. It was no surprise that in time, Césaire took it upon himself to see this dreams made reality, in a few years managing to rise to the top of the new Federation's political sphere."

Furthering his education, Fan leanred Russian at the Xinjiang russian Law School, and made efforts to promote cohesion between the newly arrived Russian immigrants to Aksu. In 1920, Governor Yang Zengxin appointed Fan as Xinjiang's representative to Russia, wherin Fan negotated a deal to end Russian tarrifs to Xinjiang until 1940.

Yang Zengxin was impressed by Ma Shaowu's loyalty, and appointed him to dispose of the warlord Ma Fuxing in 1924. Ma Shaowu was given the Dao-Yin of Hotan as a reward. Ma Shaowu's policy as Dao-Yin leaned more towards opposing aggressive Russian immigration, and held Ughiers and Mongolian residents in low regard.

The ensuing years of revolution depelted Yang's administrative staff, pusing Jin higher until he was appointed Comissioner of Civil Affairs in Urmuqi in 1927.

First fighting under Zhang Soulin in 1924, Sheng became incensed at the anti-intellectual policies Zhang esposed, and left for Japan once again to recieve more military training. Upon the faiture of the Northern Expedition, Sheng returned to China and joined the Guominjun under Fang Yuxiang in 1928. Following the destruction of Gansu, Sheng took a job offer from Fan Yaonan to lead the Aksu Garrison.

His family was poor and he received little schooling in his early years. In 1912, after the Xinhai Revolution, Burhan accompanied Tatar merchants to Dihua in Xinjiang and worked as an apprentice and store-clerk. In 1914, Burhan was able to apply and receive Chinese citizenship from the Republic of China on account of his family's ancestry. He spoke Uyghur, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Turkish and some Arabic and acted as the interpreter for Xinjiang Governor Yang Zengxin. Burhan's relations to the Turkic community soured as a result of working under Yang Zengxin, and fellow Ughiers began to ostracize Burhan. Burhan's meager position in Yang's administration meant he was unable to mend this distrust, and the Ughier community's drift towards rebellion alienated Burhan further. Ultimately Burhan choose to attend courses at Baoding Army School starting in 1929, allwoging him to be hired by Yang as both an administrator and officer. Upon Burhan's return to Xinjiang in 1934, he found the administration in decline, and unable to correct the widening gap between the Ughier community and has resigned himself to being an effective public servant under what he considers the best possible administration to industrialize Xinjiang.

To this end, he now seeks to establish control over the Yemeni hinterland, establish a modern standing army, and establishing clear rules for succession of hereditary governorships, all while keeping a close eye on the tumultuous political environment in Sana'a itself.

This may have been due to rumors that his family was descended from Yemeni Jews. Instead, Ahmad was educated in western logic at the al Madrassa al Ahliyya. This school eventually played host to Ahmad's reform group Nadi a Islah. The Nadi a Islah saw both the Mutawakkili kingdom and the Ottoman Caliphate as relics that held back Yemen. He formed a program that disguised social reforms behind the terminology of reactionaries. Promoting the Good and Preventing the Bad was allowed his rebellion to sway otherwise conservatives Yemenis. Ultimately, this proclamation for Yemen was to ease change into a country badly divided."

POLITICS_YUNNAN_TANG_JIYAO_DESC:0 "A loyal follower of General Cai E, Tang began his political career in 1911, when Cai E ordered him to take part in the Wuchan Uprising, beggining the Xinhai Revolution. After the success of the revolution, he became governor of Guizhou and would later return to his home province of Yunnan in 1913 to replace Cai E. When Yuan Shikai announced his ambitions of becoming an Emperor, Tang immediately seceded with the support of the likes of Cai E and Li Liejun, who would spearhead the National Protection War alongside Tang. With their victory in the National Protection War, Yunnan became one of the main hegemons of the continent.\nSince then, Yunnan's glory days have long since faded away. Tang has led one failed expedition after another, with his failure in defeating Sichuan causing him to almost be deposed by Gu Pinzhen in a coup d'etat in 1921. However, the failure of the Northern Expedition became a blessing for Tang's control over Yunnan. With the threat of the Zili Clique and their German Patrons looming in the distance, the presence of the surviving NRA members as well as Tang's own forces have largely deterred them from taking action against a seemingly hostile Republican province. However, Tang's flamboyant and over ambitious character have largely alienated many of the officers residing in Yunnan, and his control over the province is much weaker than it seems from the outside."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_ZHU_PEIDE_DESC:0 "A scion of a distinguished Lufeng family, Zhu Peide could trace among his ancestors proud servants to the Ming Dynasty and loyal administrators of the Qing Empire. Despite his lineage, he alligned himself to Dr Sun Yat-sen's cause as a zealous and scholarly revolutionary. After a brief stint in Jiangxi as the province's chairman and a lengthy career in the Kuomintang, Zhu Peide fled into exile after the KMT's failed Northern Expedition. Alongside most of the remaining 3rd NRA army, he returned back to his home region of Yunnan, beginning to build up a new career within Tang Jiyao's administration.\nWhen Tang's government fell, Zhu Peide seized the oppertunity to rally the remnants of the Rightist Kuomintang and denounce Long Yun's takeover. Alongside his comrades, he marched west for Kunming and lead a successful takeover. Now comfortably seated in the capital of Yunnan, he has sworn to rebuild a National Government, honoring Sun Yat-Sen's legacy."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LU_HAN_DESC:0 "Rumors have long circulated that Lu Han was the alleged half-brother of Long Yun, which is said to have been one of the reasons behind the two men's close comradeship. Whether that is the truth or not, it seems that whatever bond of blood or friendship existed between the two was not thick enough to prevent Lu Han from seizing this latest opportunity. The young Yi general has served with the Kuomintang, fought with the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang of Indochina, and now lead a daring coup against his former comrades. Lu has desperately gathered his forces in the capital and has set out to weather the coming storm. Yet the men around him wonder: can a man who betrayed his own supposed brother really be trusted?"
POLITICS_YUNNAN_HU_RUOYU_DESC:0 "The new administration was not to last, as the men who ousted Tang Jiyao have now turned their knives and guns on each other. Hu Ruoyu has made the first move, making a play to control the capital with the aid of his small band of followers. Unlike his peers, Hu came from a privileged family of scholars and landlords, yet found himself drawn to the revolutionary politics of the early 20th century. Under the patronage of Tang Jiyao, he climbed the ranks of the Yunnanese Army, eventually landing a comfortable position in the Kunming Military staff. With deep pockets and close connections to the officers and garrisons of the capital, Hu has made a risky gamble to oust and arrest his co-conspirators, proclaiming himself as Yunnan's new leader. Now time will tell if that risk will pay off..."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LONG_YUN_DESC:0 "In his youth, Long Yun became inspired by the radical Anti-Qing student movements among his peers at the Yunnan Military Academy. He joined a local militia and fought in the Xinghai revolution, climbing through the ranks until he was serving under Tang Jingyu as commander of the Fifth Army, within the Yunnan Clique. His rise to power was helped by the close comradeship he held with his superior, as well as his alleged half-brother Lu Han. Yet in time, these friendships would be tainted with political rivalry and a heated competition for power in the declining revolutionary movement. It has taken many sacrifices, many betrayals and certainly regrets, yet Long Yun has now risen to lead the Yunnan Clique as its new warlord.\nLong's hold over Yunnan is tenuous but determined, he holds plenty of ambitions to remain a leading figurehead for the coming years, yet just like how he ousted his predecessor there's a distinct risk his own subordinates could turn on him at any minute. This is not helped by Long's ethnic background as a member of the Yi minority, although it has helped foster friendships between his administration and his kinsfolk. A pragmatist, an outsider to the Han political elite, and an ambitious warlord: 'The Dragon of Yunnan' may be a force for China to reckon with."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_ZHU_DE_DESC:0 "Famed as a man who rose from humble beginnings, Zhu De was nothing bit a dirt poor peasant, a simple tentant farmer in the Sichuan countryside. At nine years of age, he was taken in by a wealthy uncle and later sent to study at Yunnan Military Academy. His time at the academy saw him enlist in the Tongmenhui, the predecessor to the Kuomintang. The next years in Zhu De's life were a turbulent series of travels throughout China, fighting at various revolutionary fronts with the National Republican Army, serving various political factions and building up a great network of connections. From Sichuan to Shanghai, Tibet and even a brief stint as a student in Berlin, the roads of fate eventually lead Zhu De back to Yunnan. In recent years he fell afoul of the warlord Tang Jiyao's despotism, being driven to resign his position in the National Republican Army and promise to abstain from politics rather than face an umpteenth journey around the Asian continent.\nZhu De had perhaps expected to spend the rest of his life as a teacher at the Yunnan Military Academy, yet the news that Tang's government had fallen, and that all hell was breaking loose in Yunnan convinced him resurface from obscurity. Outwitting and outlasting the failed would-be despots of Yunnan, Zhu has set out with a simple goal, to here in Yunnan build the moral and responsible democratic institutions which he has studied, taught and dreamed of."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_LI_XIN_DESC:0 "Li Xin initially attended a German Private school in Kunming, where after he would study at various universities around the country. He first studied agronomy in Nanjing's South Eastern University, but was transferred to Beijing Agriculture University. During his stay in the Northern capital he became increasingly interested by foreign political thought, studying the failed Bolshevik movement in Russia and the now ascendant Syndicalist ideology in Europe. Throughout the 20s he grew increasingly closer to Syndicalism and later with other radical students at the university to form a political group named the "Renovation Society" in order to promote leftist views. After graduating in 1926, he traveled to Guangzhou and attended a lecture held by the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang on Agricultural Socialism. Although Li was at this point enamoured with Syndicalism, he accepted a request from the political representatives to join the Communist Party and help organise a political movement back in his home province of Yunnan. Dubbed the "Yunnan Special Branch", this group was initially meant to collaborate with its superiors but lost contact with the mother party following the failure of the Northern Expedition.\nLi, as one of the key figures in the group began to apply the same ideological currents which had dominated the Renovation Society, building an underground intellectual society of Syndicalist radicals in the heart of Kunming. This lead to a large schism between those loyal to the Special Branch's original beliefs, and Li's Syndicalist influence, eventually leading to Li's party founding 'Xindianshe' or 'The New Society' as a separate group. Despite his revolutionary convictions, Li has managed to remain below the radar of Tang's government. Initially several warlords in Yunnan were aware of his leftist beliefs, but had little reason to persecute a simple agricultural scholar. That all changed when Li Xin journeyed to various Yunnanese tin mines, hoping to organize the workers into a union. He even disguised himself as a miner, toiling away in hopes of growing closer to the proletariat. After organizing a wildcat strike in 1929 Li was almost arrested and executed, which forced him to go into hiding. Since then he has continued to grow his political influence, hoping to once more unite the Yunnanese workers and show the warlords what power truly lies in the hands of the proletariat."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_WANG_FUSHENG_DESC:0 "Wang's life was uneventful until he was admitted to Beijing University's Liberal Arts program. Early on he began to associate with radical student groups, getting to know several influential figures such as Li Xin and Li Dazhou. While many of his comrades dabbled in studying the newly resurgent Syndicalist movement that was sweeping through Europe and America, Wang remained a committed Marxist. He later joined Li Xin's "Renovation Society", a leftist group which promoted socialist ideology at Beijing University. During this time he witnessed many of his comrades be repressed, arrested and even executed by the Beijing government, driving him down a vengeful and authoritarian path. Much like his colleague Li Xin, he met with members of the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang, being similarly instructed to travel back to Yunnan and organize socialists within the province. The hope was to topple the warlord Tang Jiyao's hold over the south west, by founding a 'Yunnan Special Branch' of the Communist Party that could ferment revolution.\nYet the Special Branch was nearly annihilated when the Northern Expedition failed, and its superiors among the CPC and Leftist Kuomintang ended up scattered to the wind. Worst of all for Wang, his own comrades now began to turn on him. Rejecting the old authorities they had followed and beginning to rally around Li Xin's own syndicalist views. Outraged, Wang seized control of the special branch and moved to expel Li. During his tenure as leader of the underground revolutionary society, he worked to regain contact with whatever remnants of the Kuomintang or CPC might still be organized and continuing the fight in China. After years of silence and falls leads, he finally found them. The ZhongTeJu, and through a series of secret meetings, encoded messages and risky plans, the Yunnan Special Branch was restored to its original purpose: To ferment revolution against the Yunnan warlords. Despite his new superiors and the schism with his old comrades, Wang remains diligently committed to one single goal, revolution before all."

In 1922 he was appointed acting governor of Yunnan as part of the leadup to the Northern Expedition. After a mere month in office Jin was pressured to resign by Tang Jiyao in a political soft coup. Having lost his prestigeous position in Yunnan, he attached himself to Chiang Kai Chek's forces, but the Kuomintang's failed military campaign put another stop to Jin's ambitions. Facing obscurity or exile, the young commander was surprised to see his usurper, Tang Jiyao extend an olive branch after the Manchu Restoration and invite him back to Kunming. With a desperate need for competent, republican generals, Jin and Tang have to overlook their mutual distaste for each other and prepare for the inevitable confrontation with their northern enemy. As the democratic forces lick their found, Jin has also had the chance to reunite with some old friends, such as his former classmate Zhu De. In addition to his military work, Jin Handing is also a renowned teetotaler, leading a political campaign against the mass consumption of tobacco, opium and alcohol within the National Republican Army."

Despite this unruly nature, he joined the military and became a renowned and obedient soldier. During this time, he was noticed by Tang Jiyao and promoted to a higher position, climbing the ranks through the National Republican Army until he had the honor of serving as Dr Sun Yat-sen's bodyguard. During the Northern Expedition, he was wounded in combat and hospitalized, an event that likely saved his life during the disasterous military campaign. After recovering, he joined his exiled comrades in Yunnan, making use of his friendship with Tang to easily join the warlord's inner circle of confidants."

Tang was reccomended to the Yunnan Military Academy, becoming famed as a child progedy. Although he initially participated in the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, he did not serve at the frontlines. Instead, he worked as a teacher and military educator. Like many of his comrades, he fled to Yunnan when news arrived of Chiang Kai Chek's death. While more accustomed to discussing strategy and teaching he was recently urged to return to the officer staff by the Yunnan Clique's warlord, Tang Jiyao."

He studied medicine and worked as a teacher, until his friend Li Hongxiang introduced him to general Cai E. Already enamoured with the revolutionary movement, Fan abandoned his academic career and joined Cai's army. The constant struggles and repeated failures of the Kuomintang to consolidate their hold over China eventually lead Fan to retire from the military, taking up work as a doctor in Kunming. He was content to remain as an apolitical civilian, until he caught Tang Jiyao's attention. Already familiar with each other from their time in the revolution, Tang managed to convince his old comrade to return to the army. Fan has now traded in his robes and rickshaw for a uniform and rifle, attaching himself to the recovering republican movement."

POLITICS_YUNNAN_ZHAO_XINGWU_DESC:0 "Zhao travelled to Kunming and attended Yunnan Law School in 1917. Although he was too young to participate in the Xinhai Revolution or the National Protection War, the stories of what was happening around China thrilled him. During his stay in Kunming he began reading political literature, both the more mainstream democratic manifestos but also digging into forbidden communist propaganda that had been outlawed under the warlord Tang Jiyao's rule. After attempting to organize political activities among his fellow students, he was expelled from the school. Outraged at this censorship, Zhao decided to leave Yunnan and join the Kuomintang's armies to the east. During the coming military campaigns he served as an officer under Zhu Peide, distinguishing himself thanks to his analytical mind and aptitude for strategic thinking. It was also around this time he first joined the Communist Party of China, but his hopes of working with fellow socialists both within the party and the Kuomintang was short lived. The failure of the Northern Expedition broke the democratic and socialist movements in southern China, forcing Zhao to flee back to Yunnan alongside his superior Zhu Peide. During his exile, he distanced himself from both the other rightist Kuomintang exiles. He began to correspond and meet with various members of the now scattered leftists, becoming a key liaison to them in Yunnan. Zhao has gone from leading students, soldiers and now exiles, but despite it all he still maintains a great skill for leadership and a zealous devotion to socialist ideals."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_GONG_SHOU_DESC:0 "The latest in a long line of Yi Tusi, a form of regional hereditary chieftain in the old imperial bureaucracy, Gong Shou rose to prominence thanks to his unscrupulous political flexibility and zealous defence of the southern minorities' autonomy. Although initially born with the name Dāo Yuè Chūn, he served as Tusi of the Nandian Prefecture up until the Xinhai Revolution. Sensing political change sweeping through China, Shou changed his name to Gong and began to promote an elaborate story that his family were in reality descendants of Ming dynasty soldiers who had occupied Yunnan. The decision to pass himself off as a member of the Han ethnicity earned Shou a considerable degree of influence in the post-revolutionary political climate, which he used to campaign against the attempted land reforms that would weaken the Yi people and their Tusi's autonomy. Although it landed him a stint in prison, he was later released and continued to live with this unique ethnic duality, spending some days as the Han politician Gong Shou and others as the Yi Chieftain Dao YueChun."

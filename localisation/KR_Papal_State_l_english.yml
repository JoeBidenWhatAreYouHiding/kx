Papal_States:0 "Papal State Focus Tree"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_COLLEGE_CARDINALS_DESC:0 "While the conclave is in session, Carmelengo Eugenio Pacelli holds de facto administrative roles. however the Holy See is officially empty, and the Papal State thus lacks a Head of State formally. The conclave is usually a time consuming process that may set the State and the Church itself in a brand new path for decades to come."

### Ideas ###
PAP_future_past_idea:0 "Stuck Between the Future and the Past"
PAP_future_past_idea_desc:0 "The years of being trapped behind the Leonine walls has taken a great effect on the Papacy and the Holy See, who have long since abandoned most of the facets of a modern state, in favor of governing their small sliver of land as something of a Cathedral with a state. This complete focus on church matters has remained present despite the Papal State being recreated in Rome during the Italian Civil War. The Papal State, while a shadow of its former self, still controls the area of Rome, an ideologically diverse and strategically important area rife with the rigors of political discourse. The question of whether we shall reinforce Temporal Power, vesting all powers of governance with Cardinal Secretary of State, or if we shall restore the Fundamental Statute for the Secular Government of the States of the Church and designate civilian governance to the people of Rome is a hotly contested topic, and one which will most likely have to be settled by the next Pope. Pius XI has been driven to an early grave, and once he finally passes to the gates of Heaven, it is likely that his successor will have to settle once and for all whether the Papal State will be a Modern Nation, or simply an extension of the Catholic Church."
PAP_fading_pope_idea:0 "The Fading Pope"
PAP_fading_pope_idea_desc:0 "To say that the pressures of leadership have worn heavy on our Holy Father: Pope Pius XI is very much an understatement. Forced to reckon with the Vatican's violent transition to full statehood throughout the entirey of his tenure, many have predicted that it won't be long before Pope Pius slips from the mortal veil once and for all. While still concerned with issues such as Anti-Racism and Anti-Syndicalism, the Pope has become withdrawn in recent months, mainly opting to remain in his bedchambers, abandoning completley previous passions such as mountain climbing. The issue of the Pope's Ill health have consumed many within the Vatican walls, who's private whispers on who will succeed the Pope have often been a subject of rather intense debate."
PAP_holy_see:0 "The Holy See"
PAP_holy_see_desc:0 "[PAP.GetNameDefCap] is the temporal seat of power for the Catholic Church and led by the Pope, the Bishop of Rome and ex officio leader of the Church. With more than 300 million worshippers across the world, the actions and words of the Papacy carry a unique weight that is seen nowhere else on earth."
PAP_roman_state:0 "The Roman State"
PAP_roman_state_desc:0 "With the Fundamental Statute for the Secular Government of the States of the Church once more in effect, the Pope has delegated the majority of temporal matters to the resurrected office of the Minister of the Interior. This has lead more people to use one of the alternative names for the Papacy's lands, that being the Roman State, to signify this profound change. While the Pope's role in the government might be now minimal, he still remains a powerful and influential figure and the leader of the entire Church."
PAP_black_monday_1:0 "Black Monday"
PAP_blackmonday_1_desc:0 "The collapse of the economy in Germany has had ripples throughout the world, no less so in our state where German- and Austrian-owned businesses have closed their doors and our national debt has escalated beyond our control."

PAP_roman_new_deal_desc:0 "Inspired by the various New Deals popular in the United States of America, the Roman New Deal is an ambitious plan set forth by Benedict XVI with aims to create a more equal Papal State for all of its subjects."

### Decisions ###
PAP_attack_sri:0 "Declare Crusade Against Syndicalism"
PAP_attack_sri_desc:0 "While we would prefer peace, against the great evil of syndicalism there can be no compromise. We have put off the inevitable for far too long. Our military is ready and prepared to defend the Catholic faith and liberate the land from the godless syndicalists that have desecrated the north."
PAP_declare_independence_from_SIC:0 "Declare the Papacy's Independence"
PAP_declare_independence_from_SIC_desc:0 "While we are grateful to the Sicilians for protecting the Holy See, it does not do to have the Papacy under another nation's control, even unofficially. The Pope shall issue a declaration of independence, and we shall see our own destiny."
PAP_claim_donation_of_pepin:0 "Claim the Donation of Pepin"
PAP_claim_donation_of_pepin_desc:0 "The lands of Central Italy rightfully belong under the purview of the Catholic Church, dating back more than a thousand years to the Donation of Pepin. We will not see them in enemy hands, so long as we have anything to say about it."
PAP_rally_faithful:0 "Rally the Faithful"
PAP_rally_faithful_desc:0 "Now that war with [SRI.GetNameDef] has finally arrived, the time has come to send out the call to the Catholic faithful and let them rise up to aid our holy cause!"

PAP_form_italian_fed:0 "Form the Italian Federation"
PAP_form_italian_fed_desc:0 "It appears that God has smiled upon Pope [PAP.GetLeader], as the small Papal State has managed to successfully re-unite the fragmented Italian States. Instead of restoring the pre-Risorgimento balance, the Pope has instead opted to form a united Italian Federation, a decentralized state nominally led by the Pope."
PAP_restore_the_papal_states:0 "Restore the Papal States"
PAP_restore_the_papal_states_desc:0 "After many years of decline, the once mighty Papal States had been reduced to little more than the singular City of Rome and surrounding areas. Fortunately, the Pope has now reversed this decline and reclaimed both the rightful domain, and indeed the title of the plural 'Papal States' itself."

### Focuses ###
PAP_conclave:0 "Call Papal Conclave"
PAP_conclave_desc:0 "With the death of Pius XI, a conclave will need to be called by the cardinals to select a replacement - a Pope who will determine our path for the years to come."
PAP_john_xxiii:0 "Pope John XXIII"
PAP_john_xxiii_desc:0 "Elia dalla Costa is a man most favoured by the people due to his charitable nature. However, he is not a man overly interested in politics, and his election will most likely result in the Papacy giving way to the rule of the people."
PAP_help_poor:0 "Helping Those in Need"
PAP_help_poor_desc:0 "The poor of our country need to be fed, just as our Lord commands us to do. The new system of charity will make use of popular donations, allowing the government to invest its resources elsewhere."
PAP_displaced_families:0 "Help Displaced Families"
PAP_displaced_families_desc:0 "The collapse of Italy following the Weltkrieg and rise of syndicalism in the north caused many refugees to flee south, and even today along the border some seek shelter from syndicalist tyranny. Despite our duty to help we have largely neglected these refugees and left them in squalid conditions, something which the new Pope is determined to rectify."
PAP_call_people:0 "A Call to the People"
PAP_call_people_desc:0 "The thing about the poor and the common people is that they exist in multitudes. Fed, clothed, and provided the fire of inspiration which only God can provide, they can be marshalled to support the will of the Pope with a fervour unmatched by any mercenary."
PAP_benedict_xvi:0 "Pope Benedict XVI"
PAP_benedict_xvi_desc:0 "Proven to be a progressive archbishop with a great heart for the common man during his time in Chicago, George Mundelein will do his utmost to reform the Papacy and the Church as a whole as a force for reform and stern fight against the race-baiters such as his long-time enemy Charles Coughlin."
PAP_new_deal_new_rome:0 "A New Deal for a New Rome"
PAP_new_deal_new_rome_desc:0 "Inspired by many ambitious politicians in his homeland, Pope Benedict shall implement a programe similar to these postulated as 'New Deal', be it the New York one of La Guardia or Oklahoma's one of Governor Marland."
PAP_leo_xiv:0 "Pope Leo XIV"
PAP_leo_xiv_desc:0 "A socialist at heart, Achille Lienart would do his utmost to prevent another Weltkrieg by decreasing the political tension. Electing him could even mean limited friendship with the syndicalists, no matter how unpopular such a move would be among devoted anti-syndicalists."
PAP_welfare_programs:0 "Champion the Worker-Priest Movement"
PAP_welfare_programs_desc:0 "There needs to be no revolution to reach the necessary social changes, espcially with Achille Liénart - now Pope Leo XIV - at the helm. With a background in championing social reform and welfare programs, non-revolutionary trade unionism, socialist humanitarianism, and the Worker-Priest Movement - which urges priests and other clergymen to take up work in working class chapels such as the factories in which they toil in order to better hear and meet the needs of the common masses, Pope Leo XIV shall guide the rest of the Papacy into progressive modernity on the backs of a satisfied and supported working class. As times change, so too shall our law."
PAP_trade_unions:0 "Christian Trade Unions"
PAP_trade_unions_desc:0 "Trade unions are the bedrock of the modern social state. In our country, they should be completely Catholic, inspired by the Christian trade unions of Germany, Flanders-Wallonia, France, and of course Italy, along with the pre-Papacy work of Achille Liénart who has long worked towards social reform since entering the Church even before his ascension to the position of Pope. Through the unions, we can also encourage the worker-priest missionary initiative, allowing the priesthood to take up work in factories and rediscover the working masses who have become disaffected with the Catholic Church."
PAP_economic_incentives:0 "Economic Incentives"
PAP_economic_incentives_desc:0 "With the unions empowered, we must mobilise the workers of the Papal State to expand our industry and make it the heart of our growing state. To begin this process we must assist our industry by creating artificial demand through public projects requiring industrially manufactured goods and materials."
PAP_eccalesiastical_matters:0 "Focus on Ecclesiastical Matters"
PAP_eccalesiastical_matters_desc:0 "As was to be expected the new Pope intends to restore democratic government to Rome, allowing him to focus on ecclesiastical matters. His legacy will be extending the rule of the Papal State to its people."
PAP_relinquish_temporal:0 "Re-Promulgate the Fundamental Statute"
PAP_relinquish_temporal_desc:0 "Signed into law by Pope Pius IX in 1848 before his turn towards authoritarianism and anti-reformism, the Fundamental Statute for the Secular Government of the States of the Church guaranteed a popularly elected lower house called the Chamber of Deputies and the position of the Minister of the Interior, equivalent to role of the prime minister in most nations. To ensure our reforms will be lasting we ought to reconsider that great document and put it into practice once more."
PAP_peoples_rule:0 "The People's Rule"
PAP_peoples_rule_desc:0 "Some in the Curia and even among the ordinary priesthood remain opposed to the establishment of democracy in Rome, if we are to promote a stable system in the long-term we must seek to promote the new government and relinquishment of a greater part of the temporal power by the clergy."
PAP_pius_xii:0 "Pope Pius XII"
PAP_pius_xii_desc:0 "Eugenio Pacelli is a man of peace and stability. His rule is perhaps sure to strengthen our country in many ways, making sure a mighty Italy walks the true path of God."
PAP_traditional_values:0 "Promote Traditional Values"
PAP_traditional_values_desc:0 "A Christian population is a loyal one. Focusing our propaganda on this fact may prove fruitful."
PAP_roman_patron:0 "Patron of Rome"
PAP_roman_patron_desc:0 "Let the government patronise some of the most promising artists and architects. They will not forget it, and neither will the people of Rome."
PAP_fight_corruption:0 "Fight Corruption"
PAP_fight_corruption_desc:0 "The Pope intends to issue a new encyclical, one aimed at corruption - both in the soul and within the government. It offers guidance to a nation struggling with finding its path."
PAP_adrian_vii:0 "Pope Adrian VII"
PAP_adrian_vii_desc:0 "Theodor Innitzer is a man of both conservatism and reformism, inspired from the Austropopulist movement in his native Austria. While some are uncertain of his connections to Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Edler von Schuschnigg, son of Lombardy-Venetia's military governor, many welcome Innitzer as someone that will reform the Papacy within bounds of tradition to withstand hardships of the modern world."
PAP_romanopopulism:0 "Theorizing Romanopopulism"
PAP_romanopopulism_desc:0 "To bring the disjointed and uncertain position of our State onto calmer waters we should start implementing policies based on the Austropopulist movement, while adapting it to the realities of Rome and Italy as a whole."
PAP_julius_iv:0 "Pope Julius IV"
PAP_julius_iv_desc:0 "Alfredo Schuster is a man described by many as leaning too far right ideologically. He warns against the evils of radical socialism, and declares he is willing to take up arms to defend Christendom by any means necessary."
PAP_promote_order:0 "Promote Order"
PAP_promote_order_desc:0 "The new Catholic way of governance will ensure every man of every occupation will be represented accordingly, leading to a much more stable government."
PAP_call_faithful:0 "A Call to the Faithful"
PAP_call_faithful_desc:0 "The heart of Christianity itself is threatened by the godless syndicalists. With the enemy so close to the Holy See the faithful of Rome and the Papal Zouaves must fight with all their strength to ensure that the Lateran Palace remains untouched by our vile foes."
PAP_holy_war:0 "Holy War"
PAP_holy_war_desc:0 "The time has come for the Papal State to take on its role as the defender of God and virtue, and for the people to rise up to its service in an Eleventh Crusade against syndicalism."
PAP_temporal_power:0 "Reinforce Temporal Power"
PAP_temporal_power_desc:0 "The increasing secularisation of society means a lessening of the pope´s influence. However, there are ways by which we can reinforce his influence inside his own borders."
PAP_condemn_mobrule:0 "Condemn Mob Rule"
PAP_condemn_mobrule_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a scourge of all things holy. It is unacceptable to let Catholics join syndicalist movements. The pope must publish an encyclical to make this clear."
PAP_strengthen_border:0 "Strengthen the Border"
PAP_strengthen_border_desc:0 "If an invasion comes, it will be by the evil syndicalists to the north. We must strengthen our border, fortify it to withstand the onslaught."
PAP_roman_senate:0 "The Chamber of Deputies of the Roman State"
PAP_roman_senate_desc:0 "Now that the new Pope has chosen to delegate the administration of the Papal State to the people, we can bring back the Fundamental Statute for the Secular Government of the States of the Church and re-establish the popularly elected Chamber of Deputies which was abolished after the proclamation of the Roman Republic in 1849."
PAP_general_election:0 "Call for General Elections"
PAP_general_election_desc:0 "Following the revival of the Chamber of Deputies the next step to bringing democracy to Rome will be to call for a general election to elect a civilian government that will oversee the task of administrating and developing the revived Rome into a modern nation."
PAP_civilian_government:0 "Organising a Civilian Government"
PAP_civilian_government_desc:0 "With the transition from the temporal power of the Pope to democracy and civilian government complete we can now declare the end of the Papal State and the birth of the Roman State, with the Pope reigning akin to a constitutional monarch."
PAP_black_monday:0 "Dealing with Black Monday"
PAP_black_monday_desc:0 "The entire nation has fallen into despair and unemployment with the collapse of the economy. Finding our way out will be a long road, though we are better off than some."
PAP_lazio_subsidies:0 "Subsidies in Lazio"
PAP_lazio_subsidies_desc:0 "The collapse of the Kingdom of Italy dealt a major blow to the economy of Lazio, and the industries that did survive have been dealt a harsh blow by the Black Monday crisis. If we are to maintain Lazio's industry and economy we must start with subsidies so that they may weather the crisis and expand in future."
PAP_revive_industry:0 "Reviving our Industry"
PAP_revive_industry_desc:0 "The industries hit hardest in Rome by the fall of Italy were those that depended on supplying the military, which was no longer needed after the war by the Papal State who saw themselves as protected by the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and saw no need for anything larger than an enlargened Palatine Guard. Now we must begin to revive our military industries so that we may field a modern army of our own."
PAP_aid_farmers:0 "Aid Farmers"
PAP_aid_farmers_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the farmers of the primarily agricultural Lazio hard due to a lack of sales from exports, and some farmers have even fallen into bankruptcy and forced to sell their farms. If we are to help both our people and economy we must begin to aid our farmers and save them from bankruptcy through subsidies and limiting production of agricultural products to create demand."
PAP_agricultural_incentives:0 "Agricultural Incentives"
PAP_agricultural_incentives_desc:0 "One way to further improve our agriculture and recover from the Black Monday crisis would be to reduce taxes on agricultural equipment and raise protectionist tariffs in order to encourage domestic farming over foreign goods and provide another source of revenue for the government."
PAP_economic_recovery:0 "Black Monday Recovery"
PAP_economic_recovery_desc:0 "The burst of industrial and agricultural development in our country has clearly been enough to spur the Papal State's recovery from the financial nightmare. Let us all celebrate!"
PAP_campaign_promises:0 "Fulfill Campaign Promises"
PAP_campaign_promises_desc:0 "We have promised much to the people of Rome during the former Papal government and the first elections. Now that we are in power we must begin to live up to our promises and build the Roman State into a nation worthy of sharing the name of the greatest empire in history."
PAP_infrastructure_investment:0 "Urban Renewal in Rome"
PAP_infrastructure_investment_desc:0 "Rome was last given a fresh start when rebuilding from the 1527 sack by the Charles V's armies. Since then, the population has boomed, but many of these new citizens find themselves living in ramshackle houses, as slums crowd ancient Roman buildings. We must engage in a program of urban renewal to make our great city both more beautiful and more efficient. The people in the slums may not see it that way, though."
PAP_military_railways:0 "Military Railways"
PAP_military_railways_desc:0 "A critical part of waging war that often gets overlooked is logistics. If we are to keep our armies well supplied in the coming war against the syndicalists up north we must ensure that our military railways are in top working order so that supplies and equipment may be delivered quickly to the front with few complications."
PAP_education_reform:0 "Educational Reform"
PAP_education_reform_desc:0 "We have so far neglected the need for a modern and highly efficient education system and the necessity of keeping the scientists well supported. Our new progressive reform will improve our situation in this area greatly."
PAP_university_grants:0 "Papal University Grants"
PAP_university_grants_desc:0 "We know of many bright minds in our universities, but unfortunately, they need more funding to continue their projects, which the Church is ready to provide. It is time to improve the qualities of our scientists."
PAP_expand_ports:0 "Expand Ports"
PAP_expand_ports_desc:0 "While the Papal State invested much into rebuilding the Pontifical Navy for a new age, the ports themselves and especially the shipbuilding industry were often neglected. With enough development, the docks of Rome shall become an ideal centre of shipping in the Mediterranean."
PAP_heavy_industry:0 "Attract Heavy Industry"
PAP_heavy_industry_desc:0 "For Rome to be an effective military power as it once was we will need to build artillery, vehicles and armour to assist our troops in battle against the larger and stronger armies of our enemies, as well as steel for building modern military equipment. To do this we will need to adjust our laws and spending to attract and encourage heavy industrial production."
PAP_airfield_expansion:0 "Military Airfield Expansion"
PAP_airfield_expansion_desc:0 "Our air force leaders have long been demanding additional funds. Our air bases do indeed need expansion."
PAP_roman_army:0 "Roman Army"
PAP_roman_army_desc:0 "Our former government, confident in the unlikelihood of a war and the protection of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, did not invest much in an army leaving the defence of the nation to only a small Palatine Honour Guard. With war seemingly becoming an inevitability it is essential that our army is fit to inherit the legacy of Rome and isn't reliant on Sicilian protection."
PAP_armed_citizenry:0 "Armed Citizenry"
PAP_armed_citizenry_desc:0 "If Rome is to protect its independence from the northerners or the exiled Savoyards its citizens must be prepared to resist any invading armies. Inspired by our Swiss Guards we can begin to implement a Swiss-style militia system, requiring our citizens to own a personal rifle and ammunition and to engage in periodical combat and marksmanship training so that our people can fight effectively when the time comes."
PAP_industry_captains:0 "Captains of Industry"
PAP_industry_captains_desc:0 "While the days of Rome being the world's greatest power are gone we must foster the Roman economy as much as possible. The greatest decider of economic strength in this era is industry, which the previous government under Pius XI viewed negatively and was reluctant to encourage. Now that Rome is under new governance we must undo these previous policies and ensure that Roman industry flourishes."
PAP_men_of_rome:0 "Men of Rome"
PAP_men_of_rome_desc:0 "Should our nation be invaded every man in Rome must be ready and determined to resist and drive out the invaders by any means necessary, using guerrilla warfare and their knowledge of the terrain to outwit and ambush the occupying forces."
PAP_legionary_spirit:0 "Legionary Spirit"
PAP_legionary_spirit_desc:0 "Through the discipline, organisation, persistence and motivation of the Roman Legions Rome emerged from an Italian city-state to become the world's greatest power and forever left a glorious mark on history. In these precarious times, we must revive this legendary discipline and make the legions of Rome internationally renowned once again."
PAP_army_reorganisation:0 "Army Reorganisation"
PAP_army_reorganisation_desc:0 "Ever since the re-establishment of the Papal State the defence of Rome was left purely up to the small Palatine Guard and the protection of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. With the new civilian government reforming the nation and army it is time to establish a professional army so that we may stand up for ourselves against the northerners."
PAP_latin_perimeter:0 "Latin Perimeter"
PAP_latin_perimeter_desc:0 "Our northern border lies exposed. It must be reinforced."
PAP_combined_arms:0 "Combined Arms"
PAP_combined_arms_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to field a proper infantry army and fortified our borders for war with the North we should begin to fully modernise our army by researching motorised vehicles and tanks to assist our infantry in battle and encircle the enemy forces."
PAP_navy:0 "The Pontifical Navy"
PAP_navy_desc:0 "Despite our state's small size we have rebuilt the Pontifical Navy following independence from the Italians. However, our current fleet, including the former Italian battleship Roma, is becoming old and outdated, and will only be able to stall the enemy for a while should war break out. If we want to rule the seas we will need to continue building and modernising our navy."
PAP_in_being:0 "Fleet in Being"
PAP_in_being_desc:0 "The Pontifical Navy must gallantly face the enemy's naval forces head on and claim the Mediterranean as our sea, as our ancestors did long ago."
PAP_trade_interdiction:0 "Trade Interdiction"
PAP_trade_interdiction_desc:0 "While we may have dominated the Mediterranean long ago our small state has no hopes of achieving such an ambition today. If our navy is to compete successfully against stronger opponents we must focus on hitting the enemy's trade."
PAP_roman_fleet:0 "A Roman Fleet"
PAP_roman_fleet_desc:0 "Long ago, we exercised the absolute control over the Mediterranean. It would be shameful if our ambitions were not to once again rule the area by large and powerful ships."
PAP_submarines:0 "Submarine Focus"
PAP_submarines_desc:0 "Submarines are an exceptionally powerful weapon. Relatively easy to build and deadly to even the biggest ships, they need to be focused on."
PAP_screens:0 "Cruiser Focus"
PAP_screens_desc:0 "Cruisers and Destroyers are useful in many ways and it is imperative to have a fleet to patrol our waters. They should be included in our navy."
PAP_air_force:0 "The Pontifical Air Force"
PAP_air_force_desc:0 "While we have built up a sizable navy by the standards of a small nation such as ours, we have not yet invested in an air force, giving our enemies a critical advantage over us. We must quickly rectify this if Rome is not to be destroyed from above in the event of war with the Socialist Republic of Italy."
PAP_defend_skies:0 "Defend the Skies of Rome"
PAP_defend_skies_desc:0 "Without air superiority, we can never make use of aircraft. Improving our fighters should be our top priority."
PAP_bombers:0 "Bomber Focus"
PAP_bombers_desc:0 "Bombers are seeing massive improvements all around the world. We must keep up and make use of them ourselves."
PAP_closeair_support:0 "CAS Focus"
PAP_closeair_support_desc:0 "Our land forces need proper air support to fight effectively. Our new CAS designs will help us achieve this."
PAP_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bomber Focus"
PAP_naval_bombers_desc:0 "We can achieve a certain level of naval superiority without even using our ships. However, better bomber models will need to be developed."
PAP_radar:0 "Radar Focus"
PAP_radar_desc:0 "With the syndicalists having an industrial advantage over our small nation we must stay a step ahead if we are to defend ourselves in the air, the building of radars could help us achieve this advantage by allowing us to detect our enemy beforehand and react accordingly."
PAP_anti_air:0 "Anti-Air Defences"
PAP_anti_air_desc:0 "While we have begun to fortify our borders and have an effective navy to combat syndicalist invasions from the sea we have neglected our defences from the air. We cannot allow the precious works of art and history in Rome to be destroyed by syndicalist bombing raids."
PAP_reformed_power:0 "Reformed Temporal Power"
PAP_reformed_power_desc:0 "The Pope has established that his temporal power over the Papal State and its claimed territories offered to us by the Donation of Pepin and stolen by the Piedmontese in 1860 shall continue.

papalstate.1.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the Papal State!"
papalstate.1.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depth, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached us. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, our currency is losing value, industrial exports are shrinking, and our national debt is beginning to grow out of control..."
papalstate.1.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."
papalstate.2.t:0 "Father Charles Coughlin"
papalstate.2.d:0 "Three years ago today, Father Charles Coughlin started doing a weekly radio broadcast in America and more than 50 million people turn on their radios and listen. He is a raving Anti-Semite, claiming that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'fermented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International Conspiracy of Jewish Bankers' and somehow people still tune in. His hate-speech will not be tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so his hateful message cannot reach the public."
papalstate.2.a:0 "Ask the President of the United States to shut down this 'Radio Priest'"
papalstate.2.b:0 "It would be best if we did not interfere."
papalstate.3.t:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno"
papalstate.3.d:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno (Latin for 'In the 45th Year') is a new encyclical written by Pope Pius XI that discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order (45 years after Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum encyclical). The encyclical describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and syndicalism, calling for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. In the first part, he reviews and applauds the encyclical of his predecessor, which helped the development of a new social conscience.\nAccording to Pius XI, three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family responsibilities, the economic condition of the enterprise and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and sound enterprises. For this, Pope Pius concludes that solidarity, not conflict, is a necessary condition. The pope, therefore, demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees through new forms of cooperation and communication among Catholic citizens. A new era of Catholic Corporatism is just beginning."
papalstate.3.a:0 "Excellent."
papalstate.4.t:0 "Donations from the Faithful"
papalstate.4.d:0 "With the very seat of God's church under threat from non-believers for the first time in centuries, donations have been pouring in from Catholics throughout the world."
papalstate.4.a:0 "Every bit counts."
papalstate.5.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes"
papalstate.5.d:0 "The order has been given to clear the Pontine Marshes and thus open the once-useless land for farming or industry. The plan will require the employment of thousands of Romans and take many months to get the bulk of it done, but the outcome may be worth it."
papalstate.5.a:0 "So long as it keeps them working, I'm happy."
papalstate.6.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes Are Cleared"

papalstate.11.t:0 "Financial Aid from the Two Sicilies?"
papalstate.11.d:0 "While we have determined that the best way to get the Black Monday crisis under control is to seek a bailout from the Kingdom of Two Sicilies we must decide how much of our debt we shall ask them to take. If we were to ask them to take on all of our debts it would greatly improve our financial situation but would also give away much of our sovereignty to the Sicilians. If this proves unacceptable we could instead request that they take on only some of our debt, although should we do this we would have to enact measures ourselves to clear the remaining debt and economic damage."
papalstate.11.a:0 "Ask the Sicilians to take our whole debt"
papalstate.11.b:0 "Only ask them to take some of our debt"
papalstate.12.t:0 "The Papal State's Request"
papalstate.12.d:0 "The Papal State has been hit hard by Black Monday and in particular they are unable to handle their international debts. Despite our own economic troubles, they have requested that we take on all of their debts and while we have protected them ever since the collapse of Italy and accepting their request would give us far more control over their state, many question if our economy would be able to handle the stress."

papalstate.12.b:0 "Take on some of their debts"
papalstate.12.c:0 "Refuse - our own nation must come first"
papalstate.13.t:0 "Two Sicilies Accepts!"
papalstate.13.d:0 "The Sicilians have agreed to take on our debt! While we have given significant concessions and the Sicilian government now has far more influence over us, at least our debts have been cleared and our economy is running again."
papalstate.13.a:0 "Great!"
papalstate.14.t:0 "Two Sicilies Partially Accepts"
papalstate.14.d:0 "Unfortunately the Sicilians were unwilling to take on our full debt due to their own economic problems following Black Monday, but they have still agreed to take part of it, helping to relieve the burden on ourselves even if we will have to take steps for our economy to fully recover."
papalstate.14.a:0 "It's better than nothing."
papalstate.15.t:0 "Two Sicilies Refuses!"
papalstate.15.d:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies have refused our generous request, claiming that their nation's economy comes first! This will make the road towards improving our state's economy more expensive than we had hoped."
papalstate.15.a:0 "How unfaithful."
papalstate.16.t:0 "The Papal State's Request"
papalstate.16.d:0 "The Papal State has been hit hard by Black Monday and in particular they are unable to handle their international debts. Despite our own economic troubles they have requested that we take on some of their debts and while we have protected ever since the collapse of Italy and our people are faithful to the Church and the Pope, many question if our economy would be able to handle the stress."
papalstate.16.a:0 "Accept their request"
papalstate.16.b:0 "Refuse - our own nation must come first"
papalstate.17.t:0 "Two Sicilies Accepts!"
papalstate.17.d:0 "The Sicilians have agreed to take on some of our debts! Although we have not reached the light at the end of the tunnel yet, the elimination of some of our debts will lighten the load on our economy and make our recovery an easier task."
papalstate.17.a:0 "Great!"
papalstate.18.t:0 "Military Aid for the Papal State?"
papalstate.18.d:0 "As international tensions grow and the possibility of another war arises the Papal State has begun to see the need to rebuild its army in order to defend the Holy See from desecration by the vile syndicalists just across our border, and have reached out to us to aid them in modernising their forces. How shall we respond?"
papalstate.18.a:0 "Assist them as much as possible!"
papalstate.18.b:0 "We can spare them some help."
papalstate.18.c:0 "No need - we can protect them ourselves."
papalstate.19.t:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies Accepts!"
papalstate.19.d:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies has accepted our request and begun to aid us in modernising our military technology so that we may defend ourselves from the tyranny of syndicalism."
papalstate.19.a:0 "Great!"
papalstate.20.t:0 "Two Sicilies Supplies Some Aid"
papalstate.20.d:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies have accepted our request and while they have not given us as much military aid as we had hoped what they have seen fit to give should hopefully assist us in modernising our army."
papalstate.20.a:0 "It's better than nothing."
papalstate.21.t:0 "Two Sicilies Refuses!"
papalstate.21.d:0 "To our disappointment, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies have refused our request for military aid, claiming that doing so would be a waste of time and resources for their own nation and that the Sicilian army is capable of defending Rome themselves."
papalstate.21.a:0 "How foolish and arrogant."
papalstate.22.t:0 "Syndicalist Guerrilla Campaign"
papalstate.22.d:0 "While we have thwarted the syndicalists in their attempt to bring about a second Risorgimento and reclaimed the land stolen by Piedmont in 1860, it appears that our troubles have not ended there. Syndicalists in the liberated territories, refusing to recognise our rightful rule, have taken up arms against our government and are engaging in a campaign of guerrilla warfare against us!"
papalstate.22.a:0 "These subversives must be brought to justice!"
papalstate.23.t:0 "Syndicalist Riots"
papalstate.23.d:0 "Today many syndicalist sympathisers turned out for protests and demonstrations against our rule in the formerly Italian territories. The protests soon turned into rioting, causing much damage in acts of vandalism and injuring many."
papalstate.23.a:0 "Damn!"
papalstate.24.t:0 "Syndicalist Ambushes"

papalstate.27.a:0 "At last!"
papalstate.38.t:0 "Effects of Black Monday End!"
papalstate.38.d:0 "While it was a hard and trying time for our nation and economy, the effects of the Black Monday crisis are at last at an end, and our country can begin to move on."
papalstate.38.a:0 "Finally!"
papalstate.39.t:0 "The Papal Conclave"
papalstate.39.d:0 "With the passing of Pius XI, the cardinals of the Catholic Church have convened within the Sistine Chapel to elect the new Pope. They will remain in seclusion until a consensus has been reached, and a new successor to St. Peter has been chosen by the electors."
papalstate.39.a:0 "Let us pray they choose wisely."
papalstate.40.t:0 "The State of the Papacy"
papalstate.40.d:0 "Following the collapse of Italy after the Weltkrieg, Rome became in danger of capture by the republican rebels against the old Kingdom. The blurry battle lines of the civil war mostly spared Rome due to the protection of the southern royalist forces, which, together with local right wing militias, crushed uprisings in Rome. The Pope soon emerged from the Vatican to take back up the administration of his God-ordained domain, but the debilitated state had no armed forces loyal to it, and it had scarce chances at resisting any Syndicalist offensive. However, the white generals in the south would not stand by while the centre of Catholicism fell to syndicalism, and led a counter-offensive to secure Rome, bringing the Papal State under royalist, later Sicilian, protection, receiving support from foreign volunteers in Rome, the reborn Zouave corps.\n\nAfter the war ended, the Papal States joined the Italian Federation along with its protectors in Naples, but controlled only a small fraction of its nominal territory, and was and is in most respects a rump, puppet state of the Sicilians. Following the declaration of independence along with Sardinia and the Two Sicilies in 1926, it has been recognized as an independent state by the majority of nations in the world, though it is extremely limited in its diplomatic options. \n\nIn the sphere of Curia politics, the fading health of Pius is in everyone's minds, and it remains to be seen who will succeed him should he pass in the coming years."
papalstate.40.a:0 "Interesting."
papalstate.41.t:0 "The Siculo-Papal Joint Planning Staff"

papalstate.66.d:0 "First founded in 1892 in the post-unification intellectual climate by famed Italian numismatics such as Solone Ambrosoli, Vergano the Elder, the brothers Francesco and Ercole Gnecchi, and even a young Vittorio Emanuele III nearly a decade before he would rise to the throne, the Società numismatica italiana - or the Italian Numismatic Society - is the premier cultural association for the study of numismatics and for the promotion and spread of studies ‘relating to coins, tesserae, coin weights, medals and seals’ in any Italy. Largely staffed by prominent elites and nobles from across not only the peninsula but wider Europe - with members like Philip Grierson, Carlo Maria Cipolla, Francesco Panvini Rosati, Laura Breglia, Maria Radnoti-Alföldi and Michael Crawford - the Society boasts an impressive group of members and an even more impressive collection of coins and other facets of monetary history, including perhaps the largest private trove of Roman and pre-Roman coins anywhere in the world. It also publishes the 'Rivista italiana di numismatica e scienze affini', the oldest Italian review on numismatics. However, due to its historic but problematic position of being traditionally headquartered in Milan along with the fractured nature of contemporary Italy which stands at odds with the nature and environment of which the organization was originally birthed, a new headquarters for the Society has been sorely needed, and we think we may have finally found it. \n\nIn Rome, at the center of Italian civilization and largely removed from the factionalism that has taken over the rest of our beloved homeland, the Marquis Camillo Serafini - relative to the famous Marquis and Cardinal Domenico Serafini, Prefect of the Propagation of the Faith, who died near the tail end of the Great War as Italy just began to shatter - stands as a prominent numismatist from a respectable family and with the funds available to him freely that will be necessary to create this new branch of the Society. Close to members of the Papacy and a friend of King Victor Emmaneul III through their shared membership in our organization, Marquis Camillo Serafini would be a fine fit to lead this new branch as we slowly begin to shift more operations from Milan to more neutral and central Rome. With this expansion of such an esteemed organization, especially one with such diplomatic usefulness as the SNI, both Italian intellectualism and the dream of Italian re-unification shall hopefully be advanced in twain."

Pius_XI:0 "Pius XI"
POLITICS_PIUS_XI_DESC:0 "Pope Pius XI, formerly Cardinal Achille Ratti, was elected to the Holy See in 1922, having spent most of the previous years as a papal representative in the newly re-established state of Poland, and was named a cardinal in 1921. Thus, he avoided most of the turmoil of the civil war and the danger that the Papacy underwent in its later stages. He was the first pope since the unification of Italy to give an ascension speech at Saint Peter's, as the practice has been abandoned during the 'Hostage Years' under the Savoyard monarchy. His papacy has been also marked by increasing tensions between factions in the Curia, and the troubled re-establishment of temporal authority."
POLITICS_PIUS_XII_DESC:0 "Pope Pius XII, formerly Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, is a man of great spiritual fervour. He is renowned for his piety, but has a strong authoritarian streak that is matched only by his desire to protect the people."
POLITICS_JOHN_XXIII_DESC:0 "Pope John XXIII, formerly Cardinal Elia dalla Costa, is a gentle man renowned for his charitable nature and love of the poor. Most assume he will eventually turn the Papacy away from its direct rule of the nation, and already forces are gathering within the Papal State to determine who will undertake that role."
POLITICS_LEO_XIV_DESC:0 "Pope Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal Achille Liènart, is a controversial choice as Pope. He is a well-known socialist, considered by some to even be a radical, and it's possible he was chosen by the Papacy due to the possibility his socialist leanings will lead to a reconciliation with the north."
POLITICS_BENEDICT_XVI_DESC:0 "Pope Benedict XVI, formerly Cardinal George Mundelein, is an unexpected choice for a Pope. The first one in Papacy's entire history to come from the New World, Benedict has become famous as a friend to the lower classes and champion in the fight against both ethnic and racial discrimination while Archbishop of Chicago, often clashing with the infamous Father Charles Coughlin."
POLITICS_JULIUS_IV_DESC:0 "Pope Julius IV, formerly Cardinal Alfredo Schuster, is a man renowned for his passion. He has been involved in the running of the Papal State for many years, and, as the former Archbishop of Milan, has declared syndicalism to be an evil he will battle until it is eradicated from the Earth."
POLITICS_ADRIAN_VII_DESC:0 "Pope Adrian VII, formerly Cardinal Theodor Innitzer, is a somewhat controversial choice as Pope. He has been involved with the Austropopulist movement as a long-time Archbishop of Vienna, which makes him both a figure that many in the native Italian Curia distrust while also a figure paternalistic reformers within Rome itself hope will bring the state into modern times."

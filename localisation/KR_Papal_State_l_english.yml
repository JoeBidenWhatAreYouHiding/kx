Papal_States:0 "Papal States Focus Tree"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_PIUS_XII_DESC:0 "Pope Pius XII, formerly Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, is a man of great spiritual fervour. He is renowned for his piety, but has a strong authoritarian streak that is matched only by his desire to protect the people."
POLITICS_STEPHEN_X_DESC:0 "Pope Stephen X, formerly Cardinal Elia dalla Costa, is a gentle man renowned for his charitable nature and love of the poor. Most assume he will eventually turn the Papacy away from its direct rule of the nation, and already forces are gathering within the Papal State to determine who will undertake that role."
POLITICS_JOHN_XXIII_DESC:0 "Pope John XXIII, formerly Cardinal Achille Liènart, is a controversial choice as Pope. He is a well-known socialist, considered by some to even be a radical, and it's possible he was chosen by the Papacy due to the possibility his socialist leanings will lead to a reconciliation with the north."
POLITICS_JULIUS_IV_DESC:0 "Pope Julius IV, formerly Cardinal Theodor Innitzer, is a man renowned for his passion. He has been involved in the running of the Papal State for many years, and, as the former Archbishop of Milan, has declared syndicalism to be an evil he will battle until it is eradicated from the Earth."
POLITICS_PIUS_XI_DESC:0 "Pope Pius XI, formerly Cardinal Achille Ratti, was elected to the Holy See in 1922, having spent most of the previous years as a papal representative in the newly re-established state of Poland, and was named a cardinal in 1921. Thus, he avoided most of the turmoil of the civil war and the danger that the Papacy underwent in its later stages. He was the first pope since the unification of Italy to give an ascension speech at Saint Peter's, as the practice has been abandoned during the 'Hostage Years' under the Savoyard monarchy. His papacy has been also marked by increasing tensions between factions in the Curia, and the troubled re-establishment of temporal authority."
POLITICS_COLLEGE_CARDINALS_DESC:0 "While the conclave is in session, Carmelengo Eugenio Pacelli holds de facto administrative roles. however the Holy See is officially empty, and the Papal State thus lacks a Head of State formally. The conclave is usually a time consuming process that may set the State and the Church itself in a brand new path for decades to come."

### Decisions ###
PAP_attack_sri:0 "Declare Crusade Against Syndicalism"
PAP_attack_sri_desc:0 "While we would prefer peace, against the great evil of syndicalism there can be no compromise. We have put off the inevitable for far too long. Our military is ready and prepared to defend the Catholic faith and liberate the land from the godless syndicalists that have desecrated the north."
PAP_declare_independence_from_SIC:0 "Declare the Papacy's Independence"
PAP_declare_independence_from_SIC_desc:0 "While we are grateful to the Sicilians for protecting the Holy See, it does not do to have the Papacy under another nation's control, even unofficially. The Pope shall issue a declaration of independence, and we shall see our own destiny."

PAP_claim_donation_of_pepin_desc:0 "The lands of Central Italy rightfully belong under the purview of the Catholic Church, dating back more than a thousand years to the Donation of Pepin. We will not see them in enemy hands, so long as we have anything to say about it."
PAP_fund_neosanfedisti:0 "Fund the NeoSanfedisti"
PAP_fund_neosanfedisti_desc:0 "The oppression of good Catholics in [SRI.GetNameDef] affords us an opportunity to fund a resistance, one which will weaken the syndicalists as well as give us the ability to raise partisans in their territory once the inevitable war with the North begins."
PAP_ask_permission_neosanfedisti:0 "Ask Permission to Fund the NeoSanfedisti"
PAP_ask_permission_neosanfedisti_desc:0 "Since [SIC.GetNameDef] would be forced into a position to defend us, should our attempt to fund the Catholic resistance bring the ire of [SRI.GetNameDef] down upon us, it falls on us to first ask the Sicilians if they support our efforts."

### Focuses ###
PAP_conclave:0 "Call Papal Conclave"
PAP_conclave_desc:0 "With the death of Pius XI, a conclave will need to be called by the cardinals to select a replacement - a Pope who will determine our path for the years to come."
PAP_stephen_x:0 "Pope Stephen X"
PAP_stephen_x_desc:0 "Elia dalla Costa is a man most favoured by the people due to his charitable nature. However, he is not a man overly interested in politics, and his election will most likely result in the Papacy giving way to the rule of the people."
PAP_help_poor:0 "Helping Those in Need"
PAP_help_poor_desc:0 "The poor of our country need to be fed, just as our Lord commands us to do. The new system of charity will make use of popular donations, allowing the government to invest its resources elsewhere."
PAP_displaced_families:0 "Help Displaced Families"
PAP_displaced_families_desc:0 "The collapse of Italy following the Weltkrieg and rise of syndicalism in the north caused many refugees to flee south, and even today along the border some seek shelter from syndicalist tyranny. Despite our duty to help we have largely neglected these refugees and left them in squalid conditions, something which the new Pope is determined to rectify."
PAP_call_people:0 "A Call to the People"
PAP_call_people_desc:0 "The thing about the poor and the common people is that they exist in multitudes. Fed, clothed, and provided the fire of inspiration which only God can provide, they can be marshalled to support the will of the Pope with a fervour unmatched by any mercenary."
PAP_john_xxiii:0 "Pope John XXIII"
PAP_john_xxiii_desc:0 "A socialist at heart, Achille Lienart would do his utmost to prevent another Weltkrieg by decreasing the political tension. Electing him could even mean limited friendship with the syndicalists, no matter how unpopular such a move would be among devoted anti-syndicalists."
PAP_welfare_programs:0 "Welfare Program"
PAP_welfare_programs_desc:0 "There needs to be no revolution to reach the necessary social changes. As times change, so shall our law."
PAP_trade_unions:0 "Christian Trade Unions"
PAP_trade_unions_desc:0 "Trade unions are the bedrock of the modern social state. In our country, they should be completely Catholic, inspired by the Christian trade unions of Germany and Flanders-Wallonia. Through the unions, we can also encourage the worker-priest missionary initiative, allowing the priesthood to take up work in factories and rediscover the working masses who have become disaffected with the Catholic Church."
PAP_economic_incentives:0 "Economic Incentives"
PAP_economic_incentives_desc:0 "With the unions empowered, we must mobilise the workers of the Papal State to expand our industry and make it the heart of our growing state. To begin this process we must assist our industry by creating artificial demand through public projects requiring industrially manufactured goods and materials."
PAP_eccalesiastical_matters:0 "Focus on Ecclesiastical Matters"
PAP_eccalesiastical_matters_desc:0 "As was to be expected the new Pope intends to restore democratic government to Rome, allowing him to focus on ecclesiastical matters. His legacy will be extending the rule of the Papal State to its people."
PAP_relinquish_temporal:0 "Relinquish Temporal Power"
PAP_relinquish_temporal_desc:0 "The last step in social reform is recognising that God's place is to guide, not to rule. True power belongs in the people, and a democratic state must be erected to look after their welfare."
PAP_peoples_rule:0 "The People's Rule"
PAP_peoples_rule_desc:0 "Some in the Curia and even among the ordinary priesthood remain opposed to the establishment of democracy in Rome, if we are to promote a stable system in the long-term we must seek to promote the new government and relinquishment of temporal power within the Church and clergy."
PAP_pius_xii:0 "Pope Pius XII"
PAP_pius_xii_desc:0 "Eugenio Pacelli is a man of peace and stability. His rule is perhaps sure to strengthen our country in many ways, making sure a mighty Italy walks the true path of God."
PAP_traditional_values:0 "Promote Traditional Values"
PAP_traditional_values_desc:0 "A Christian population is a loyal one. Focusing our propaganda on this fact may prove fruitful."
PAP_roman_patron:0 "Patron of Rome"
PAP_roman_patron_desc:0 "Let the government patronise some of the most promising artists and architects. They will not forget it, and neither will the people of Rome."
PAP_fight_corruption:0 "Fight Corruption"
PAP_fight_corruption_desc:0 "Pope Pius XII intends to issue a new encyclical, one aimed at corruption - both in the soul and within the government. It offers guidance to a nation struggling with finding its path."
PAP_julius_iv:0 "Pope Julius IV"
PAP_julius_iv_desc:0 "Theodor Innitzer is a man described by many as leaning too far right ideologically. He warns against the evils of radical socialism, and declares he is willing to take up arms to defend Christendom by any means necessary."
PAP_promote_order:0 "Promote Order"
PAP_promote_order_desc:0 "The new Catholic way of governance will ensure every man of every occupation will be represented accordingly, leading to a much more stable government."
PAP_call_faithful:0 "A Call to the Faithful"
PAP_call_faithful_desc:0 "The heart of Christianity itself is threatened by the godless syndicalists. With the enemy so close to the Holy See the faithful of Rome and the Papal Zouaves must fight with all their strength to ensure that the Lateran Palace remains untouched by our vile foes."
PAP_holy_war:0 "Holy War"
PAP_holy_war_desc:0 "The time has come for the Papal State to take on its role as the defender of God and virtue, and for the people to rise up to its service in an Eleventh Crusade against syndicalism."
PAP_temporal_power:0 "Reinforce Temporal Power"
PAP_temporal_power_desc:0 "The increasing secularisation of society means a lessening of the pope´s influence. However, there are ways by which we can reinforce his influence inside his own borders."
PAP_condemn_mobrule:0 "Condemn Mob Rule"
PAP_condemn_mobrule_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a scourge of all things holy. It is unacceptable to let Catholics join syndicalist movements. The pope must publish an encyclical to make this clear."
PAP_strengthen_border:0 "Strengthen the Border"
PAP_strengthen_border_desc:0 "If an invasion comes, it will be by the evil syndicalists to the north. We must strengthen our border, fortify it to withstand the onslaught."
PAP_roman_senate:0 "The Senate of the Kingdom of Rome"
PAP_roman_senate_desc:0 "Now that the new Pope has chosen to delegate the administration of the Papal State to the people, we can bring back the Senatus Romanus for the first time in centuries with effective power to make sure the people's voice is heard"
PAP_general_election:0 "Call for General Elections"
PAP_general_election_desc:0 "Following the revival of the Roman Senate the next step to bringing democracy to Rome will be to call for a general election to elect a civilian government that will oversee the task of administrating and developing the revived Rome into a modern nation."
PAP_civilian_government:0 "Organising a Civilian Government"
PAP_civilian_government_desc:0 "With the transition from the temporal power of the Pope to democracy and civilian government complete we can now declare the end of the Papal State and the birth of the Kingdom of Rome, with the Pope reigning akin to a constitutional monarch."
PAP_black_monday:0 "Dealing with Black Monday"
PAP_black_monday_desc:0 "The entire nation has fallen into despair and unemployment with the collapse of the economy. Finding our way out will be a long road, though we are better off than some."
PAP_lazio_subsidies:0 "Subsidies in Lazio"
PAP_lazio_subsidies_desc:0 "The collapse of the Kingdom of Italy dealt a major blow to the economy of Lazio, and the industries that did survive have been dealt a harsh blow by the Black Monday crisis. If we are to maintain Lazio's industry and economy we must start with subsidies so that they may weather the crisis and expand in future."
PAP_revive_industry:0 "Reviving our Industry"
PAP_revive_industry_desc:0 "The industries hit hardest in Rome by the fall of Italy were those that depended on supplying the military, which was no longer needed after the war by the Papal State who saw themselves as protected by the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and saw no need for anything larger than an enlargened Palatine Guard. Now we must begin to revive our military industries so that we may field a modern army of our own."
PAP_aid_farmers:0 "Aid Farmers"
PAP_aid_farmers_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the farmers of the primarily agricultural Lazio hard due to a lack of sales from exports, and some farmers have even fallen into bankruptcy and forced to sell their farms. If we are to help both our people and economy we must begin to aid our farmers and save them from bankruptcy through subsidies and limiting production of agricultural products to create demand."
PAP_agricultural_incentives:0 "Agricultural Incentives"
PAP_agricultural_incentives_desc:0 "One way to further improve our agriculture and recover from the Black Monday crisis would be to reduce taxes on agricultural equipment and raise protectionist tariffs in order to encourage domestic farming over foreign goods and provide another source of revenue for the government."
PAP_economic_recovery:0 "Black Monday Recovery"
PAP_economic_recovery_desc:0 "The burst of industrial and agricultural development in our country has clearly been enough to spur the Papal State's recovery from the financial nightmare. Let us all celebrate!"
PAP_campaign_promises:0 "Fulfill Campaign Promises"
PAP_campaign_promises_desc:0 "We have promised much to the people of Rome during the former Papal government and the first elections. Now that we are in power we must begin to live up to our promises and build the Kingdom of Rome into a nation worthy of sharing the name of the greatest empire in history."
PAP_infrastructure_investment:0 "Urban Renewal in Rome"
PAP_infrastructure_investment_desc:0 "Rome was last given a fresh start when rebuilding from the 1527 sack by the Charles V's armies. Since then, the population has boomed, but many of these new citizens find themselves living in ramshackle houses, as slums crowd ancient Roman buildings. We must engage in a program of urban renewal to make our great city both more beautiful and more efficient. The people in the slums may not see it that way, though."
PAP_military_railways:0 "Military Railways"
PAP_military_railways_desc:0 "A critical part of waging war that often gets overlooked is logistics. If we are to keep our armies well supplied in the coming war against the syndicalists up north we must ensure that our military railways are in top working order so that supplies and equipment may be delivered quickly to the front with few complications."
PAP_education_reform:0 "Educational Reform"
PAP_education_reform_desc:0 "We have so far neglected the need for a modern and highly efficient education system and the necessity of keeping the scientists well supported. Our new progressive reform will improve our situation in this area greatly."
PAP_university_grants:0 "Papal University Grants"
PAP_university_grants_desc:0 "We know of many bright minds in our universities, but unfortunately, they need more funding to continue their projects, which the Church is ready to provide. It is time to improve the qualities of our scientists."
PAP_expand_ports:0 "Expand Ports"
PAP_expand_ports_desc:0 "While the Papal State invested much into rebuilding the Pontifical Navy for a new age, the ports themselves and especially the shipbuilding industry were often neglected. With enough development, the docks of Rome shall become an ideal centre of shipping in the Mediterranean."
PAP_heavy_industry:0 "Attract Heavy Industry"
PAP_heavy_industry_desc:0 "For Rome to be an effective military power as it once was we will need to build artillery, vehicles and armour to assist our troops in battle against the larger and stronger armies of our enemies, as well as steel for building modern military equipment. To do this we will need to adjust our laws and spending to attract and encourage heavy industrial production."
PAP_airfield_expansion:0 "Military Airfield Expansion"
PAP_airfield_expansion_desc:0 "Our air force leaders have long been demanding additional funds. Our air bases do indeed need expansion."
PAP_roman_army:0 "Roman Army"
PAP_roman_army_desc:0 "Our former government, confident in the unlikelihood of a war and the protection of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, did not invest much in an army leaving the defence of the nation to only a small Palatine Honour Guard. With war seemingly becoming an inevitability it is essential that our army is fit to inherit the legacy of Rome and isn't reliant on Sicilian protection."
PAP_armed_citizenry:0 "Armed Citizenry"
PAP_armed_citizenry_desc:0 "If Rome is to protect its independence from the northerners or the exiled Savoyards its citizens must be prepared to resist any invading armies. Inspired by our Swiss Guards we can begin to implement a Swiss-style militia system, requiring our citizens to own a personal rifle and ammunition and to engage in periodical combat and marksmanship training so that our people can fight effectively when the time comes."
PAP_industry_captains:0 "Captains of Industry"
PAP_industry_captains_desc:0 "While the days of Rome being the world's greatest power are gone we must foster the Roman economy as much as possible. The greatest decider of economic strength in this era is industry, which the previous government under Pius XI viewed negatively and was reluctant to encourage. Now that Rome is under new governance we must undo these previous policies and ensure that Roman industry flourishes."
PAP_men_of_rome:0 "Men of Rome"
PAP_men_of_rome_desc:0 "Should our nation be invaded every man in Rome must be ready and determined to resist and drive out the invaders by any means necessary, using guerrilla warfare and their knowledge of the terrain to outwit and ambush the occupying forces."
PAP_legionary_spirit:0 "Legionary Spirit"
PAP_legionary_spirit_desc:0 "Through the discipline, organisation, persistence and motivation of the Roman Legions Rome emerged from an Italian city-state to become the world's greatest power and forever left a glorious mark on history. In these precarious times, we must revive this legendary discipline and make the legions of Rome internationally renowned once again."
PAP_army_reorganisation:0 "Army Reorganisation"
PAP_army_reorganisation_desc:0 "Ever since the re-establishment of the Papal State the defence of Rome was left purely up to the small Palatine Guard and the protection of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. With the new civilian government reforming the nation and army it is time to establish a professional army so that we may stand up for ourselves against the northerners."
PAP_latin_perimeter:0 "Latin Perimeter"
PAP_latin_perimeter_desc:0 "Our northern border lies exposed. It must be reinforced."
PAP_combined_arms:0 "Combined Arms"
PAP_combined_arms_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to field a proper infantry army and fortified our borders for war with the North we should begin to fully modernise our army by researching motorised vehicles and tanks to assist our infantry in battle and encircle the enemy forces."
PAP_navy:0 "The Pontifical Navy"
PAP_navy_desc:0 "Despite our state's small size we have rebuilt the Pontifical Navy following independence from the Italians. However, our current fleet, including the former Italian battleship Roma, is becoming old and outdated, and will only be able to stall the enemy for a while should war break out. If we want to rule the seas we will need to continue building and modernising our navy."
PAP_in_being:0 "Fleet in Being"
PAP_in_being_desc:0 "The Pontifical Navy must gallantly face the enemy's naval forces head on and claim the Mediterranean as our sea, as our ancestors did long ago."
PAP_trade_interdiction:0 "Trade Interdiction"
PAP_trade_interdiction_desc:0 "While we may have dominated the Mediterranean long ago our small state has no hopes of achieving such an ambition today. If our navy is to compete successfully against stronger opponents we must focus on hitting the enemy's trade."
PAP_roman_fleet:0 "A Roman Fleet"
PAP_roman_fleet_desc:0 "Long ago, we exercised the absolute control over the Mediterranean. It would be shameful if our ambitions were not to once again rule the area by large and powerful ships."
PAP_submarines:0 "Submarine Focus"
PAP_submarines_desc:0 "Submarines are an exceptionally powerful weapon. Relatively easy to build and deadly to even the biggest ships, they need to be focused on."
PAP_screens:0 "Cruiser Focus"
PAP_screens_desc:0 "Cruisers and Destroyers are useful in many ways and it is imperative to have a fleet to patrol our waters. They should be included in our navy."
PAP_air_force:0 "The Pontifical Air Force"
PAP_air_force_desc:0 "While we have built up a sizable navy by the standards of a small nation such as ours, we have not yet invested in an air force, giving our enemies a critical advantage over us. We must quickly rectify this if Rome is not to be destroyed from above in the event of war with the Socialist Republic of Italy."
PAP_defend_skies:0 "Defend the Skies of Rome"
PAP_defend_skies_desc:0 "Without air superiority, we can never make use of aircraft. Improving our fighters should be our top priority."
PAP_bombers:0 "Bomber Focus"
PAP_bombers_desc:0 "Bombers are seeing massive improvements all around the world. We must keep up and make use of them ourselves."
PAP_closeair_support:0 "CAS Focus"
PAP_closeair_support_desc:0 "Our land forces need proper air support to fight effectively. Our new CAS designs will help us achieve this."
PAP_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bomber Focus"
PAP_naval_bombers_desc:0 "We can achieve a certain level of naval superiority without even using our ships. However, better bomber models will need to be developed."
PAP_radar:0 "Radar Focus"
PAP_radar_desc:0 "With the syndicalists having an industrial advantage over our small nation we must stay a step ahead if we are to defend ourselves in the air, the building of radars could help us achieve this advantage by allowing us to detect our enemy beforehand and react accordingly."
PAP_anti_air:0 "Anti-Air Defences"
PAP_anti_air_desc:0 "While we have begun to fortify our borders and have an effective navy to combat syndicalist invasions from the sea we have neglected our defences from the air. We cannot allow the precious works of art and history in Rome to be destroyed by syndicalist bombing raids."
PAP_reformed_power:0 "Reformed Temporal Power"
PAP_reformed_power_desc:0 "The Pope has established that his temporal power over the Papal State and its claimed territories offered to us by the Donation of Pepin and stolen by the Piedmontese in 1860 shall continue. To enforce this and quell dissent ultramontane groups have proposed that we establish the temporal power of the Pope as a dogma, divinely revealed by God himself."
PAP_faithful_arms:0 "Call to Arms for the Faithful"
PAP_faithful_arms_desc:0 "The Papacy has a history of using foreign soldiers to defend it, and with the Catholic nations of France and northern Italy under syndicalist rule there are many devout Catholics and war veterans with grudges against the Communards who will flock to our cause and help us bolster our forces for the coming fight."
PAP_palatine_guard:0 "Expand the Palatine Guard"
PAP_palatine_guard_desc:0 "The current Palatine Guard, while expanded since the years following the fall of Italy with the incorporation of the Swiss Guard, still remains far too small an army for our protection against the growing Syndicalist might. We must expand the Palatine Guard into reborn Zouaves if we are to be able to field a proper army against our enemies."
PAP_zouave_officers:0 "Zouave Officers"
PAP_zouave_officers_desc:0 "While we have received many Catholic volunteers willing to join our army, a majority are inexperienced exiles fleeing Syndicalist rule in the north of Italy and the French Commune. We will need to recruit some experienced Catholic officers to successfully train and lead our reformed Zouaves into battle."
PAP_zouave_mobilisation:0 "Zouave Mobilisation"
PAP_zouave_mobilisation_desc:0 "Now that war has broken out we must rally the Catholic world to our cause and encourage foreign volunteers to join the Zouaves and protect the Universal Church from Syndicalist desecration."
PAP_financial_aid:0 "Financial Aid"
PAP_financial_aid_desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis has severely affected our state and sent our national debt spiralling out of control, encouraging dangerous democratic and syndicalist sentiments and unrest among our people. If we are to maintain order and bring our economy back to normal we must seek financial aid from our longtime protector, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies."
PAP_budget_rebalancing:0 "Budget Rebalancing"
PAP_budget_rebalancing_desc:0 "With the effects of the crisis still affecting our state despite our attempts to get financial aid from the Sicilians we must enact austerity measures if we are to quickly recover from Black Monday, even if it is unpopular with our people in the short-term."
PAP_temporal_debt:0 "Ending Temporal Debt"
PAP_temporal_debt_desc:0 "Unfortunately our austerity measures while having a positive effect have not been yet completely eliminated our national debt or the economic repercussions of Black Monday. One radical idea to end the crisis would be to use Papal gold to repay those whom we are indebted to, which would be popular among the people but unpopular within the Church."
PAP_military_aid:0 "Military Aid"
PAP_military_aid_desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis has greatly emboldened the syndicalist powers, who see it as an opportunity to strike while other nations are weakened by the crisis. The chance of such an attack on our state is a major worry for many in the Curia, who have recommended reaching out to our protectors, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, for military aid in modernising our armies so as to defend the Holy See in such an event."
PAP_sicilian_advisors:0 "Sicilian Advisers"
PAP_sicilian_advisors_desc:0 "While we have recruited many foreign soldiers and officers into our military, we will need training from Sicilian military advisers if the strategy of our armies is to be modernised and effective."
PAP_technical_aides:0 "Technical Aides"

### Events ###
papalstate.1.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the Papal State!"
papalstate.1.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depth, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached us. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, our currency is losing value, industrial exports are shrinking, and our national debt is beginning to grow out of control..."
papalstate.1.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."
papalstate.2.t:0 "Father Charles Coughlin"
papalstate.2.d:0 "Three years ago today, Father Charles Coughlin started doing a weekly radio broadcast in America and more than 50 million people turn on their radios and listen. He is a raving Anti-Semite, claiming that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'fermented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International Conspiracy of Jewish Bankers' and somehow people still tune in. His hate-speech will not be tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so his hateful message cannot reach the public."
papalstate.2.a:0 "Ask the President of the United States to shut down this 'Radio Priest'"
papalstate.2.b:0 "It would be best if we did not interfere."
papalstate.3.t:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno"
papalstate.3.d:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno (Latin for 'In the 45th Year') is a new encyclical written by Pope Pius XI that discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order (45 years after Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum encyclical). The encyclical describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and syndicalism, calling for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. In the first part, he reviews and applauds the encyclical of his predecessor, which helped the development of a new social conscience.\nAccording to Pius XI, three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family responsibilities, the economic condition of the enterprise and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and sound enterprises. For this, Pope Pius concludes that solidarity, not conflict, is a necessary condition. The pope, therefore, demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees through new forms of cooperation and communication among Catholic citizens. A new era of Catholic Corporatism is just beginning."
papalstate.3.a:0 "Excellent."
papalstate.4.t:0 "Donations from the Faithful"
papalstate.4.d:0 "With the very seat of God's church under threat from non-believers for the first time in centuries, donations have been pouring in from Catholics throughout the world."
papalstate.4.a:0 "Every bit counts."
papalstate.5.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes"
papalstate.5.d:0 "The order has been given to clear the Pontine Marshes and thus open the once-useless land for farming or industry. The plan will require the employment of thousands of Romans and take many months to get the bulk of it done, but the outcome may be worth it."
papalstate.5.a:0 "So long as it keeps them working, I'm happy."
papalstate.6.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes Are Cleared"
papalstate.6.d:0 "The areas formerly known as the Pontine Marshes are now cleared, with factories and farms springing up throughout the area, further strengthening our nation economically."
papalstate.6.a:0 "A monumental achievement!"
papalstate.7.t:0 "Pius XI Passes Away"
papalstate.8.t:0 "The Successor to St. Peter"
papalstate.8.d:0 "The Holy See has finally come together to deliberate the election of a new Pope following Pius XI's death. In the end, they choose to..."
papalstate.8.a:0 "...elect the pious and popular Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli as Pius XII"
papalstate.8.b:0 "...elect the charitable Elia Cardinal dalla Costa as Stephen X"
papalstate.8.c:0 "...elect the socialist cardinal, Achille Liènart, as John XXIII"
papalstate.8.e:0 "...elect the hardline cardinal Theodor Innitzer as Julius IV"
papalstate.9.t:0 "The First Roman Elections"
papalstate.9.d:0 "With the Pope relinquishing his temporal power and the transition from Papal rule to democracy under way, free elections shall take place in Rome for the first time since the Roman Republic of 1849. The question is, which party shall come out victorious?"
papalstate.9.a:0 "Il Movimento Sociale Latino!"
papalstate.9.b:0 "L'Alleanza Cristiana Democratica!"
papalstate.10.t:0 "The [GetYear] Roman Elections"
papalstate.10.d:0 "With approval granted by Pope [Root.GetLeader], elections are once again held in Rome."
papalstate.10.a:0 "Il Movimento Sociale Latino is victorious!"
papalstate.10.b:0 "L'Alleanza Cristiana Democratica is victorious!"
papalstate.11.t:0 "Financial Aid from the Two Sicilies?"
papalstate.11.d:0 "While we have determined that the best way to get the Black Monday crisis under control is to seek a bailout from the Kingdom of Two Sicilies we must decide how much of our debt we shall ask them to take. If we were to ask them to take on all of our debts it would greatly improve our financial situation but would also give away much of our sovereignty to the Sicilians. If this proves unacceptable we could instead request that they take on only some of our debt, although should we do this we would have to enact measures ourselves to clear the remaining debt and economic damage."
papalstate.11.a:0 "Ask the Sicilians to take our whole debt"
papalstate.11.b:0 "Only ask them to take some of our debt"
papalstate.12.t:0 "The Papal State's Request"
papalstate.12.d:0 "The Papal State has been hit hard by Black Monday and in particular they are unable to handle their international debts. Despite our own economic troubles, they have requested that we take on all of their debts and while we have protected them ever since the collapse of Italy and accepting their request would give us far more control over their state, many question if our economy would be able to handle the stress."
papalstate.12.a:0 "Accept their request"
papalstate.12.b:0 "Take on some of their debts"
papalstate.12.c:0 "Refuse - our own nation must come first"
papalstate.13.t:0 "Two Sicilies Accepts!"
papalstate.13.d:0 "The Sicilians have agreed to take on our debt! While we have given significant concessions and the Sicilian government now has far more influence over us, at least our debts have been cleared and our economy is running again."
papalstate.13.a:0 "Great!"
papalstate.14.t:0 "Two Sicilies Partially Accepts"
papalstate.14.d:0 "Unfortunately the Sicilians were unwilling to take on our full debt due to their own economic problems following Black Monday, but they have still agreed to take part of it, helping to relieve the burden on ourselves even if we will have to take steps for our economy to fully recover."
papalstate.14.a:0 "It's better than nothing."
papalstate.15.t:0 "Two Sicilies Refuses!"
papalstate.15.d:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies have refused our generous request, claiming that their nation's economy comes first! This will make the road towards improving our state's economy more expensive than we had hoped."
papalstate.15.a:0 "How unfaithful."
papalstate.16.t:0 "The Papal State's Request"
papalstate.16.d:0 "The Papal State has been hit hard by Black Monday and in particular they are unable to handle their international debts. Despite our own economic troubles they have requested that we take on some of their debts and while we have protected ever since the collapse of Italy and our people are faithful to the Church and the Pope, many question if our economy would be able to handle the stress."
papalstate.16.a:0 "Accept their request"
papalstate.16.b:0 "Refuse - our own nation must come first"
papalstate.17.t:0 "Two Sicilies Accepts!"
papalstate.17.d:0 "The Sicilians have agreed to take on some of our debts! Although we have not reached the light at the end of the tunnel yet, the elimination of some of our debts will lighten the load on our economy and make our recovery an easier task."
papalstate.17.a:0 "Great!"
papalstate.18.t:0 "Military Aid for the Papal State?"
papalstate.18.d:0 "As international tensions grow and the possibility of a second Weltkrieg arises the Papal State has begun to see the need to rebuild its army in order to defend the Holy See from desecration by the vile syndicalists just across our border, and have reached out to us to aid them in modernising their forces. How shall we respond?"
papalstate.18.a:0 "Assist them as much as possible!"
papalstate.18.b:0 "We can spare them some help."
papalstate.18.c:0 "No need - we can protect them ourselves."
papalstate.19.t:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies Accepts!"
papalstate.19.d:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies has accepted our request and begun to aid us in modernising our military technology so that we may defend ourselves from the tyranny of syndicalism."
papalstate.19.a:0 "Great!"
papalstate.20.t:0 "Two Sicilies Supplies Some Aid"
papalstate.20.d:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies have accepted our request and while they have not given us as much military aid as we had hoped what they have seen fit to give should hopefully assist us in modernising our army."
papalstate.20.a:0 "It's better than nothing."
papalstate.21.t:0 "Two Sicilies Refuses!"
papalstate.21.d:0 "To our disappointment, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies have refused our request for military aid, claiming that doing so would be a waste of time and resources for their own nation and that the Sicilian army is capable of defending Rome themselves."
papalstate.21.a:0 "How foolish and arrogant."
papalstate.22.t:0 "Syndicalist Guerrilla Campaign"
papalstate.22.d:0 "While we have thwarted the syndicalists in their attempt to bring about a second Risorgimento and reclaimed the land stolen by Piedmont in 1860, it appears that our troubles have not ended there. Syndicalists in the liberated territories, refusing to recognise our rightful rule, have taken up arms against our government and are engaging in a campaign of guerrilla warfare against us!"
papalstate.22.a:0 "These subversives must be brought to justice!"
papalstate.23.t:0 "Syndicalist Riots"
papalstate.23.d:0 "Today many syndicalist sympathisers turned out for protests and demonstrations against our rule in the formerly Italian territories. The protests soon turned into rioting, causing much damage in acts of vandalism and injuring many."
papalstate.23.a:0 "Damn!"
papalstate.24.t:0 "Syndicalist Ambushes"
papalstate.24.d:0 "Syndicalist guerrillas have staged ambushes against our troops throughout our nation!"
papalstate.24.a:0 "Damn!"
papalstate.25.t:0 "Syndicalist Bombing"
papalstate.25.d:0 "The syndicalist guerrillas carried out a bomb attack today, dealing large damage to our infrastructure in that area."
papalstate.25.a:0 "Damn!"
papalstate.26.t:0 "Syndicalist Sabotage"
papalstate.26.d:0 "The syndicalist guerrillas have bombed one of our factories in an attempt to sabotage our industry!"
papalstate.26.a:0 "Damn!"
papalstate.27.t:0 "End of the Syndicalist Resistance"
papalstate.27.d:0 "After many long months of guerrilla warfare we have finally been successful in rooting out and destroying the syndicalist remnants still opposing our rule."
papalstate.27.a:0 "At last!"
papalstate.38.t:0 "Effects of Black Monday End!"
papalstate.38.d:0 "While it was a hard and trying time for our nation and economy, the effects of the Black Monday crisis are at last at an end, and our country can begin to move on."
papalstate.38.a:0 "Finally!"
papalstate.39.t:0 "The Papal Conclave"
papalstate.39.d:0 "With the passing of Pius XI, the cardinals of the Catholic Church have convened within the Sistine Chapel to elect the new Pope. They will remain in seclusion until a consensus has been reached, and a new successor to St. Peter has been chosen by the electors."
papalstate.39.a:0 "Let us pray they choose wisely."
papalstate.40.t:0 "The State of the Papacy"
papalstate.40.d:0 "Following the collapse of Italy after the Weltkrieg, Rome became in danger of capture by the republican rebels against the old Kingdom. The blurry battle lines of the civil war mostly spared Rome due to the protection of the southern royalist forces, which, together with local right wing militias, crushed uprisings in Rome. The Pope soon emerged from the Vatican to take back up the administration of his God-ordained domain, but the debilitated state had no armed forces loyal to it, and it had scarce chances at resisting any Syndicalist offensive. However, the white generals in the south would not stand by while the centre of Catholicism fell to syndicalism, and led a counter-offensive to secure Rome, bringing the Papal State under royalist, later Sicilian, protection, receiving support from foreign volunteers in Rome, the reborn Zouave corps.\n\nAfter the war ended, the Papal States joined the Italian Federation along with its protectors in Naples, but controlled only a small fraction of its nominal territory, and was and is in most respects a rump, puppet state of the Sicilians. Following the declaration of independence along with Sardinia and the Two Sicilies in 1926, it has been recognized as an independent state by the majority of nations in the world, though it is extremely limited in its diplomatic options. \n\nIn the sphere of Curia politics, the fading health of Pius is in everyone's minds, and it remains to be seen who will succeed him should he pass in the coming years."
papalstate.40.a:0 "Interesting."
papalstate.41.t:0 "The Siculo-Papal Joint Planning Staff"
papalstate.41.d:0 "The Papal State has just proposed that our nation and theirs create a joint planning staff, so as to coordinate our future wars against the threats that plague Italy better."

This would serve to weaken the syndicalists, and also give the Papacy an ability to raise partisan forces behind their lines once the inevitable war begins. If the [SRI.GetAdjective] government discovers [PAP.GetNameDef]'s involvement, however, it could mean an invasion... and, since [Root.GetNameDef] acts as the Pope's protector, that is why he has decided to ask permission.

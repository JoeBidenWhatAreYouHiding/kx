LIC_FRANZ_I_DESC:0 "Born in Castle Liechtenstein, in Lower Austria, as Franz de Paula Maria Karl August, Franz I began his early life like many Liechtensteiner princes and royalty: off in Austrian and Bohemian properties, receiving education there, out of their little principality. He studied law in the Viennese and Prague universities in 1871 through 1878, earning entry into Austro-Hungarian diplomatic duties.\nFirst serving as an attache to Belgium, right after his exit from school, Franz I then joined in the task of administrating the Liechtenstein family's royal holdings and properties, even representing the prince himself on many occasion. His actions garnered the watchful eyes of K.u.K. authorities, and in time Franz I became a man involved in diplomatic expeditions to both Rome and St. Petersburg. He presided over the warmest period of Austro-Russian relations as the ambassador to St. Petersburg, then the capital of the old Russian Empire, between the Crimean War and the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. One of Franz I's greatest diplomatic triumphs lies in the Kaiser-Entrevue in 1897, allowing the Austro-Hungarian delegation's departure at the time of the Weltkrieg a ten-year entente, or understanding.\n While serving as ambassador, Franz I took on one of the most radical ideas for an Austrian of his time: an Austro-Russian alliance, attempting to prevent the Tsar from declaring war, and at long last Franz I was forced to resign.\nAfter this, not much of note happened to the aging Franz, until 1929, 8 years after the end of the Weltkrieg: Johann II, prince of Liechtenstein, perished, leaving the throne of the principality to him. Franz I's reign marked a strengthening of the Austro-Liechtensteiner Customs Union, which has been faltering in recent years in favor of Switzerland. Franz I is at and old age now, and many believe that Franz Josef II will become the next Prince of Liechtenstein. For now, though, Franz has presided upon a time of great prosperity in the little Principality of Liechtenstein. He successfully used his diplomatic prowess to resolve the Trans-Alpine Strikes in his country and Vorarlberg, and some say that the princes' "usual" residence will become Vaduz at long last."

LIC_FRANZ_II_DESC:0 "The prince following the late Franz I, Franz Josef II, the industrialist and man of money, was born at Schloss Frauenthal in Deutschlandsberg, in Styria to parents Alois and Elisabeth Amalie. At his baptising was his great-uncle and godfather, Franz Josef I of Austria. Young Franz became heir to the throne in 1929 at 23 years old, a feat remarkable for the old House of Liechtenstein.\nWhile young, the Prince has embarked on extravagant and strange spending adventures, increasingly looking into Alaska and eyeing Austrian territories lest they go asunder. Young Franz II is an avid supporter of the industrialization of Liechtenstein, assisting in establishing new factories and initiating new public works projects. Thus Franz II has gained a popularity both within and outside Liechtenstein that exceeded Franz I at many times.\nNow as Prince of Liechtenstein, Franz II is the first Prince since the acquisition of the Principality to principally live within the principality of Liechtenstein's princely quarters, the princely Palace of Liechtenstein in Vaduz. Franz II still maintains industrial investments and advancements with both Swiss and Austrian colleagues, yet always espouses Liechtensteiner neutrality at any and every possible opportunity.\nPrince Franz Josef II is expected to be one for the princely archives, as his achievements shall decide little Liechtenstein's future in the decades to come."

LIC_RUDOLF_SCHAEDLER_DESC:0 "Born on March 31, 1903, Rudolf Schädler and the party he commands has forever been shrouded in both mystery and distrust. As a young boy, Schädler was enthralled with nature, art, and music, entering into the Basel Conservatory in his later teens. Young Schädler came upon the Ostara magazine by chance in his years as a tavern owner, fascinated by Lanz von Liebenfels' radical, enrapturing tellings of Germanic superiority and the bright natural state of the Earth and all of it. Schädler came to adopt his own school of Ariosophy, largely absent of Liebenfels' celestial tellings and Aryan superpowers. Schädler became a founding member of the VDBL, or Volksdeutsche Bewegung in Liechtenstein, in 1938. The VDBL was built upon a platform of Greater Germany, taking in inspiration from Liebenfels, Georg von Schoenerer, and the Iron Guard in Romania.\nWhile hated, the VDBL has triumped, yet must go its own route, away from that of Greater Germany. For now, Schädler shall lead Liechtenstein to its Germanic renaissance it always yearned for, in an era that shall mark a new dawn for Liechtenstein."

LIC_customs_union:0 "Austro-Liechtensteiner Customs Union"
LIC_customs_union_desc:0 "The Customs Union of Liechtenstein and Austria was first established in 1852, and fully melds the economies of our two states into one large market. With free, open trade between our realms and with one shared economic zone, we enjoy all the economic benefits of being with the wider Austro-Hungarian Empire without having to actually be within it politically, and even military benefits for our protection given that we have no standing army. However, despite the economic boon that this has caused our nation - a greatly one-sided boon that benefits our small principality more than the vast Empire - many within our borders feel that the Customs Union infringes upon our stance of neutrality. This has caused tensions within the government, so we must monitor this situation and tread carefully, especially as Vienna’s ambitions grow."

LIC_austro_swiss_divide:0 "Austro-Swiss Divide"
LIC_austro_swiss_divide_desc:0 "Our small but proud nation is currently divided as competing forces threaten to tear our realm asunder. For nearly a century we have been bound to Austria economically through the Customs Union, but some say it is time to end this long standing economic pact. These worried ministers and princes fear it compromises our famous stance of permanent neutrality - a position firmly held since 1868 - and have instead pushed for closer ties with Bern over Vienna. Opposing them are the Austrian loyalists and defenders of the status quo who seek to continue the Customs Union, further linking our economy with that of the Empire. With these competing factions arguing nonstep, refusing to cooperate and impeding the duties of the state and the Crown, our small principality must heal this schism and decide our destiny."

Sparking over resentment to Habsburg dominance and foreign rule under Vienna, the strikes started in North Italy and raged across Switzerland, Austria, and our Liechtenstein. These strikes have left a deep mark on our nation, and have given rise to extremism on both ends of the political spectrum. Pertaining to little Liechtenstein, the issue of social securities and rising unemployment were raised as chief issues in regard to little Liechtenstein. Though the Crown remains solidly in control, the government around it is in peril and might be easily subjected to radical change. We must remain vigilant and resolve ourselves against this rising tide of radicalism."

LIC_princely_holdings_idea:0 "Holdings of the House"
LIC_princely_holdings_idea_desc:0 "All across Europe, the various sigils and symbols of our House adorn properties both large and small. From small plots to massive estates and castles, the Crown owns properties, business interests, and other investments from Spain to Russia - each providing their own slice of income that contributes to the vast wealth of our small principality. Due to these holdings, the Crown is rich, but perhaps it may be time to let loose on some in order to free up funds or to forge new friendships."

BOTDE_SRI_LANKA_LOBBY_desc:0 "With Black Monday having shattered the pre-eminent world power's economic might, some of its overseas assets are liabilities, or, even better, able to be taken advantage of.\nOne such example is the island of Ceylon, under German control for a long few years. Germany now desperately needs money, and one obvious contender, one colony, and one oddball has come out to duke it financially over the fate of Ceylon.\nLobbyists from the incredibly rich Indian princes in the south come to Ceylon to build a network, intent on making Ceylon the first step in Indian unification.\nHundreds of kilometers away, out of the Indian subcontinent and on snowy mountaintops rising high over a river, lies a European royal house. The Princely House of Liechtenstein, south of the Kaiserreich, sends surveyors and investors to scope out Ceylon for their Prince and Fatherland in an ever-mystifying ambition.\nBut not all of Imperial Germany wishes to relinquish its hold on its stronghold on the Indian Ocean. German East Asia, too, has sent fleets of men and money to Ceylon to turn it over from direct rule to governorshop under the German eastern pearl.\nCeylon is now a financial battleground, and only one side may come out on top.\n\nThe [PRF.GetFlag] §OPrincely Federation§! has [?PRF.CEYLON_INFLEUNCE|Y0] influence in §GCeylon§!.\nThe [LIC.GetFlag] §CPrincipality of Liechtenstein§! has [?LIC.CEYLON_INFLEUNCE|Y0] influence in §GCeylon§!.\nThe [GEA.GetFlag] §LColony of Deutsch-Ostasien§! has [?GEA.CEYLON_INFLEUNCE|Y0] influence in §GCeylon§!.\nThe [GER.GetFlag] §gGerman Empire§! supports [GEA.GetFlag] §LDeutsch-Ostasien§! in its endeavours.\n\nFor §GCeylon§! to be in one's hands, certainly, one must have §Y20§! points of influence, and §Y5§! over the competitor.\n\nA nation under the jackboot of Europeans does not like to stay under the oppression of the boot.

Predictably, they are not thrilled about our acquisition: a far-away, incredibly small, foriegn nation has seized land many times its size.

lic.1.t:0 "The Principality of Liechtenstein, circa 1936"
lic.1.d:0 "Neutral since 1868, following the dissolution of the German Confederation, Liechtenstein has stayed in its state of permanent, respected neutrality, lasting through the Weltkrieg and maintaining to today.\nOne of Europe's smallest extant nations, with a western border entirely dictated by the young Rhine, Liechtenstein's eleven thousand strong population maintains an agricultural, rural lifestyle, much like other Alpine areas. Recently, though, with the coronation of Franz I and at the encouragement of Franz Josef II, Liechtenstein has been rapidly industrialising in recent years, and while Liechtensteiner industry is still in its infancy, the vast, rich, prosperous properties of the ruling House of Liechtenstein, from which our little principality takes its name, has been playing a large role in the expansion and construction of new factories.\nThe goods exported from these youthful assembly lines usually go to Austria, as per the 1852 Customs Treaty. However, the rising flames that lick the world ever closer frighten our quaint nation. Some feel as if Austria will get pulled into the war, and if Swiss neutrality is disrespected, which some feel may very well happen, then Liechtenstein may be in mortal danger. Thus the customs union with Austria has experienced a decline since 1921, as traders seek routes into Switzerland, for Swiss markets.\nThe Alpine region as a whole was brought to its knees in 1930, after a strike in Italy protesting Habsburg occupation some time after the end of the Italian Civil War burned out of control, spreading fervor to Switzerland, Austria, what is now Illyria, and even little Liechtenstein. The trade union movement that Syndicalism spearheaded has given the LAV, or Liechtensteiner Arbeiterverband, a somewhat large portion of economic policy inside the Landtag. However, the LAV, uniquely, does not see the King as an obstacle, but rather a potential ally.\nThe rise of Lanz von Liebenfels and the ANI has brought similar far-right waves to Liechtenstein, empowering the LHD, or Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst, which formed in 1930, headed by Otto Schaedler.\nPrime Minister Josef Hoop, the reigning prime minister since 1928, has kept Liechtenstein in a status quo, but time and our neighbors care not for us, and Hoop's status quo is threatened from outside. The Trans-Alpine Strikes, as they are known, has pushed first and foremost the lack of social security, now a focal point of the new UEK and LAV, and the unemployment that strangles common Liechtensteiners. The House has been combatting these issues, with public works projects taking place along rapid industrialization, paid for by the Princes themselves.\nToday, in 1936, Liechtenstein could be called the most well-off nation in its immediate region, but as history has shown time and time again, we should be prepared for unforeseen consequences."
lic.1.a:0 "Für Gott, Fürst und Vaterland!"

lic.2.t:0 "Black Monday Striketh!"
lic.2.d:0 "Disaster strikes the eleven thousand of Liechtenstein! As our economy bears heavy ties to Vienna, and therefore Berlin by association, the recent details of the great Berlin Stock Market Crash, or Black Monday, as it is known simply, has not spared neutral little Liechtenstein! Switzerland has suffered a heavy hit too, and with ties to Austria being already in the question, the question has sprung again: "Should Liechtenstein pursue Swiss ties?" While Franz I had reinvigorated the ages-old customs union between Vaduz and Vienna, the crash has reportedly the whole of the princely house questioning the resolve of the customs agreement.\nAs for immediate actions, Franz Josef II, heir to the principality, has begun public works initiatives: canals, roads, schools, new buildings, investitures. It is thanks to him that Black Monday has not grinded Liechtenstein to a halt, and while employment suffered a large thwack on the head, Franz Josef II has ensured that his initiatives will keep the economic downturn as a minor footnote in Liechtensteiner history. While others struggle for survival, Liechtenstein and Prince shall prevail!"
lic.2.a:0 "What shall happen to princely fortunes?!"

lic.3.t:0 "Death of Franz I"
lic.3.d:0 "Reports from Austria and Bohemian castles housing Liechtensteiner royalty have only confirmed the rumors: Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein, has passed away today, in his sleep, at age 84 in Castle Feldberg. He died peacefully in his sleep of natural causes. Kaiser Karl I of Austria has already expressed his condolences, as has Maximilian Lobkowicz of Bohemia. The body has been put in a coffin, and a symbolic funeral parade has taken its route throughout a nationwide drive of Liechtenstein, as 'Oben am jungen Rhein' plays from a somber brass. As for Franz I's deceased body, it has been laid to rest in the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Brno.\n Franz Josef II, heir to the throne, has taken leadership over the House of Liechtenstein, and in a historic event of Liechtensteiners, has moved into Castle Liechtenstein in Vaduz, declaring it his home. This marks the first time a Liechtensteiner prince has actually lived in Liechtenstein, further solidifying Franz Josef II's massive popularity in Liechtenstein."
lic.3.a:0 "Hail to thee, Franz Josef II!"

lic.4.t:0 "A Convenient Count"
lic.4.d:0 "With economic plight comes political adversity. The Berlin Stock Market Crash has proved just that, all around the world, and Liechtenstein is no exception to this. Fortunately for us, a general election was slated for February, and both rounds of the election have come to a close.\nJosef Hoop has ruled Liechtenstein as Prime Minister since 1928, and has led Liechtenstein's economy up - but with Black Monday, some blame the failure on him and his inability to switch to Swiss markets.\nThe VU, a recent amalgam of the LHD and the VP, created to contest Hoop and the UEK, is notably pro-Swiss in its economic policy. Always the underdog in elections, Black Monday may provide the VU with the momentum it needs to finally own the Landtag.\nThe UEK was formed during the height of the Trans-Alpine Strikes, and the timing has been a principal contributor of the UEK's current political successes. Offering a new program with economic recovery as its highest priority, some see the UEK as the beginning of something new."
lic.4.a:0 "The FBP continues Hoop's reign!"
lic.4.b:0 "The VU's coalition overpowers!"
lic.4.c:0 "The new UEK strikes its first win!"

lic.5.t:0 "Formation of the Vaterländische Union"
lic.5.d:0 "Seeking to push past Hoop's steel grip over Liechtensteiner hearts, the Vaterländische Union has united the minds of the Christian-Social Party and the Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst. Figures from the Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst dominate the upper positions of party rule, and Otto Schaedler has been placed as chairman of the new political force.\nAmong its primary policy is termination of the Austro-Liechtensteiner Customs Union and advancements of the Swiss relationship, along with a new Swiss customs union, and with that reorienting the Landesbank to the Swiss National Bank.\nInspired heavily by Engelbert Dollfuss and the Swiss Frontenbewegung, the VU espouses Catholic and corporatist ideals. Some of the most radical support the Heimwehr in Austria, forming a surprisingly broad range of views for the party. Central to Schaedler's policy is keeping this strange coalition together, but once he is elected shall the real test begin."
lic.5.a:0 "But will it really change anything?"

lic.6.t:0 "The Vaterländische Union Calls for Emergency Election!"
lic.6.d:0 "The tenure of the Fortschrittliche Bürgerpartei in Liechtenstein, or FBP, over the last few years has seen Liechtenstein draw even closer to Austria than it ever has been before. The Austro-Liechtensteiner Customs Union has been reinforced with steel, to be impenetrable for years to come in the status quo the FBP has finalized. The Principality has found itself chained to Vienna by a shackle of its own flesh, yet not all agree to this voluntary companionship. The Vaterländische Union and the UEK, besides associates to the Royal House of Liechtenstein, have expressed worry and distrust in the future of Liechtenstein while it kneels at the foot of the Habsburg throne.\nThis has coalesced in Otto Schaedler of the VU calling for an emergency election. Rumors float around the Landtag of Emil Risch, head of the Liechtensteiner Arbeiterverband, and Otto Schaedler, head of the Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst, splitting from the moderate factions of their partiesto run independently in the special election."
lic.6.a:0 "No need for such measures."
lic.6.b:0 "We need change, and we need it now!"

lic.7.t:0 "Fate of the Emergency Election"
lic.7.d:0 "With the sudden emergency election's tallies in, two things as of yet are certain: one, that the FBP has lost the vote by a significant margin. Two, the top two parties of the election are the Liechtensteiner Arbeiterverband and the Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst.\nThe Liechtensteiner Arbeiterverband, or LAV, has been criticized for its 'Syndicalist' overtures, but Emil Risch has time and time again affirmed that his loyalties lie to the Prince, and not to Paris nor London. The LAV and UEK were empowered following the Trans-Alpine Strikes, and its platform reflects its upbringings: safety for industrial workers and institutions for common betterment.\nIn contrast, the LHD, chaired by Otto Schaedler alone, has built its platform on a foundation of Liechtensteiner nationalism, away and truly separate from the grabby vices of Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. To the LHD, Liechtenstein is higher than these lows, and shall reflect the fact as such. Still, it has found allies in the Swiss Frontenbewegung, and radical elements of Austria's Heimwehr and VF.\nAs numbers climb up for the voting tallies of the LAV and LHD, one stops, and then the other; which is the latter?"
lic.7.a:0 "The LAV lights the way!"
lic.7.b:0 "The LHD secures its victory!"

lic.8.t:0 "Austria Holds the Ausgleich"
lic.8.d:0 "Our eastern brother and protector over the last few centuries, Austria's history is long and convolted. It is blotched with war, spiked with rebellions, and cracked with scandals and illicit political deals and inefficiency. Over the last few years, Austria has been taking the necessary steps to wash off the black dots that riddle its historical record, smooth out the rough edges of nationalist minorities vying for more, and seal the holes and faults they have let prosper.\nThese ameliorations have finally reached their apex, in the long-awaited Ausgleich of 1937. Vienna and Budapest stand on highly different positions on that of federalism, and while it is clear Austria will finally put its foot down to say 'no,' it remains unclear what the Magyars have to say in response. The Austrians are now promoting a federation, starting with the inclusion of Illyria as a full-fledged Constituent of Austria, following centralization in Bohemia, Galicia, Austria, and Hungary.\n\nRevolutionary Danubian federalism has entered the political spheres of oddball nations around the world, from the Caucasus to Asia, the Americas, and Mittelafrika - a solution to satisfy ever-raging oppressed peoples.\nDanubian federalism, too, has reached Liechtenstein's inner circles, particularly those of German nationalists or proponents of Swiss alliance."

lic.10.d:0 "The coup-de-etat of 1937 that has overthrown the Prince and set Liechtenstein on a fork in the road previously thought to be dealt with when the Holy Roman Empire fell many a year ago. On the left, Liechtenstein shall continue as an independent nation, or, on the other side of the long, winding road of the future, Liechtenstein shall find its place in Austria, Germany, or both; a Greater Germany. The interior circles of the VDBL, while espousing German nationalism, have to tread carefully, though - Liechtenstein relishes in its incredibly low tax rates, rates which invite business and make life easier. If Liechtenstein is to lower its red-and-blue banner for the final time, it must be universally agreed upon, and the pros and cons of such an arrangement measured on a thousand different scales."
lic.10.a:0 "We must go our own route."
lic.10.b:0 "It is time to join our brothers."
lic.10.c:0 "It is time to join our brothers."

lic.11.t:0 "Liechtenstein Requests Annexation"
lic.11.d:0 "The German nationalists of Liechtenstein have seized control of the little principality, and have seemingly come to a consensus in a political crisis we have only barely monitored. [LIC.GetLeader] has formally come to request Liechtenstein's annexation into [ROOT.GetNameDef], as part of a Greater Germany.\nSome see no benefit to adding the 160 kilometers large land, absent of valuable resources in both man and earth, while others see no benefit in not annexing the obscure, irrelevant European monarchy lying smack-dab in the center of Europe.\nUltimately, a letter is sent back to Vaduz with the official goverment answer, and in large, red ink, stands one bold word:"
lic.11.a:0 "Akzeptiert."

lic.12.t:0 "The VDBL Mounts a Coup!"
lic.12.d:0 "It has been whispered about for months, in dirty an dingy basements, lit by dull bulbs of a bygone century. They have scrawled their messages akin to homeless lunatics on a big-city sidewalk preaching the nigh end of mankind. They taunt us; they prod us. But never did we think that the small, incredibly hated, and incredibly radical Volksdeutsche Bewegung in Liechtenstein would ever make a proper move, without a single friendly face in Liechtenstein to back themselves.\nThey have found Austrian and Swiss rifles, funded by the ÖAE's radical restructurers in Austria. Plans and men, the means to an end - the members of the VDBL stormed Vaduz Castle, closed the roads between Switzerland and Austria, and demand the overturn of government to their rule alone, without the unsympathetic Prince to meddle in their 'divine' efforts.\nHermann Meier and Josef Brunhart, Police Chiefs of the Landespolizei, have taken their rifles and marched the Landespolizei to Vaduz Castle. What happens?"
lic.12.a:0 "Obviously, the coup is swiftly defeated!"
lic.12.b:0 "By only a miracle, the coup is a success!"

lic.13.t:0 "Flight in Vaduz"
lic.13.d:0 "Liechtenstein hath broken its vow, its independence, its neutrality. Liechtenstein entered a war it could not win, and now Liechtenstein may no longer be Liechtenstein - [LIC.GetLeader] has fled Vaduz on an airplane with the royal family, due to leap over the Mediterranean Sea into an exile to a land yet unknown. The House shall briefly stop in Corsica and Tunisia, where the family's vast connections will refuel, repair, and tend to any wounds or damage. Next, we must find a property far away from Europe, free from the slitted prying eyes of anti-royal ogres. Perhaps we shall fly to Canada, or find ourselves a property for sale in colonial Africa. Perhaps there are Chinese cities with lavish interiors for us to set up shop in, or remote American towns to bring the House's sigil to.\nBut what matters now is the Flight of Vaduz - the exile of the royal house of Liechtenstein."
lic.13.a:0 "We are sorry."

lic.14.t:0 "Die Ruckkehr der Fürsten"
lic.14.d:0 "We left Vaduz as cowards - leaving our people at the behest of the Devil's ratty cronies. Today, we have brought the sun back to Liechtenstein, as clouds dissipate for the clear paving of the infantry. We came from across the seas, and with our loyal people of both Liechtenstein and our properties supporting us in our glorious crusade, waving blue and red, victory is at last ours. Vaduz bears the mark of the House of Liechtenstein once more, and fortunately, our exile was not long - we are heroes in Liechtenstein and on this planet itself.\n[LIC.GetLeader] has retaken his rightful seat at Vaduz Castle, where the Principality of Liechtenstein rises once more, above Everest, above all."
lic.14.a:0 "Oben am jungen Rhein, steht Liechtenstein, siegreich!"

lic.15.t:0 "Heed the Call of the von Habsburg"
lic.15.d:0 "Our brave and selfless act to house members of the Habsburg family from an enemy on our doorstep has earned us the gleaming admiration of not just the House of Habsburg, but its staunch and hearty loyalists, too. From Vorarlberg to Lemberg, in every realm, former and current, they lie, simmering and raring for the day of reclamation.\nToday, we settle into the uncertain first few days of life forever away, with the Habsburg monarchy housed in but two planes, who had flown behind us, as we left Europe. Otto has told us that the Habsburg loyalists in the Empire remain strong, and ready to take back what's theirs at a moment's notice. The Imperial restoration movement is entirely underground, bunkered in thick woods, deep basements, and chilly mountain peaks and valleys, but yet even these ragtag men shall strike fear into traitorous infidels when the reckoning is to come. The Habsburgs are indebted to our humility, though, and if we or they attempt to retake the Fatherland, Liechtenstein may raise the red-and-blue bicolor alongside the black-and-yellow of the Habsburgs."
lic.15.a:0 "For Prince and Kaiser, we are united."

lic.16.t:0 "Election of 1939"
lic.16.d:0 "The past three years have seen much change to Liechtenstein: the death of Franz I, the status-quo-shattering elections of 1936, and the tide of Black Monday that has washed our clear blue skies in murky, obfuscating darkness that hides our eyes from the future. Now, in 1939, it is time to see where all this has taken us - reform, triumph, defeat, and ballot. Josef Hoop, paragon of the FBP for many a year now, has re-cast himself against Otto Schaedler and Gustav Schaedler, chairmen of the Vaterländische Union and the Partei der Unselbständig Erwerbenden und Kleinbauern, respectively.\nThe 15 seats in the Landtag have voted - who wins?"

licflavor.1.d:0 "To anyone who has never seen Liechtenstein Castle in Vaduz, the name Andreas Kieber probably sounds like another man on the streets, another person in this vast plane of life. If you have visited Liechtenstein Castle, though, you will know who Andreas Kieber is - the last man standing. The last man standing in the Army of Liechtenstein, after its abolition in 1868. He participated in the Veteran's Association of the war, this war being the Seven Weeks' War, also famous for Liechtenstein going to war with 80 soldiers and returning with 81, Kaiserjäger Lieutenant Radinger of Austria being the extra man.\nMr. Kieber was able to have many photos taken of himself, still standing post outside Liechtenstein Castle. As the Veterans dwindled, Kieber kept kicking, until now, [GetDateText], finally passing due to natural causes early this morning. A state-wide funeral has been announced, and the last veteran of Liechtenstein has passed on."
licflavor.1.a:0 "Godspeed, Kieber."

licflavor.2.t:0 "The Oddity from Switzerland"
licflavor.2.d:0 "Over the last decade, the House of Liechtenstein has participated in odd yet fruitful investments, to Alaskan business to experimental military technology. While Liechtenstein holds no standing army, Liechtenstein owns an arsenal of military oddities and normalities. The most recent acquisition is by far the strangest, besides a Rigsby coilgun in personal service to Prince [LIC.GetLeader], purchased from Texan inventor Virgil Rigsby in 1934.\nThe new acquisition comes from Liechtenstein's western border, in fact, more west than that. It bears the mark of André Louis Octave Fauchon-Villeplée, a French inventor, notable for inventing an electric cannon that shut off a city's power grid. With the promising technology augmented by the notable Nikola Tesla, Prince [LIC.GetLeader] has laid a sum on the technology, adding yet another quirk into Liechtensteiner investments. The 'railgun,' as it was slightly inappropriately called, arrived in Vaduz yesterday.\nHermann Meier, Chief of Police, requested to see the weapon fired ASAP, which was granted a few hours after the weapon's completion. As the weapon charged, some could say there was a deafening silence besides the roar of the railgun. Once it fired, a bolt left the chamber into a lended light tank, colliding and fantastically eradicating the armored vehicle in a brilliant display of ballistic testing. However, as the impressed officials returned to gather data, they found all lights off! After an extended period of waiting, the lights returned.\nUpon further inspection, the small Landespolizei contingent assigned to the oddity have discovered that the railgun completely shutdown Liechtenstein's power grid momentarily. However, the deactivation of the grid did not faze the government too much, and Franz Josef II believes that the railgun could be a powerful weapon to sell off... or use for his own purposes."

licflavor.3.d:0 "Liechtenstein National Day, or Staatsfeiertag, is a public holiday that takes place annually on the fifteenth of August. Today is its first occurrence: one day before the birthday of Prince Franz Josef II. The celebration is also called the "prince's festival," no doubt for its link to Franz Josef II. The Prince begins the holiday with a speech on the meadow outside Vaduz Castle, following select Landtag members.\nToday, banners fly more often than not on rural roads and houses, banners of the multiple principal municipalities of the princely principality. At the end of the day there shall be a brilliant display of fireworks, and burning of letters for God, Prince, and Fatherland. A fire fall shall also be seen at the city-side wall front."

This monumentous occasion was Liechtenstein's first debut in the Olympics, with Xaver Frick and Oskar Ospelt participating in track, Adolf Schreiber on road cycling, and Augustin Hilti, Rudolf Jehle, and Rudolf Senti participating in the 50 meter rifle prone shooting. While we did not win any medals, apt eyes in the crowd noticed two of the exact same flags parading around every once in a while. Eventually it was realized that Liechtenstein bears the exact same flag as Haiti, a Caribbean nation across the globe. While amusing, the Principality has acknowledged that the flag must be amended at once to prevent any sort of these confusing visual mix-ups again. Our new flag features the princely crown in the upper left corner, now solidifying a distinct national flag from Haiti. The old blue-and-red flag has been lowered at most official establishments, and the new flag, blue on red with the crown, has been raised in its place."

With unemployment taking a rapid upturn in the last few weeks, Liechtensteiner businesses have found the need to protect domestic purchases. The government, too, is not lost on this requirement for the modern predicament we currently find ourselves tangled up in, and a bill has been introduced to the Landtag with a rather curious proposition: the ban of department stores.\nThe bill has polarized Liechtenstein's politicians, with a blind head count of supporters versus opponents about half and half. The bill has found its ways to the hands of paperboys and news distribution outlets, which has been received with a similarly halving effect. After a rather reserved silence, the Landtag counts the votes for the ban on department stores, and the tally shall tell us that:"

licflavor.6.d:0 "Since 1893, little Liechtenstein has had a museum of its own: the Princely State Museum, a measure to prevent heritage from leaving Liechtenstein to collectors abroad. The exhibits were donated to by the Princes of Liechtenstein, with a couple rooms in Vaduz Castle set aside for their exhibition. However, castle renovations moved the collection off to a different government construct.\nIn 1910, the collection passed from the Princes into the Historischen Vereins für das Fürstentum Liechtenstein, or the Historical Association for the Principality of Liechtenstein. The Association provided the collection with primarily prehistoric artifacts, produced by the wonders of archaeology. Nineteen years later, Vaduz Castle once again set aside rooms for a portion of the collection. Nowadays, Anton Frommelt, the curator, handles acquisitions for the collection.\nWith the collection growing ever so slightly year by year, Vaduz Castle and the cellars of government buildings cannot hold Liechtenstein's heritage for much longer. Two plans have been waved in the air, each with its own merits: one, move it to the Herrschaftliche Taverne, a local inn, and merge its premises the neighboring Verweserhaus, a government complex. Two, create a brand new building to house the grandiose collections of Liechtenstein: paintings, tools, maps, the works - all part of Liechtenstein's grand history."

licflavor.7.d:0 "Otto von Habsburg, heir to the throne of the Habsburg dynasty, has unexpectedly passed through Liechtenstein in a heavily-armed convoy. The Landespolizei, shocked by the events, initially thought Otto had gone too far through Vorarlberg, missed Dornbirn, and ended up in Liechtenstein by sheer accident, or even was personally invading Liechtenstein, but neither were the case! Otto explained that ever since 1914, Austrian royalty traveled in armored vehicles and heavy entourages, and that he was merely on his way to summer vacation. A clueless young border guard questioned Otto where he was staying, to which the Habsburg replied 'here, high on the young Rhine!'  With that, Otto was let through with salutes and warm greetings.\n News spreads fast, of course - Prince [LIC.GetLeader] has already been notified of Otto's arrival, and plans to give Karl's son a warm welcome with drinks and feast in the halls of Vaduz Castle if he wish, along with more quaint attractions of fishing and hunting. The public has gathered out into streets, as no one is quite sure of where Otto's vacation home is, but all hope to see the Paneuropean Habsburg in the flesh, roses and flowers adorned to their hands to shower the famous Austrian."

In fact, some Princes have even momentarily forgotten that they even owned Liechtenstein at all - more enthralled in the golden tastes of fine wine and dining.\nIn the past decade, however, the late Prince Franz I has made ever more frequent appearances in Liechtenstein, and it seems this behavior has only multiplied in his heir-turned-prince. Franz Josef II, the newly-coronated Prince of Liechtenstein, has formally announced to the whole eleven thousand people of Liechtenstein that he shall move his family to Castle Vaduz, a castle in Liechtenstein itself over a hill.\nAt long last, Franz Josef II shall become the first Prince of Liechtenstein to live inside his own nation, rather than in imperial Austria."

Thus, it is only natural, that to the regular peoples of Liechtenstein, and even spiralling out into Tyrol, that jokes are made about how the world isn't big enough for the two of them. It seems the amicable humor has reached both Franz Josef IIs involved, who have met tonight in Vaduz to discuss a deal with absolutely no monetary gain: a duel!\nThe 'duel' is to compete in numerous activities, much like an Olympics, but for royalty! Events are to be held in both Vaduz and Vienna, through a recent railway, matter-of-factly titled the V2 Railroad.\nThe events have reached even Italians, Swiss and Germans, who line up to watch the royal heads of house duke it out to see who is the true Franz Josef II."

They find themselves jeered and booed at every turn, and even met with frowns from the royal house.\nThe Volksdeutsche's rally has gone peacefully, with only glass bottles and small metal objects being the only casualties of the march of the Volksdeutsche through all of Liechtenstein.\nSome raise the question of quelling them now, before they can grow, and others call them no threat."

A group of unexperienced soldiers crossed the river west and south, where they conducted shooting drills.\nA few hours later, the clueless soldiers continued further west in accordance to their assigned orders - until they were happened upon and fired upon by who they presumed to be friendly infantry. This was evidently not the case when live rounds were returned, where, in rapid German, the officer of the Liechtensteiner group reprimanded the supposed friendly to turn off live fire, and to load blanks. It was then that the 'friendly' was revealed to be a squad of investigative Swiss soldiers, outnumbered two to one by the Fürstliche Wachen. The Swiss escorted the Army back across the Rhine, and with little better to do, the two armies camped out beside the river.\nNone were wounded or harmed in the incident, and [LIC.GetLeader] has apologized profusely to Switzerland, who disregarded the incident."

It was only after an officer of the enemy told the Swiss to load blanks, that it was understood - it must be a training exercise by a lost contingent.

licflavor.16.d:0 "The Rheinische Clothes Factory, one of the more notable single industrial names in Liechtenstein's meagre 160 kilometers of territory, was hit by an explosion inside its machinery. The Landespolizei assigned to the accident realized, that upon looking at the way the machine exploded and the discharge of debris, that it was not, in fact, an accident - someone had deliberately planted a bomb in the factory and attempted to disguise it as faulty machinery. This would have worked if the machine the explosive was placed in was prone to explosions, but alas.\nThe motive behind the attack was determined to be a vendetta against the factory owner's religion. The Rheinische Clothes Factory is owned by Richard Graetz, of open Jewish belief. It is now suspected that the VDBL was behind the attack at the clothes factory, just as they were with the attack on the Kreuz Inn in Switzerland.\nThe Landtag of Liechtenstein is to hold a meeting concerning the activities of the VDBL, and a potential ban of the Ariosophic group.

With all the buzz in the news about the bombs in Switzerland and the Rheinische Clothes Factory, homeowners rushed out to attempt to catch the culprits - but it was too late.\nAuthorities gathered information from the dozens of present men and women, who said that the bomb detonated in a house belonging to a Jewish family.\nThe affected neighborhood has been on protest the following few hours, pushing Vaduz to do something about the phantom Volksdeutsche bombers. The VDBL has found its open members increasingly ridiculed and harassed by commoners of the streets, and been applied demeaning nicknames - not like that is a problem.\nWhat is a problem is the VDBL's open compliance with the bombings, as Rudolf Schädler, leader of the VDBL, has refused to collaborate with authorities on the bombers.\n\nThe calls of apprehending the VDBL have reached [LIC.GetLeader], and about eight hours after the bombings, the VDBL has been officially banned from Liechtenstein, much to the chagrin of Lanz von Liebenfels."

licflavor.18.d:0 "To the Volksdeutsche Bewegung in Liechtenstein, or VDBL, its banning was not seen as a call to disperse, but rather a call to revolt. Over the nights of November 28, 29, and 30, four separate bombs blew up over Liechtenstein, all at the expected antagonist of the VDBL - the Jews.\nOn November 28, the Dux inn in Schaan, a notable regional hotel, was bombed in an arbitrary location. The investigative procedure produced the results that the VDBL merely knew Jewish guests were staying in the hotel, and not where there rooms actually were - so they blew a bomb in a place to heavily damage the foundation and the rooms of the guests, indiscriminate of whether or not the Jews were actually staying in those rooms.\n\nTwo more Jewish families were roped into the unholy, uncaring business of the VDBL's terror campaign against the Jews. The Fiori and Goldstaub families, run-of-the-mill families with little note to their names besides this new tragedy, were rudely jostled from their beds by bombs at their homes. The bombs injured three and killed only one. Neighbors of the Fioris and Goldstaubs have been generously gifting the afflicted families with compensation, and the police stations in Vaduz and yonder find themselves swarmed by angry homeowners, afraid that the VDBL may bolden and bomb the regular Liechtensteiner.\n\nOn the 30th, the Rheinische Clothes Factory, no stranger to the VDBL's terror antics, was again rocked by a bomb - but this time, the bomber did not attempt to mask the explosion. Yet again, Richard Graetz evaded the wounds of the fiery ball that blew up on his property, but he said that if it happens again he'd rather the bomber actually hit his mark.\nOne more family was struck by the bombs of the VDBL, that of the Schiftan family. None were harmed in the explosion, and the family joked with the police about the inefficacy of their bombs, calling them 'shoddier than Austria's war performance in the Weltkrieg.'"

Even now, a decade later, many of the questions initially raised during the apex of the Strikes have laid on unwritten papers on the polished mahogany tables of bigshot politicians.\nThe matter of today's finally-penned document to seal a wound of the strikes would have to be in regards to education. Liechtenstein's education is primarily centered around Catholic-oriented schools, something which the atheistic or less-pious Socialists found as a major point on te Liechtensteiner side of the Strikes. Years ago, the infant UEK had campaigned under an education expansion for all, free of Catholic bias - and today, that sentiment returns. Not on the tip of a pointer stick or on the waves of a teacher's voice, but rather on the stroke of a pen and as a vote in the Landtag. The UEK's new bill is specifically aimed at discrediting these Catholic institutions, and making them more free to all deities.\nOther circles besides the UEK and LAV speak with the same vitriolic backlash that they did when the UEK first introduced the controversial idea, although it is less audible.

The Binnenkanal was designed to protect Liechtenstein from floods and assist in drainage.\nThe Binnenkanal is complete now, and the dozens of laborers who signed up to dig the 23-kilometer-long trench for the express purpose of making money during the blight of Black Monday have once again found themselves out of jobs.\nThe Binnenkanal has had a noticeable positive effect on the economy - signing laborers for public works seems to have been the first leap towards Liechtenstein's recovery. Some speak of road repair, others of building maintenance, for the men who toiled for the Binnenkanal have now left the economy slumping slowly again.

The Weltkrieg brought the waves of revolutionary syndicalism to Liechtenstein, and it wormed its way into the LAV slowly but surely. The rise of the Commune of France, coupled with the Trans-Alpine Strikes, has considerably radicalized and politicized the LAV since its inception in the late years of the Weltkrieg. Now, the LAV is usually characterized as the 'syndicalist party' of Liechtenstein, but its ideas compared to Paris or London are much more localized and less radical. The LAV, for one major difference, supports the Prince.\nAs questions that were raised during the Trans-Alpine Strikes float around, the LAV has taken an old demand forth to the Landtag and placed it before the members for a vote. The demand is to create a worker's secretariat, to administrate and organize the workers of Liechtenstein and any future trade unions. Some see this as a point in a greater Syndicalist path tread by the LAV, while cooler heads say that Syndicalist or not, it is a fine idea. The votes are in, and:"

The customs union has also eliminated trade tariffs between Liechtenstein and Austria, something Liechtenstein desperately needs - resources, when it has so little itself. What Liechtenstein lacked in resources it made up for in money, and the Customs Union held strong as Bohemian and Hungarian manufactories cranked out machines that were to go to Vaduz.\nThen, in 1914, Austria invaded Serbia, and the rest is history. The Austrians were tired and war-weary, and all material went to the K.u.K. Armee as it fought its hardest on the front under the oversight of incompetent commanders. This formed the first crack in a previously impenetrable union, a crack which would turn into a web of dents and scratches that has been slowly eroding the foundation of Vaduz and Vienna's agreement.\nThe Trans-Alpine Strikes, and the years after the Weltkrieg, for that matter, brought the question of a Second Weltkrieg in it - something Liechtenstein wants to avoid. With Austria a major power, Liechtensteiner politics have attempted to near Switzerland instead, famous for its neutrality, and therefore escape the horror of war, rather than behind lumped in with Austria.\nFranz I of Liechtenstein's relationship with Austria ensured the Agreement held firm, but after his passing, Franz Josef II has seen better use in the abolition of the Customs Agreement.\nWhat the future of Liechtenstein's finances hold, no one knows - but it will be without Vienna, or at least, with less Viennese influence."

licflavor.34.d:0 "Countess Georgina von Wilczek has known the Prince, a third cousin, since 1942. This meeting was happened upon in Switzerland, and the rosy yellow roses eventually bloomed into velvet red; a friendship to love. One year ago, the royal couple announced their engagement - and after historic preparations and scrutinizing over every last detail of the event, the wedding was to take place today. And that it did, becoming the first royal wedding of Liechtenstein to actually take place in Liechtenstein itself; a testament to the new patriotism of Franz Josef II.\nA few days from now, the couple is to take a tour to all eleven communes of Liechtenstein, visiting and greeting their people as they go."
licflavor.34.a:0 "How historic!"

licflavor.35.t:0 "Founding of the Liechtenstein Red Cross"
licflavor.35.d:0 "Founded formally in 1922 after the end of the Weltkrieg, the International Red Cross is one of the few things that unites the west and the east together, of both Europe and Earth. The Red Cross has organizations in Paris, Berlin, Washington, Moscow, Tokyo, and even Dar-es-Salaam. All over the world, the Red Cross and Crescent fly high as a symbol of justice for the injured and safety of the innocent.\nUntil now, Liechtenstein has not had a Red Cross organization of its own, but now it does. Our very own Princess Gina, wife of the great Franz Josef II, has blessed upon Vaduz a Red Cross. Already a member of the International Red Cross Movement, the officially-endorsed Red Cross of Liechtenstein has already attracted a sizeable amount of volunteers, in comparison to our population."
licflavor.35.a:0 "A princess of the people!"

licflavor.36.t:0 "Founding of the Heimattreue Vereinigung Liechtenstein"
licflavor.36.d:0 "The increasingly malevolent poltergeist of the Volksdeutsche Bewegung in Liechtenstein, or VDBL, has garnered such hate that organizations have grown to oppose it and it alone. Today, the Heimattreue Vereinigung Liechtenstein, or HTVL, has been formed. Its sole purpose is to counter the activities of Rudolf Schädler's VDBL, and uphold the red-and-blue flag of Liechtenstein, with a crown rather than an Ariosophic cross or swastika. The HTVL has made attempts to draw Liechtenstein away from Austria and to Switzerland, as they see neutrality the best course for Liechtenstein; a shield against foreign ideology that threatens to undermine our peaceful Alpine country.\nIt remains to be seen how they shall specifically counter the VDBL, but if anything, rather anything that the VDBL."
licflavor.36.a:0 "A necessary action."

licflavor.37.t:0 "Raising of the Black and Yellow"
licflavor.37.d:0 "As the news spread like the Sun's light to Earth, Vaduz was doomed, and all in danger - the House of Liechtenstein and all its friends. But Liechtenstein was not the only marooned family, for the greatest dynasty the world had ever seen had been reduced to shattered glass dust. This would be the House of Habsburg, protectors of Austria and God - finding their way onto an airplane bound for foreign property.\nNow we have raised the flag of Liechtenstein, crown and all, above Vaduz. Now we have reclaimed our people. Now we have reclaimed our home, our river, our glory, our place in the sun!\n\nBut, we are not all who has reclaimed what they have lost - God hath taken pity upon Austria, and over the Hofburg and Schönbrunn in Vienna rises not the blue-and-red, but the black-and-yellow banner of the victorious Habsburgs. Their loyalists have been repaid in full, and God has saven Emperor [AUS.GetLeader]."

licflavor.38.d:0 "[LIC.GetLeader] has always been known for his affinity to nature and its wonders. An amateur wood carver, painter, and carpenter, Schädler's new position as the sole head of state of Liechtenstein has brought him fortunes to fund his increasing appetite for the fine and natural flavors of luxurious canvas, paint, and wood.\nSchädler's favorite collectors are among Austrian painters: Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, and numerous singles from other artists; esoteric and natural.\nHowever, Schädler's most prized artworks, housed in his residence, is an epitome of him: nature, architecture, culture, and the mildly zany. Max Ernst, Adolf Hitler, and Oswald Achenbach's masterpieces and normalities line his art room, polished and maintained diligently by him himself.\nAll a sight for a Liechtenstein of tomorrow: proud, cultural, and single."

licflavor.39.d:0 "Josef Wenzel I, Prince of Liechtenstein, perished a century and a half ago. Despite this, the prince subservient to Vienna was noted as an excellent general - a man with a string of military victories and prides tacked to his title and armor. In line with the tradition of Liechtenstein, Josef Wenzel was massively rich - and he used these incredibles troves of personal wealth to entirely fund a brand-new Habsburg artillery organization, completely remodeling it from the ground up to bring it to revolutionary standards, much ahead of other great powers of the time.\nWe have followed in Josef Wenzel I von Liechtenstein's endeavours, and with the advent of new Liechtensteiner militarism, the 1st Artillery Battalion has been named in his honor. The battalion is primarily equipped with old Weltkrieg howitzers, plus modern mortars, anti-tank, anti-aircraft, and other assorted batteries, paid for by [LIC.GetLeader] and the treasure that lies within the bank accounts of the house."

licflavor.40.t:0 "Knighting of the Prince"
licflavor.40.d:0 "The Prince, Franz Josef II von Liechtenstein, has received an honorary order from an elder order of knights from the east - the Grand Order of the Teutonic Knights. Today, the Prince met with Eugen von Habsburg, the current reigning Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights. In a modest ceremony marked by black crosses emblazoned on white tapestries, the Prince was christened as a honorary knight of the Order. The reason cited by the Knights for the conferring of this title was chivalry, charity, and civility. In the eyes of the people, too, this sentiment is reflected; already, Prince Franz Josef II is recorded as one of the most popular ever, and monarchic sentiment is at an all time high."
licflavor.40.a:0 "A fittingly knightly title."

licflavor.41.t:0 "The Prince Eyes a Strange New Contraption"
licflavor.41.d:0 "In line with the recent outlandish financial decisions, the Prince has his eyes set on something new. In a recent visit to Germany, [LIC.GetLeader] sighted a strange new aircraft in the skies over the Kaiserreich: a strange, car-like vehicle with a tail like an airplane. Mysteriously, the aircraft had little wings, far too small for most aircraft! It seemed that the aircraft was held aloft by a rotor, a spinning propeller on the top of the vehicle. The Drache, as it was called, was the newest toy of Germany, and the Prince has returned with both photos and a most intriguing up-close experience with the 'helicopter!'\n\nThe Prince has seen benefit in the helicopter in assisting with material goods transport over short, mountainous distances, and has offered a hefty lump of cash to Berlin in order to retrieve a few of these Draches for himself. Military-outfitted, some wonder if they will retain their armament, but the Prince sees something in the technology the rest of the Principality can't. The Landtag has made its concerns apparent, and the Prince's ultimate decision is:"
licflavor.41.a:0 "Yes! The future is now!"

licfor.7.d:0 "The great Kaiserreich, the primary holder of the sun's light, has been struck a great blow in its core - the economy. As global businesses panic and sleazy capitalists finally leave their rich leather armchairs, different opportunities have sprung up around this earth.\nAs Germany needs money, the island of Ceylon, formerly a British colony, has been put up for sale. However, we are not the only contender for the purchase of the rubber-rich island; we must content with a competition both near and far to gain enough stakes in Ceylon to be the one shaking the Kaiser's hand.\nThe strategically-important island gives an ample springboard for operations in the Indian subcontinent, and by extension, East Asia, or Western Africa. Its laborers are acquainted with the rubber plant, praised by Harvey Samuel Firestone as the greatest commodity of the modern world. But, most obviously, Ceylon is a large island. With size comes buildings, and we may industrialize our Ceylon to our will alone.\nBut before we may tap into any of these alluring, sparkling riches, we must first buy the island itself - and that means ridding Ceylon of our rotten, mouth-breathing competition!"

licfor.8.d:0 "The foreign turmoil that has transformd the quiet island of Ceylon into an economic battlefield, akin to Verdun in the Weltkrieg, has not escaped the eyes nor ears of locals. Ceylonese separatists, long a fringe group of colonial Ceylon, have finally been reaching for their future, too - a Ceylon free of foreign yoke.\nIf Ceylon's separatists are to be the true victor of our squabble, then no one has won - and therefore, it is all's duty to crush the Ceylones insurgents wherever we see them - for what good is Ceylon if we cannot have it?"

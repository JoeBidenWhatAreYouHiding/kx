LIC_FRANZ_I_DESC:0 "Born in Castle Liechtenstein, in Lower Austria, as Franz de Paula Maria Karl August, Franz I began his early life like many Liechtensteiner princes and royalty: off in Austrian and Bohemian properties, receiving education there, out of their little principality. He studied law in the Viennese and Prague universities in 1871 through 1878, earning entry into Austro-Hungarian diplomatic duties.\nFirst serving as an attache to Belgium, right after his exit from school, Franz I then joined in the task of administrating the Liechtenstein family's royal holdings and properties, even representing the prince himself on many occasion. His actions garnered the watchful eyes of K.u.K. authorities, and in time Franz I became a man involved in diplomatic expeditions to both Rome and St. Petersburg. He presided over the warmest period of Austro-Russian relations as the ambassador to St. Petersburg, then the capital of the old Russian Empire, between the Crimean War and the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. One of Franz I's greatest diplomatic triumphs lies in the Kaiser-Entrevue in 1897, allowing the Austro-Hungarian delegation's departure at the time of the Weltkrieg a ten-year entente, or understanding.\n While serving as ambassador, Franz I took on one of the most radical ideas for an Austrian of his time: an Austro-Russian alliance, attempting to prevent the Tsar from declaring war, and at long last Franz I was forced to resign.\nAfter this, not much of note happened to the aging Franz, until 1929, 8 years after the end of the Weltkrieg: Johann II, prince of Liechtenstein, perished, leaving the throne of the principality to him. Franz I's reign marked a strengthening of the Austro-Liechtensteiner Customs Union, which has been faltering in recent years in favor of Switzerland. Franz I is at and old age now, and many believe that Franz Josef II will become the next Prince of Liechtenstein. For now, though, Franz has presided upon a time of great prosperity in the little Principality of Liechtenstein. He successfully used his diplomatic prowess to resolve the Trans-Alpine Strikes in his country and Vorarlberg, and some say that the princes' "usual" residence will become Vaduz at long last."

LIC_FRANZ_II_DESC:0 "The prince following the late Franz I, Franz Josef II, the industrialist and man of money, was born at Schloss Frauenthal in Deutschlandsberg, in Styria to parents Alois and Elisabeth Amalie. At his baptising was his great-uncle and godfather, Franz Josef I of Austria. Young Franz became heir to the throne in 1929 at 23 years old, a feat remarkable for the old House of Liechtenstein.\nWhile young, the Prince has embarked on extravagant and strange spending adventures, increasingly looking into Alaska and eyeing Austrian territories lest they go asunder. Young Franz II is an avid supporter of the industrialization of Liechtenstein, assisting in establishing new factories and initiating new public works projects. Thus Franz II has gained a popularity both within and outside Liechtenstein that exceeded Franz I at many times.\nNow as Prince of Liechtenstein, Franz II is the first Prince since the acquisition of the Principality to principally live within the principality of Liechtenstein's princely quarters, the princely Palace of Liechtenstein in Vaduz. Franz II still maintains industrial investments and advancements with both Swiss and Austrian colleagues, yet always espouses Liechtensteiner neutrality at any and every possible opportunity.\nPrince Franz Josef II is expected to be one for the princely archives, as his achievements shall decide little Liechtenstein's future in the decades to come."

LIC_RUDOLF_SCHAEDLER_DESC:0 "Born on March 31, 1903, Rudolf Schädler and the party he commands has forever been shrouded in both mystery and distrust. As a young boy, Schädler was enthralled with nature, art, and music, entering into the Basel Conservatory in his later teens. Young Schädler came upon the Ostara magazine by chance in his years as a tavern owner, fascinated by Lanz von Liebenfels' radical, enrapturing tellings of Germanic superiority and the bright natural state of the Earth and all of it. Schädler came to adopt his own school of Ariosophy, largely absent of Liebenfels' celestial tellings and Aryan superpowers. Schädler became a founding member of the VDBL, or Volksdeutsche Bewegung in Liechtenstein, in 1938. The VDBL was built upon a platform of Greater Germany, taking in inspiration from Liebenfels, Georg von Schoenerer, and the Iron Guard in Romania.\nWhile hated, the VDBL has triumped, yet must go its own route, away from that of Greater Germany. For now, Schädler shall lead Liechtenstein to its Germanic renaissance it always yearned for, in an era that shall mark a new dawn for Liechtenstein."

LIC_customs_union:0 "Austro-Liechtensteiner Customs Union"
LIC_customs_union_desc:0 "The Customs Union of Liechtenstein and Austria was first established in 1852, and fully melds the economies of our two states into one large market. With free, open trade between our realms and with one shared economic zone, we enjoy all the economic benefits of being with the wider Austro-Hungarian Empire without having to actually be within it politically, and even military benefits for our protection given that we have no standing army. However, despite the economic boon that this has caused our nation - a greatly one-sided boon that benefits our small principality more than the vast Empire - many within our borders feel that the Customs Union infringes upon our stance of neutrality. This has caused tensions within the government, so we must monitor this situation and tread carefully, especially as Vienna’s ambitions grow."

LIC_austro_swiss_divide:0 "Austro-Swiss Divide"
LIC_austro_swiss_divide_desc:0 "Our small but proud nation is currently divided as competing forces threaten to tear our realm asunder. For nearly a century we have been bound to Austria economically through the Customs Union, but some say it is time to end this long standing economic pact. These worried ministers and princes fear it compromises our famous stance of permanent neutrality - a position firmly held since 1868 - and have instead pushed for closer ties with Bern over Vienna. Opposing them are the Austrian loyalists and defenders of the status quo who seek to continue the Customs Union, further linking our economy with that of the Empire. With these competing factions arguing nonstep, refusing to cooperate and impeding the duties of the state and the Crown, our small principality must heal this schism and decide our destiny."

These strikes have left a deep mark on our nation, and have given rise to extremism on both ends of the political spectrum. Pertaining to little Liechtenstein, the issue of social securities and rising unemployment were raised as chief issues in regard to little Liechtenstein. Though the Crown remains solidly in control, the government around it is in peril and might be easily subjected to radical change. We must remain vigilant and resolve ourselves against this rising tide of radicalism."

BOTDE_SRI_LANKA_LOBBY_desc:0 "With Black Monday having shattered the pre-eminent world power's economic might, some of its overseas assets are liabilities, or, even better, able to be taken advantage of.\nOne such example is the island of Ceylon, under German control for a long few years. Germany now desperately needs money, and one obvious contender, one colony, and one oddball has come out to duke it financially over the fate of Ceylon.\nLobbyists from the incredibly rich Indian princes in the south come to Ceylon to build a network, intent on making Ceylon the first step in Indian unification.\nHundreds of kilometers away, out of the Indian subcontinent and on snowy mountaintops rising high over a river, lies a European royal house. The Princely House of Liechtenstein, south of the Kaiserreich, sends surveyors and investors to scope out Ceylon for their Prince and Fatherland in an ever-mystifying ambition.\nBut not all of Imperial Germany wishes to relinquish its hold on its stronghold on the Indian Ocean. German East Asia, too, has sent fleets of men and money to Ceylon to turn it over from direct rule to governorshop under the German eastern pearl.\nCeylon is now a financial battleground, and only one side may come out on top.\n\nThe [PRF.GetFlag] §OPrincely Federation§! has [?PRF.CEYLON_INFLEUNCE|Y0] influence in §GCeylon§!.\nThe [LIC.GetFlag] §CPrincipality of Liechtenstein§! has [?LIC.CEYLON_INFLEUNCE|Y0] influence in §GCeylon§!.\nThe [GEA.GetFlag] §LColony of Deutsch-Ostasien§! has [?GEA.CEYLON_INFLEUNCE|Y0] influence in §GCeylon§!.\nThe [GER.GetFlag] §gGerman Empire§! supports [GEA.GetFlag] §LDeutsch-Ostasien§! in its endeavours.\n\nFor §GCeylon§! to be in one's hands, certainly, one must have §Y20§! points of influence, and §Y5§! over the competitor.\n\nA nation under the jackboot of Europeans does not like to stay under the oppression of the boot.

annex.liechtenstein.ceylon:0 "Prepare it for the Prince."


lic.1.t:0 "The Principality of Liechtenstein, circa 1936"
lic.1.d:0 "Neutral since 1868, following the dissolution of the German Confederation, Liechtenstein has stayed in its state of permanent, respected neutrality, lasting through the Weltkrieg and maintaining to today.\nOne of Europe's smallest extant nations, with a western border entirely dictated by the young Rhine, Liechtenstein's eleven thousand strong population maintains an agricultural, rural lifestyle, much like other Alpine areas. Recently, though, with the coronation of Franz I and at the encouragement of Franz Josef II, Liechtenstein has been rapidly industrialising in recent years, and while Liechtensteiner industry is still in its infancy, the vast, rich, prosperous properties of the ruling House of Liechtenstein, from which our little principality takes its name, has been playing a large role in the expansion and construction of new factories.\nThe goods exported from these youthful assembly lines usually go to Austria, as per the 1852 Customs Treaty. However, the rising flames that lick the world ever closer frighten our quaint nation. Some feel as if Austria will get pulled into the war, and if Swiss neutrality is disrespected, which some feel may very well happen, then Liechtenstein may be in mortal danger. Thus the customs union with Austria has experienced a decline since 1921, as traders seek routes into Switzerland, for Swiss markets.\nThe Alpine region as a whole was brought to its knees in 1930, after a strike in Italy protesting Habsburg occupation some time after the end of the Italian Civil War burned out of control, spreading fervor to Switzerland, Austria, what is now Illyria, and even little Liechtenstein. The trade union movement that Syndicalism spearheaded has given the LAV, or Liechtensteiner Arbeiterverband, a somewhat large portion of economic policy inside the Landtag. However, the LAV, uniquely, does not see the King as an obstacle, but rather a potential ally.\nThe rise of Lanz von Liebenfels and the ANI has brought similar far-right waves to Liechtenstein, empowering the LHD, or Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst, which formed in 1930, headed by Otto Schaedler.\nPrime Minister Josef Hoop, the reigning prime minister since 1928, has kept Liechtenstein in a status quo, but time and our neighbors care not for us, and Hoop's status quo is threatened from outside. The Trans-Alpine Strikes, as they are known, has pushed first and foremost the lack of social security, now a focal point of the new UEK and LAV, and the unemployment that strangles common Liechtensteiners. The House has been combatting these issues, with public works projects taking place along rapid industrialization, paid for by the Princes themselves.\nToday, in 1936, Liechtenstein could be called the most well-off nation in its immediate region, but as history has shown time and time again, we should be prepared for unforeseen consequences."
lic.1.a:0 "Für Gott, Fürst und Vaterland!"

lic.2.t:0 "Black Monday Striketh!"
lic.2.d:0 "Disaster strikes the eleven thousand of Liechtenstein! As our economy bears heavy ties to Vienna, and therefore Berlin by association, the recent details of the great Berlin Stock Market Crash, or Black Monday, as it is known simply, has not spared neutral little Liechtenstein! Switzerland has suffered a heavy hit too, and with ties to Austria being already in the question, the question has sprung again: "Should Liechtenstein pursue Swiss ties?" While Franz I had reinvigorated the ages-old customs union between Vaduz and Vienna, the crash has reportedly the whole of the princely house questioning the resolve of the customs agreement.\nAs for immediate actions, Franz Josef II, heir to the principality, has begun public works initiatives: canals, roads, schools, new buildings, investitures. It is thanks to him that Black Monday has not grinded Liechtenstein to a halt, and while employment suffered a large thwack on the head, Franz Josef II has ensured that his initiatives will keep the economic downturn as a minor footnote in Liechtensteiner history. While others struggle for survival, Liechtenstein and Prince shall prevail!"
lic.2.a:0 "What shall happen to princely fortunes?!"

lic.3.t:0 "Death of Franz I"
lic.3.d:0 "Reports from Austria and Bohemian castles housing Liechtensteiner royalty have only confirmed the rumors: Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein, has passed away today, in his sleep, at age 84 in Castle Feldberg. He died peacefully in his sleep of natural causes. Kaiser Karl I of Austria has already expressed his condolences, as has Maximilian Lobkowicz of Bohemia. The body has been put in a coffin, and a symbolic funeral parade has taken its route throughout a nationwide drive of Liechtenstein, as 'Oben am jungen Rhein' plays from a somber brass. As for Franz I's deceased body, it has been laid to rest in the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Brno.\n Franz Josef II, heir to the throne, has taken leadership over the House of Liechtenstein, and in a historic event of Liechtensteiners, has moved into Castle Liechtenstein in Vaduz, declaring it his home. This marks the first time a Liechtensteiner prince has actually lived in Liechtenstein, further solidifying Franz Josef II's massive popularity in Liechtenstein."
lic.3.a:0 "Hail to thee, Franz Josef II!"

lic.4.t:0 "A Convenient Count"
lic.4.d:0 "With economic plight comes political adversity. The Berlin Stock Market Crash has proved just that, all around the world, and Liechtenstein is no exception to this. Fortunately for us, a general election was slated for February, and both rounds of the election have come to a close.\nJosef Hoop has ruled Liechtenstein as Prime Minister since 1928, and has led Liechtenstein's economy up - but with Black Monday, some blame the failure on him and his inability to switch to Swiss markets.\nThe VU, a recent amalgam of the LHD and the VP, created to contest Hoop and the UEK, is notably pro-Swiss in its economic policy. Always the underdog in elections, Black Monday may provide the VU with the momentum it needs to finally own the Landtag.\nThe UEK was formed during the height of the Trans-Alpine Strikes, and the timing has been a principal contributor of the UEK's current political successes. Offering a new program with economic recovery as its highest priority, some see the UEK as the beginning of something new."
lic.4.a:0 "The FBP continues Hoop's reign!"
lic.4.b:0 "The VU's coalition overpowers!"
lic.4.c:0 "The new UEK strikes its first win!"

lic.5.t:0 "Formation of the Vaterländische Union"
lic.5.d:0 "Seeking to push past Hoop's steel grip over Liechtensteiner hearts, the Vaterländische Union has united the minds of the Christian-Social Party and the Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst. Figures from the Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst dominate the upper positions of party rule, and Otto Schaedler has been placed as chairman of the new political force.\nAmong its primary policy is termination of the Austro-Liechtensteiner Customs Union and advancements of the Swiss relationship, along with a new Swiss customs union, and with that reorienting the Landesbank to the Swiss National Bank.\nInspired heavily by Engelbert Dollfuss and the Swiss Frontenbewegung, the VU espouses Catholic and corporatist ideals. Some of the most radical support the Heimwehr in Austria, forming a surprisingly broad range of views for the party. Central to Schaedler's policy is keeping this strange coalition together, but once he is elected shall the real test begin."
lic.5.a:0 "But will it really change anything?"

lic.6.t:0 "The Vaterländische Union Calls for Emergency Election!"
lic.6.d:0 "The tenure of the Fortschrittliche Bürgerpartei in Liechtenstein, or FBP, over the last few years has seen Liechtenstein draw even closer to Austria than it ever has been before. The Austro-Liechtensteiner Customs Union has been reinforced with steel, to be impenetrable for years to come in the status quo the FBP has finalized. The Principality has found itself chained to Vienna by a shackle of its own flesh, yet not all agree to this voluntary companionship. The Vaterländische Union and the UEK, besides associates to the Royal House of Liechtenstein, have expressed worry and distrust in the future of Liechtenstein while it kneels at the foot of the Habsburg throne.\nThis has coalesced in Otto Schaedler of the VU calling for an emergency election. Rumors float around the Landtag of Emil Risch, head of the Liechtensteiner Arbeiterverband, and Otto Schaedler, head of the Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst, splitting from the moderate factions of their partiesto run independently in the special election."
lic.6.a:0 "No need for such measures."
lic.6.b:0 "We need change, and we need it now!"

lic.7.t:0 "Fate of the Emergency Election"
lic.7.d:0 "With the sudden emergency election's tallies in, two things as of yet are certain: one, that the FBP has lost the vote by a significant margin. Two, the top two parties of the election are the Liechtensteiner Arbeiterverband and the Liechtensteiner Heimatdienst.\nThe Liechtensteiner Arbeiterverband, or LAV, has been criticized for its 'Syndicalist' overtures, but Emil Risch has time and time again affirmed that his loyalties lie to the Prince, and not to Paris nor London. The LAV and UEK were empowered following the Trans-Alpine Strikes, and its platform reflects its upbringings: safety for industrial workers and institutions for common betterment.\nIn contrast, the LHD, chaired by Otto Schaedler alone, has built its platform on a foundation of Liechtensteiner nationalism, away and truly separate from the grabby vices of Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. To the LHD, Liechtenstein is higher than these lows, and shall reflect the fact as such.

It is blotched with war, spiked with rebellions, and cracked with scandals and illicit political deals and inefficiency. Over the last few years, Austria has been taking the necessary steps to wash off the black dots that riddle its historical record, smooth out the rough edges of nationalist minorities vying for more, and seal the holes and faults they have let prosper.\nThese ameliorations have finally reached their apex, in the long-awaited Ausgleich of 1937. Vienna and Budapest stand on highly different positions on that of federalism, and while it is clear Austria will finally put its foot down to say 'no,' it remains unclear what the Magyars have to say in response. The Austrians are now promoting a federation, starting with the inclusion of Illyria as a full-fledged Constituent of Austria, following centralization in Bohemia, Galicia, Austria, and Hungary.\n\nRevolutionary Danubian federalism has entered the political spheres of oddball nations around the world, from the Caucasus to Asia, the Americas, and Mittelafrika - a solution to satisfy ever-raging oppressed peoples.\nDanubian federalism, too, has reached Liechtenstein's inner circles, particularly those of German nationalists or proponents of Swiss alliance."

On the left, Liechtenstein shall continue as an independent nation, or, on the other side of the long, winding road of the future, Liechtenstein shall find its place in Austria, Germany, or both; a Greater Germany. The interior circles of the VDBL, while espousing German nationalism, have to tread carefully, though - Liechtenstein relishes in its incredibly low tax rates, rates which invite business and make life easier.

While Liechtenstein holds no standing army, Liechtenstein owns an arsenal of military oddities and normalities. The most recent acquisition is by far the strangest, besides a Rigsby coilgun in personal service to Prince [LIC.GetLeader], purchased from Texan inventor Virgil Rigsby in 1934.\nThe new acquisition comes from Liechtenstein's western border, in fact, more west than that. It bears the mark of André Louis Octave Fauchon-Villeplée, a French inventor, notable for inventing an electric cannon that shut off a city's power grid. With the promising technology augmented by the notable Nikola Tesla, Prince [LIC.GetLeader] has laid a sum on the technology, adding yet another quirk into Liechtensteiner investments. The 'railgun,' as it was slightly inappropriately called, arrived in Vaduz yesterday.\nHermann Meier, Chief of Police, requested to see the weapon fired ASAP, which was granted a few hours after the weapon's completion. As the weapon charged, some could say there was a deafening silence besides the roar of the railgun. Once it fired, a bolt left the chamber into a lended light tank, colliding and fantastically eradicating the armored vehicle in a brilliant display of ballistic testing. However, as the impressed officials returned to gather data, they found all lights off! After an extended period of waiting, the lights returned.\nUpon further inspection, the small Landespolizei contingent assigned to the oddity have discovered that the railgun completely shutdown Liechtenstein's power grid momentarily. However, the deactivation of the grid did not faze the government too much, and Franz Josef II believes that the railgun could be a powerful weapon to sell off... or use for his own purposes."

While we did not win any medals, apt eyes in the crowd noticed two of the exact same flags parading around every once in a while. Eventually it was realized that Liechtenstein bears the exact same flag as Haiti, a Caribbean nation across the globe. While amusing, the Principality has acknowledged that the flag must be amended at once to prevent any sort of these confusing visual mix-ups again. Our new flag features the princely crown in the upper left corner, now solidifying a distinct national flag from Haiti.

The exhibits were donated to by the Princes of Liechtenstein, with a couple rooms in Vaduz Castle set aside for their exhibition. However, castle renovations moved the collection off to a different government construct.\nIn 1910, the collection passed from the Princes into the Historischen Vereins für das Fürstentum Liechtenstein, or the Historical Association for the Principality of Liechtenstein. The Association provided the collection with primarily prehistoric artifacts, produced by the wonders of archaeology. Nineteen years later, Vaduz Castle once again set aside rooms for a portion of the collection. Nowadays, Anton Frommelt, the curator, handles acquisitions for the collection.\nWith the collection growing ever so slightly year by year, Vaduz Castle and the cellars of government buildings cannot hold Liechtenstein's heritage for much longer. Two plans have been waved in the air, each with its own merits: one, move it to the Herrschaftliche Taverne, a local inn, and merge its premises the neighboring Verweserhaus, a government complex. Two, create a brand new building to house the grandiose collections of Liechtenstein: paintings, tools, maps, the works - all part of Liechtenstein's grand history."

Otto explained that ever since 1914, Austrian royalty traveled in armored vehicles and heavy entourages, and that he was merely on his way to summer vacation. A clueless young border guard questioned Otto where he was staying, to which the Habsburg replied 'here, high on the young Rhine!'  With that, Otto was let through with salutes and warm greetings.\n News spreads fast, of course - Prince [LIC.GetLeader] has already been notified of Otto's arrival, and plans to give Karl's son a warm welcome with drinks and feast in the halls of Vaduz Castle if he wish, along with more quaint attractions of fishing and hunting.

Franz Josef II, the newly-coronated Prince of Liechtenstein, has formally announced to the whole eleven thousand people of Liechtenstein that he shall move his family to Castle Vaduz, a castle in Liechtenstein itself over a hill.\nAt long last, Franz Josef II shall become the first Prince of Liechtenstein to live inside his own nation, rather than in imperial Austria."

The investigative procedure produced the results that the VDBL merely knew Jewish guests were staying in the hotel, and not where there rooms actually were - so they blew a bomb in a place to heavily damage the foundation and the rooms of the guests, indiscriminate of whether or not the Jews were actually staying in those rooms.\n\nTwo more Jewish families were roped into the unholy, uncaring business of the VDBL's terror campaign against the Jews. The Fiori and Goldstaub families, run-of-the-mill families with little note to their names besides this new tragedy, were rudely jostled from their beds by bombs at their homes. The bombs injured three and killed only one. Neighbors of the Fioris and Goldstaubs have been generously gifting the afflicted families with compensation, and the police stations in Vaduz and yonder find themselves swarmed by angry homeowners, afraid that the VDBL may bolden and bomb the regular Liechtensteiner.\n\nOn the 30th, the Rheinische Clothes Factory, no stranger to the VDBL's terror antics, was again rocked by a bomb - but this time, the bomber did not attempt to mask the explosion. Yet again, Richard Graetz evaded the wounds of the fiery ball that blew up on his property, but he said that if it happens again he'd rather the bomber actually hit his mark.\nOne more family was struck by the bombs of the VDBL, that of the Schiftan family. None were harmed in the explosion, and the family joked with the police about the inefficacy of their bombs, calling them 'shoddier than Austria's war performance in the Weltkrieg.'"

The Binnenkanal was designed to protect Liechtenstein from floods and assist in drainage.\nThe Binnenkanal is complete now, and the dozens of laborers who signed up to dig the 23-kilometer-long trench for the express purpose of making money during the blight of Black Monday have once again found themselves out of jobs.\nThe Binnenkanal has had a noticeable positive effect on the economy - signing laborers for public works seems to have been the first leap towards Liechtenstein's recovery. Some speak of road repair, others of building maintenance, for the men who toiled for the Binnenkanal have now left the economy slumping slowly again. We need to work fast to ensure that the Binnenkanal was not for naught."

licflavor.22.d:0 "The Liechtensteiner Arbeiterverband, or LAV as most know it, was founded in 1920 as Liechtenstein's first and still single trade union by Emil Risch, a schoolteacher. The Weltkrieg brought the waves of revolutionary syndicalism to Liechtenstein, and it wormed its way into the LAV slowly but surely. The rise of the Commune of France, coupled with the Trans-Alpine Strikes, has considerably radicalized and politicized the LAV since its inception in the late years of the Weltkrieg. Now, the LAV is usually characterized as the 'syndicalist party' of Liechtenstein, but its ideas compared to Paris or London are much more localized and less radical. The LAV, for one major difference, supports the Prince.\nAs questions that were raised during the Trans-Alpine Strikes float around, the LAV has taken an old demand forth to the Landtag and placed it before the members for a vote. The demand is to create a worker's secretariat, to administrate and organize the workers of Liechtenstein and any future trade unions. Some see this as a point in a greater Syndicalist path tread by the LAV, while cooler heads say that Syndicalist or not, it is a fine idea. The votes are in, and:"

The name is the Volksdeutsche Jugend. The VDJ has found itself in conflict with all other groups, and they took today to take to the streets in support of Ariosophic ideals.\n\nHowever, our own youth group, the Sturmtrupp, was there to oppose them. The Sturmtrupp stalled the VDJ and eventually drowned out their radical, pan-German demands in a voice favoring the Prince and the true fatherland of Liechtenstein.\nOtto Schädler has praised the Sturmtrupp's organizers, and the LHD has found itself a few new allies due to the incident."

Many feel no need to argue or discuss, for if we deny it, they will ask again, and again, like an itch that will never truly disappear unless we either give it medicine or yank it out by the roots. We do not want to cause any injuries, however, so we shall apply the ointment in the form of an acceptance letter. The letter is en route back to Vaduz, and finally Liechtenstein will shut up about their radio broadcasting station. Hopefully they will not use this new license to ask us for more!"

For that hour, the Landessender plays classical songs from composers in or near Liechtenstein, along with popular folk tunes from our little nation.\nThe antenna is housed in Vaduz Haberfeld, and the sudden augment to the building has produced financial and technical problems for the firm. The Prince himself has used the station frequently, listening to folk songs as he writes or meanders around Vaduz Castle."

licflavor.27.d:0 "The Austro-Liechtensteiner Postal Agreement, a major screw in the plate of the Customs Union, is an agreement that gives the Austrian post the rights over Liechtenstein's mailing. The Austrian post would manage the post of Liechtenstein, and therefore manners of radio licenses and the like would also be up to them. Since the end of the Weltkrieg and the gearing of Liechtenstein's sentiment for neutrality pushing for ties with Bern over Vienna, the Austro-Liechtensteiner Post Agreement has found itself on increasingly faulty ground. Now, the Agreemnt has been fully dissolved, or at least, the postal section of the Customs Agreement.."

Now, Liechtenstein seeks to erect the very same agreement with us instead of Vienna. The nature of the postal agreement will have the Swiss postal service in charge of distributing mail to Liechtenstein, and therefore we shall also inherit handling radio licenses and other manners of media.

Little infant Hans-Adam's godfather is the Pope himself, and as the eldest son of Franz Josef II, he is the first in line to the House of Liechtenstein, besides the sovereign himself.\nThe news has already been received in Liechtenstein, and cheers have erupted - congratulations by townspeople and government ministers alike have flooded the Prince's mail.

licflavor.30.d:0 "Since 1852, Liechtenstein has participated in a customs union with Austria, specifically matching its monetary system with that of neighboring Vorarlberg. The customs union has also eliminated trade tariffs between Liechtenstein and Austria, something Liechtenstein desperately needs - resources, when it has so little itself. What Liechtenstein lacked in resources it made up for in money, and the Customs Union held strong as Bohemian and Hungarian manufactories cranked out machines that were to go to Vaduz.\nThen, in 1914, Austria invaded Serbia, and the rest is history. The Austrians were tired and war-weary, and all material went to the K.u.K. Armee as it fought its hardest on the front under the oversight of incompetent commanders. This formed the first crack in a previously impenetrable union, a crack which would turn into a web of dents and scratches that has been slowly eroding the foundation of Vaduz and Vienna's agreement.\nThe Trans-Alpine Strikes, and the years after the Weltkrieg, for that matter, brought the question of a Second Weltkrieg in it - something Liechtenstein wants to avoid. With Austria a major power, Liechtensteiner politics have attempted to near Switzerland instead, famous for its neutrality, and therefore escape the horror of war, rather than behind lumped in with Austria.\nFranz I of Liechtenstein's relationship with Austria ensured the Agreement held firm, but after his passing, Franz Josef II has seen better use in the abolition of the Customs Agreement.\nWhat the future of Liechtenstein's finances hold, no one knows - but it will be without Vienna, or at least, with less Viennese influence."

With Liechtenstein able to provide, and others away on combat duty or having their magazine printers possessed for war material, Emanuel's troops have ventured into occupied territory to deliver these German-written scouting magazines. Dutch and Austrian scouts have assisted Emanuel's troop in delivering these scouting necessities to affected communities near the front lines, where Scouting may continue.\nEmanuel has been praised by his people and the scouting organizations of Austria and the Netherlands for his actions, yet these praises are whispered rather than proclaimed - the operation is to be strictly secret!"

All over the world, the Red Cross and Crescent fly high as a symbol of justice for the injured and safety of the innocent.\nUntil now, Liechtenstein has not had a Red Cross organization of its own, but now it does.

Its sole purpose is to counter the activities of Rudolf Schädler's VDBL, and uphold the red-and-blue flag of Liechtenstein, with a crown rather than an Ariosophic cross or swastika. The HTVL has made attempts to draw Liechtenstein away from Austria and to Switzerland, as they see neutrality the best course for Liechtenstein; a shield against foreign ideology that threatens to undermine our peaceful Alpine country.\nIt remains to be seen how they shall specifically counter the VDBL, but if anything, rather anything that the VDBL."

Mysteriously, the aircraft had little wings, far too small for most aircraft! It seemed that the aircraft was held aloft by a rotor, a spinning propeller on the top of the vehicle. The Drache, as it was called, was the newest toy of Germany, and the Prince has returned with both photos and a most intriguing up-close experience with the 'helicopter!'\n\nThe Prince has seen benefit in the helicopter in assisting with material goods transport over short, mountainous distances, and has offered a hefty lump of cash to Berlin in order to retrieve a few of these Draches for himself.

However, we are not the only contender for the purchase of the rubber-rich island; we must content with a competition both near and far to gain enough stakes in Ceylon to be the one shaking the Kaiser's hand.\nThe strategically-important island gives an ample springboard for operations in the Indian subcontinent, and by extension, East Asia, or Western Africa. Its laborers are acquainted with the rubber plant, praised by Harvey Samuel Firestone as the greatest commodity of the modern world. But, most obviously, Ceylon is a large island.

The streets of Vaduz and the little townships in the European microstate weep openly for the beloved Franz I's passing at the ripe old age of 84.\nThe new Prince, Franz Josef II, has already been given his coronation and promptly moved his seat to Vaduz Castle; an unprecedented move in the history of the house of Liechtenstein. He has pledged to continue his father's legacy, but that includes solving the complicated relations between Liechtenstein's neighbors and itself.\n The entire royal house of Liechtenstein, plus Kaiser Karl of Austria, have paid their respects at his funeral at the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Brno, where the late Prince was laid to burial."

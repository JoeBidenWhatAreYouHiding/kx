POLITICS_MAHAMMAD_RASULZADE: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 31st, 1884, in Novkhany, Baku Guberniya, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Despite being born into a clergyman's family, Mahammad, or, simply, Mamed, received a secular education, and already in 1902 began his political life. Having founded the social-democratic organization \"Hummet\" in 1904, as the Baku branch of the Russian SDRP, Rasulzade actively cooperated with the Caucasian Bolsheviks and was under police surveillance in connection with his revolutionary activities. This forced him to leave his homeland and go abroad, but in 1913, after an amnesty, Mamed was able to return to Baku, leaving his old Hummet party to create a new one - Musavat, meaning 'Equality', becoming its head.\n\nMamed Amin headed the Azerbaijani National Council, which, under his leadership, adopted a declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. Soon peace was signed with the Ottoman Empire and with the support of Porta's army Baku was liberated from the socialists sitting there. Mamed Amin Rasulzade spoke at the opening of parliament and utters the famous phrase that has become the motto of independent Azerbaijan - \"Once raised the banner will never fall!\"\n\nIn subsequent years, Rasulzade was engaged in journalistic and social activities, nevertheless, he did not participate in the government until hard times hit Azerbaijan. Supported by Azerbaijan's first Prime Minister, now Foreign Minister, Fatali Khan Khoyski, and Rashid bey Akhundzade, prime-minister at that time, Mamed Amin becomes president - the head of state and \"face\" of Azerbaijan, a necessary man to rally the nation in difficult times. Under his symbolic leadership, it is to be hoped that bright times await Azerbaijan..."

POLITICS_ALSAN_SEFIKURDSKI: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! September 30st, 1881, in Sefikurd, Yelizavetpol Guberniya, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! The founder of the People's Party, Aslan Sefikurdski received his legal education at Kharkov and Petrograd universities. In Russia Aslan joined the revolutionary student strikes, for which he was expelled but was reinstated. His revolutionary sentiments made him a member of the Social Revolutionary Party. Returning to Azerbaijan, Sefikurdski worked as an assistant attorney at the court in Ganja, was one of the leaders of the Muslim Charitable Society, and later worked in the Shusha City Duma as a sworn representative.\n\nIn independent Azerbaijan, Sefikurdski became one of the leaders of the socialist faction in parliament and was even able to serve briefly as Minister of Justice and Labor until Musavat ceased cooperation with all socialist parties at the insistence of the German imperialists. After the split of the Socialist faction, Sefikurdski founded and led a new party, Khalqchi, taking inspiration from the Russian Social Revolutionaries. In stiff opposition to the Musavatists, Sefikurdski, together with the Hummetists, intended to put an end to the colonization of Azerbaijan and establish just reforms for peasants and workers."
POLITICS_AHMAD_PEPINOV: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! September 11th, 1893, in Bolojur, Tiflis Guberniya, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Ahmad bey Pepinov, a graduate of the Law Faculty, returned to Baku after receiving higher education in 1918 and became actively involved in political events in the South Caucasus.\n\nPepinov actively participated in the activities of the parliament, speaking on behalf of the socialist faction he represented during the discussion of a number of important draft laws. Pepinov was directly involved in the organization of the Baku State University and made many efforts to accelerate the discussion of this issue in the Parliament and to allocate funds for the opening of the University. As secretary of the Majlis-Mabasan from December 1918 to April 1928, Pepinov won great popularity among the socialist-minded parties and became the main candidate for the presidency of the Hummet after the death of Samad aga Agamalioglu."
POLITICS_ABDULLAH_EFENDIZADE: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 3rd, 1873, in Nuha, Yelizavetpol Guberniya, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Abdullah bey Efendizade was born in Ganja into the family of a member of the Sunni spiritual assembly who was educated in the Ottoman Empire. This foreshadowed his future path as a teacher. From 1898 Efendizade taught in Baku, worked as principal and teacher in various schools, and drafted a new alphabet.\n\nHe was elected to the ADR parliament as a member of the "Ahrar" faction and later joined the newly formed party. As a parliamentarian, Efendizade worked in the commission on the alphabet reform, and in 1919 it was allowed to publish a textbook based on this alphabet. Efendizade paid much attention to the development of Azerbaijani culture and education, and in the second half of the 1930s he became the main presidential candidate of the Ahrar Party. His fame and popularity among Azerbaijanis of all ages enabled him to win the trust of parliament and be elected to the presidency."

Qara Qarabeyli was a famous physician and revolutionary, now a leader of the Ittihad party. After graduating from the Shamkir German-Russian Lyceum, then the Tbilisi Gymnasium, Qara entered the medical faculty in Moscow, where he was soon convicted of \"revolutionary activity\" and served a year in prison. He worked in Moscow, then in Baku, but in 1906 was forced to leave Russia and immigrated to Iran to continue his revolutionary activities, then lived in Turkey and collaborated with the Young Turks.\n\nQarabeyli returned to Baku after the February Revolution, and at first participated in the work of the Hummet party, but on the petition of the Union party he joined it and headed the faction in the parliament, his membership was accepted unanimously. Throughout his political career he was a member of the Standing Committee on Legislation, Protection, Central Elections and Statutes, as well as of the Special Commission for the Selection of Students to Send Abroad and the Commission of Inquiry on the Qarabag Events.\n\nEven though Qarabeyli became disillusioned with the Musavatists during his long years in Parliament, he still stands for democracy and electability and calls for cooperation with Turkey and other Muslim brothers in the struggle against the European colonizers."

The first chairman of the party was Mir Hasan Vazirov, one of the Baku commissars. However, after the failure of the Baku Commune, the new leadership of the party - Habib Jebiyev and Ruhulla Akhundov faced low popularity among the working masses of Azerbaijanis as well as prohibition of their activities by the Musavatist government.

As a result of disagreements, the Muslim Socialist Bloc disintegrated, and those who disagreed with the Social Democrats on the agrarian issue, under the leadership of Aslan bey Sefikurdski, founded the Azerbaijani Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, or Khalqchi Party. The party was created to unite the peasants, workers and the industrious, intelligent part of the population and to defend against counter-revolutionary forces within and outside Azerbaijan.

Formally it appeared as a branch of the Baku Committee of the RSDRP, but in fact the party acted independently. In 1917 the party was split into 'Bolsheviks' and 'Mensheviks', but despite disagreements, the party elected a unified Central Committee, although the fact that the leftist faction ignored parliament led to their isolation. Hummet stands in general on internationalist and Russophile positions, criticizing Musavat for its national and economic policies, and is currently the main critic of the pro-German orientation, which has helped them to win the popularity of many Azerbaijanis who are dissatisfied with Musavat's policies.§!"

With the fall of Musavat's popularity and authority among the Azerbaijani, Yusifbeyli understood that the party has a future without Musavat.

### Events ###
aze.1.t: "The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic"
aze.1.d: "Azerbaijan gained its independence on May 28, 1918, during the chaos of the Russian Civil War, after seceding from the short-lived Transcaucasian Federation. But unlike its neighbors, Georgia and Armenia, who had to give up some of their lands or lose their independence, Azerbaijan only gained. In June 1918 a treaty was signed with Turkey on the railroad and oil, and on June 26 the National Army was established. However, Azerbaijan was still unstable. In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, power belonged to the so-called \"Baku Commune\" - a group of Bolsheviks and Armenian Dashnaks. Already in July 1918, however, the power of the Bolsheviks fell, and the power went to the Tsentrokaspiy - the rule of the 5 Dictators, from the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.\n\nFinally, Baku was captured on September 15, 1918 by the Caucasian Islamic Army and the Azerbaijani National Council took its rightful place as the supreme authority in Azerbaijan, led by its chairman, Fatali Khan Khoyski. On October 5, the oil was denationalized, and on November 19, the Azerbaijani Parliament - Majlis-Mabusan was convened.\n\nBut this was not the end of the era of chaos. Unresolved territorial disputes with Georgia and Armenia led Azerbaijan to fierce interethnic resistance. Throughout 1918 and 1919, Azerbaijani and Ottoman forces were embroiled in various border conflicts with Azerbaijan's neighbors - with Georgia over the Zakatala region and the Kura River valley, and with Armenia over Qarabag and Zangezur. To prevent escalation, the Caucasus Conference was convened at the initiative of Germany.\nThe Caucasus Conference ended largely in favor of Azerbaijan, satisfying all of its territorial claims and receiving a guarantee of independence from Germany and a huge flow of investments for the development of the economy.\n\nSince 1918 the liberal Musavatist party has held power in the republic, but the party has had to concede much to the opposition in recent years, and it is possible that it will have great difficulty winning the next elections."
aze.1.a: "Interesting"

aze.2.t: "Majlis-Mabusan"
aze.2.d: "The political landscape of Azerbaijan is largely represented by Majlis-Mabusan. Currently the largest faction is the centrist liberal Musavat party.\n\nThe other four major parliamentary parties are the Muslim Social Democrats - Hummet, the liberal-agrarian Ahrar party, the splinter right wing of Musavat - Geyrat, and the pan-Islamic Ittihad.\n\nApart from those, there are several less popular movements, mainly SR-based Akinchi and Khalqchi, as well as ultranationalist party of the Mujahideen."
aze.2.a: "Interesting"

aze.3.t: "Oil, Trade, and the German Mark"
aze.3.d: "From the oil derricks of Baku to the vineyards of Ganja and the silk looms of Shamakhi, the Republic of Azerbaijan stands at the crossroads of prosperity and dependence.\n\nTwo decades have passed since the young Republic declared independence. The economy that rose from the ashes of empire was built upon three pillars - oil, foreign capital, and free enterprise. Baku’s oil, once fueling the Russian Empire, now drives half of the Reichspakt. Yet, prosperity came at a price: the Deutsche Mark became as common in business circles as the Manat itself, and German syndicates carved a powerful niche in Azerbaijan’s financial and industrial life.\n\nWhile liberal policy and open trade allowed the economy to flourish - turning Baku into a cosmopolitan port of immense wealth - it also fostered a degree of dependency. German firms dominate refinery and transport infrastructure, and Azerbaijani exports are deeply tied to Berlin’s markets. At the same time, Musavat’s cautious fiscal management and dedication to education and agrarian modernization brought genuine progress in rural provinces, making Azerbaijan one of the most developed and politically stable states in the post-imperial Caucasus."
aze.3.a: "Being an oil hub brings many advantages."

aze.4.t: "The Question of Qarabag and Zangezur"
aze.4.d: "Two decades after the republic declared independence, the mountains of Qarabag and Zangezur remain a thorn in the side of Baku. Despite the formal annexation of these territories during the Caucasus Conference, Armenian guerilla forces under Garegin Nzdeh continue to operate from fortified positions, with occasional support from remnants of the former Armenian government.\n\nThe recent decade of intermittent conflict has left the population wary. Raids, sabotage, and terrorist attacks - most notably the tragic bombing at the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater - have deepened national wounds. While Germany and the Ottoman Empire previously exerted pressure on Baku to restrain military action, the operational phase of the insurgency has largely cooled. The rebels are scattered, their leadership in hiding, and active conflict is at a low point.\n\nTwo decades later, the Armenian issue remains a scar on the national conscience. In Baku, many view the Armenian minority as a potential fifth column, resentful of Azeri administration. Within the confines of mountainous hideouts, Armenian insurgents are preparing to reclaim their nation's sovereignty, even if it sets the whole Caucasus on fire."
aze.4.a: "We should deal with separatists!"

aze.109.d: "Today, a delegation from Azerbaijan has arrived in Russia to discuss the prospects of partnership and the development of relations between our two countries, which have been largely estranged over the past few decades. In addition to the physical distance between us, German dominance and their colonial ambitions have also served as a significant obstacle to our relations. While the Azerbaijani government undoubtedly benefited from this situation, the majority of our Russian oil companies and enterprises were either acquired at a pittance or found themselves in a state of clear oppression and injustice.\n\nWith the Kaiser's influence in the Caucasus waning, the Azerbaijani have chosen to strike a deal. They propose to join the Rostorg, allowing us to reap enhanced dividends from their burgeoning oil industry while simultaneously contributing to their growth through our investments. However, there are those among the radicals who insist that Azerbaijan must concede significant advantages to this partnership, such as preferential treatment for Russian companies, particularly the Russian General Oil Corporation, which will essentially monopolize the Baku oil market in our favor."

Should we grant these concessions, we may indeed secure the desired partnership, but there will undoubtedly be widespread dissatisfaction within the domestic sphere."

Royal Dutch Shell has been engaged in oil production in Azerbaijan since the early years of the century, when it was still part of the Russian Empire. However, after the Weltkrieg, German influence in the region significantly increased, with some of our oil companies being acquired by Deutsche Petroleum Werkaufsgesellschaft. The other part continued operating, but in a far more competitive and challenging environment.\n\nAs a result, our earnings from oil production in Azerbaijan became insignificant compared to other regions. We even considered shutting down Royal Dutch Shell operations in Azerbaijan following the Black Monday. Nonetheless, Azerbaijan now offers us an extraordinary opportunity - a kind of restart for our oil business. If we invest in their oil industry, Azerbaijan will be able to increase its oil production. This will be achieved through the nationalization of some foreign enterprises and the conclusion of new concession agreements, including those for production in the Caspian Sea. Failure to do so would likely result in Azerbaijan having to purchase our enterprises at a low cost."

aze.116.t: "Success of the Negotiations"
aze.116.d: "We have been able to reach a consensus with Royal Dutch Shell, who will now emerge as the primary foreign beneficiary of the region's oil production. Not only do we stand to receive a substantial portion, but we have secured a dependable European partner in this endeavor."

aze.117.t: "Failure of the Negotiations"
aze.117.d: "Regrettably, our discussions with the Dutch government regarding the future of Royal Dutch Shell have proven futile. [HOL.GetNameDefCap] has demonstrated a lack of interest in its own companies operating in our nation, and yesterday, the government announced the nationalization of Royal Dutch Shell’s oil production assets in accordance with previously agreed-upon arrangements with the Dutch side."

This entity, although not a state, is effectively a military alliance designed to counter Russian aggression.\n\nAzerbaijan aspires to integrate our economies and military forces, forming a united front against a shared adversary. This aspiration is commendable, yet it raises certain considerations. The last instance of such collaboration occurred in 1918, resulting in the disintegration of the frontline and the occupation not only of Transcaucasia but also of the Mountainous Republic by Ottoman forces. Only through the intervention of Germany was the independence of our nations preserved.\n\nFurthermore, there are disputes over territories that Azerbaijan claims for itself. It is imperative that we insist on the return of these territories, particularly our historic city of Derbent."

The representatives of several state and public organisations, including the Ministries of Trade, Industry, and Food; Finance; Agriculture and State Property; Communications; State Control; as well as members of the Congress of Oil Producers, and the Baku City Administration who are part of the Committee are tasked with determining the course of action regarding the current economic situation in the country.\n\nCertain experts propose that until the market reaches a state of equilibrium, it would be prudent to curtail oil production and exports abroad in order to preserve prices for domestic consumers and mitigate costs. Conversely, another segment of experts maintains that the optimal course of action would be to implement import tariffs, which would generate additional revenue for the national budget."

The explosion tore through the car, killing Khan-Khoyski and two of his aides instantly.\n\nWithin hours, the investigation identified the culprit - an Armenian conspirator, long suspected of ties to the remnants of the so-called \"Republic of Mountainous Armenia\". The device was likely assembled in Goris, smuggled into the city through merchant contacts.\n\nNews of the assassination spread rapidly. Crowds gathered before the State Opera House and the Parliament, chanting Khoyski’s name and calling for revenge. From the oil fields to the universities, from workers to officers, a single word echoes across the republic: justice.\n\nThe government declared a day of mourning - and a state of emergency in the districts bordering Qarabag.

Orders have been issued for the military to restore full control over the western districts. The General Staff, led by General Habib Bey Salimov, has begun mobilizing reserve units in Ganja and Yevlakh.\n\nAcross the nation, public outrage has turned into fervent calls for retribution. Yet not all within the government are united - liberals warn of German and Ottoman disapproval, while the army and nationalists insist that Qarabag must be cleansed once and for all."

The attackers, armed with rifles and explosives, vanished into the hills after destroying the lead truck. Several soldiers were killed, their bodies mutilated and paraded in a nearby Armenian village - a brutal message from the guerrillas under Garegin Nzdeh.\n\nThe streets of Baku buzz with alarm as citizens demand swift justice, while newspapers fill their columns with outrage.

Local peasants fled their homes, fearful of reprisals from either side. In Baku, the press is divided. While \"Achyg Soz\" calls for decisive action and full mobilization, deputies of Ahrar and Hummet urge caution.

Smoke rises from the hills as frightened villagers flee toward the city.\n\nIn Baku, news of the attack sparks outrage. Opposition from the Geyrat and Ittihad demand decisive retaliation, while liberals argue for restraint and diplomacy.

Once the seat of the short-lived Republic of Aras under Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski, the region is now fully reintegrated into the Azerbaijani state. Yet the echoes of past autonomy linger: local notables and former officers still wield influence, and the people remember the hardships of border life.\n\nRecent reports speak of renewed raids by Armenian insurgents spilling over from Qarabag into the southern passes. Villages near Ordubad and Sharur are on edge, and merchants report disrupted trade. The Ministry of Interior warns that while the army is stretched thin in Karabagh, unrest in Nakhchivan could spark wider discontent. Meanwhile, whispers suggest that Ottoman advisors stationed in the region are pressing for a more assertive military presence, fearing that any instability could threaten their interests."

azeterror.13.d: "As the conflict in the Highland Karabakh region of Azerbaijan continues to escalate, Germany has attempted to exert pressure on Baku by advocating for a ceasefire. However, [AZE.GetName] has steadfastly refused to acquiesce to these demands, likely due to the repeated same concessions made by the ruling Musavat Party over the last 20 years, which have eroded its popularity and allowed Armenian nationalists to consolidate their influence.\n\nIn light of this, Germany has now turned to us for mediation, seeking our assistance in influencing the Musavatist leadership in Baku. This presents a unique opportunity for our government to enhance our position in the Caucasus region. We can endeavor to negotiate our own terms with Azerbaijan, potentially securing access to its resources and drawing it into our orbit of influence.\n\nNevertheless, we cannot match the level of commitment offered by the European hegemon. Moreover, there is a segment of the nationalist movement within our own country that views Azerbaijan as a mere fragment of our Empire, rather than a sovereign nation. It is possible that our true dominion over the Caucasus lies not in confrontation with Berlin, but rather in cooperation with it."

The German side strongly advocates for an armistice, while the Ottoman Empire proposes \"peaceful mediation\". The situation is becoming increasingly tense, with Ottoman diplomats subtly insinuating that rejecting the generous offer extended by the great powers is untenable. We are compelled to reluctantly accept their terms.\n\nWhile Berlin appears to be seeking calm, Ottoman officers have already begun to deploy to the border regions, ostensibly for observation purposes, effectively establishing temporary control over [1303.GetName]."
azeterror.14.a: "We are withdrawing troops today, but Azerbaijan will soon rise up!"

azeterror.15.t: "Secret Note from the Ottoman Ambassador"
azeterror.15.d: "Through clandestine channels, we have received information indicating that Germany has approached the Ottoman Empire as a mediator in resolving the current conflict. However, the Ottomans have proposed cooperation with us instead. Their terms are straightforward: they are willing to support our efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the matter with the Nzdeh's terrorists, in return for investments and preferential treatment in trade in oil with us.\n\nWhile this development may cause a diplomatic incident, the prospect of uniting with our Turkic brethren and a clear ally in the Caucasus is undoubtedly gratifying, despite the fact that their economy, which is already struggling, may not be as valuable to us as that of Germany."

azeterror.20.d: "The Germans are blatantly exerting pressure on us in an attempt to secure the acceptance of their conditions. We must provide them with a definitive response."
azeterror.20.a: "We stand on our terms."
azeterror.20.b: "We are not in a position to counter Germans."

azeterror.21.t: "Azerbaijan Stands its Ground"
azeterror.21.d: "Despite all our efforts to resolve the issue amicably, Azerbaijan has ultimately chosen to disregard our requests for a unilateral ceasefire with Armenia. What is our response?"
azeterror.21.a: "We are a great power, not a laughing stock!"

azeterror.22.t: "Germany Backs Down!"
azeterror.22.d: "Realizing the significance of Azerbaijan as a commercial partner for Germany, the Hegemon relinquished its demands and opted to abstain from meddling in our domestic affairs."
azeterror.22.a: "A great victory for the Musavat diplomats!"

azeterror.23.t: "German Sanctions"
azeterror.23.d: "Following unsuccessful negotiations, Germany has declared that it is compelled to impose economic sanctions on our country, as we have refused to cede our ancestral territories to the Nzdeh's terrorist militant group. This decision will have far-reaching consequences for the entire region."
azeterror.23.a: "A cost for our independence."

azeterror.24.t: "Armenian Resistance Crushed!"
azeterror.24.d: "After months of relentless pursuit, the fires of rebellion in Qarabag have begun to fade. Azerbaijani troops, hardened by the mountain campaign, report that organized resistance has all but vanished. The villages once flying insurgent banners now stand eerily quiet. The once-frequent ambushes and sabotage of supply columns have ceased.\n\nIntelligence reports suggest that Garegin Nzhdeh, the elusive leader of the rebellion, has fled with a small band of loyalists into the highlands or possibly across the border into Persia. The remaining partisan cells have dissolved into the forests, blending among the peasantry or dispersing toward Zangezur and Nakhchivan.\n\nYet, for all the outward calm, the wounds of the conflict are deep. Many districts lie half-ruined, and whispers of revenge still echo in the hills. Local officials warn that the spirit of revolt lingers beneath the surface - dormant, not extinguished. The government celebrates a hard-fought victory, but among weary soldiers and refugees, the mood is somber."
azeterror.24.a: "They hid like rats and are unlikely to recover."

azeterror.25.t: "The Qarabag Question"
azeterror.25.d: "The guns have fallen silent in Qarabag, but the echoes of rebellion linger in the minds of the people and the chambers of the Majlis-Mabusan. The new government inherits not only a war-torn province, but a question that has haunted the republic since its birth - how to integrate the Armenian population, now broken and distrustful, into the Azerbaijani state.\n\nThe military governors warn that any leniency will only invite renewed trouble. In their view, the mountains must be held with a firm hand and the local councils purged of disloyal elements. Others - particularly within the liberal Ahrar and moderate Musavat circles - argue that peace cannot last without some measure of reconciliation, perhaps even limited cultural autonomy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hummet deputies demand that the state address the root causes: poverty, exploitation, and inequality. They insist that true loyalty will come only from justice, not bayonets. The Geyrat and Ittihad factions denounce such talk as naïve - for them, national unity must come before all else, even if it means permanent military rule in the region."
azeterror.25.a: "Offer limited cultural autonomy and self-governance." # not ittihad
azeterror.25.b: "Reinforce national unity - no talk of autonomy." 
azeterror.25.c: "Impose permanent military rule in the region." # not ahrar
azeterror.25.e: "Call for reconciliation through socialist reconstruction." #hummet-only

azeflavour.1.t: "A Shepherd Lit the Mountain"
azeflavour.1.d: "While the rural areas of the Absheron Peninsula, the very same on which our capital is located, are usually quite peaceful - if not even arcadic - they have been recently a source of much activity within our academic circles. As the story goes, a local shepherd was tending to his flock at night on the hillsides in the near vicinity of Baku when he slipped on a loose rock. Unfortunately for him, he dropped a lit cigarette - one of the older Batschari packs from Germany - which proceeded to lodge itself into the porous sandstone.\n\nThe result of this small event could not have been expected by anyone, much less the shepherd himself. The whole hill erupted in a blaze of never-ending fire, still ongoing and one not showing any signs of ever going out. According to the preliminary research multiple scientists carried out the inferno is connected to a seepage of natural gas through natural openings in the rock. Although quite a dangerous site to anyone walking near it, the location has already attracted much local attention, receiving the name of Yanar Dağ (Burning Mountain), not to mention the possibility of utilizing the gas for future industrial purposes."
azeflavour.1.a: "I recollect Marco Polo already reported this."
azeflavour.1.b: "Reward the shepherd for his curiosity."
azeflavour.1.c: "Keep it a secret... nobody shall ever know about this miracle."

azeflavour.2.t: "Zoroastrian Pilgrims in Yanar Dag"
azeflavour.2.d: "Following the ‘establishment’ of the Burning Mountain the locals began to observe a strange occurrence. Organized groups of travelers, some speaking our language yet many utilizing the myriad of Iranic tongues of our bigger neighbor, could be witnessed making stops and holding various ceremonies while surrounding Yanar Dağ. According to the officials sent to investigate this matter these people represent the ancient Zoroastrian faith, driven underground and scattered by the millenia of Islamic rule in Persia.\n\nIt seems that the naturally inextinguishable flame, surely connected to the religious concept of a purifying fire and visible presence of Ahura Mazda in the ‘ātar’, has attracted their attention. Many observes note a similarity to an older flame, also situated near Baku, housed in the Ateshgah, or just the Fire Temple. While these travellers are not causing any harm so far, it is best if we kept an eye on their practices and general location."
azeflavour.2.a: "Crazy lunatics..."

AZE_Extraordinary_Meeting_EMK_desc: "Established in 1919, the Emtee Mübadilesi Komitesinin or Commodity Exchange Committee, serves as an interdepartmental advisory, and in some cases a decision-making, body, that is engaged in the import of goods necessary for Azerbaijan from foreign countries, as well as the export of oil and petroleum products. Representatives of a number of state and public organisation, including the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Food, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and State Property, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of State Control, as well as representatives of the Congress of the Council of Oil Producers and the Baku City Administration are included in the Committee, a much-needed institution that ensured our prosperity throughout the 1920s-1930s.

AZE_Bailout_German_Companies_desc: "It was the German companies that catalyzed the swift expansion of industrial production and commercial activity in Azerbaijan. Our debt to the Germans is immense, and in order to prevent their enterprises, which had contributed so greatly to our nation's prosperity, from collapsing due to financial obligations, it was deemed necessary to support them by providing loans and issuing bonds at interest rates that, while modest, were deemed sufficient to ensure their survival."

Now, as the crisis deepens, their continued treatment is nothing but poison.

Each fiscal year concludes with the deficit slipping unnoticed from one administration to the next. However, the era of excuses is drawing to a close. The Ministry of Finance is set to implement austerity measures across all governmental levels: military acquisitions, municipal subsidies, even cultural initiatives will be scaled back.

The Ministry of Economy suggests applying for an extraordinary credit line from Deutsche Bank and the Reich Finance Ministry.

AZE_Increase_Cotton_Exports: "Increase Cotton Exports"
AZE_Increase_Cotton_Exports_desc: "Azerbaijan’s fertile lowlands are ideal for cotton cultivation - a crop that has already brought prosperity to many regions. By mechanizing production and improving transport logistics, we can increase output and reclaim our position in the global textile market.

## Army ##
AZE_Milli_Ordusu: "Review the Milli Ordusu"
AZE_Milli_Ordusu_desc: "The Milli Ordusu, born out of the tumultuous wars of independence, remains a patchwork of outdated doctrines and regional loyalties. A comprehensive review of its structure and capabilities is long overdue. Standardizing command, improving logistics, and ensuring loyalty to the state will transform the army from a symbol of survival into a true instrument of national power."
AZE_Arrange_Arms_Supplies: "Arrange Ordnance Delivery"
AZE_Arrange_Arms_Supplies_desc: "Our arsenals are depleted, and the army’s armament relies heavily on old Imperial stocks and whatever can be imported through intermediaries. Negotiations for new deliveries of rifles, artillery, and vehicles - whether from Germany, the Ottomans, or domestic manufacturers - will give our soldiers the tools they need to defend the republic effectively."
AZE_Invite_Foreign_Advisors: "Invite Foreign Advisors"
AZE_Invite_Foreign_Advisors_desc: "Modern warfare demands modern expertise. The General Staff proposes to invite seasoned officers from abroad - engineers, logisticians, and tacticians - to reform our doctrine and training.

AZE_Improve_EMT_Intelligence: "Improve EMT Intelligence"
AZE_Improve_EMT_Intelligence_desc: "The EMT - the Republic’s Military Intelligence Bureau - has proven vital during the Qarabag operations, yet its reach remains limited.

AZE_Professional_Army: "A Professional Army"
AZE_Professional_Army_desc: "The time of improvisation is over.

AZE_Training: "Expand Military Education Programs"
AZE_Training_desc: "Education is the foundation of professionalism.

AZE_Supply_Corps: "Expand the Supply Corps"
AZE_Supply_Corps_desc: "No army can fight without supplies.

AZE_Increase_War_Ministry_Budget: "Increase Military Spending"
AZE_Increase_War_Ministry_Budget_desc: "Our army cannot defend the republic on promises and speeches alone.

AZE_Military_Industrial_Complex: "Azerbaijani Military-Industrial Complex"
AZE_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc: "The lessons of recent years are clear - national security cannot rely solely on imports.

Creating an Azerbaijani military-industrial base will anchor our sovereignty in steel, not diplomacy."
AZE_Standartisation_Of_Equipment: "Standardize Military Equipment"
AZE_Standartisation_Of_Equipment_desc: "Decades of improvised procurement have left the army equipped with a chaotic mix of German, Ottoman, Russian, and locally produced weapons.

AZE_Mountain_Army: "Azerbaijani Mountaineer Forces"
AZE_Mountain_Army_desc: "The rugged highlands of Qarabag, Zaqatala, and the Lesser Caucasus have long bred hardy men - hunters, shepherds, and patriots who know every trail and pass.

Lightly equipped, well-trained in reconnaissance and ambush, they will be the silent guardians of the republic’s frontier."
AZE_Motorization: "Establish the Motorisation Commission"
AZE_Motorization_desc: "Modern warfare moves on wheels and engines, not on horse hooves. To prepare our forces for the demands of mechanized logistics and mobile combat, a Motorisation Commission will be established within the War Ministry.

AZE_Improve_Artillery_Batallions: "Modernize Artillery Batallions"
AZE_Improve_Artillery_Batallions_desc: "The artillery remains the backbone of any modern army - the thunder that breaks enemy lines and protects our own. By upgrading rangefinders, replacing outdated field guns, and creating centralized fire control training, the Azerbaijani artillery arm will evolve from static support to a decisive battlefield force. Our enemies must learn to fear the guns of Baku."
AZE_AA_investments: "Defend Azerbaijani Skies"
AZE_AA_investments_desc: "As warfare evolves, so does its reach. Bombers and reconnaissance aircraft now threaten cities far from the front lines. Establishing anti-aircraft batteries, radar posts, and early warning systems will safeguard both our army and our people. The skies above Baku, Ganja, and Nakhchivan must never belong to anyone else" 
AZE_AT_investments: "Anti-Tank Investments"
AZE_AT_investments_desc: "Armor grows thicker every year, and our infantry must not face it unarmed. By producing shaped charges, modern field guns, and portable anti-tank rifles, we can ensure that no foreign tank crosses our soil unscathed. Azerbaijan may not build armored divisions - but it will never be defenseless."
AZE_Use_Garabagh_Experience: "Apply Qarabag War Experience"
AZE_Use_Garabagh_Experience_desc: "The recent operations in Qarabag, though costly, have taught our army bitter but invaluable lessons. Guerrilla warfare, logistics under fire, the coordination between local forces and the regular army - all must be studied and codified. By turning hard-won experience into doctrine, Azerbaijan can transform its scars into strength, ensuring the next war will be fought on our terms."

## Air ##
AZE_Establish_Air_Force: "Establish the HHQ"
AZE_Establish_Air_Force_desc: "For too long, the defense of Azerbaijan has depended solely on its soldiers and guns. The skies above our land remain empty - vulnerable. To correct this, the Herbi Hava Qüvveleri shall be established under the War Ministry. Its first task will be to lay the foundations of an independent air arm, capable of reconnaissance, defense, and, one day, deterrence. The republic must claim its place among the nations that rule the air."
AZE_Equipment_Procurement: "Equipment Procurement"
AZE_Equipment_Procurement_desc: "No army flies without machines, and no air force can exist without engines.

Each new plane that takes off from Azerbaijani soil marks a milestone toward independence in the air."
AZE_Construct_Air_Base: "Ganja Air Base"
AZE_Construct_Air_Base_desc: "At the foot of the Lesser Caucasus, near the city of Ganja, construction begins on the republic’s first dedicated air base. It will serve both as an operational airfield and a training ground for our new aviators. From this strategic site, our air wings will patrol the western approaches and protect the skies of Azerbaijan."
AZE_Caspiy_Air_Academy: "\"Kaspi\" Air Academy"
AZE_Caspiy_Air_Academy_desc: "With the establishment of the “Kaspi” Air Academy, Azerbaijan will train its own generation of pilots, navigators, and engineers. Combining local discipline with foreign expertise, the academy will forge the nation’s air elite - men who will guard both the Caspian and the Caucasus from above. The dream of an Azerbaijani aviator corps is no longer distant; it is being built, one wing at a time."
AZE_Radar_Station: "Invest in Radar Stations"
AZE_Radar_Station_desc: "A new era of warfare demands new eyes. Radar technology, still in its infancy, offers a chance to detect incoming aircraft long before they appear over our cities. By installing experimental radar systems near Baku and along the Caspian shore, Azerbaijan takes a decisive step into the modern age of defense."
AZE_Aerial_Reconnaissance: "Aerial Reconnaissance"
AZE_Aerial_Reconnaissance_desc: "One of the most significant advantages of modern aircraft is that they can observe the enemy from safety above. Reconnaissance planes will allow us to map enemy positions, track movements, and plan operations with precision."

## Navy ##
AZE_Invest_In_Navy: "Maritime Department Investments"
AZE_Invest_In_Navy_desc: "Though Azerbaijan’s fate is written in oil and mountains, the Caspian remains our lifeline. The Maritime Department must be strengthened - with funding, new vessels, and modern port facilities. From trade protection to coastal patrols, we must expand our reach so that our new seaways are be a vulnerable expanse no longer, but a shield of water under our flag."
AZE_State_Marine_Academy: "State Marine Academy"
AZE_State_Marine_Academy_desc: "The time has come to professionalize our naval service.

AZE_Tanker_Fleet: "Azerbaijani Oil Tankers"
AZE_Tanker_Fleet_desc: "Our oil sustains the state - but dependence on foreign transport weakens us. The establishment of a national tanker fleet under Azerbaijani registry will guarantee the secure export of our black gold across the world."

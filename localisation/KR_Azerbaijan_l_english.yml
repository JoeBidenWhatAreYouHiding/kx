AZE_Armenian_Terrorism_desc:0 "Our country is suffering from significant Armenian minority, greatly dissatisfied with Ottoman and Azeri rule. After the April 1931 terror attack, we have cracked down on Armenians, which led to the fact that they lay low, and now they are acting surreptitiously, arranging sabotage and terrorist attacks."

AZE_Dependance_On_Germany_desc:0 "We managed to become the largest oil producer in the region, however, mainly due to the German investments. Moreover, most of the extracted oil is transfered to the Kaiserreich. In an age in which the consumption of oil is becoming the dominant need of both industrial society and of modern warfare, Azerbaijan is increasingly finding herself the battleground of both corporate and national foreign interests."

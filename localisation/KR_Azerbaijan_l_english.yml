POLITICS_MAHAMMAD_RASULZADE: "Despite being born into a clergyman's family, Mahammad, or, simply, Mamed, received a secular education, and already in 1902 began his political life. Having founded the social-democratic organization \"Hummet\" in 1904, as the Baku branch of the Russian SDRP, Rasulzade actively cooperated with the Caucasian Bolsheviks and was under police surveillance in connection with his revolutionary activities. This forced him to leave his homeland and go abroad, but in 1913, after an amnesty, Mamed was able to return to Baku, leaving his old Hummet party to create a new one - Musavat, meaning 'Equality', becoming its head.\n\nMamed Amin headed the Azerbaijani National Council, which, under his leadership, adopted a declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. Soon peace was signed with the Ottoman Empire and with the support of Porta's army Baku was liberated from the socialists sitting there. Mamed Amin Rasulzade spoke at the opening of parliament and utters the famous phrase that has become the motto of independent Azerbaijan - \"Once raised the banner will never fall!\"\n\nIn subsequent years, Rasulzade was engaged in journalistic and social activities, nevertheless, he did not participate in the government until hard times hit Azerbaijan. Supported by Azerbaijan's first Prime Minister, now Foreign Minister, Fatali Khan Khoyski, and Rashid bey Akhundzade, prime-minister at that time, Mamed Amin becomes president - the head of state and \"face\" of Azerbaijan, a necessary man to rally the nation in difficult times. Under his symbolic leadership, it is to be hoped that bright times await Azerbaijan..."

POLITICS_ALSAN_SEFIKURDSKI: "The founder of the People's Party, Aslan Sefikurdski received his legal education at Kharkov and Petrograd universities. In Russia Aslan joined the revolutionary student strikes, for which he was expelled but was reinstated. His revolutionary sentiments made him a member of the Social Revolutionary Party. Returning to Azerbaijan, Sefikurdski worked as an assistant attorney at the court in Ganja, was one of the leaders of the Muslim Charitable Society, and later worked in the Shusha City Duma as a sworn representative.\n\nIn independent Azerbaijan, Sefikurdski became one of the leaders of the socialist faction in parliament and was even able to serve briefly as Minister of Justice and Labor until Musavat ceased cooperation with all socialist parties at the insistence of the German imperialists. After the split of the Socialist faction, Sefikurdski founded and led a new party, Khalqchi, taking inspiration from the Russian Social Revolutionaries. In stiff opposition to the Musavatists, Sefikurdski, together with the Hummetists, intended to put an end to the colonization of Azerbaijan and establish just reforms for peasants and workers."
POLITICS_AHMAD_PEPINOV: "Ahmad bey Pepinov, a graduate of the Law Faculty, returned to Baku after receiving higher education in 1918 and became actively involved in political events in the South Caucasus.\n\nPepinov actively participated in the activities of the parliament, speaking on behalf of the socialist faction he represented during the discussion of a number of important draft laws. Pepinov was directly involved in the organization of the Baku State University and made many efforts to accelerate the discussion of this issue in the Parliament and to allocate funds for the opening of the University. As secretary of the Majlis-Mabasan from December 1918 to April 1928, Pepinov won great popularity among the socialist-minded parties and became the main candidate for the presidency of the Hummet after the death of Samad aga Agamalioglu."
POLITICS_ABDULLAH_EFENDIZADE: "Abdullah bey Efendizade was born in Ganja into the family of a member of the Sunni spiritual assembly who was educated in the Ottoman Empire. This foreshadowed his future path as a teacher. From 1898 Efendizade taught in Baku, worked as principal and teacher in various schools, and drafted a new alphabet.\n\nHe was elected to the ADR parliament as a member of the "Ahrar" faction and later joined the newly formed party. As a parliamentarian, Efendizade worked in the commission on the alphabet reform, and in 1919 it was allowed to publish a textbook based on this alphabet. Efendizade paid much attention to the development of Azerbaijani culture and education, and in the second half of the 1930s he became the main presidential candidate of the Ahrar Party. His fame and popularity among Azerbaijanis of all ages enabled him to win the trust of parliament and be elected to the presidency."

POLITICS_QARA_QARABEYOV: "Qara Qarabeyli was a famous physician and revolutionary, now a leader of the Ittihad party. After graduating from the Shamkir German-Russian Lyceum, then the Tbilisi Gymnasium, Qara entered the medical faculty in Moscow, where he was soon convicted of \"revolutionary activity\" and served a year in prison. He worked in Moscow, then in Baku, but in 1906 was forced to leave Russia and immigrated to Iran to continue his revolutionary activities, then lived in Turkey and collaborated with the Young Turks.\n\nQarabeyli returned to Baku after the February Revolution, and at first participated in the work of the Hummet party, but on the petition of the Union party he joined it and headed the faction in the parliament, his membership was accepted unanimously. Throughout his political career he was a member of the Standing Committee on Legislation, Protection, Central Elections and Statutes, as well as of the Special Commission for the Selection of Students to Send Abroad and the Commission of Inquiry on the Qarabaqh Events.\n\nEven though Qarabeyli became disillusioned with the Musavatists during his long years in Parliament, he still stands for democracy and electability and calls for cooperation with Turkey and other Muslim brothers in the struggle against the European colonizers."

Despite staying as a faction of Hummet, the Kommunistlar consistently rejects any participation in parliamentary democratic politics and is trying to activize revolutionary sentiments in the masses, so far without success though.§!"

The first chairman of the party was Mir Hasan Vazirov, one of the Baku commissars. However, after the failure of the Baku Commune, the new leadership of the party - Habib Jebiyev and Ruhulla Akhundov faced low popularity among the working masses of Azerbaijanis as well as prohibition of their activities by the Musavatist government. The party stands on the positions of revolutionary socialism and Soviet power, conducting subversive activities against the democratic republic.§!"

As a result of disagreements, the Muslim Socialist Bloc disintegrated, and those who disagreed with the Social Democrats on the agrarian issue, under the leadership of Aslan bey Sefikurdski, founded the Azerbaijani Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, or Khalqchi Party. The party was created to unite the peasants, workers and the industrious, intelligent part of the population and to defend against counter-revolutionary forces within and outside Azerbaijan. It is the most leftist of the parties in the Majlis-Mabusan, but it is unlikely to gain a majority without allying the Hummet.§!"

Formally it appeared as a branch of the Baku Committee of the RSDRP, but in fact the party acted independently. In 1917 the party was split into 'Bolsheviks' and 'Mensheviks', but despite disagreements, the party elected a unified Central Committee, although the fact that the leftist faction ignored parliament led to their isolation. Hummet stands in general on internationalist and Russophile positions, criticizing Musavat for its national and economic policies, and is currently the main critic of the pro-German orientation, which has helped them to win the popularity of many Azerbaijanis who are dissatisfied with Musavat's policies.§!"

Weakened by political crises, the centrists seek the status quo and unification of the party. While advocating cooperation with Germany and Georgia, the centrist Musavatists are not ready to change anything, and this could lead to their eventual collapse.\nThe left 'Proletarian' wing of the party includes social democrats close to Gummet, led by Javad Malik-Yeganov.

With the fall of Musavat's popularity and authority among the Azerbaijani, Yusifbeyli understood that the party has a future without Musavat.

aze.1.t: "The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic"
aze.1.d: "Azerbaijan gained its independence on May 28, 1918, during the chaos of the Russian Civil War, after seceding from the short-lived Transcaucasian Federation. But unlike its neighbors, Georgia and Armenia, who had to give up some of their lands or lose their independence, Azerbaijan only gained. In June 1918 a treaty was signed with Turkey on the railroad and oil, and on June 26 the National Army was established. However, Azerbaijan was still unstable. In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, power belonged to the so-called \"Baku Commune\" - a group of Bolsheviks and Armenian Dashnaks. Already in July 1918, however, the power of the Bolsheviks fell, and the power went to the Tsentrokaspiy - the rule of the 5 Dictators, from the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.\n\nFinally, Baku was captured on September 15, 1918 by the Caucasian Islamic Army and the Azerbaijani National Council took its rightful place as the supreme authority in Azerbaijan, led by its chairman, Fatali Khan Khoyski.  On October 5, the oil was denationalized, and on November 19, the Azerbaijani Parliament - Majlis-Mabusan was convened.\n\nBut this was not the end of the era of chaos. Unresolved territorial disputes with Georgia and Armenia led Azerbaijan to fierce interethnic resistance. Throughout 1918 and 1919, Azerbaijani and Ottoman forces were embroiled in various border conflicts with Azerbaijan's neighbors - with Georgia over the Zakatala region and the Kura River valley, and with Armenia over Karabakh and Zangezur. To prevent escalation, the Caucasus Conference was convened at the initiative of Germany.\nThe Caucasus Conference ended largely in favor of Azerbaijan, satisfying all of its territorial claims and receiving a guarantee of independence from Germany and a huge flow of investments for the development of the economy.\n\nSince 1918 the liberal Musavatist party has held power in the republic, but the party has had to concede much to the opposition in recent years, and it is possible that it will have great difficulty winning the next elections."

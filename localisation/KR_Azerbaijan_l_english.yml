POLITICS_MAHAMMAD_RASULZADE: "Despite being born into a clergyman's family, Mahammad, or, simply, Mamed, received a secular education, and already in 1902 began his political life. Having founded the social-democratic organization \"Hummet\" in 1904, as the Baku branch of the Russian SDRP, Rasulzade actively cooperated with the Caucasian Bolsheviks and was under police surveillance in connection with his revolutionary activities. This forced him to leave his homeland and go abroad, but in 1913, after an amnesty, Mamed was able to return to Baku, leaving his old Hummet party to create a new one - Musavat, meaning 'Equality', becoming its head.\n\nMamed Amin headed the Azerbaijani National Council, which, under his leadership, adopted a declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. Soon peace was signed with the Ottoman Empire and with the support of Porta's army Baku was liberated from the socialists sitting there. Mamed Amin Rasulzade spoke at the opening of parliament and utters the famous phrase that has become the motto of independent Azerbaijan - \"Once raised the banner will never fall!\"\n\nIn subsequent years, Rasulzade was engaged in journalistic and social activities, nevertheless, he did not participate in the government until hard times hit Azerbaijan. Supported by Azerbaijan's first Prime Minister, now Foreign Minister, Fatali Khan Khoyski, and Rashid bey Akhundzade, prime-minister at that time, Mamed Amin becomes president - the head of state and \"face\" of Azerbaijan, a necessary man to rally the nation in difficult times. Under his symbolic leadership, it is to be hoped that bright times await Azerbaijan..."

POLITICS_ALSAN_SEFIKURDSKI: "The founder of the People's Party, Aslan Sefikurdski received his legal education at Kharkov and Petrograd universities. In Russia Aslan joined the revolutionary student strikes, for which he was expelled but was reinstated. His revolutionary sentiments made him a member of the Social Revolutionary Party. Returning to Azerbaijan, Sefikurdski worked as an assistant attorney at the court in Ganja, was one of the leaders of the Muslim Charitable Society, and later worked in the Shusha City Duma as a sworn representative.\n\nIn independent Azerbaijan, Sefikurdski became one of the leaders of the socialist faction in parliament and was even able to serve briefly as Minister of Justice and Labor until Musavat ceased cooperation with all socialist parties at the insistence of the German imperialists. After the split of the Socialist faction, Sefikurdski founded and led a new party, Khalqchi, taking inspiration from the Russian Social Revolutionaries. In stiff opposition to the Musavatists, Sefikurdski, together with the Hummetists, intended to put an end to the colonization of Azerbaijan and establish just reforms for peasants and workers."
POLITICS_AHMAD_PEPINOV: "Ahmad bey Pepinov, a graduate of the Law Faculty, returned to Baku after receiving higher education in 1918 and became actively involved in political events in the South Caucasus.\n\nPepinov actively participated in the activities of the parliament, speaking on behalf of the socialist faction he represented during the discussion of a number of important draft laws. Pepinov was directly involved in the organization of the Baku State University and made many efforts to accelerate the discussion of this issue in the Parliament and to allocate funds for the opening of the University. As secretary of the Majlis-Mabasan from December 1918 to April 1928, Pepinov won great popularity among the socialist-minded parties and became the main candidate for the presidency of the Hummet after the death of Samad aga Agamalioglu."
POLITICS_ABDULLAH_EFENDIZADE: "Abdullah bey Efendizade was born in Ganja into the family of a member of the Sunni spiritual assembly who was educated in the Ottoman Empire. This foreshadowed his future path as a teacher. From 1898 Efendizade taught in Baku, worked as principal and teacher in various schools, and drafted a new alphabet.\n\nHe was elected to the ADR parliament as a member of the "Ahrar" faction and later joined the newly formed party. As a parliamentarian, Efendizade worked in the commission on the alphabet reform, and in 1919 it was allowed to publish a textbook based on this alphabet. Efendizade paid much attention to the development of Azerbaijani culture and education, and in the second half of the 1930s he became the main presidential candidate of the Ahrar Party. His fame and popularity among Azerbaijanis of all ages enabled him to win the trust of parliament and be elected to the presidency."

POLITICS_QARA_QARABEYOV: "Qara Qarabeyli was a famous physician and revolutionary, now a leader of the Ittihad party. After graduating from the Shamkir German-Russian Lyceum, then the Tbilisi Gymnasium, Qara entered the medical faculty in Moscow, where he was soon convicted of \"revolutionary activity\" and served a year in prison. He worked in Moscow, then in Baku, but in 1906 was forced to leave Russia and immigrated to Iran to continue his revolutionary activities, then lived in Turkey and collaborated with the Young Turks.\n\nQarabeyli returned to Baku after the February Revolution, and at first participated in the work of the Hummet party, but on the petition of the Union party he joined it and headed the faction in the parliament, his membership was accepted unanimously. Throughout his political career he was a member of the Standing Committee on Legislation, Protection, Central Elections and Statutes, as well as of the Special Commission for the Selection of Students to Send Abroad and the Commission of Inquiry on the Qarabaqh Events.\n\nEven though Qarabeyli became disillusioned with the Musavatists during his long years in Parliament, he still stands for democracy and electability and calls for cooperation with Turkey and other Muslim brothers in the struggle against the European colonizers."

The first chairman of the party was Mir Hasan Vazirov, one of the Baku commissars. However, after the failure of the Baku Commune, the new leadership of the party - Habib Jebiyev and Ruhulla Akhundov faced low popularity among the working masses of Azerbaijanis as well as prohibition of their activities by the Musavatist government.

As a result of disagreements, the Muslim Socialist Bloc disintegrated, and those who disagreed with the Social Democrats on the agrarian issue, under the leadership of Aslan bey Sefikurdski, founded the Azerbaijani Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, or Khalqchi Party. The party was created to unite the peasants, workers and the industrious, intelligent part of the population and to defend against counter-revolutionary forces within and outside Azerbaijan.

In 1917 the party was split into 'Bolsheviks' and 'Mensheviks', but despite disagreements, the party elected a unified Central Committee, although the fact that the leftist faction ignored parliament led to their isolation. Hummet stands in general on internationalist and Russophile positions, criticizing Musavat for its national and economic policies, and is currently the main critic of the pro-German orientation, which has helped them to win the popularity of many Azerbaijanis who are dissatisfied with Musavat's policies.§!"

aze.1.t: "The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic"
aze.1.d: "Azerbaijan gained its independence on May 28, 1918, during the chaos of the Russian Civil War, after seceding from the short-lived Transcaucasian Federation. But unlike its neighbors, Georgia and Armenia, who had to give up some of their lands or lose their independence, Azerbaijan only gained. In June 1918 a treaty was signed with Turkey on the railroad and oil, and on June 26 the National Army was established. However, Azerbaijan was still unstable. In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, power belonged to the so-called \"Baku Commune\" - a group of Bolsheviks and Armenian Dashnaks. Already in July 1918, however, the power of the Bolsheviks fell, and the power went to the Tsentrokaspiy - the rule of the 5 Dictators, from the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.\n\nFinally, Baku was captured on September 15, 1918 by the Caucasian Islamic Army and the Azerbaijani National Council took its rightful place as the supreme authority in Azerbaijan, led by its chairman, Fatali Khan Khoyski.  On October 5, the oil was denationalized, and on November 19, the Azerbaijani Parliament - Majlis-Mabusan was convened.\n\nBut this was not the end of the era of chaos. Unresolved territorial disputes with Georgia and Armenia led Azerbaijan to fierce interethnic resistance. Throughout 1918 and 1919, Azerbaijani and Ottoman forces were embroiled in various border conflicts with Azerbaijan's neighbors - with Georgia over the Zakatala region and the Kura River valley, and with Armenia over Karabakh and Zangezur. To prevent escalation, the Caucasus Conference was convened at the initiative of Germany.\nThe Caucasus Conference ended largely in favor of Azerbaijan, satisfying all of its territorial claims and receiving a guarantee of independence from Germany and a huge flow of investments for the development of the economy.\n\nSince 1918 the liberal Musavatist party has held power in the republic, but the party has had to concede much to the opposition in recent years, and it is possible that it will have great difficulty winning the next elections."

In addition to the physical distance between us, German dominance and their colonial ambitions have also served as a significant obstacle to our relations. While the Azerbaijani government undoubtedly benefited from this situation, the majority of our Russian oil companies and enterprises were either acquired at a pittance or found themselves in a state of clear oppression and injustice.\n\nWith the Kaiser's influence in the Caucasus waning, the Azerbaijani have chosen to strike a deal. They propose to join the Rostorg, allowing us to reap enhanced dividends from their burgeoning oil industry while simultaneously contributing to their growth through our investments. However, there are those among the radicals who insist that Azerbaijan must concede significant advantages to this partnership, such as preferential treatment for Russian companies, particularly the Russian General Oil Corporation, which will essentially monopolize the Baku oil market in our favor."

aze.115.d: "A delegation from distant Azerbaijan has arrived in The Hague today with an unexpected but highly lucrative offer for trade. Royal Dutch Shell has been engaged in oil production in Azerbaijan since the early years of the century, when it was still part of the Russian Empire. However, after the Weltkrieg, German influence in the region significantly increased, with some of our oil companies being acquired by Deutsche Petroleum Werkaufsgesellschaft. The other part continued operating, but in a far more competitive and challenging environment.\n\nAs a result, our earnings from oil production in Azerbaijan became insignificant compared to other regions. We even considered shutting down Royal Dutch Shell operations in Azerbaijan following the Black Monday. Nonetheless, Azerbaijan now offers us an extraordinary opportunity — a kind of restart for our oil business. If we invest in their oil industry, Azerbaijan will be able to increase its oil production. This will be achieved through the nationalization of some foreign enterprises and the conclusion of new concession agreements, including those for production in the Caspian Sea. Failure to do so would likely result in Azerbaijan having to purchase our enterprises at a low cost."

aze.116.a: "We hope for a fruitful cooperation."

aze.117.t: "Failure of the Negotiations"
aze.117.d: "Regrettably, our discussions with the Dutch government regarding the future of Royal Dutch Shell have proven futile.

This aspiration is commendable, yet it raises certain considerations. The last instance of such collaboration occurred in 1918, resulting in the disintegration of the frontline and the occupation not only of Transcaucasia but also of the Mountainous Republic by Ottoman forces. Only through the intervention of Germany was the independence of our nations preserved.\n\nFurthermore, there are disputes over territories that Azerbaijan claims for itself. It is imperative that we insist on the return of these territories, particularly our historic city of Derbent."

As Minister of Foreign Affairs Fatali Khan-Khoyski was leaving the Council of Ministers on the Parliament Street, a bomb detonated near his motorcade. The explosion tore through the car, killing Khan-Khoyski and two of his aides instantly.\n\nWithin hours, the investigation identified the culprit — an Armenian conspirator, long suspected of ties to the remnants of the so-called \"Republic of Mountainous Armenia\". The device was likely assembled in Goris, smuggled into the city through merchant contacts.\n\nNews of the assassination spread rapidly. Crowds gathered before the State Opera House and the Parliament, chanting Khoyski’s name and calling for revenge. From the oil fields to the universities, from workers to officers, a single word echoes across the republic: justice.\n\nThe government declared a day of mourning — and a state of emergency in the districts bordering Garabagh. While official statements call for calm, there is little doubt that the attack has lit the fuse of a long-suppressed fury."

Evidence gathered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Gendarmerie confirms what many feared — the attack was coordinated from the insurgent-held territories of Garabagh and Zangezur, where Armenian guerilla formations continue to operate under the banners of the so-called Republic of Mountainous Armenia.\n\nIn an emergency session of the Cabinet, Prime Minister Rashid Akhundzade declared that the patience of the Republic has limits. Orders have been issued for the military to restore full control over the western districts. The General Staff, led by General Habib Bey Salimov, has begun mobilizing reserve units in Ganja and Yevlakh.\n\nAcross the nation, public outrage has turned into fervent calls for retribution. Yet not all within the government are united — liberals warn of German and Ottoman disapproval, while the army and nationalists insist that Garabagh must be cleansed once and for all."

The attackers, armed with rifles and explosives, vanished into the hills after destroying the lead truck. Several soldiers were killed, their bodies mutilated and paraded in a nearby Armenian village — a brutal message from the guerrillas under Garegin Nzdeh.\n\nThe streets of Baku buzz with alarm as citizens demand swift justice, while newspapers fill their columns with outrage. Opposition deputies accuse the government of inaction, calling Musavat blind and complacent. Military officers whisper in barracks and cafés that the patience of the army is near its limit."

German shareholders have already dispatched urgent telegrams to Baku, demanding the protection of their assets and warning of dire consequences if such attacks continue.\n\nIn the cafés, markets, and streets of Baku some whisper of Armenian guerrillas under Garegin Nzdeh, while others point fingers at corrupt officials and bureaucratic negligence."

Local peasants fled their homes, fearful of reprisals from either side. In Baku, the press is divided. While \"Achyg Soz\" calls for decisive action and full mobilization, deputies of Ahrar and Hummet urge caution.

Smoke rises from the hills as frightened villagers flee toward the city.\n\nIn Baku, news of the attack sparks outrage. Opposition from the Geyrat and Ittihad demand decisive retaliation, while liberals argue for restraint and diplomacy.

Once the seat of the short-lived Republic of Aras under Jafargulu Khan Nakhchivanski, the region is now fully reintegrated into the Azerbaijani state. Yet the echoes of past autonomy linger: local notables and former officers still wield influence, and the people remember the hardships of border life.\n\nRecent reports speak of renewed raids by Armenian insurgents spilling over from Garabagh into the southern passes. Villages near Ordubad and Sharur are on edge, and merchants report disrupted trade. The Ministry of Interior warns that while the army is stretched thin in Karabagh, unrest in Nakhchivan could spark wider discontent. Meanwhile, whispers suggest that Ottoman advisors stationed in the region are pressing for a more assertive military presence, fearing that any instability could threaten their interests."

azeterror.13.d: "As the conflict in the Highland Karabakh region of Azerbaijan continues to escalate, Germany has attempted to exert pressure on Baku by advocating for a ceasefire. However, [AZE.GetName] has steadfastly refused to acquiesce to these demands, likely due to the repeated same concessions made by the ruling Musavat Party over the last 20 years, which have eroded its popularity and allowed Armenian nationalists to consolidate their influence.\n\nIn light of this, Germany has now turned to us for mediation, seeking our assistance in influencing the Musavatist leadership in Baku. This presents a unique opportunity for our government to enhance our position in the Caucasus region. We can endeavor to negotiate our own terms with Azerbaijan, potentially securing access to its resources and drawing it into our orbit of influence.\n\nNevertheless, we cannot match the level of commitment offered by the European hegemon. Moreover, there is a segment of the nationalist movement within our own country that views Azerbaijan as a mere fragment of our Empire, rather than a sovereign nation. It is possible that our true dominion over the Caucasus lies not in confrontation with Berlin, but rather in cooperation with it."

The situation is becoming increasingly tense, with Ottoman diplomats subtly insinuating that rejecting the generous offer extended by the great powers is untenable.

However, the Ottomans have proposed cooperation with us instead. Their terms are straightforward: they are willing to support our efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the matter with the Nzdeh's terrorists, in return for investments and preferential treatment in trade in oil with us.\n\nWhile this development may cause a diplomatic incident, the prospect of uniting with our Turkic brethren and a clear ally in the Caucasus is undoubtedly gratifying, despite the fact that their economy, which is already struggling, may not be as valuable to us as that of Germany."

Azerbaijani troops, hardened by the mountain campaign, report that organized resistance has all but vanished. The villages once flying insurgent banners now stand eerily quiet. The once-frequent ambushes and sabotage of supply columns have ceased.\n\nIntelligence reports suggest that Garegin Nzhdeh, the elusive leader of the rebellion, has fled with a small band of loyalists into the highlands or possibly across the border into Persia. The remaining partisan cells have dissolved into the forests, blending among the peasantry or dispersing toward Zangezur and Nakhchivan.\n\nYet, for all the outward calm, the wounds of the conflict are deep. Many districts lie half-ruined, and whispers of revenge still echo in the hills. Local officials warn that the spirit of revolt lingers beneath the surface — dormant, not extinguished. The government celebrates a hard-fought victory, but among weary soldiers and refugees, the mood is somber."

The new government inherits not only a war-torn province, but a question that has haunted the republic since its birth — how to integrate the Armenian population, now broken and distrustful, into the Azerbaijani state.\n\nThe military governors warn that any leniency will only invite renewed trouble. In their view, the mountains must be held with a firm hand and the local councils purged of disloyal elements. Others — particularly within the liberal Ahrar and moderate Musavat circles — argue that peace cannot last without some measure of reconciliation, perhaps even limited cultural autonomy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Hummet deputies demand that the state address the root causes: poverty, exploitation, and inequality. They insist that true loyalty will come only from justice, not bayonets. The Geyrat and Ittihad factions denounce such talk as naïve — for them, national unity must come before all else, even if it means permanent military rule in the region."

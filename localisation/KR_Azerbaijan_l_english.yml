POLITICS_MAHAMMAD_RASULZADE: "Despite being born into a clergyman's family, Mahammad, or, simply, Mamed, received a secular education, and already in 1902 began his political life. Having founded the social-democratic organization \"Hummet\" in 1904, as the Baku branch of the Russian SDRP, Rasulzade actively cooperated with the Caucasian Bolsheviks and was under police surveillance in connection with his revolutionary activities. This forced him to leave his homeland and go abroad, but in 1913, after an amnesty, Mamed was able to return to Baku, leaving his old Hummet party to create a new one - Musavat, meaning 'Equality', becoming its head.\n\nMamed Amin headed the Azerbaijani National Council, which, under his leadership, adopted a declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. Soon peace was signed with the Ottoman Empire and with the support of Porta's army Baku was liberated from the socialists sitting there. Mamed Amin Rasulzade spoke at the opening of parliament and utters the famous phrase that has become the motto of independent Azerbaijan - \"Once raised the banner will never fall!\"\n\nIn subsequent years, Rasulzade was engaged in journalistic and social activities, nevertheless, he did not participate in the government until hard times hit Azerbaijan. Supported by Azerbaijan's first Prime Minister, now Foreign Minister, Fatali Khan Khoyski, and Rashid bey Akhundzade, prime-minister at that time, Mamed Amin becomes president - the head of state and \"face\" of Azerbaijan, a necessary man to rally the nation in difficult times. Under his symbolic leadership, it is to be hoped that bright times await Azerbaijan..."

POLITICS_ALSAN_SEFIKURDSKI: "The founder of the People's Party, Aslan Sefikurdski received his legal education at Kharkov and Petrograd universities. In Russia Aslan joined the revolutionary student strikes, for which he was expelled but was reinstated. His revolutionary sentiments made him a member of the Social Revolutionary Party. Returning to Azerbaijan, Sefikurdski worked as an assistant attorney at the court in Ganja, was one of the leaders of the Muslim Charitable Society, and later worked in the Shusha City Duma as a sworn representative. \n\nIn independent Azerbaijan, Sefikurdski became one of the leaders of the socialist faction in parliament and was even able to serve briefly as Minister of Justice and Labor until Musavat ceased cooperation with all socialist parties at the insistence of the German imperialists. After the split of the Socialist faction, Sefikurdski founded and led a new party, Khalqchi, taking inspiration from the Russian Social Revolutionaries. In stiff opposition to the Musavatists, Sefikurdski, together with the Hummetists, intended to put an end to the colonization of Azerbaijan and establish just reforms for peasants and workers."
POLITICS_AHMAD_PEPINOV: "Akhmed bey Pepinov, a graduate of the Law Faculty, returned to Baku after receiving higher education in 1918 and became actively involved in political events in the South Caucasus.\n\nPepinov actively participated in the activities of the parliament, speaking on behalf of the socialist faction he represented during the discussion of a number of important draft laws. Pepinov was directly involved in the organization of the Baku State University and made many efforts to accelerate the discussion of this issue in the Parliament and to allocate funds for the opening of the University. As secretary of the Majlis-Mabasan from December 1918 to April 1928, Pepinov won great popularity among the socialist-minded parties and became the main candidate for the presidency of the Hummet after the death of Samad aga Agamalioglu"
POLITICS_ABDULLAH_EFENDIZADE: "Abdullah bey Efendizade was born in Ganja into the family of a member of the Sunni spiritual assembly who was educated in the Ottoman Empire. This foreshadowed his future path as a teacher. From 1898 Efendizade taught in Baku, worked as principal and teacher in various schools, and drafted a new alphabet.\n\nHe was elected to the ADR parliament as a member of the "Ahrar" faction and later joined the newly formed party. As a parliamentarian, Efendizade worked in the commission on the alphabet reform, and in 1919 it was allowed to publish a textbook based on this alphabet. Efendizade paid much attention to the development of Azerbaijani culture and education, and in the second half of the 1930s he became the main presidential candidate of the Ahrar Party. His fame and popularity among Azerbaijanis of all ages enabled him to win the trust of parliament and be elected to the presidency."

POLITICS_QARA_QARABEYOV: "Qara Qarabeyli was a famous physician and revolutionary, now a leader of the Ittihad party. After graduating from the Shamkir German-Russian Gymnasium, then the Tbilisi Gymnasium, Qara entered the medical faculty in Moscow, where he was soon convicted of \"revolutionary activity\" and served a year in prison. He worked in Moscow, then in Baku, but in 1906 was forced to leave Russia and immigrated to Iran to continue his revolutionary activities, then lived in Turkey and collaborated with the Young Turks.\n\nQarabeyli returned to Baku after the February Revolution, and at first participated in the work of the Hummet party, but on the petition of the Union party he joined it and headed the faction in the parliament, his membership was accepted unanimously. Throughout his political career he was a member of the Standing Committee on Legislation, Protection, Central Elections and Statutes, as well as of the Special Commission for the Selection of Students to Send Abroad and the Commission of Inquiry on the Qarabaqh Events.\n\nEven though Qarabeyli became disillusioned with the Musavatists during his long years in Parliament, he still stands for democracy and electability and calls for cooperation with Turkey and other Muslim brothers in the struggle against the European colonizers."

### Parties ###
AZE_totalist_party: "Hummet (Kommunistlar)"
AZE_totalist_party_long: "Sosial Demokrat Müselman Tashkilati \"Hümmet\"\n§LMuslim Social Democratic Party \"Endeavor\" - Communist Wing§!\n§gThe left, mostly Bolshevist wing of the Hummet under leadership of Aliheydar Garayev barely holds any significant influence among the Azerbaijani workers and peasants. Despite staying as a faction of Hummet, the Kommunistlar consistently rejects any participation in parliamentary democratic politics and is trying to activize revolutionary sentiments in the masses, so far without success though.§!"
AZE_syndicalist_party: "Akinchi"
AZE_syndicalist_party_long: "Akinchi Partiyasi\n§LPeasant Party§!\n§gThe Akinchi Party arose as a Muslim branch of the Russian Party of Left Socialist Revolutionaries, and from March 1918 became known under its current name. The first chairman of the party was Mir Hasan Vazirov, one of the Baku commissars. However, after the failure of the Baku Commune, the new leadership of the party - Habib Jebiyev and Ruhulla Akhundov faced low popularity among the working masses of Azerbaijanis as well as prohibition of their activities by the Musavatist government. The party stands on the positions of revolutionary socialism and Soviet power, conducting subversive activities against the democratic republic.§!"
AZE_radical_socialist_party: "Khalqchi"
AZE_radical_socialist_party_long: "Khalqchi Partiyasi - Azerbayjan Sosialist Inqilabchilar Partiyasi\n§LPeople's Party - Party of Azerbaijan Socialists-Revolutionaries§!\n§gThe Khalqchi Party is the rightful successor to the Muslim Socialist Bloc, an influential and organizationally strong political party that participated in the Russian Constituent Assembly. As a result of disagreements, the Muslim Socialist Bloc disintegrated, and those who disagreed with the Social Democrats on the agrarian issue, under the leadership of Aslan bey Sefikurdski, founded the Azerbaijani Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, or Khalqchi Party. The party was created to unite the peasants, workers and the industrious, intelligent part of the population and to defend against counter-revolutionary forces within and outside Azerbaijan. It is the most leftist of the parties in the Majlis-Mabusan, but it is unlikely to gain a majority without allying the Hummet.§!"
AZE_social_democrat_party: "Hummet"
AZE_social_democrat_party_long: "Sosial Demokrat Müselman Tashkilati \"Hümmet\"\n§LMuslim Social Democratic Party \"Endeavor\"§!\n§gProudly bearing the title of the first national social-democratic organization in the entire Islamic world, the Hummet Party was founded in 1904 on the initiative of the Azerbaijani democratic intelligentsia. Formally it appeared as a branch of the Baku Committee of the RSDRP, but in fact the party acted independently. In 1917 the party was split into 'Bolsheviks' and 'Mensheviks', but despite disagreements, the party elected a unified Central Committee, although the fact that the leftist faction ignored parliament led to their isolation. Hummet stands in general on internationalist and Russophile positions, criticizing Musavat for its national and economic policies, and is currently the main critic of the pro-German orientation, which has helped them to win the popularity of many Azerbaijanis who are dissatisfied with Musavat's policies.§!"
AZE_social_liberal_party: "Ahrar"
AZE_social_liberal_party_long: "Ahrar Firqasi\n§LLiberal Party§!\n§gFounded in Baku in the fall of 1918 by Aslan bey Kardashov, the Ahrar party became in opposition to the Musavatist government. Ahrar advocated demands for the distribution of landed estates among the peasants in connection with the agrarian reform, and other social guarantees for workers and peasants, which brought them closer to Hummet, and also advocated the establishment and development of friendly relations with neighboring republics, paying particular attention to the importance of protecting the independence and rights of all Caucasian peoples.§!"
AZE_market_liberal_party: "Musavat"
AZE_market_liberal_party_long: "Müselman Demokrat Partiyasi \"Müsavat\"\n§LMuslim Democratic Party \"Equality\"§!\n§gThe liberal Musavat party had a majority in parliament until the last election, but the years after the crisis revolution have shattered it, dividing it into factions and forcing it into disadvantageous coalitions. Musavat is supported by the petty bourgeoisie, the nationalist intelligentsia, and parts of the peasantry, but the growing polarization in society has forced many to withdraw their support for Musavat in favor of other movements.\nThe centrist majority of the party is the faction of the current Azerbaijani president, Mamed Amin Rasulzade. Weakened by political crises, the centrists seek the status quo and unification of the party. While advocating cooperation with Germany and Georgia, the centrist Musavatists are not ready to change anything, and this could lead to their eventual collapse.\nThe left 'Proletarian' wing of the party includes social democrats close to Hummet, led by Javad Malik-Yeganov. They represent Azerbaijan's trade union movement and seek to resolve conflicts between workers and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe party's right wing includes liberal nationalists close to Ittihad, led by Behbud Khan Javanshir. In response to the left wing formed in Musavat, Javanshir, director of a large oil company, created a serious platform together with Qarabeyli, head of Ittihad.§!"
AZE_social_conservative_party: "Geyrat"
AZE_social_conservative_party_long: "Türk Adami-Markaziyyat Firqasi\n§LTurkic Party of Decentralisation§!\n§gShortly known as Qeyrat or Geyrat (Honour), the Turkic Party of Decentralisation was once known as a Socialist-Federalist party during its first establishment. However, as the party was revived in 1917 by Nasib bey Yusifbeyli, they have united with Musavatists into a single liberal-conservative party, with Geyrat becoming its right-wing. With the fall of Musavat's popularity and authority among the Azerbaijani, Yusifbeyli understood that the party has a future without Musavat. Promoting pan-Turkic ideology, the new Geyrat is a serious opponent both to Musavatists and Ittihadists, as it seeks to establish itself as the true successor of Musavat's lost legacy.§!"
AZE_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Ittihad"
AZE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Qafqaz Ittihad Firqasi\n§LCaucasus Unity Party§!\n§gThe Islamist Ittihad party, founded in September 1917, has been the main opposition party in parliament throughout its existence. Although Qara Qarabeyli is considered by many to be the founder of the party, he joined it in 1918 by special invitation. Despite the polarization and split of the party into conservative and radical branches, the concentration of the party around a single ideology led to the growth of its popularity and development. Already by January 1920 Ittihad had more than 600 local branches and 30 major committees. The ideological basis of the party was Islamic modernism and Islamic reformism, but the main line was ideal Islam - the principle of returning to the traditions of the time of the Prophet Muhammad. Ittihad is radically opposed to colonialism, but sees the reasons for the transformation of Muslim countries into colonies in the general decline of the Islamic world, its cultural, economic and political backwardness. Once in power, Ittihad guarantees progressive social reforms and cooperation with the Turk brothers instead of the imperialists.§!"

The main activity of this organization is agitation in mosques, teahouses and other public places, which boiled down to the idea of unity of Muslims regardless of their belonging to Shiites or Sunnis and rendering all possible assistance to Turkey. Standing on strong pro-Ottoman positions, the party dreams of becoming part of the Caliphate as its legitimate part.§!"

Moreover, most of the extracted oil is transfered to the Kaiserreich. In an age in which the consumption of oil is becoming the dominant need of both industrial society and of modern warfare, Azerbaijan is increasingly finding herself the battleground of both corporate and national foreign interests."

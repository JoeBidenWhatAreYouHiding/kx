### Ideas ###
GAL_karol_olbracht:0 "Cesarski Namiestnik Karol Olbracht"
GAL_karol_olbracht_desc:0 "Karol Olbracht Habsburg-Lotaryński, although Austrian by birth, is a stalwart advocate for the Poles within the Empire. Having inherited both his title and fascination with all things Polish from his father Karol Stefan, the most legitimate claimant to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, Karol Olbracht is in a perfect position to become a beloved and fair King to his newly adopted subjects, but that is a task far easier said than done. With the Regency in eternal deadlock, he patiently waits in Galicia as its Imperial Governor, the second most powerful position in the constituent realm and a position only legally subservient to the National Governor elected by the Sejm. With these powers, Karol Olbracht has tried everything that he can to make Galicia a better place for his subjects, and this effort has paid dividends for both the welfare of the Galician population as well as his popularity with their masses."
GAL_golicja_glodomeria:0 "Golicja i Głodomeria"
GAL_golicja_glodomeria_desc:0 "The fools in Vienna have not invested in the region for decades, and this destitute reality shows gravely. Currently, Galicia stands as one of the poorest regions in wider Europe, and as the most impoverished constituent realm within the Habsburg Empire. This reality has become an unshakable reputation, with Poles from other regions jokingly referring to Galicia and Lodomeria as 'Golicja i Glodomeria', literally translating to 'Nakedia and Hungria' or more poetically, the Lands of the Naked and Hungry. This reality must be undone and through any means necessary, for our impoverished land must finally be able to feed and clothe our poor masses."
GAL_rural_society:0 "Rural Society"
GAL_rural_society_desc:0 "Wider Galician society largely consists of peasants and smallholders - a reality of tradition that has lasted for centuries in this near-idyllic rural ‘paradise’. Although the majority of the inhabitants live in scattered villages, the fragmentary nature of the population’s distribution has ensured that despite a largely agrarian socioeconomic system, most domestic agriculture is not very profitable. This harsh reality must be undone, for although we shall always be tied to the land, we are not destined to wallow in the mud."
GAL_minority_unrest:0 "Restless Minorities"
GAL_minority_unrest_desc:0 "Galicia is a land deeply divided on both ethnic and religious grounds. The largest religious group in the nation are the Roman Catholics, with nearly half of all ‘Galicians’ - mostly Poles and a small but vocal group of Austrian settlers - bowing to the Pope in Rome. Rivaling the Roman Catholics in size and influence while also bowing to the Roman Pope are the Greek Catholics, making up roughly 42% of the population compared to the 46% dominated by the Roman Catholics. Most of these Byzantine Catholics describe themselves as Ukrainians or Ruthenians (sometimes contrasting both terms), but many others instead refer to themselves as merely 'tutejsi' or locals - a novel idea in the ethnic mixing pot that is Galicia. \n\nNot to be forgotten and certainly not unheard, the Jewish population also constitutes a significant proportion of the population, dominating the non-Christian minorities and further adding to ethno-religious tensions. Fueling these fires further, Poles have held near complete power within the constituency since the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which has only intensified tensions between the bickering groups. Galicia is a box full of varied tinder ready to burn, with varied local and foreign forces both working to control the burn or let it run wild, with the very destiny of Galicia hanging in the balance."
GAL_shattered_unity:0 "Shattered Political Unity"
GAL_shattered_unity_desc:0 "With the failure of a broad political front in the days of the Great War, and with the continued domination of foreign powers over the local Polish population, Galician politics are in utter shambles. At present, confidence in Vienna is shaky at best, even though almost all legal political parties declare their support for the monarchy and despite much of the masses loving or at least tolerating Karol Olbracht. The ruling Polish People's Party and its leader Wincenty Witos are as much loved as they are despised by the general population, with the split being most apparent between the rural and urban populations. For now, it remains unclear if this agrarian-minded party of farmers can save itself from the abyss of Galician politics, or will Galicia itself succumb to its inner turmoil."

GAL_tough_year:0 "Another Tough Year in Galicia"
GAL_tough_year_desc:0 "The Years haven't been kind to poor old Galicia, a land plagued by poverty, strife and crisis. Sadly 1936 seems to be the same as every other year, despite governing agrarians best efforts to change that. At least it cannot get any worse."
GAL_downwards_spiral:0 "The Constituent Spirals Down"
GAL_downwards_spiral_desc:0 "Black Monday has proven to be the final kick to cause the crumbling structure of Austria's most devolved constituent to fall. People are rioting in the streets, factories are closing and farmers are burning their unsellable stocks. We cannot allow this to be the end."
GAL_calm_minorities:0 "Calm the Ethno-Religious Minorities"
GAL_calm_minorities_desc:0 "Galicia is a home to many minorities, the vast amount of them seeing the continued Polish political dominance as the main cause of the current crisis. If the land is to be held together and not fracture into sectarian violence we must calm them, especially in regions in which minorities form a majority in terms of numbers."
GAL_another_committee:0 "Another Supreme National Committee?"
GAL_another_committee_desc:0 "The Supreme National Committee, created to be a broad political front uniting all the political options during the Great War, ended as a failure, dividing the already fragile Galicia even more. Perhaps in the lack of any other options a second committee could be formed, hopefully with better results this time."
GAL_call_gentry:0 "Call on Ziemiaństwo"
GAL_call_gentry_desc:0 "Ziemiaństwo are the group of landed gentry, which inherited its land and manors from generation to another generation. Many of them are descendants from Commonwealth's szlachta itself. In those dire times we have to call upon them for help in saving their less fortunate brothers."
GAL_emergency_peasant:0 "Emergency Peasant Relief"
GAL_emergency_peasant_desc:0 "As more funds are gathered thanks to generous gentry as well as rich citizens we can start a programme of emergency relief. Its main goal will be to ease the burdens of our peasants, caused by the Black Monday."
GAL_contact_vienna:0 "Contact Vienna"
GAL_contact_vienna_desc:0 "While the government in Vienna, especially the bureaucrats, are not seen favourably in recent years we could still use their help in dealing with the economic downturn. Its high time someone sent an urgent telegram to the capital."
GAL_trust_market:0 "Trust the Market"
GAL_trust_market_desc:0 "After we accepted the help of Vienna and KSE the School has convinced the Sejm to implement some early pro-market policies. Hopefully the invisible hand can pick up the shattered economy of Galicia."
GAL_sell_oil:0 "Sell Off Oil Supply"
GAL_sell_oil_desc:0 "With the outreach to Vienna becoming another failure of the ruling government there is nothing else we can do. The oil supplies gathered from Borysław and Drohobycz fields has to be inspected and then sold to heal the sick economy."
GAL_special_elections:0 "Announce Special Election"
GAL_special_elections_desc:0 "Seeing as no other parties are ready to stand up and work together to overcome the crisis, Wincenty Witos has decided to ask Namiestnik Olbracht to announce a special election to be hold as soon as the time allows. The people need to decide who they trust to ensure Galicia's renewed prosperity."

### Decisions ###

### Events ###

gal.0.t:0 "In the Throes of Collapse"
gal.0.d:0 "The Habsburg Empire has collapsed. Its minorities fight and vie for land once ruled by the black-and-yellow banner. Without the House of Habsburg Galicia-Lodomeria is almost nothing, no national identity; Galicia is in a state of anarchy between Poles, Ukrainians, and Romanians. No doubt the collapse of the Empire will pick from us too."
gal.0.a:0 "Such is life..."

gal.1.t:0 "Galicia and Lodomeria Becomes Independent"
gal.1.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia Lodomeria sees herself independent. But we are a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours - and maybe we would do good seeking protection from Poland, the nation our territory has been taken from all these years ago."
gal.1.a:0 "Ask to formally join Poland. (Game Over)"
gal.1.b:0 "Galicia shall remain independent."

gal.2.t:0 "Galicia Seeks to Join Our Nation"
gal.2.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia Lodomeria sees herself independent. But being a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours, the newly independent nation feels her very existence threatened. A diplomatic envoy arrived today to discuss an incorporation of Galicia into Polish territory."
gal.2.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers."

gal.3.t:0 "Claiming the Bucovina"
gal.3.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, its southernmost province, the Bucovina, is home to many Romanians. Given the current confusion within the territory, we could relatively easily seize it in a swift manoeuvre."
gal.3.a:0 "Let us free our brothers."
gal.3.b:0 "Provoking the Poles is not wise."

gal.4.t:0 "Claiming East Galicia"
gal.4.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, the East is home to mostly Ukrainians. Given the current confusion within the territory, we could relatively easily seize it in a swift manoeuvre."
gal.4.a:0 "Let us free our brothers."
gal.4.b:0 "Provoking the Poles is not wise."

gal.5.t:0 "Romania Has Marched into the Bucovina"
gal.5.d:0 "An incorporation of a territory as large as Galicia was never expected to go smoothly. However what wasn't expected was meddling from the outside - Romanian troops have marched into the largely Romanian-speaking territory Bucovina, claiming the state as their own. Officials of the former Galician government have urged us to intervene."
gal.5.a:0 "This shall not stand. Retake what is ours!"
gal.5.b:0 "Let the Romanians have what speaks Romanian."

gal.6.t:0 "The Ukraine Has Seized Eastern Galicia"
gal.6.d:0 "Kraków and Lwów are the most important cities of Galicia. The integration of the former has gone smoothly over the run of the last week, however the inhabitants of the mostly Ruthenian-speaking territories surrounding Lwów have, with aid of the Ukrainian military, seized the city. The city of Lwów is too important for Poland to just let it fall into the hands of another country."
gal.6.a:0 "This shall not stand. Retake what is ours!"
gal.6.b:0 "Ruthenians aren't Poles anyway."

gal.7.t:0 "Karl Albrecht Elected as King of Poland"
gal.7.d:0 "The current Governor of Galicia and Lodomeria, Karl Albrecht von Habsburg, has just been elected as the new King of Poland after an intensely contested vote. Karl Albrecht is expected to leave the nation early tomorrow to take up his new position as leader of the Polish people, and has left Jozef Haller von Hallenburg in charge of Galicia in his absence."
gal.7.a:0 "Wish him luck."

gal.10.t:0 "Dark Clouds Over the Kingdom, Galicia in 1936"
gal.10.d:0 "The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and the Grand Duchy of Kraków with the Duchies of Auschwitz and Zator, also known simply as Galicia or Austrian Poland, was established in 1772 as a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland. After initially strong Germanization, in 1861 Galicia gained autonomy with the national parliament and the government in the capital city of Lviv. In 1867, with the establishment of a dualistic monarchy, the provincial autonomy was extended. The Austrian government guaranteed that governors would be appointed from among local Poles. The local parliament 'Sejm Krajowy' had the right to pass laws on the national economy, communication, education and health.\n\n Thanks to its extensive autonomy, Galicia became the center of the Polish independence movement. Many Polish political parties and paramilitary organizations operated here, which formed the basis of the Legions created at the beginning of the 20th century. The armed organizations established during the war, however, did not achieve their goal of winning the independence or the unification of Galician lands with Congress Kingom nor with the lands held by the German Empire.\n\n After Karl I was enthroned as the next Emperor of Austria, lands of Galicia were given an even greater degree of autonomy. Thanks to the creation of the office of Cesarsk Namiestnik (Imperial Governor), who could assume most of the rights and responsibilities of the Emperor in Vienna, Galicia could be run mostly by the Namiestnik Krajowy and the Sejm of Galicia.\n\n Yet even with the extensive autonomy the lands of Galicia are torn by ethnic strife, radical political movements, government's lack of support from other parties and rampant poverty. If the situation doesn't improve soon enough this land might devolve into a hell on earth, which is exactly what the Vienna Government as well as the current governing PSL want to avoid."
gal.10.a:0 "We shall endure."

gal.12.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Galicia!"
gal.12.d:0 "The fears of many have been finally realized. The general economic downturn exploded into a crash never seen before in the current age. The German economy collapsing took with itself every other nation invested in it, including Austria and by proxy Galicia. With Black Monday's effects raging on all around us we have to do something quick to save the already ailing nation."
gal.12.a:0 "We are doomed!"

gal.13.t:0 "A Temporary Agreement?"
gal.13.d:0 "Defying the expectations of everyone inside the ruling party, no other political force agreed to an alliance in the light of recent spiral Galicia has entered. Citing the failure of the previous Supreme National Committee formed during the war as well as the inability of PSL's government to keep Galicia out of the economic chaos, various parties have announced that they shall run candidates directly against Witos in any future election. Thus both socialist and conservatives have put an end to any hopes for a broad front inside the Sejm."
gal.13.a:0 "Curses!"

gal.14.t:0 "Imperial Demands"
gal.14.d:0 "Our urgent telegram to Vienna was answered with a demand unexpected by many. His Imperial and Royal Majesty's government agreed to send us much needed funds, on one condition that is. The Kraków School of Economics, one of the most loyal groups inside Galicia, is to be allowed inside the Sejm to institute some early recovery policies. The bureaucrats in the capital might hope that this will allow the School to gather enough popular support to run in any future election, and win."
gal.14.a:0 "We have no other choice."
gal.14.b:0 "Damn those bureaucrats, we won't allow that."

gal.15.t:0 "Snap Election"
gal.15.d:0 "Seeing no other option to maintain control, Witos has called for a snap election to the National Sejm, which Governor Karol Olbracth allowed. Having lost much of its previous support PSL stands in a perilous position, having to contest with forces both similar as well as unlike their own party.\n\n On the left stand two powerful groups, the Radical Peasants of Father Okoń and the Social Democrats of a long time leader Ignacy Daszyński. The first force advocates for a holy and moral government, combining the Church's teachings with socialism. Yet standing separate from its rigid hierarchy in favor of a Peasant Church and Agrarian Socialism. The second force calls for a great reform that would touch every aspect of the legal and economic life in Galicia. All to benefit the urban worker and allow Galicia to become the launching point of a new and independent Polish Republic.\n\n The situation on the right is in some ways much less but in some much more exciting. The Party of Nationl Right has long been a dominant force inside Galician politics, only recently losing the position to the Polish People's Party. Yet they are not as unified as it might seem from the first glance, having been split between the Kraków and Lwów factions for many decades now. Stańczycy are much less dogmatic in their conservatism than their Podolacy counterpart, who believe that democracy itself is a form of poverty.\n\n The entire population of the Kingdom, be they Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, Jews or Germans, ask itself one question. Who will be tasked with saving their land after all is said and done?"

gal.20.d:0 "A landowner, activist of the Galician Agricultural Society and long-time chairman of the local county council, Władysław Jakub Dzieduszycki, was brutally murdered today in Stanislaw. Moreover, he was the son of one of the influential leaders of the Podolacy faction of the Stronnictwo Prawicy Narodowej, which immediately gained much attention from the politicians and journalists.\n\nSince the middle of the previous year, the activities of the Ukrainian Military Organization (Ukraińska Organizacja Wojskowa) under Melnyk's leadership took on a brightly colored nationalistic and terrorist character. Despite all sorts of indulgences for the Ukrainian minority, it was the Galician UWO corps that appeared in Eastern Galicia in 1933 that began, according to the central government, an active campaign to discredit our authorities and foment interethnic conflicts. Recently, their terrorist activity has intensified and there is every reason to believe that they are trying by terror and military action to tear away the territories of Eastern Galicia, including the Polish city of Lwów\n\nAt the time of the murder, the direct perpetrator was detained; he was one of the members of the underground UWO group. The Podolacy have already made an official appeal to find and punish the perpetrators, those who ordered this brutal murder. "
gal.20.a:0 "A tragic event!"

gal.21.t:0 "Eastern Galicia in Flames"
gal.21.d:0 "Every day the headlines scream about the violence perpetrated by underground UWO groups. Despite the fact that the Ukrainian state tries in every way to deny Melnyk's activities, our police found that the person responsible for the violence on the part of the Galician UWO corps is known as Mykoła Sciborski. His detachments commit beatings of Polish priests, and several attempts of pogroms in cities have also been recorded. Active pressure was also put on the head of the Ukrainian faction in the Galician Sejm, Eugene Petrushevich, who was accused of being unable to settle things peacefully. At the same time, Galician generals urge the government to solve the terror problem before the attacks escalate into open guerrilla warfare "
gal.21.a:0 "We must act!"

gal.22.t:0 "Violence in Eastern Regions"
gal.22.d:0 "From the eastern provinces come reports of horrific acts committed by UWO members. To reinforce and solidify the idea that they stand for a "Western Ukraine without Poles and Jews," these nationalists persecuted and attacked Polish and Jewish minorities, kicked them out of their homes in the cities, and attacked prominent leaders of these ethnic groups. More often than not, this violence was met with violence - the Jewish Workers' Bund began organizing self-defense groups to protect its members, as did the Poles in Lwów, and they engaged in gunfights with paramilitary UWO formations."
gal.22.a:0 "We should do something!"

gal.23.t:0 "Urban Battles"
gal.23.d:0 "In an utterly daring attack that was undoubtedly motivated by racial hatred, in a chaotic frenzy the UWO pounced on the city center, wreaking havoc and destruction everywhere. The Jewish population of the city, nearly a quarter of the population, fled in terror. But the cries for help did not go unheeded, and the alert reached the local Galician military garrison, which immediately arrived in the city. After an intense exchange of fire in the streets of the city, the garrison was forced to retreat. This incident undoubtedly alarmed many Poles. As can be seen from this attack, it is evident that the UWO is growing stronger every day, and everyone is wondering when their attacks will be no more. At the moment, the city is partially under rebel control, and we need to replenish the garrison."
gal.23.a:0 "Even in broad daylight?"

gal.24.t:0 "Industrial Sabotage"
gal.24.d:0 "This morning the residents of Lwów awoke to a terrifying sight and sound: a bomb exploded at a factory, killing several people and injuring dozens more. The bomb severely damaged the plant and also damaged local infrastructure. None other than the UWO claimed responsibility for the attack, which claimed that the purpose of the attack was to hit Austrian businesses in Galicia. Although the reaction of local firefighters and police is admirable, many locals are extremely alarmed and some even accuse the Galician government of inaction. There is even a growing murmur that the government's actions in recent days have only provoked the UWO into organizing more terrorist attacks. If we want to regain the trust of our people, we must redouble our efforts to show the people that we can protect them!"
gal.24.a:0 "We will prevail!"

gal.25.t:0 "Arms Factory Attacked"
gal.25.d:0 "Yesterday afternoon a weapons factory in Tarnopol exploded, disabling an entire weapons production line. According to reports from the scene, there were no fatalities, but there were injuries among the workers. None other than the UWO claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming that their attack was aimed at undermining Austria's position in our country. It will take time to rebuild the destroyed industry, but our citizens are growing weary of the violence every day. If we want to regain the support of our people, we must destroy the UWO as soon as possible, before they take more drastic measures."
gal.25.a:0 "They will pay for it!"

gal.26.t:0 "All Quiet"
gal.26.d:0 "After weeks of violence, bloodshed, and terrorism, the UWO has... disappeared. Like rats in the shadows, it appears either that the government suppression of UWO activities is working or that the UWO is planning something else, something sinister perhaps than their previous actions have shown. While hardliners are pushing for the military to seek out the UWO actively, a search of the UWO would be akin to finding a needle in a haystack without any intelligence of their whereabouts. Unfortunately, it appears that we must wait for them to make the first move before we crush them once and for all..."
gal.26.a:0 "It's quiet... too quiet..."

gal.27.t:0 "Failed Attack"
gal.27.d:0 "Today the military command in Lwów was absolutely delighted when the news of the actual victory reached them. It turns out that in their conceited arrogance the UWO had attempted to raid a small military outpost near Stanisławów in broad daylight. Most likely they intended to attack the base solely for supplies, since they were on the run and were probably running out of fuel for their so-called rebellion. After a silly attack on the base, the defenders fired from fortified positions and towers littered with sandbags, fighting off the UWO forces like fish in a barrel. Finally, after suffering heavy losses, the UWO escaped into the woods again, but not immediately, leaving their wounded and fallen comrades behind. News of the victory reached the streets of every Galician town, and the military and government praised the response. At last we had a great success, which testifies to the strength of our government and the loyalty of our military to Galicia-Lodomeria!"
gal.27.a:0 "Good riddance."

gal.28.t:0 "Railway Bombing"
gal.28.d:0 "Residents along the Lwów-Przemyśl railroad woke up to a loud explosion and a cloud of smoke in the middle of the night. Apparently, UWO terrorists struck quickly in the dark and just as quickly fled into the Galician forests. The implication of their attack is clear: the Lwów-Przemyśl rail line plays a key role in supplying Lwów with Austrian goods, and without them our troops will have difficulty with food and ammunition. Although we will send recovery crews to get our trains up and running more quickly, the latest attack reflects the increasingly violent nature of the UWO. We will make sure that when we find them, they pay for their crimes."
gal.28.a:0 "We will catch them!"

gal.29.t:0 "Military Depot Raided"
gal.29.d:0 "A military depot in Stanisławów, near the Galician-Hungarian border, was attacked in the dead of night. At the signal of a sudden signal flare, UWO forces descended on the outpost, aiming at whoever and whatever they could, as well as knocking panicked deserters out of the trees. Most of them panicked at first, but the Loyalists began a courageous defense, using the light machine guns of the depot to overwhelm the enemy. Despite their valiant efforts, however, the UWO rebels fled deep into the Nadvirna Forest, and the defenders were too exhausted to pursue them. By the time the sun finally rose, military reinforcements had finished putting out the last of the fires. The damage to the city's industrial center was estimated as light to moderate, but the lives lost were irreparable."
gal.29.a:0 "Those bastards will pay."

gal.30.t:0 "A Successful Raid"
gal.30.d:0 "Units of the Army of Galicia-Lodomeria successfully seized the UWO hideout after a brief but intense firefight. Unfortunately, most of the terrorists managed to escape with their weapons, but nevertheless, the skirmish is celebrated as a victory. Each time the insurgents are forced to retreat further and further to the borders, hiding in forests and villages, while the major cities remain under our control."
gal.30.a:0 "Onwards!"

gal.31.t:0 "Civilians Harmed!"
gal.31.d:0 "The real victims of this bloodbath are those who are simply trying to provide for their families. For every person killed, there is one suffering family. Despite the government's efforts to help and the strong condemnation of the guerrillas, many question the meaning of the whole conflict. There are renewed news reports of civilians caught in the crossfire or as a result of UWO bombings against the military. Many point out that harsh measures by the military do not do much to reduce the UWO's support base - on the contrary, it seems that the blood spilled by Ukrainians only strengthens their struggle."
gal.31.a:0 "The terrorist cannot hide forever."

gal.32.t:0 "The Radykaly Stronghold"
gal.32.d:0 "Today we won a major victory - our forces captured a large UWO weapons cache. The well-hidden cellar was discovered after some light "coercion" by local peasants, which gave us all the information we needed to storm the hiding place and capture most of the terrorist cell. Upon further investigation, it turned out that the cache was filled with Ukrainian small arms and homemade explosives, and even a few light mortars. This should hamper the UWO's efforts to mount further effective attacks against us."
gal.32.a:0 "Well done."

gal.33.t:0 "No Contact"
gal.33.d:0 "The towns and villages had been quiet lately. The UWO were silent, no doubt gathering their strength while our troops relentlessly sought their hiding place. The lull in violence gave the brave citizens of our kingdom a moment of relief in the midst of rebellion."
gal.33.a:0 "It's quiet..."

gal.34.t:0 "UWO Laid Low"
gal.34.d:0 "The leadership of the Galician UWO corps was effectively dissolved, and its members largely fled. Information from Maseina and Alantas showed that the UWO had weakened because of internal conflicts in the leadership, which threatened to break up the party. Although Melnyk was the formal leader of the UWO Galician Corps, the more aggressive minority under Sciborski, known as the Radicals, criticized his authority in every way and acted on their own. In the end, this resulted in the fragmented UWO forces collapsing and being effectively defeated in Eastern Galicia. We will hope that this abominable nightmare is finally over, but the Ukrainian resistance will not disappear until they get what they want."
gal.34.a:0 "Hope they will never rise up again..."

gal.35.t:0 "The End of Prosvita"
gal.35.d:0 "The cultural-educational society \"Prosvita\", founded in Lviv as early as 1868, arose as a counterbalance to the colonial and Russophile trend in the cultural life of Eastern Galicia. \n\nFor many years the Prosvita did much for the cultural development of Ukrainians and their self-consciousness. In the lands of Galicia the Prosvita had more than 3,000 readings and 15,000 direct members. Now the society was practically dissolved, of course, only on the territory of our kingdom. Reading rooms were promptly closed throughout the country, but the archive, valuable historical documents and manuscripts, and printed matter could be saved and taken back to Ukraine. \n\nThe Prosvita ban undoubtedly caused enormous damage to Ukrainians. Yevhen Petrushevych has already issued a strong condemnation in the Galicia Sejm, and the Ukrainian ambassadors protested and left the current session in full. It seems that we have only fueled anti-Polish sentiment in Eastern Galicia, but one cannot but note the benefits of this decision for our government."
gal.35.a:0 "The decision of the Sejm should be respected..."

gal.36.t:0 "Nationalization of the \"Dnister\""
gal.36.d:0 "Mutual Insurance Company \"Dnister\" is the first Ukrainian insurance company, founded in 1892 in Lwów. Thanks to the energetic activity of the first director Jaroslaw Kulachkowsky the company has become one of the most respected insurance companies in Galicia. The company successfully developed all subsequent years, and in it was insured the property of all Greek Catholic parishes of Galicia. As a result, by 1936 the \"Dnister\" had policies worth more than 19 million Krones. \n\nThe insurance company provided stability and peace of mind for the Ukrainian minority, but now the decision was made to nationalize it in favor of the crown... Undoubtedly, this will cause great damage to Ukrainians and spur their resistance. However, at the same time, we are not abandoning them, for now their property will be in the hands of the state..."
gal.36.a:0 "They will be good..."

gal.37.t:0 "The End of 'West Ukraine'?"
gal.37.d:0 "Yevgen Petrushevich, who is considered the main representative of Ukrainian minority interests in Austria and Galicia, was arrested today. He was officially charged with ties to a terrorist group known as the Galician UWO Corps."
gal.37.a:0 "Without a head the resistance will fade..."

gal.38.t:0 "Melnyk Leaves For Ukraine"
gal.38.d:0 "After recent events in Ukraine, the Galician UWO Corps have been recalled to Ukraine. Its head, Andriy Melnyk has left as well, however, some of the UWO insurgents still remain here, mainly the Radicals under the guidance of Mykoła Sciborski. While seriously harming their intelligence and number of their troops and equipment by this exodus, the Radicals are still quite powerful to resist our rule."
gal.38.d.AUS: "After the Ukrainian Military Organization was established, one of Konovalets' main associates, Andriy Melnyk, was sent to Galicia, where he headed the local paramilitary units of Ukrainian Striltsi. Now that Konovalets is cooperating with the Ukrainian Soim and His Royal Majesty King Vasyl, Melnyk has returned to Kyiv. However, the dire consequence of this is that the UVO in Galicia is now headed by Mykola Stsiborskyi - a radical national-syndicalist, who has openly called for the Ukrainian annexation of the Eastern Galicia, as well as other 'Ukrainian sovereign lands'. We must await serious instability in Galicia in the upcoming years."
gal.38.a:0 "We hoped they will all leave."
gal.38.b: "We should watch the Galician forests more closely."

gal.39.t:0 "[GAL.GetName] Attempts to Dissolve the UGA"
gal.39.d:0 "The recent reports from Galicia-Lodomeria, where the Ukrainian nationalist resistance is on rise, show that the Galician government seeks to dissolve the Ukrainian Galician Army, simply known as the UGA, as they believe that they can have close connections to the terrorists.\n\nHowever, most of the UGA generals have been our citizens for decades, having been raised up in our Empire and showing their loyalty during the Weltkrieg. We should decide if we shall allow the centralisationist policy of the Galicia-Lodomeria to endure, or prevent them from oppressing the Ukrainian half of the kingdom."
gal.39.a:0 "They have no right to disband the UGA!"
gal.39.b:0 "That's their internal affairs, we can't intervene."

gal.40.t:0 "Austria Prevents Dissolving the UGA"
gal.40.d:0 "After Vienna heard about our attempt to dissolve the Ukrainian Galician Army, they have strongly opposed, stating that the affairs of the military formations of the Austrian crown should be decided by the military command of the Gemeinsame Armee, not by us."
gal.40.a:0 "Sad!"

gal.41.t:0 "The 75th Anniversary of Szewczenko's Death"
gal.41.d:0 "On the 75th anniversary of the death of the famous Ukrainian poet Taras Szewczenko, the society Prosvita appealed to the central government with a request to allocate money for the construction of a new monument to the poet in Tarnopol.\n\nTaras Szewczenko has an important cultural and historical significance for the Ukrainian people and is to some extent a symbol of their language, identity and independence. At the same time, many conservative-minded officials opposed the allocation of money from the treasury, saying that Ukrainian banks in Eastern Galicia would do an excellent job of subsidizing the local cultural event."
gal.41.a:0 "It will serve for inter-ethnic friendship"
gal.41.b:0 "They won't get a single Krone" 

gal.42.t:0 "The Krakow Sanctuary"
gal.42.d:0 "While lawlessness abounds in the rest of Galicia-Lodomeria, Krakow has taken it upon itself to restore the Free City as an interim solution until a more permanent solution is found. Krakow, being our capital, means this is a crippling blow to the final pieces of the Austrian construct that is Galicia and Lodomeria."
gal.42.a:0 "So falls the Constituent."
gal.42.b:0 "For Krakow!" 
gal.42.c:0 "Restore order at once!" 

gal.43.t:0 "Join Poland?"
gal.43.d:0 "The situation outside the rest of Krakow is stable enough. Should we take the opportunity to join Poland?"
gal.43.b:0 "Naturally!"
gal.43.a:0 "Krakow is at odds with Warsaw."  

gal.44.t:0 "Seizing Sanok"
gal.44.d:0 "Galicia-Lodomeria has collapsed. It has no purpose in its existence, and the Sanok area holds a sizeable Ukrainian population. As the Polish swoop in to restore order to Galicia now is the time we should seize Sanok for our own benefit."
gal.44.a:0 "Naturally!"

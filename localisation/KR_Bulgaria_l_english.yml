### Leaders ###
POLITICS_FERDINAND_I_DESC:0 "An Austrian noble, Ferdinand was elected Prince of Bulgaria in 1887 with Russian support. Though harsh rumors about his personal life and humiliation in the Second Balkan War nearly brought about his abdication in the past, the recently minted 'Tsar' won widespread support with victory in the Weltkrieg. Indeed, in the golden age that followed, all but the most pessimistic ceased to concern themsselves with Ferdinand's eccentricities. As the aging Ferdinand looks to the future he hopes to slowly but surely open the Bulgarian political sphere and consolidate past geopolitical gains."
POLITICS_BORIS_III_DESC:0 "Born in 1894 to Ferdinand I, Boris grew up watching his father lead Bulgaria to glory and independence from the Ottoman Empire. Graduating from the Sofia Military School, Boris joined the Bulgarian military as an officer and took part in the Balkan wars and later the Weltkrieg, earning respect from both German and Bulgarian soldiers alike despite his young age, and rapidly rising through the ranks until becoming one of the heads of the Bulgarian military itself. As his father aged after the Weltkrieg, Boris took more and more state responsibilities onto himself, experience that will prove useful with his recent ascension to power. Now Tsar Boris the III hopes to continue his father's legacy and reassert Bulgarian hegemony across the Balkans."

BUL_zveno_corporatism_idea:0 "Corporatism"
BUL_zveno_corporatism_idea_desc:0 "The Zveno has always been one of the greatest supports for the implementation of corporatist policies defined by the organization of institutions bringing together workers and employers in order to subordinate their interests to those of the company in which they work, this measure will unify the Bulgarian people and reduce the social class conflicts."
BUL_zveno_social_idea:0 "The Social State"

BUL_zveno_culture_idea:0 "The Bulgarian Culture"
BUL_zveno_culture_idea_desc:0 "The Bulgarian culture is undoubtedly one of the richest in the world, drawing its sources from the ancient Bulgarian Khanate.

BUL_zveno_race_idea_desc:0 "The Bulgarian race is thousands of years old and has remained largely pure despite the numerous attempts of our enemies to subjugate our proud nation.

BUL_retain_agrarianism_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to remember our roots and ensure that Bulgaria remains an agrarian nation. This is seen by many, including our peasants and members of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, as the safer and correct choice. We can now focus on furthering Bulgaria's output of crops and other agricultural goods to the market."
BUL_ailing_economy_idea:0 "Ailing Economy"
BUL_ailing_economy_idea_desc:0 "Following Prime Minister Malinov's decision to break off ties with Germany, alongside cool relations with all of our neighbours, we have largely been forced to rely on ourselves and what few nations that are willing to trade with us in order to ensure that our economy stays afloat. In addition, our precarious economic position is not helped by our policy of protectionism, which has driven away even the most adventurous investors..."

BUL_adopt_industrialisation_idea_desc:0 "Seen by many as risky, we've decided to abandon Bulgaria's status as an agricultural nation and have begun to take steps to turn the nation into one that is primarily industrial. This has, however, worried and even angered many members of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, who see our move towards industrialisation as one that will only hurt the farmers."
BUL_military_pensions_idea:0 "Military Pensions"
BUL_military_pensions_idea_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, Bulgaria had sent all that it had available, with a sizeable portion of its population in the military and sent to the frontlines. While this had been a massive boon during the war, this had hurt us following the conclusion of the Weltkrieg where the number of soldiers who were to receive their pensions were more than enough to divert significant amounts of funding."
BUL_slashed_military_pensions_idea:0 "Slashed Military Pensions"
BUL_slashed_military_pensions_idea_desc:0 "We have made the controversial decision of entirely cutting the funding of military pensions. This has not endeared us to many veterans, or even the military themselves, who see us as taking away what had rightfully belonged to them.

### Events ###
bulgaria.1.t:0 "The Tsardom of Bulgaria"
bulgaria.1.d:0 "Following the end of the Weltkrieg, [Root.GetName] had emerged victorious and had suddenly found herself in a golden age with the successful establishment of a Bulgarian hegemony over the Balkans.\n\nWith the death of Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov in 1927, Aleksandar Malinov was able to take power. A known Germanophobe, Malinov and his close allies saw Germany as threat, intent on making Bulgaria little more than a pawn, and thus, during the hubris of their golden age, sought to drift away from Germany which saw the cooling of relations between the two former allies.\n\nNow, Bulgaria has found herself in a precarious position with little to no allies in the Balkans—despite remaining the dominant military power in the area—and an ailing economy which weakens Bulgaria's position as her old enemies circle, like vultures, eagerly and hungrily awaiting the opportunity to reclaim their old territories..."
bulgaria.1.a:0 "Glory to the [Root.GetName] and the Tsar!"

bulgaria.2.t:0 "Veterans Association Rally"
bulgaria.2.d:0 "The Bulgarian Veterans Association is an influential organisation in [Root.GetName], consisting mostly of soldiers and officers of the [Root.GetAdjective] forces of the Weltkrieg. These men are largely renowned as heroes throughout [Root.GetName]. Their rally today in Sofia, consisting largely of patriotic displays, drew in large support from the populace."
bulgaria.2.a:0 "We must keep this in mind for the days to come."

bulgaria.3.t:0 "Economic Collapse!"
bulgaria.3.d:0 "Horrid news has reached us! Apparently, the Berlin Stock Exchange, in what many consider an extremely abrupt turn of events, has plunged economically, sending the economy of the German Empire, and the countries within its sphere, on a downward spiral! Of course, these effects were not confined to the German sphere as Germany's trade partners, which includes many nations both in Europe and around the world, have also seen their economies tank.\n\nBulgaria has not been left unscathed as we have also experienced severe economic downturn. International observers and enemies alike are closely watching our nation, with some calling this the beginning of the end of the [BUL.GetAdjective] golden age. In any case, we must turn our gaze towards our ever collapsing economy, lest we end up losing both the trust of our people, and our dominance within the Balkans..."
bulgaria.3.a:0 "We cannot fail!"

bulgaria.4.t:0 "Tensions Surrounding Industrialisation"
bulgaria.4.d:0 "Severe discontent has been in the air within [Root.GetName], with many of our peasants and factory workers experiencing poor economic conditions due to the economic crash now dubbed Black Monday. This has only been made worse due to our decision of beginning the industrialisation of the nation, with opposition coming from the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union and its members, who are mostly peasant farmers. While we have managed to temporarily quell most of the discontent, we must hope that our policy of industrialisation succeeds, lest we fail to pull ourselves out of this economic crisis and risk the people turning on us."
bulgaria.4.a:0 "We must go forward, no matter what."

bulgaria.5.t:0 "[BUL.GetName] has Embargoed Us!"
bulgaria.5.d:0 "Word has reached us that the treacherous Bulgarians have, in the wake of the economic crisis, decided to maintain protectionist tariffs and have, accordingly, saw fit embargo the members of Mitteleuropa. While this is by no means a big loss, as Bulgarian-German relations had already cooled significantly following the Weltkrieg, this does go to show how self-serving and heinous the [BUL.GetAdjective]s can truly be."
bulgaria.5.a:0 "No matter."

bulgaria.6.t:0 "Examining the Budget"
bulgaria.6.d:0 "Alongside our lack of involvement in the economy and the lack of support to our workers, it seems as though the extensive military pensions may be our undoing. It is clear that, following the examination of the budget, we must take steps to balance the budget, either by cutting military pensions or reorganising the system entirely. Whatever it may be, however, it is clear that we must take steps to remedy this situation and rid ourselves of the economic plague that has surrounded our nation."
bulgaria.6.a:0 "Whatever it takes."

bulgaria.7.t:0 "The Veterans React"
bulgaria.7.d:0 "Due to our controversial decision to slash military pensions which, even prior to the economic crisis, were already a drain on the government's finances, veterans from the Weltkrieg have begun to stage protests against the government. While this is not a major threat, it could help further destabilise our nation amidst economic fears."
bulgaria.7.a:0 "Uh oh..."

bulgaria.8.t:0 "The People React"
bulgaria.8.d:0 "As we have decided to maintain military pensions, it has endeared us to the supporters of the military and the veterans of the Weltkrieg themselves. And while this is good for morale within our nation and government support, it has not endeared us to the various peasants and factory workers, who view this as a move of sacrificing the common man for the military."
bulgaria.8.a:0 "Whatever."

bulgaria.9.t:0 "Retaining Agrarianism"
bulgaria.9.d:0 "It seems as though a sigh of relief has collectively echoed throughout the [Root.GetAdjective] nation and its people as we've decided to retain our policy of agrarianism and stay true to our roots as an agrarian nation. And while this has managed to unite the people in favour of our policies, it has also politically undermined us as a minority have seen it fit to join the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, who are in fierce opposition to our policies."
bulgaria.9.a:0 "No matter, for we shall prove ourselves yet."

bulgaria.10.t:0 "The Bulgarian Land Forces"
bulgaria.10.d:0 "Indeed, the Bulgarian Land Forces are the pride of [Root.GetName], with many referring to our great nation as the 'Prussia of the Balkans' and 'a military with a state'.\n\nBulgaria had sent much of its able-bodied men to fight in the Weltkrieg, where it was able to assert its military superiority, and had emerged dominant in the Balkans, yet, as a result, had incurred the penalty of high military pensions.\n\nIt is clear that we must take to examining both the status and readiness of our army as our enemies, who surround us like eager vultures waiting to attack, will be quick to pounce on any sort of mistake we might make. The institution of reforms must continue, so that the Bulgarian Land Forces can forever maintain their dominance in the Balkans..."
bulgaria.10.a:0 "Na nozh!"

bulgaria.11.t:0 "The Bulgarian Hegemony"
bulgaria.11.d:0 "We must turn our gaze towards maintaining the hegemony in the Balkans in order to preserve the [BUL.GetAdjective] golden age. As it stands, we are surrounded by the Romanians who seeks to take our rightful land and the Greeks in the south, who also claim land that is rightfully ours. In addition, Serbia has helped stoke the fires of revanchism, trying to secure its own hegemony in the Balkans. We cannot let that happen."
bulgaria.11.a:0 "We must stand firm!"

bulgaria.12.t:0 "Honouring the Dead"
bulgaria.12.d:0 "Only by honouring those who had so willingly sacrificed themselves to help defend the [BUL.GetAdjective] state and its people can we ever hope to move forward as a nation and properly maintain the dominance of our armed forces. Today is a joyous day for some, and a sombre day for many more..."
bulgaria.12.a:0 "Today, we mourn."

bulgaria.13.t:0 "Asserting the Tsar's Power"
bulgaria.13.d:0 "It is crucial that, during these trying times, we work hard towards maintaining and asserting the power of the Tsar as not only a figurehead for the nation, but as a symbol of [BUL.GetAdjective] strength and unity for the people to rally around. We must, in order to preserve our golden age, continually retain the confidence of the people and, if possible, boost it."
bulgaria.13.a:0 "Glory to the Tsar, glory to [Root.GetName]!"

bulgaria.14.t:0 "Empowering the National Assembly"
bulgaria.14.d:0 "We must work towards ensuring that [BUL.GetName]'s parliament, the National Assembly, is empowered and retains its power in order to secure the will of the people. Without power vested in the National Assembly, the people would not have any way of properly expressing their thoughts or even ensuring that they are, in some way, shape, or form, properly represented. We must secure the parliament, for it blows life into the Tsardom of Bulgaria."
bulgaria.14.a:0 "For the people!"

bulgaria.15.t:0 "Freedom of Press"
bulgaria.15.d:0 "One of the biggest goals of Malinov and the rest of the Liberal Party was to continue the implementation of progressive reforms that had been instituted a few years back, prior to the Weltkrieg. One of these reforms was loosening censorship laws on the press. While Malinov had had moderate success doing so, he was unable to fully rid the press of the shackles that had surrounded it. However, today marks the day where press censorship laws have been fully abolished which will allow for a freer and more expressive Bulgaria. This does, however, have the downside of allowing the press to criticise anything they deem fit."
bulgaria.15.a:0 "No matter, we must deal with the fallout."

bulgaria.16.t:0 "The Question of Women's Rights"
bulgaria.16.d:0 "For some time now, the Bulgarian Women's Union, primarily composed of educated women, have been lobbying the [BUL.GetAdjective] government to expand women's rights and enact universal suffrage. As Malinov's wife, Julia Malinova, is head of the union, the Liberals are inclined to support the movement. However, we may face the possibility of resistance from our, mostly, conservative population. With all that in mind, what say we?"
bulgaria.16.a:0 "We shall support the initiative."
bulgaria.16.b:0 "We shan't support the initiative."

bulgaria.17.t:0 "Ties With [BUL.GetName]?"
bulgaria.17.d:0 "It seems as though the [BUL.GetAdjective]s have approached us in an attempt to foster relations between our two nations. A delegation has come to us, asking to further ties, claiming that it would be useful for both of our nations, especially in the current turbulent climate, and that there is safety in numbers. While an alliance with [BUL.GetName] could be useful, the fact remains that they fought against us during the Weltkrieg and are currently surrounded by hostile nations. What should we do?"
bulgaria.17.a:0 "Accept their advances."
bulgaria.17.b:0 "Reject their advances."

bulgaria.18.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
bulgaria.18.d:0 "Thankfully, the Russians have decided to accept our advances for closer co-operation and greater ties between our two nations. This is great news, as we can now safely say that we have a strong ally to help watch out for our interests."
bulgaria.18.a:0 "A toast to our Russian friends!"

bulgaria.19.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Declined!"
bulgaria.19.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems as though the Russians have decided to decline furthering ties between our two nations. They've cited the turbulent atmosphere alongside concerns in the Balkans as a reason. While we know that these are, of course, blatant lies, it seems as though there's nothing we can do."
bulgaria.19.a:0 "Dammit..."

bulgaria.20.t:0 "Trade With [BUL.GetName]?"
bulgaria.20.d:0 "The Tsardom of [BUL.GetName] has approached us, yet again, in order to further ties between our countries. This time, they've made it clear that they would like to pursue a trade deal with us in an attempt to allow for the freer movement of goods between our nations and have argued that this will mutually benefit both of our economies. What is our response?"
bulgaria.20.a:0 "Sure!"
bulgaria.20.b:0 "Absolutely not."

bulgaria.21.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
bulgaria.21.d:0 "Russia has decided to accept our offer a trade deal, thereby allowing us to begin the freer movement of goods between our two nations while also putting us in a diplomatically favourable situation. This has far reaching implications, all of them good, for future Bulgarian-Russian joint ventures."
bulgaria.21.a:0 "Excellent!"

bulgaria.22.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Declined!"
bulgaria.22.d:0 "It seems as though the Russians have seen fit to deny us a trade deal, thereby disallowing us any semblance of economic co-operation between our two countries and effectively robbing us of any sort of economic gain that we may have enjoyed. This has far reaching implications for future Bulgarian-Russian joint ventures."
bulgaria.22.a:0 "Damn them."

bulgaria.23.t:0 "Appointing Loyal Officers"
bulgaria.23.d:0 "With our recent rise to power and the installation of Boris III as the new Tsar of [Root.GetName], it is clear that we must take steps to solidify our rule in key areas. This includes the [BUL.GetAdjective] Land Forces, whose support we will need in the upcoming days to bring about stability in Bulgaria and punish those who had wronged our great nation. By appointing loyal officers to high command, we can ensure that the armed forces are more ready and eager to receive orders from us and willing to assist with the protection of the state from those who would seek to destabilise it both internally and externally."
bulgaria.23.a:0 "For the greater good."

bulgaria.24.t:0 "Suppressing the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union"
bulgaria.24.d:0 "We must turn our gaze towards suppressing the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union as it is very clear that they are a direct threat to not only the stability of the [BUL.GetAdjective] nation, but to its very existence. During our darkest hour, they were willing to collaborate with the Serbian menace and turn Bulgaria into a mere lapdog of one of our greatest enemies. We cannot, and must not, allow this to go unpunished. The Bulgarian Agrarian National Union shall officially be shut down and any of its supporters shall be heavily suppressed. All officials belonging to the party will be placed under arrest. While these measures are unpopular with the peasantry, they are necessary to ensure Bulgaria's survival in these turbulent times."
bulgaria.24.a:0 "Show them no mercy!"

bulgaria.25.t:0 "Expanding the Tsar's Powers"
bulgaria.25.d:0 "In a move that is, somewhat surprisingly, popular with the [Root.GetAdjective] people, we've decided to take steps to allow for the Tsar to have a more direct role in [BUL.GetAdjective] politics and [BUL.GetAdjective] society. Since Tsar Boris III is already popular with a majority of the people, we've not faced much opposition. However, it has come to our attention that a few politicians, particularly those who are left leaning, are worried about the implications that the greater assertion of royal prerogatives holds, with many reminding the new government that the power is held by the National Assembly. No matter, for they are only a minor obstacle in our road to consolidating the power of the Tsar..."
bulgaria.25.a:0 "We shall succeed!"

bulgaria.26.t:0 "Tightening Electoral Laws"
bulgaria.26.d:0 "We have begun to move into action with the passage of a new law that severely restricts the type of parties that are allowed to operate within the National Assembly. Particularly, we have decided to target left leaning parties, which includes the Narrow and Broad Socialists, the Liberals, and the Radical Democrats, in order to strengthen, solidify, and give rise to the [BUL.GetAdjective] right. Unfortunately, as expected, we've faced much resistance from the affected parties. However, we cannot allow dissenters within our nation lest we suffer yet another humiliating defeat. For the sake of the people, we must stand firm."
bulgaria.26.a:0 "We cannot falter."

bulgaria.27.t:0 "Widespread Protesting Has Broken Out!"
bulgaria.27.d:0 "Following the tightening of the electoral laws, we've been faced with nationwide protests, from both the people and the politicians, who feel as though we've made Bulgaria a more constricting and less representative society. Political violence has also become somewhat widespread, with socialists, mostly located in major cities, advocating against our policies. This has not been helped by the fact that they have managed to garner the support of a sizeable minority, who wish to see the end of our rule. The Radical Democrats and Broad Socialists as well have taken this as an opportunity to push for a constitutional monarchy in an attempt to limit the Tsar's powers and, according to them, 'help empower the National Assembly once more'. We cannot allow these dissenters to run around and destabilise our great nation, what shall we do?"
bulgaria.27.a:0 "We will wait them out."
bulgaria.27.b:0 "Send in the army, now!"

bulgaria.28.t:0 "The Council of Ministers"
bulgaria.28.d:0 "By transferring power into the hands of the Council of Ministers, we can slowly, but surely, fully take away power from the National Assembly. In addition, we shall appoint loyal ministers to positions within the executive branch and have them work closely with the Tsar, having them receive directives from him. This way, we can convince the people that the government is still in power (with the added bonus of having yes men in positions of power) and allow for the Tsar and his close advisers in the military to pull the strings behind the scenes."
bulgaria.28.a:0 "Excellent."

bulgaria.29.t:0 "Reconciliation with [BUL.GetName]?"
bulgaria.29.d:0 "It seems as though the new [BUL.GetAdjective] government, with Bogdan Filov and Boris III at its head, wish to seek reconciliation with us. This comes as somewhat of a surprise as during the reign of Malinov and the Liberals, Bulgaria had been eager to disregard our alliance and ties forged during the Weltkrieg, even going so far as to recently erect trade barriers against us in our time in need. However, it is also clear that an ally in the Balkans, especially one as military powerful as Bulgaria, would be useful. What should we do?"
bulgaria.29.a:0 "Reconciliation would be to our benefit."
bulgaria.29.b:0 "Reconciliation would be to our detriment."

bulgaria.30.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted our Offer!"
bulgaria.30.d:0 "To the shock of many, including the Tsar himself, it seems as though Germany has decided to accept our efforts of reconciliation, citing that 'an alliance between both the German Empire and the Tsardom of Bulgaria will be mutually beneficial to both nations'. This comes as wonderful news, as it means we can now pursue our agenda of increasing and deepening Bulgarian-German ties."
bulgaria.30.a:0 "Wonderful!"

bulgaria.31.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Rejected our Offer!"
bulgaria.31.d:0 "It comes to shock as none, bar Filov himself, who was utterly confident that the Germans would receive our reconciliation efforts kindly, that the Germans have snubbed us, effectively telling us that our prior lack of commitment towards the Central Powers following the conclusion of the Weltkrieg has shown us to be unreliable and opportunistic allies."
bulgaria.31.a:0 "Damn them!"

bulgaria.32.t:0 "Trade with [BUL.GetName]?"
bulgaria.32.d:0 "Following our reconciliation with [BUL.GetName], they have begun to push for a joint trade deal between our two nations, citing that the effects of Black Monday can still be felt throughout Europe and that, if we were to accept their offer, we could be closer to truly eradicating the lasting effects of the economic plague while also mutually benefitting and deepening ties. On one hand, this is a good prospect due to Bulgaria's bountiful resources and their willingness to reconcile with us. On the other hand, however, the Balkans is hardly a stable region and we could potentially lose our investments in the region if things were to go south. How should we respond?"
bulgaria.32.a:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
bulgaria.32.b:0 "There's no need at the moment."

bulgaria.33.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted!"
bulgaria.33.d:0 "A collective sigh of relief has just been released throughout the government; it seems as though our gamble has paid off. Germany has decided to accept our offer of a trade deal which will go very far in terms of helping us deepen ties with the Kaiserreich and give us preferred access to their trade."
bulgaria.33.a:0 "Wonderful!"

bulgaria.34.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Declined!"
bulgaria.34.d:0 "Word has just reached us from the [BUL.GetAdjective] embassy in Berlin: apparently, the Germans have decided to reject our offer of a Bulgarian-German trade deal, citing that they are not in such a position to commit to such a deal due to their current situation. Unfortunately, this means that we can no longer hope to gain preferred access to their trade."
bulgaria.34.a:0 "Dammit..."

bulgaria.35.t:0 "Widespread Rioting!"
bulgaria.35.d:0 "The people, protesting against our decision of outright banning all political parties and, effectively, shutting down the National Assembly, have, together with the ostracised politicians, begun to stage protests against the Tsar and the new government. Luckily, as we've the army on our side, it is only a matter of pacifying the people and forcing them to accept the new political realities. We shall stand firm, and we shall rule with an iron fist, regardless of what dissenters and traitors may believe."
bulgaria.35.a:0 "We shall endure."

bulgaria.36.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Under Syndicalism"
bulgaria.36.d:0 "While we have managed to take power, it is key that we also retain that power. As it stands, we have more enemies than we do allies within Bulgaria, with the Liberals, Absolutists, and Agrarians doubting our will to lead the [BUL.GetAdjective] state into a prosperous era. In addition, they've already begun to make moves against us, decrying the syndicalist system in an attempt to politically undermine our position. While we do not pay heed to their words, as we know that we shall be successful in bringing syndicalism to Bulgaria, there is a cause for worry as a sizeable portion of the population have been swayed by these words. One thing is for certain, however, we must begin to undertake the monumental task of restructuring the state to fit our new vision and have faced heavy resistance and a widespread opposition..."
bulgaria.36.a:0 "This will not be easy, it seems."

bulgaria.37.t:0 "Supporting the Free Trade Unions"
bulgaria.37.d:0 "Allowing unions to take over and begin assisting with the management of the state is a key tenet of the very ideology of syndicalism. By courting the workers of the Free Trade Unions and empowering workers under labour unions, we can give them a fairer advantage against the once capitalist economy. In addition, by pushing the idea of co-operatives, we can help convince other workers to voluntarily join trade unions in order to help further the economic and political goals of Bulgaria as a whole. We shall overcome economic aristocracy and allow union democracy to reign unopposed!"
bulgaria.37.a:0 "For the workers!"

bulgaria.38.t:0 "[BUL.GetAdjective] Ties?"
bulgaria.38.d:0 "Interestingly, following their syndicalist takeover, [BUL.GetName] has decided to approach us in an attempt to foster relations between our two nations and, as a result, help open up a dialogue and deepen ties. It is clear that they remain politically isolated in the Balkans, due to their support of syndicalism, and that they will need allies in the future. It seems as though we have two options in this regard: we can either support the [BUL.GetAdjective]s and help foster syndicalism in the Balkans, or we can leave them on their own. While the second option is far from ideal, we also have commitments and political considerations that must be tended to. What say we?"

As they are very popular with the people and the reactionary politicians, alongside the uncertainty of the people regarding the new system, it is clear that we will need to be cautious. It is also worth considering, however, that the royal family remaining in Bulgaria undermines our power and that they represent the old system. Since we are committed to ridding the nation of all vestiges of monarchism, and considering the costs, it is best that we exile the royal family. This will have consequences, however..."

bulgaria.60.d:0 "In order to better represent the needs of our constituents and ensure that the nation democratises further, we must look towards the decentralisation of the political system. We cannot allow the power to be predominantly held by the central government or even the Tsar himself. We must allow the needs of people from every corner of the country to be heard, so that we can better address their concerns and, in time, help them address their own concerns as well."

We must make clear the position of the Tsar as a figurehead and allow the power of the nation to rest in the hands of elected officials rather than the royal family. The Tsar will be a good unifier for the people, but if the [BUL.GetAdjective] people are to be truly free and decide the future of their nation, much of the Tsar's powers must be neutered and his role be made a ceremonial one."

Our old Tsar unfortunately did not have the chance to survive this vile attack on his life. Those who had had the pleasure of knowing him few days before his death noted how proud and full of joy he was to have brought [Root.GetName] to its zenith and had successfully maintained the [Root.GetAdjective] hegemony within the Balkans.\n\nThe late Tsar's death saw the ascension of his son, who was crowned Tsar Boris III, which was a momentous occasion for all [Root.GetAdjective]s.

We have managed to avenge the Fall of Constantinople, which had occurred in 1453 – nearly 500 years ago, and have placed the city in Orthodox hands. The Hagia Sofia and the Ecumenical Patriarch will now be safe in Christian hands."

Later on, following the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, the Principality of [Root.GetName], alongside Eastern Rumelia, was established by the powers of Europe.

bulgariaflavour.7.d:0 "On the 22nd of September, Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, who was then Prince Ferdinand, had proclaimed the independence of [Root.GetName] in Tarnovo. This had been a momentous occasion of our great nation, as it allowed for us to gain our de jure independence and fully free ourselves from the grip of the treacherous Ottoman Empire. Following the declaration of independence, we've met much success throughout the years, especially during our time spent fighting in the Weltkrieg."

Of course, while a majority of the population is Greek, there are [Root.GetAdjective]s in the region who are happy to see the transfer of the territory into [Root.GetAdjective] hands.

bulgariaflavour.15.d:0 "Feeling as though [Root.GetNameDef] is on the brink of defeat, it seems as though Stamboliyski has shown his true colours as he has defected to the enemy and has come in support of pan-Slavic ideals. He has gained the attention of many within the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union, but only a minority of the members of the party itself have come out in favour of co-operation with the Serbs."

bulgariaflavour.17.d:0 "By beginning the process of shutting down Sharia family courts, we have begun to experience a bit of backlash from the local Turkish and Pomak communities, who have argued that the usage of Sharia courts are crucial with regards to abiding by Islamic law and that, by doing this, the Bulgarian state is blatantly depriving a substantial part of the population of its needs."

bulgariaflavour.21.d:0 "With the recent protests by a certain portion of our citizenry with regards to the status of the Muslim minority in [BUL.GetName], it is important that a key issue is addressed: namely the question of who will fund the mosques within [BUL.GetName]. While we could simply saddle the burden onto the already existing wealthy Muslims, it is important to keep in mind that this will not endear us to the Muslim community, whereas using the state’s coffers to pay for the upkeep of mosques will hurt our standing with the [BUL.GetAdjective] Christian segment of our population. What should we do?"
bulgariaflavour.21.a:0 "We shall continue to fund it ourselves."

bulgariaflavour.22.t:0 "Schooling within [TUR.GetAdjective] Communities"

bulgariaflavour.24.d:0 "With the beginnings of the new mass migration policy officially put into motion by the government of [BUL.GetName], we have already asked the first of our Christian [BUL.GetAdjective] settlers to begin moving into the mostly Muslim Western Thrace so as to better homogenise the region with the rest of our nation.

bulgariaflavour.25.d:0 "The stream of [BUL.GetAdjective] settlers into the Eastern Rhodope and Northern Albanian Mountain regions has slowly resulted in greater promotion of Christian [BUL.GetAdjective] attitudes in the area.

Stating that the [BUL.GetAdjective] government, for far too long, has been rather lenient towards Muslim minorities alongside blaming them for job losses, members of Zveno have begun to protest the policies of the government and have demanded change in the way that [BUL.GetName] treat its Muslim minority.\n\nIn response to these protests and attacks, counter-protests and attacks against Zveno by [BUL.GetAdjective] Turks and even some Pomaks have also begun, with the groups agitating for the [BUL.GetAdjective] government to not only grant their respective communities further autonomy, but to also make clear its stance on many issues that have been put on hold by the government."
bulgariaflavour.26.a:0 "Oh dear."

zveno.1.t:0 "Leadership Question"
zveno.1.d:0 "Although our grip on the country was complete, divisions began to appear within Zveno itself, a faction led by General Hristo Lukov criticized the government of our leader Georgiev, finding it too soft and too sympathetic with the socialists. Where Georgiev could have banished Lukov and his allies from the party, he decided, in order to maintain the integrity of the movement, to hold an internal party vote to decide who would have the honor of leading the nation. Georgiev and confident of his victory, having led the Zveno for years, however, Lukov also has good chances of winning, being especially popular with younger members of the party, more radical. A tense vote was held today and a winner is about to be announced."

zveno.2.t:0 "The Totalism Question"
zveno.2.d:0 "The new Totalist ideology is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating human inventions of the 20th century, combining the best elements of nationalism and socialism, resulting in a perfect alchemy ready to serve the people whatever the cost. After our association with the various nationalist Totalist movements to our cause, many expect Georgiev to proclaim himself a Totalist and declare the Bulgarian People's Republic. These are only rumors at the moment, many others think that Georgiev has only formed an alliance and does not intend to change the official ideology of Zveno. Only Georgiev himself has the true answer and the members of our party are waiting for it."

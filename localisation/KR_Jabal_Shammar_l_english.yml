### Decisions ###
JBS_Ottoman_Favours:0 "Diplomacy with the Sublime Porte"
JBS_Ottoman_Favours_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire, commonly refered to as the Sublime Porte, is our largest ally in the region and also its strongest military. Even though we should not expect direct intervention from them should the Saudis strike, we can still rely on the Sultans favour in times of need." 

JBS_Ottoman_Training:0 "Invite Experts from the Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi"
JBS_Ottoman_Training_desc:0 "The Ottomans have fought a bloody war with us at their side two decades ago but even then it was clear who had the doctrinal advantage. Fighting war for close to a decade on end, the Ottomans are battle hardened, trained and capable of providing us with all the assistance necessary to reform our army."
JBS_Ottoman_Weapons_Assistance:0 "Military Contract with ATF"
JBS_Ottoman_Weapons_Assistance_desc:0 "The facilities of Ankara Tüfek Fabrikasi are producing the finest weapons in the Middle East which we will dearly need should we expect to stand a chance against the forces of Ibn Saud on our own."
JBS_Join_Istanbul_Pact:0 "Join the Istanbul Pact"
JBS_Join_Istanbul_Pact_desc:0 "Allies in the Weltkrieg, the Porte once more calls on all decent muslimfolk to defend the values of the Caliphate and oust the invaders of its territory. Although we don't really have a stake in the fighting, we may be greatly rewarded for our loyalty once the Porte inevitably crushes the weak Sultan in Cairo."
JBS_Join_Cairo_Pact:0 "Join the Cairo Axis"
JBS_Join_Cairo_Pact_desc:0 "Times have changed and the once undefeatable Ottoman war machine has lost steam. With Arab nations and groups flocking to the green banner of Egypt who clamours to fight for the liberation and glory of the Arab peoples, our Emir as well questions his relation to the Porte. We already had a whiff of freedom these last few years so after all... why not? Why shouldn't we keep it?"

JBS_SAU_Power_Struggle:0 "Preparations for the War of Unification"
JBS_SAU_Power_Struggle_desc:0 "Time has not been very kind to the House of Rashid. Losing most of their male family members at the hands of the Ibn Saud and suffering from continous raids into their territory by the Ikhwan, the power and prestige emanating from Ha'il has severely waned under the weight of the Wahabbists. Support by the Ottoman Empire is keeping our dominion on its feet however as their continued partnership and alliance with our Emir ensures his lands are safe from any immediate threat.\n\nSome have argued however that this partnership is the only thing keeping our realm together and should disaster befall the Ottomans, Ibn Saud may see it as his destiny to unite the peninsula under his rule.\n\n§gThe strength of our £in_combat §GAllies§! will determine the size of our army at the start of the war with [SAU.GetNameWithFlag]. Courting the Central Arabian tribes and securing assistance from forces in Hejaz and Iraq could help tip the scales in our favour.§!\n      [JBS.GetNameWithFlag] : [?num_divisions|H0] ([?tribes|H0])\n      [SAU.GetNameWithFlag] : [?SAU.num_divisions|H0] ([?SAU.tribes|H0])\n"

JBS_War_of_Unification:0 "Arab War of Unification"
JBS_War_of_Unification_desc:0 "The final struggle for control over the Arab interior is rapidly approaching, as the Ottoman behemoth is cracking under the weight of the worldwide economic depression, temporarily unable to maintain peace on the peninsula. All Emirs will have to pick a side, for the future of the Arab world will be written in blood. Those who win will have the chance to shape the destiny of the Arabs. The losers will find themselves disgraced, cast aside or slain on the field of battle."
JBS_War_of_Unification_Peace:0 "Imminent Collapse"
JBS_War_of_Unification_Peace_desc:0 "Whilst the deserts of Arabia are no strangers to war, its economy and agrarian base can not sustain long conflicts without intermittent armistices and decisive victories. Should either the House of Rashid or Saud find itself on the verge of victory, the other will have no choice but to admit that it does not have the capacity to sustain a lengthy siege or a war of attrition." 
JBS_Sway_Harb:0 "Sway the §YHarb§!"
JBS_Sway_Harb_desc:0 "Tightly bound to the tribes of Hejaz, the Harb nonetheless form a formidable power bloc in Central Arabia. In the conflict between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud, they have nonetheless thus far remained neutral as they have little stakes in the tug of war and are protected by the Sharif in Mecca.\n\nMore recently however they have become concerned by attacks of the Ikhwan whose seemingly endless desire for the glory of the battlefield have started to raid the outer reaches of the Harb domain."
JBS_Sway_Hutaim:0 "Sway the §YHutaim§!"
JBS_Sway_Hutaim_desc:0 "Inhabiting mostly the coastline, with a large subsection near Hejaz, the Hutaim are one of the 'Lesser Tribes' of Arabia. They are mostly hunters/gatherers with little stakes in the Arab conflict, largely stemming from the fact that neither side recognises them as True Arabs.\n\nOften serving as slaves or filling the lower positions in Arab society, they could perhaps be persuaded to support our side if we were to make concessions."
JBS_Sway_Muntafiq:0 "Sway the §YMuntafiq§!"
JBS_Sway_Muntafiq_desc:0 "A Shi'ite tribal confederation led by Sunnis, the Muntafiq are one of the largest groups in Iraq and play an important role in its politics. Besides that, they also serve as border guards preventing the further expansion of Ibn Saud and the raids of the Ikhwan.\n\nLed by §YYusuf al-Sa'adun§!, the §RIraqi Camel Corps§! is a distinguished part of the Ottoman Army in Iraq and could if need be prove decisive in defeating the troops of Ibn Saud when properly supported by the Turks."
JBS_Sway_Anizzah:0 "Sway the §YAnizzah§!"
JBS_Sway_Anizzah_desc:0 "The largest and most powerful tribe of Central Arabia, the allegiance of the Anizzah is of vital importance to any group looking to unite Arabia. Despite this, the Anizzah are considered one of our traditional enemies and it will prove extremely difficult to convince them into coming over to our side. To further his case, Ibn Saud also proudly calls himself a descendant of the Annizah who he called the tribe with the 'Bluest Blood'.\n\nDespite these factors however, the Anizzah have had an especially bad run in with the Ikhwan and have called on Ibn Saud to show where his true loyalties lay. It is this difference that we can exploit and hopefully use to our advantage."
JBS_Sway_Mutair_Dawish:0 "Sway the §YMutair§! (Faisal al Duwaish)"
JBS_Sway_Mutair_Dawish_desc:0 "One of the most formidable tribes, the Mutair can be seen as a sort of wildcard amongst tribal loyalties, flocking to the banner of the power most beneficial to their situation. Whilst the Ikhwan count a significant amount of Mutair amongst their numbers and has assisted Ibn Saud on multiple occasions, their leader is well known for switching sides to his own advantage.\n\nThe great §YFaisal al Duwaish§!, their leader and commander is seen as the greatest military mind on the peninsula and may very well prove to be the decisive factor in the wars to come if his loyalty can be ensured."
JBS_Sway_Mutair_Busayis:0 "Sway the §YMutair§! (Mishari ibn Busayis)"
JBS_Sway_Mutair_Busayis_desc:0 "Although for most Mutair, Faisal al Duwaish can be seen as their hero, saint and father, it may be possible to sow dissent amongst their ranks and drive a wedge between those disillusioned by the endless violence and religious rhetoric of the Ikhwan.\n\nCommanding a substantial part of the Western Mutair, §YMishari ibn Busayis§! could potentially be swayed to our side if we promise to reward him in return with lordship over the Western Qasim tribes."
JBS_Sway_Ajman:0 "Sway the §YAjman§!"
JBS_Sway_Ajman_desc:0 "The Ajman have been among the most unmanageable tribes for almost a century and submit to the central government only reluctantly. Attempts by Riyadh to bind them closer to the crown turned into disaster in 1915 when the Ajman rose their flag in revolt and after achieving an initial victory over Ibn Saud, almost succeeded in killing him. They would however not prove a match for his combined forces and after a short setback, he returned to enact his vengeance.\n\nThe command after their defeat to be broken up in small parts and settle in the Hijra of the Ikhwan has been received especially poorly and it is no secret that their leader, §YZaidan ibn Hithlain§!, has been preparing the downfall of his suzerain ever since."
JBS_Sway_Utaibah:0 "Sway the §YUtaibah§!"
JBS_Sway_Utaibah_desc:0 "The second largest tribe of Central Arabia, the Utaibah have always been staunch allies of the Saudis and fought on their frontlines against threats both from within and abroad. Nonetheless a feud has developed within their ranks between the Ikhwan aligned Sultan ibn Humaid ibn Bijad and §YAbd al-Rahman ibn Rubayin§!. It is this division that we could potentially exploit and use to our advantage if we play our cards right." 
JBS_Sway_Awazim:0 "Sway the §YAwazim§!"
JBS_Sway_Awazim_desc:0 "Much like the Hutaim, the Awazim are seen as an "inferior" tribe by the tribes of "blue blood" and are used to perform menial tasks or as slaves for their superiors. The Awazim in particular have a tough time as they are stuck between their "masters", the Ajman, and the Ottoman controlled city of Kuwait where their former benefactors have been removed by the Caliph.\n\nThey nonetheless form a potent military force of their own and could potentially be persuaded to join our coalition if we were to rid them of the Ajman threat."

### Ideas ###
JBS_shammar_chauvinism:0 "Shammar Chauvinism"
JBS_shammar_chauvinism_desc:0 "Although the Shammar form only part of the tribal confederation that has sworn fealty to the Emirs of Ha'il, they are without a doubt the lifeblood of it. Unlike their rivals in Riyadh, the Shammar do not share the belief that all the monotheists should be united or that they are equals. For them, it is clear that the Shammar are a group above their other 'countrymen' and it is their right to rule and fight. Their martial prowess, famed in the entire subcontintent has strengthened this conviction although it has over the last few decades had no choice but to recognise that what their troops may make up in quality can't match the sheer numbers Ibn Saud brings to the field.\n\nThis attitude has in the past led to severe issues with the other tribes of Arabia who see the Shammar as unreliable chauvinists, further exacerbated by their short reign over the entire Najd region when their ruthless attempts at subjugation left the region a burning ruin." 
jbs_shammar_chauvinism_tt:0 "§RThe integration of other parts of the Peninsula will lead to frequent frictions with tribes and harsher penalties due to the Shammari unwillingness to share power§!"
JBS_ottoman_lapdogs:0 "Ottoman Lapdogs"
JBS_ottoman_lapdogs_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the Saudi state, the Emirs of Ha'il have fostered close ties with the Turkish Caliph. Partially out of economic necessity as the merchants and citizens of Ha'il depend on the influx of pilgrims going from Ottoman Iraq to Ottoman Hejaz and partially out of opportunism. As the Saudi state continued to crumble, the Shammar used this window of opportunity to expand their own power with the backing of Turkish arms.\n\nTheir inability to stop the resurgent Ibn Saud would however prove their undoing and their reliance on the Turks to help them quell the young Saudi state, gave them the reputation of Turkish lapdogs and traitors to the traditions of the Arab peninsula. Suffering defeat after defeat, the Shammar attempted to regain their position by shedding any ambiguity that may have remained and threw themselves fully behind the Ottoman cause. Although this decision would lead to their survival as a state independent from Riyadh, it also bound them closely to the Turkish state. With Ibn Saud ever expanding his power and influence, Najds undoubtedly greater military potential and the constant infighting of the Rashidi dynasty, the Turks have become the only reason the Emirate still stands."

Once a key trading hub on the lines between Iraq and the Hejaz, the city has established its reputation as a religiously tolerant and wealthy city in the Arabian Desert. Although its glory has sharply faded since the haydays of the First Rashidi State, the princes of al Rashid continue to exert their power over Northern Arabia."

JBS_guardians_of_the_haji_desc:0 "For the merchants of Ha'il and the Arab subcontinent in general, few activities are as important as the yearly Haji. The duty of every Muslim to at least once visit the Holy Cities in the Hejaz has brought with it a gargantuan economic and logistical operation. The Tribes of Jabal Shammar are one of the cogwheels and it is our duty (and source of income) to provide safe passage to those travelling from Iraq to Hejaz."
JBS_ottoman_economic_integration_program:0 "Ottoman Economic Integration Program"
JBS_ottoman_economic_integration_program_desc:0 "In the past, the merchants of Shammar were able to compete with those of the Ottoman center and the caravan routes crossing the subcontinent brought riches and splendour to Ha'il. These times are over and with the industrialisation of the Ottoman Empire, our value has greatly diminished. There is hope however that through integration of Ha'il into the Mesopotamian economy, we can achieve a new role."
JBS_invite_syrian_educators:0 "Invite Syrian Educators"
JBS_invite_syrian_educators_desc:0 "Although our tribesmen have a reputation as great warriors and merchants, they severly lack the education to play any significant role in the world of today. Whilst for many this lack is regarded with pride, the import of modern technology has necessitated the presence of an educated class. With Syria traditionally in close relation to us, we have been granted the right to send our brightest minds to their academies."

JBS_renegotiate_ottoman_subsidies_desc:0 "These days sadly one of our main sources of income, the Ottoman payments made out to our Emir for his continued loyalty and his wage as Wali of Jabal Shammar form a vital lifeline for our struggling Emirate. As tensions rise both on the subcontinent and in the greater Arab world, coupled with the wage reductions for governors in the core Ottoman lands, a renegotiation of our allowance is more than due."

JBS_protect_shia_merchants:0 "Protect Shia Merchants"
JBS_protect_shia_merchants_desc:0 "Unlike our Saudi neighbours in Riyadh, the Emirs of Ha'il have a much laxer policy towards the non-monotheists and this has enabled the rise of a prospering cosmopolitan atmosphere within the city walls. With Ikhwan rhetoric calling for the execution of all non-believers and the Shia population of al-Hasa suffering under their attacks, Ha'il has developped itself as a safehaven for those fearful of the Ikhwan."
JBS_encourage_local_manafacturing:0 "Encourage Local Manufacturing"
JBS_encourage_local_manafacturing_desc:0 "Primarily a people of merchants, herders and farmers, there is little in the shape of manufacturing performed locally with simple commodities such as clothes imported from Syria. Although this arrangement has served us well in the past, the volatility of the world market has led to severe shortages in Ha'il. To remediate this situation, we will need to establish at least a minimal local industry."
JBS_date_and_fruit_production:0 "Promote Date and Fruit Production"
JBS_date_and_fruit_production_desc:0 "The desert sands of Arabia make for hard farming and with fresh water primarily limited to Oases and the cooler highlands, the cultivation of dates and fruit have taken precedence over traditional grains or rice. With a rapid growth in population both within our lands and Greater Syria, the demand for these goods has seen a rise. A rise which we will take advantage of!"
JBS_found_directory_of_military_affairs:0 "Found the Directory of Military Affairs"
JBS_found_directory_of_military_affairs_desc:0 "The military of Ha'il consists mainly out of Bedouin allies called upon during times of war and conscripts from amongst the settled population. This latter group has seen its importance rise spectacularly over the years as a disciplined, standing army has proven its advantage in conflicts with Ibn Saud as the reliance on fragile alliances with the tribes of Arabia has led to countless unexpected defeats."
JBS_recruit_tribal_levies:0 "Recruit Tribal Levies"
JBS_recruit_tribal_levies_desc:0 "Traditionally the tribes who swear fealty to the Emirs of Ha'il are only subject to conscription or the duty to deliver men for the army when called upon in times of war. As Ha'il slowly moves towards a professional standing army, we will need to impose a quotum on our tribal allies and as such provide the manpower for this new force."
JBS_expand_body_guards:0 "Expand the Rajail"
JBS_expand_body_guards_desc:0 "As the Emirs of Ha'il found the Bedouin of Central Arabia an untrustworthy force, in the 19th Century the then ruler of Ha'il ordered the creation of a personal guard, the Rajails, consisting of hardened Turkish, Albanian or Circassian soldiers. This force has survived and even expanded on as their status as a mainly mercenary guard proved less susceptible to the Wahabbist rhetoric of Riyadh."
JBS_study_ottoman_doctrine:0 "Study Ottoman Doctrine"
JBS_study_ottoman_doctrine_desc:0 "What was once an alliance of opportunity between the city of Ha'il, unaffected by the collapse of the Second Saudi State, and the Porte to wrest control over the Arabian interior has deteriorated into a clear master-vassal relation. Ottoman soldiers have garrisons in many of the major oases whilst their military theorists hold major sway within the army of Ha'il, defining its tactics and organising its conscription."

JBS_create_camel_corps_desc:0 "Inspired by the Iraqi Camel Corps, maintained by the powerful Muntafiq tribe as a division of the Ottoman Sixth Army, officers of the Ottoman Empire are working in cooperation with the House of Rashid to establish a second Camel Corps based in Ha'il and aimed at further protecting the Southern flank of the Ottoman Empire from possible incursions."
JBS_establish_royal_horsebreeding_department:0 "Royal Horse-breeding Department"
JBS_establish_royal_horsebreeding_department_desc:0 "As many men in the West now look at their newfashioned automobiles with great pride, for the common Arab there can be no question about the divine status of the horse. Not only is the horse used for tasks of warfare but the breeding of the most beautiful, fastest and most capable horses is regarded as a major source of prestige in Arab society and one the House of Rashid can never pay enough attention to."
JBS_import_modern_weapons:0 "Import Modern Weapons"
JBS_import_modern_weapons_desc:0 "Although the forces of Riyadh and Ha'il have progressed since the days of the musket and scimitar, many of our troops still wield unstandardised pre-weltkrieg rifles with very questionable reliability. To replace these and to ensure that at least our standing army is capable to enforce order in the entire realm, the directorate of military affairs has given the order to replace the dated arsenal."
JBS_revised_infantry_tactics:0 "Revised Infantry Tactics"
JBS_revised_infantry_tactics_desc:0 "Whilst foreigners might expect conflict on the Arabian subcontinent to be solely waged from camel or horseback, the tactics used in Arab warfare have just like in the West shifted towards a larger focus on large contingents of infantry. These groups need different tactics, a sort our commanders aren't used to as they still regard a war on foot as degrading and reserved for the tribes of lesser blood. "
JBS_curb_authorities:0 "Curb Authority of the Majlis al-Shura"
JBS_curb_authorities_desc:0 "Set up after the Weltkrieg under pressure from the urban nobility, inspired by the bureaucracy established by the Turks in Hejaz, the Majlis serve as a royal council with certain authority over matters of state. It has become apparent however that this institution only serves to enrich the men who take part in its meetings and is an insult to the monarchic right to rule. We will no longer tolerate this weakness!"
JBS_relinquish_power:0 "Relinquish Absolute Power"
JBS_relinquish_power_desc:0 "Although the Majlis have seen their power expanded since the 1910s, they still have only very limited control over the realm and mostly just an advisory role to the absolute monarch. Inspired by systems set up in the Ottoman Empire, predominately in the Hejaz, some have proposed a system wherein the Majlis serve more as a parliament or council of ministers with executive power than solely an advisory organ."
JBS_modernize_zakat:0 "Modernize Zakat Collection"
JBS_modernize_zakat_desc:0 "One of the 5 Pillars of Islam, the Zakat is a religious duty for all Muslims who can afford it. Serving as a mandatory, charitable contribution, it is in practice a thinly veiled tax and one that contributes to a significant part of our revenue. As collection however greatly depends on the local religious authorities, with questionable loyalty to the state, a modernisation of the practice is clearly in order."
JBS_settle_bedouin:0 "Settle the Bedouin"
JBS_settle_bedouin_desc:0 "Although detribilisation has been a major force in the Ottoman Mashriq and Egypt, Central Arabia due to its isolated nature and vast territory has seen very little effects of this. This means that the majority of our population is still of Bedouin nature and thus quasi independent from the state. If we are to govern effectively and wield a modern army, there can be no doubt about their future status."
JBS_rearrange_irrigation:0 "Re-arrange Irrigation Obligations"
JBS_rearrange_irrigation_desc:0 "In the arid deserts of Central Arabia, the real gold is not found in the mines of Hejaz but in the oases of the highlands. As water greatly determines the prosperity and survival of our citizens, control over water and more specifically the administrative structures that determine who can use how much is highly critical to the future of our state."
JBS_outlaw_slavery:0 "Outlaw Slavery"
JBS_outlaw_slavery_desc:0 "Although slavery was technically banned within the Ottoman Empire and by extension our lands, on the ground the practice has more than endured. Despite bringing us great wealth, we can't help but recognise that continuation of the practice closes more doors than its profits open. Furthermore, many of the lesser blooded tribes might see us in a friendlier light if we abolish the practice that long opressed them."
JBS_fight_wahabbist_influence:0 "Fight Wahabbist Influence"
JBS_fight_wahabbist_influence_desc:0 "Preaching from their ivory towers in Riyadh, the Ulemma of the Wahabbist sect have served as nothing more than the tools of their Emir in spreading hate, disunity and mistrust amongst the ranks of our followers. Their fatwas are sadly finding a willing ear amongst many of our susceptible citizens and if we don't take decisive action, the Wahabbist alliance will soon outgrow anything we can muster."
JBS_consolidate_ties_with_sharif:0 "Consolidate Ties with the Sharifians"
JBS_consolidate_ties_with_sharif_desc:0 "Both tied to the Sublime Porte, the Houses of Rashid and Hashmid have throughout their history from time to time entertained the most fragile of alliances. As they both see the forces of Najd and the Wahabbist Sect as a great danger to their rule and with the Hajj a key component of both Hashimid and Rashid policies, we should rekindle our old ties and form a strong constructive relation."
JBS_enforce_rashidi_nazim:0 "Enforce Rashidi Nazim"
JBS_enforce_rashidi_nazim_desc:0 "With multiple different law systems being used interchangeably, it is hard to maintain a just and stable society. To remedy this, some of our notables together with Ottoman legal experts have been commissioned to draft up a legal system based on the Turkish Nizamiye. Although there have been ideas that aimed at instilling it with a secular character, ultimately the Sharia (indirectly under the form of the Mecelle) will still be utilised as the baseline."
JBS_modernize_bureaucracy:0 "Modernize the Bureaucracy"
JBS_modernize_bureaucracy_desc:0 "As our state largely relies on Bedouin traditions, oaths and more often than not a firm handshake, it goes without saying that the efficiency of our bureaucracy (or more often lack of) has severly hampered the growth and adaptation of our realm to the everchanging world. Furthermore, Ottoman reforms in Sham and Iraq have started to spread towards Ha'il, causing great concern amongst its citizenfolk and instigating a call for reform."
JBS_install_qadhis:0 "Install Qadis"
JBS_install_qadhis_desc:0 "A Qadi is the magistrate of a Sharia Court. Although they in theory should apply these laws to the cases presented to them, Qadis are more often than not also representatives of the ruler in their region. The limited size of Ha'il has in the past made it subservient to Qadis from other powers in the region, be that Riyadh or Istanbul.

### Events ###
jbs.0.t:0 "The Emirate of Jabal Shammar"
jbs.0.d:0 "Founded on the ruins of the Second Saudi State, the great emirs of Ha'il build the foundations of the Rashidi state. That this state was to last only a few decades, until the ascent of Ibn Saud in 1904, was not foreseen but also inevitable as the brutal reign of the Shammari over the folk of Najd distanced the proud Rashidis from the main brunt of the Arabian population and economy. Through a series of battles, the Rashidi armies were pushed back first from Riyadh and later from all parts of the Arab interior until all they had left was their homeland in the region of Jabal Shammar.\n\nDifferent from the other Arab warlords however, the emirs of Ha'il maintained close relations with the Sublime Porte whom readily used them as the shield to defend their Southern flank. This relation would continue into the weltkrieg as whilst the Hashemites sided with Britain and the Saudis sided with themselves, the Emirs of Jabal Shammar put all their money on the Ottoman Empire, remaining loyal even during the empires darkest days. Whilst this loyalty was greatly rewarded after the war, it put a large target on the Rashidis who became seen as Ottoman lapdogs and traitors to the Arab cause.\n\nDespite 'victory' in the weltkrieg, the Emirate has not seen the fortune it hoped to acquire by siding with the Turks and although relations with Konstantiniyye remain warm, the industrial revolution and its spread to the Middle East have greatly harmed the already fragile Shammari economy. Reliant on pilgrims travelling through the Arab interior towards Mecca for their Hajj, the advent of steam ships, cars and most importantly the Ottoman rail network have struck massive blows to this ancient trade.\n\nBacked in by a prospering but apathetic Ottoman state and an expansionist Saudi state, the Emirs of Ha'il will have to reinvent themselves, seek new sources of revenue and maintain the loyalty of their remaining supporters or be definitively erased from the history books."
jbs.0.a:0 "May Allah guide us on our path!"

jbs.1.t:0 "Economic Woes In The Emirate"
jbs.1.d:0 "The Emirate of Jabal Shammar had long based its prosperity on the Hajj pilgrims travelling through Ha’il. Despite arguably being outside the modern capitalist system, the Westerner’s ‘Black Monday’ appears to have harmed the Caliphate in Constantinople and, thereby, the Emirate. With Hajj pilgrims in sharp decline and the Ottoman imports imploding, the Emirate has been hit hard. Very hard. Within the court, dissent has begun to sow with talks of the Emirs incompetence and it is possible that he may not survive the storm."
jbs.1.a:0 "Nothing will come of this of course."

jbs.2.t:0 "The Syrian Exchange Program"
jbs.2.d:0 "Essentially an Ottoman attempt at bringing Ha'il closer to the Ottoman center, the Maktab 'Anbar or the Damascus Civil Preparatory School has allowed 5 men from the Ha'il elite to enlist in their prestigious academy. Normally solely reserved for the Syrian Ottomanised elite as a preparatory school for the Mekteb-i Mülkiye (Imperial Civil Service School) in the capital, the idea is that the Shammar students will return home after completing their studies and assist in training and educating the people of Ha'il.\n\nThere has however been some opposition to the plan in Ha'il as many are weary of further Turkish influence in Jabal Shammar whilst others just plain doubt the need for reform in general."
jbs.2.a:0 "Good luck!"

jbs.3.t:0 "Abolishment of the Majlis"
jbs.3.d:0 "Originally created in 1922 as a compromise between the powerful al-Subhans and the house of Rashid, the Majlis al-Shura (Parliament/Royal Council) have ruled Ha'il to varying degree ever since. Their existence has been a major thorn in the side of the Rashidi Emir however who has not hid his disdain for the institution.\n\nBenefiting from an increase in instability on the Peninsula, the Emir has embraced the opportunity to rid himself of them all together. In cooperation with allies in the Shammar bedouin, the Emir has stormed the chambers with his followers and decreed an end to the 1922 Majlis al-Shura. In its place a Majlis al-tujjar has been set up, consisting of hand picked loyalists amongst the powerful merchant families of Ha'il."
jbs.3.a:0 "Long live the Emir!"

jbs.4.t:0 "The Conquest of Buraida"
jbs.4.d:0 "Unrest had been brewing in Qasim for quite a while now as rumours of a possible return to Buraida by the al-Muhanna family had become rampant. These rumours turned facts as a detachment of irregulars from the Ottoman Sixth Army in Iraq has, with the blessing of General Al Hashimi, been sent to Buraida in an attempt to restore the disgraced dynasty to power and expand Iraqi influence over central Arabia. Consisting solely of Arab soldiers, the deposed Emir hopes that this will increase his legitimacy in the eyes of the Buraidan people, but first reactions have been nothing but damning. Calling the dynasty Turkish lapdogs and godless traitors, Saudi loyalists in the city are receiving widespread popular support.\n\nBenefiting from the occasion however, our Emir has given the order to mobilise and strike the Saudis whilst they are dealing with the Iraqi threat. Whilst raids have been continuing on both sides for over a decade, the blatant attack on Saudi land has reignited a more active phase of the Arab conflict."
jbs.4.a:0 "The Final Confrontation is upon us!"

jbs.5.t:0 "Ottoman Army Withdraws"
jbs.5.d:0 "Despite fears of a successful Ottoman backed invasion of Central Arabia, a change of leadership in Baghdad has quickly dashed any hopes the Muhanna family had left. The new Governor, following orders from the capital, has immediately decreed an end to any operations in Central Arabia. Officially claiming it recognises Ibn Saud as suzerain of Qasim in the capacity of Ottoman governor and thus sees no need for intervention, the Iraqi administration has in practice been forced to evaluate its expenses and deemed it more cost efficient to abandon Central Arabia.\n\nThe wheels have, however, already been set in motion in Qasim and open war between Ha'il and Riyadh is now inevitable. As scimitars are sharpened and rifles loaded, the burning desert sun rises above a new Arabia."
jbs.5.a:0 "To War!"

## Ikhwan insurrection
jbs.6.t:0 "Unrest amongst the Ikhwan"
jbs.6.d:0 "Whilst the defeat of Ibn Saud has greatly damaged the standing of Wahabbism on the subcontinent, the Ikhwan remains a powerful force and has through their network of Hijras and tribal alliances proven a tough nut to crack.\n\nFaisal al Duwaish, leader of the Mutair and in the eyes of many the greatest commander of the Arab peninsula, seems unhappy with his position and even refused to visit Ha'il to swear fealty to our Emir, one of the gravest insults imaginable in the eyes of many Bedouin. Other disgruntled leaders amongst the Utaibah and the Ruwala are further complicating the situation as through their combined strength they are capable of surrounding our capital of Ha'il and cut us of from the Najd hinterland, our main basis for food and manpower."
jbs.6.a:0 "This is most disturbing..."

jbs.7.t:0 "Faisal al Duwaish Imposes Demands"
jbs.7.d:0 "Under the guise of protecting the monotheists but most likely just out of political opportunism and in an attempt to sway the minds of the settled population in Najd, Faisal al Duwaish has sent a list of demands to our Emir.\n\nMost notable amongst the 'crimes' our Emir has committed are the fact that in Ha'il traders and citizens of all religions are free to practice their own faith, in sharp contradiction to the dogma of the Wahabbists. Therefore the Ikhwan now demands that either we convert them all to the true faith or slaughter every last one of them. Furthermore they also demand an immediate end to our ties with the Porte and demand that we remove all Kaffir technology, such as the radio, from the Holy land as they are one of the gravest insults to Islam imaginable.\n\nIf these demands aren't met within the month, Faisal has sworn to uphold the wishes of the monotheists and free from the heretic yoke imposed by the House of Rashid. Stirred by all the commotion, tribes from all across the peninsula are taking note of the coming conflict and deciding for themselves whether they should back their Emir or use the opportunity to expand their own power in alliance with the Ikhwan."
jbs.7.a:0 "Then war it shall be!"

jbs.8.t:0 "The Ikhwan Revolt"
jbs.8.d:0 "Receiving a negative answer from the Emir, to the surprise of none, the Ikhwan and their coalition of like-minded tribes have raised their flag in rebellion. Led by the great general Faisal al Duwaish, backed by segments of the Utaibah and the Ruwala, the revolt was kicked of by an open assault on the city of Hufuf on the al-Hasa coast.\n\nDespite their best attempts, thusfar the city still stands and its largely Shi'ite population trembles with fear behind its walls in the hope that aid will soon arrive as none doubt that if the walls are breached a most gruesome faith awaits them."
jbs.8.a:0 "To war!"

## Pro-Saudi insurrection
jbs.9.t:0 "Wahabbist Ulemma Defame [JBS.GetLeader]"
jbs.9.d:0 "Whilst our conquest over Najd has driven the sons of Ibn Saud once more out of our rightful domains, we are powerless against the influence the Wahabbist Ulemma holds over the common folk of Najd. Refusing to relinquish their loyalty to the Imam, various towns and oases in Najd have been more than vocal in their resistance to their new Emir. From our side, there has also been little animus to cooperate with the Najdi as they are deeply looked down upon by our Shammari compatriots, seeing them as lesser people and only really useful for agriculture and auxiliary troops."
jbs.9.a:0 "Most disturbing"

jbs.10.t:0 "Confrontation in Qasim"
jbs.10.d:0 "Trouble has appeared in Qasim after a confrontation between a group of settled folk and our tax collectors turned violent when the settlers pleaded for a delay to this years' taxes. Pointing out the widespread destruction of the already fragile economy of Central Arabia, famine has erupted all throughout the subcontinent.\n\nOur tax collectors however weren't in the mood to negotiate and after one of the settlers, in a foolish attempt, tried to scare them off, fighting broke out between the two groups. Although the tax collectors were forced to flee, one of the Rashidi Princes took the whole ordeal as a grave insult to his House and commanded a raiding party into Qasim, raiding and pillaging themselves a way to 'glory and riches'.\n\nWhen the party returned home, satisfied with their loot, they had left in their wake a burning ruin and a starving population. Relations between the folk of Najd and the Shammari elite were already in shambles but many now fear that the Princes may have gone too far."
jbs.10.a:0 "It is only right that the Najdi know their place!"

jbs.11.t:0 "Riyadh Ousts the Shammari Garrison"
jbs.11.d:0 "Angered by the tyrannical rule of their Rashidi governor, a small group of Saudi loyalists have stormed our garrison in the Saudi capital of Riyadh and after a short fight retaken control over their city. Proclaiming Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud the new Imam of Saudi Arabia, messenger have been sent on the swiftest horses available to gather a warhost amongst those still loyal to the Saudis and to retake the throne, ousting the Rashidis once and for all."
jbs.11.a:0 "Not again..."

jbs.12.t:0 "Saudi Bannermen Answer the Call to Arms!"
jbs.12.d:0 "Reinvigorated by the swift recapture of Riyadh and angered by the Rashidi oppression of the Central Arabian hinterland, various Sheikhs and Bedouin have pledged their swords in support of the new Imam and have started to mobilise their own forces.\n\nAmongst those returning to their places next to Saud are the Anizzah, largest of Arab tribes, the Zafir, sworn enemies of the Rashidi Muntafiq allies, the Duwasir, the most loyal of all Arabs and a subsection of the Utaibah, proud warriors.\n\nWith a new coalition gathered, time will tell if the House of Rashid can withstand this final challenge or whether it will finally go into the night!"
jbs.12.a:0 "Once more unto the fray, dear friends!"

## Overthrowal of Saud (al Rashidi)
jbs.13.t:0 "A Meeting In The Desert"
jbs.13.d:0 "It had been some days since the Emir’s forces destroyed what remained of the Saudi’s lost to the sands of time. With the new possession looted of values, plans had been made for the Emir, now Supreme Ruler of Central Arabia to return to his capital of Ha’il. Somewhere along the way, the procession had stopped to rest for the night with Saud resting in his tent. His cousin, Abdullah, gazed over the horizon and the newly conquered lands. Saud had been crowned emir as a boy at 10, and a boy he remained, to Abdullah at least. He looked upon the stars before making way his way to the tent and entering unannounced.\n\n“My dearest cousin and magnanimous Emir.” His congratulatory smile was enough to mask his envy. “I come to congratulate you on the victory over Ibn Saud.” His cousin barely noticed his presence, with Saud gazing only after a few seconds. “You could have come sooner but I suppose you have finally made your presence known. Your flattery betrays you Abdullah, what is it you desire?” Abdullah’s smile dissipated, was he that easy to see through? He gave an awkward before returning to a slight grin. “Aha, if only my lord, but no, I come with a warning. It appears that the Saudi’s did not die with this final blow and have fled into exile, I hear they are making their way for Kuwait.” Saud’s face became more serious and he turned to his cousin. “I see, I see. History repeats itself, I will have to make arrangements then.” Abdullah let a small smirk emerge on his face. “And what will those arrangements be my Lord?”"
jbs.13.a:0 "I will send a detachment of guards to hunt for him. They will die by the sword of the desert!"
jbs.13.b:0 "I will lead the men myself and kill him once and for all!"

jbs.14.t:0 "Abdullah Returns To Ha’il"
jbs.14.d:0 "Taking with him but a small contingent of soldiers in his return to Ha’il, it appeared that the first part of his plan was in motion. With Saud distracted and lost in the desert on a wild chase, it was time to go further.\n\nThe Arabian night sky was truly captivating, complemented by a cool desert breeze. Abdullah was waiting behind a small shop in the centre of Ha’il, the merchant wouldn’t mind nor did he need to know. Like a silhouette on the night sky, a man cloaked in black entered the small yard and nodded to Abdullah. “You are the cousin of the Emir?” Abdullah nodded and shut the gate, visibly brandishing a pistol. “And you are the envoy of the al-Subhan family?” He nodded and the two men shook hands before taking a seat at a small table. Before any conversation took place, Abdullah placed his pistol on the table, his finger resting on the trigger. “The Emir...the Emir is not well.” The envoy raised his eye, confused. “This is why you wish to speak to my masters?” Abdullah nodded and looked over at the night sky. “News travels fast doesn’t it? We defeat the Saudis at Riyadh and soon the whole land knows of our success. Ibn Saud was beheaded and his body buried. Yet the Emir believes that the House of Saud will continue to haunt us, that the man we killed was only the beginning and that the exiled Saudi Princes should be hunted down and destroyed, a clear sign of his mercilessness. The Emir is fuelled by hatred and a desire for blood and if we let him continue unchecked, we may soon not have a realm left to rule.”\n\n“I suppose...and what do you propose to fix the King’s affliction?” Abdullah sniggered a little and shook his head. “There is no cure for such an illness. And with the King indisposed, perhaps it is time for a change of leadership…” The two chatted some more into the evening before shaking hands and bidding each other farewell."
jbs.14.a:0 "That devious Prince..." 

jbs.15.t:0 "The Mercenary Gambit"
jbs.15.d:0 "Fortunately for Abdullah, the Emirate and its predecessors were not fond of using Arab soldiers but rather Turkish and Egyptian mercenaries for their personal bodyguards. While skilled and experienced these men fought for money, not the King. And with the Black Monday situation taking effect on the royal coffers many of these men had not seen payment for some time. Assurances of the king are one thing but a bag of gold is another…\n\n“And you offer to pay double our pay too?” The captain looked shocked and pleasantly surprised in equal measure, his men had never heard of such splendour. Abdullah simply nodded with that same menacing grin. “Of course, if that is the price of your loyalty, then so be it. Though I trust you will not intervene in such family matters once this rotten business is all well and done.” The captain thought for a second before turning to his soldiers and back to Abdullah. “And how do you actually expect to pay us? Surely your personal wealth does not rival that of the King.” Abdullah nodded, his face remained unchanged. “The al-Subhan family are backing my campaign and have guaranteed that they will supply me with the initial payments. The rest will follow once I take over.” It was quite the offer, but could he hold his word?"
jbs.15.a:0 "The King returns at dawn, we will take action then."
jbs.15.b:0 "Your word is as fickle as your coffers. We will have no part in this."

jbs.16.t:0 "The Emir Returns"
jbs.16.d:0 "In the coming days, Saud returned to Ha’il with his men to be greeted by his cousin at the Royal Palace. “Do you return with the heads of our most feared enemies, my lord?” Saud paid him no attention and instead walked straight past him. Abdullah followed. “My lord, is everything alright?” Saud ignored him once more before sighing out aloud. “They must have escaped! Gone to Kuwait or Iraq or Yemen or some other blasted place!” Abdullah tutted before offering to leave and did as told, meeting with the mercenary guards. “The Emir has failed in his duties, leading a wild goose chase just to satiate his hunger for blood. It is time he was retired.” Turning to the door they entered and Abdullah drew his pistol pointing it at the Emir. “My cousin, you have failed in your duties to the Emirate. May Allah have mercy on you.” Before Saud could respond, a multitude of gunfire rang out and the Emir was killed where he sat.\n\n“Tell your men to secure the Royal Palace and then the city. It is no doubt that there are still loyalists to the old order.” The men nodded and rushed off, sporadic gunshots and shouts ringing out in the background. Abdullah holstered his pistol and gazed upon the palace gardens, this was all his now. Hearing footsteps he turned to see one of Saud’s servants brandishing a dagger, clearly still loyal to his deceased master. In a frenzy of rage he lunged at Abdullah aiming for his chest."
jbs.16.a:0 "Abdullah shoots him dead on the spot!"
jbs.16.b:0 "The servant stabs him through the heart!"

jbs.17.t:0 "The Coup Successful"
jbs.17.d:0 "Abdullah took a deep breath as he looked over the servant’s lifeless corpse, blood pooling on the floor and enveloping the dagger. Before he could holster his pistol, a group of the mercenary guards rushed into the room, their commander looking at the body in shock. “Prince Abdullah, are you alright? Are you hurt?” Abdullah placed his pistol on a railing, looking out over the gardens once more. “I’m fine...fine...I shot him before he could get to me.” He took a breath and holstered the pistol before looking at the guards. “What is the status of your men?”\n\n“We’ve seized most of the city, some men still loyal to Saud have seized houses on the outskirts but nothing we can’t handle.”"
jbs.17.a:0 "Finally, I am Emir…"

jbs.18.t:0 "Abdullah Killed!"
jbs.18.d:0 "Unable to reach for his gun in time, Abdullah was stabbed by the servant, the blade piercing his heart. Dying before he hit the floor, the servant quickly ran and escaped the palace as a few of the mercenaries rushed over to see their fallen master. Unsure of what to do the men quickly scattered from the palace to inform their comrades with some remaining behind to loot whatever valuables they could gain. With chaos spreading throughout the palace, all came to a halt with the sound of gunfire as the son of the sixth emir, Abdallah ibn Mitab ibn Abd al-Aziz, rallied his bodyguards and quickly surrounded the palace.\n\n“Surrender yourselves now for you are surrounded and perhaps I shall take mercy.” In the confusion, those guards still inside the building fired in defense only to be cut down as the Mitab’s guards stormed the palace. With the loyal soldiers having seized the palace, Mitab entered promising to spare those who had surrendered. After all, they were soldiers of fortune, why would they die for a dead King? “Those of you who have joined my side, I shall not betray you. And of course...I shall pay you. Be wary though, I shall not tolerate dissent.” It wasn’t exactly promising but the alternative was to die where they stood."

## Overthrowal of the House of Rashid
jbs.19.t:0 "Coup in Ha'il"
jbs.19.d:0 "Angered by the constant dismissal of advice from his nobility, the exuberant spending of the Rashidi princes and their overall disregard for the wellbeing of their non-Shammari citizens, a group of urban notables has forced a change in government in Ha'il. The current Emir, [JBS.GetLeader], left without the necessary allies to maintain his throne has been forced to abdicate and has been replaced by the more controllable Muhammad ibn Talal.\n\nThe Majlis, weakened by our Emir in an attempt to reassert the absolute power of the Rashidi family will regain their prerogatives and will also receive full control over the expenditures of the state, including the personal expenses of the Emir. To further reinforce the new empowered position this council will receive, a section of the Barzan Palace has been cleared of its Princely inhabitants and filled with the new offices of state.\n\nThe coup, funded and largely led by the powerful al-Subhan family, may however be the first step towards a more conclusive set of reforms mirrored on those in the Mashriq and Kuwait. Others fear that it is a gamble by the al-Subhans who may wish to supplant the Rashidi dynasty as the rulers of Ha'il."

jbs.20.t:0 "The Fall of the Rashidi Dynasty"
jbs.20.d:0 "Ever since the coup which installed Muhammad ibn Talal, the real power within Ha'il lay with the al-Subhan family whom through their connections and influence in the Majlis controlled every aspect of life within Jabal Shammar. Nevertheless it seems that the taste of power has now gone to their head as Saud al-Subhan, former regent of our young Emir, has taken the opportunity to crown himself Emir of Ha'il and finally rid himself of the coalition with the Rashidis his family has entertained for over five decades.\n\nWhether this move will prove wise is yet to be seen however as the continued weakness of the government in Ha'il has not gone unnoticed amongst the tribes of Najd. Furthermore, Konstantiniyye has refused to acknowledge the al-Subhan scion as the new Emir, reserving the title for a Prince of the House of Rashid. Backed against a Turkish anvil to the North and a Najdi hammer to the South, the future will tell if the city of Ha'il can save itself from collapse."

## War events
jbs.21.t:0 "Faisal al-Duwaish Refuses Call to Arms"
jbs.21.d:0 "Disaster has struck the ranks of Ibn Saud as the Mutair tribe of famous Arab general Faisal al-Duwaish has refused to answer the call to arms, opting to remain neutral in our conflict with the Rashidis. To make matters worse, he seems to have also persuaded allies in the Utaibah tribe to lay down their arms thus giving a massive advantage to our enemies in Ha'il.\n\nWhilst they are sure to be punished for their outrageous betrayal once we have laid Ha'il in ashes, we are as of now incapable of doing anything but to denounce their decision for the treason that it is."
jbs.21.a:0 "May he be trampled by a thousand camels for this insubordination!" 

jbs.22.t:0 "The Conquest of Buraida"
jbs.22.d:0 "Unrest had been brewing in Qasim for quite a while now as rumours of a possible return to Buraida by the al-Muhanna family had become rampant. These rumours turned facts as a detachment of irregulars from the Ottoman Sixth Army in Iraq has, with the blessing of General Al Hashimi, been sent to Buraida in an attempt to restore the disgraced dynasty to power and expand Iraqi influence over central Arabia. Consisting solely of Arab soldiers, the deposed Emir hopes that this will increase his legitimacy in the eyes of the Buraidan people, but first reactions have been nothing but damning. Calling the dynasty Turkish lapdogs and godless traitors, Saudi loyalists in the city are receiving widespread popular support.\n\nBenefiting from the occasion however, the Emir of Ha'il has given the order to mobilise and strike us whilst we are dealing with the Iraqi threat. Whilst raids have been continuing on both sides for over a decade, the blatant attack on Saudi land has reignited a more active phase of the Arab conflict."
jbs.22.a:0 "The Final Confrontation is upon us!"

jbs.23.t:0 "Ottoman Army Withdraws"
jbs.23.d:0 "Despite fears of a successful Ottoman backed invasion of Central Arabia, a change of leadership in Baghdad has quickly dashed any hopes the Muhanna family had left. The new Governor, following orders from the capital, has immediately decreed an end to any operations in Central Arabia. Officially claiming it recognises Ibn Saud as suzerain of Qasim in the capacity of Ottoman governor and thus sees no need for intervention, the Iraqi administration has in practice been forced to evaluate its expenses and deemed it more cost efficient to abandon Central Arabia.\n\nThe wheels have, however, already been set in motion in Qasim and open war between Ha'il and Riyadh is now inevitable. As scimitars are sharpened and rifles loaded, the burning desert sun rises above a new Arabia."
jbs.23.a:0 "To War!"

### Cultural Flavor Events ###
jbs.24.t:0 "Conflict in Medina"
jbs.24.d:0 "Skirmishes have broken out in the recently conquered city of Medina between the Urban dwellers and our Bedouin allies. Outraged by the luxury and decadence of modern life, a group of Bedouin started smashing mirrors and windows, burning books and doors and committed other acts of aggression towards the urban population.\n\nAuthorities were able to put a quick end to the hostilities but the incident once more proves the sharp differences between the population of the Hejaz, used to a modern life within the Ottoman Empire, and the desert dwellers of Central Arabia. Extremely protective of their isolated lifestyle, friction between the government willing to pursue at least some degree of modernisation and the bedouin has seen a steady rise the last few decades. Nonetheless the wheels of time keep moving and it is only going to be a matter of years before the Arabia of old definitively makes place for the 20th century."
jbs.24.a:0 "Most troubling"

jbs.25.t:0 "The End of Sabaism"
jbs.25.d:0 "Although paganism had almost entirely been extinguished under the dogmatic first Wahabbist State, a couple of small hold-outs survived spread across the deserts of Arabia. One of these last groups, the people of Jawf had embraced a semi-Sabaean worship with prayers to the sun and sacrifices to the dead.\n\nWith the entrance of modern forms of communication and a greater degree of centralisation, even these last few 'cults' have finally been forced to close. In their stead, the Hijras of the Ikhwan have established a tight hold on religious practices in Central Arabia, persecuting the 'non-monotheists' with the fervour only recent converts have."
jbs.25.a:0 "The word of Mohammed stands victorious"

jbs.26.t:0 "Unrest amongst the Bedouin"
jbs.26.d:0 "Whilst the House of Rashid could be seen as a compromise between the Bedouin character of the Shammar confederation and the urban dwellers of the great trade city of Ha'il, the overthrowal of the dynasty by the al-Subhan family has inflicted great wounds on this balance. The Bedouin, who adhere to their own customs and traditions hold power and honour in the highest regard and are repulsed by the constant backstabbing and intrigue of the court in Ha'il.\n\nNot hiding their disdain for the new, predominately urban regime, various leaders have refrained from coming to official state holidays, banquets and other obligations. Tax collectors and even the Ulemma find themselves losing grip on this highly mobile yet substantial part of the population as the Bedouin distance themselves more and more from the affairs of Ha'il."
jbs.26.a:0 "Eventually they shall see reason..."

jbs.27.t:0 "The Petroleum Affair"
jbs.27.d:0 "The arrival of the petroleum industry is still a recent arrival to the Middle East, starting with the discovery of oil in Iran during 1908. As the Weltkrieg showed the extreme importance of the black gold in the future of warfare and industry, the search for it was also intensified. Starting with the German-Ottoman-Dutch partnership in Mosul under the Turkish Petroleum Company, oil soon became extractable in commercial quantities in both Southern Iraq and Bahrain. Arab rulers from all across the peninsula have looked at these developments with great interest as the declining profits from the Hajj (due to Ottoman mechanisation and transportation) and the end of the pearl trade in the Arab Gulf have put the economy of the peninsula on the brink of complete collapse.\n\nThe rulers of Ha'il have noticed this trend as well and with the economic recession further strangling the already struggling pilgrim business, plans have been unveiled to sell concessions on the al-Hasa coastline to the highest bidder. Multiple companies from across the world have shown their interest after the success of similar operations in Bahrain.\n\nAt the forefront of bidders is the TPC which sees al-Hasa as a part of the Ottoman Empire and therefore part of their domain. Financial troubles and conflict between the various partners involved have caused concern amongst our ranks however at their capacity to quickly set up the necessary operations. Offers from the Dutch Shell and a joint German bid from DAPG and DEA AG seem more promising but could risk a confrontation with the Porte which may not be in our immediate interests."
jbs.27.a:0 "We shall go with TPC"
jbs.27.b:0 "We must find an independent partner!"

jbs.28.t:0 "Creation of the DAMAG"
jbs.28.d:0 "Despite diplomatic protests from the Sublime Porte, the concession for al-Hasa has been sold to a joint German-Dutch initiative. Called the DAMAG or Deutsch-Arabische Mineralöl AG, stocks in the new company have been distributed amongst the three signatories of the Damman Treaty. The Dutch Shell is to receive 20% whilst the German DAPG and DEA AG each take 35% of the cut. The remaining 10% will go directly to the treasury of our Emirate, coupled with an additional income for the Royal family until oil has been found in commercial quantities.\n\nDespite these initial promises, our state still has a long way to go before sustainable oil production can be achieved. Engineers from the DAPG have already started preliminary drills near the town of Damman, close to the island of Bahrain, but so far cave-ins and expensive accidents are causing more concerns than hopes for the newly established DAMAG."
jbs.28.a:0 "A toast to our new friends, may they make us fabulously rich!"

jbs.29.t:0 "Camel Racing in Ha'il"
jbs.29.d:0 "A tradition as old as history itself, camel racing has long been one of the most popular sports on the Arab peninsula. Although traditionally overshadowed by the more popular horse racing, our Emir has seems to have a preference for the ship of the desert and has in his unending wisdom given the commend to organise the first Ha'il Camel Cup. Starting near the center of Ha'il, the race goes around the castle of Hatim al-Tai to Jubbah before looping back and finishing with a grand finale before the Barzan Palace.\n\nAlthough various notables in the town are frowning on the idea, seeing the camel as strictly inferior to the horse, the Bedouin seem to have enthusiastically embraced the idea and applications have been flooding the registration bureau ever since its announcement."
jbs.29.a:0 "50 Rupees on Nabran!"

### Plot to restore the Rashidis
jbs.30.t:0 "Rashidi Prince Pleads for Assistance" #OTT
jbs.30.d:0 "With the powerful al-Subhan family taking control over the former Rashidi Emirate, many of the former princes of the House of Rashid have fled to the Ottoman Hejaz or Shammari sister tribes in Iraq and Syria. As they lick their wounds, having just suffered the most humiliating blow in their history and that so shortly after their victory over Ibn Saud, a plan has taken form between Prince Abdallah ibn Mitab ibn Abd al-Aziz al Rashid and the Ottoman authorities in Medina.\n\nSince the Caliph has refused to acknowledge the Subhani pretender in the office of Wali of Ha'il and Najd, he has thus branded the Subhani rule over the city as illegal and a rebellion against his divine rule. Although there is little appetite to send a fully armed Ottoman batallion into the Arabian interior, talks in the minister cabinet in cooperation with the Wali in Jeddah have come to the conclusion that limited support for the dethroned Rashidi prince is within the realm of possibility. The Prince, together with a group of loyalists, would be responsible for retaking control over his throne but fresh camels, a sizeable loan paid out in gold and some rifles from the Ottoman Sixth Army could be provided by the Turks.\n\nIn return for this support, the cabinet has however imposed on the Prince that he relinquishes his claims on the al-Hasa strip and that he after being restored to the throne hand over control to the administration in Basra."
jbs.30.a:0 "Give him our full support!"
jbs.30.b:0 "We will not waste precious resources on a fool's plan"

jbs.31.t:0 "Jeddah Backs Prince Abdallah ibn Mitab al Rashid"
jbs.31.d:0 "Shocked by the collapse of their puppet in Ha'il, it comes as no surprise that Ottoman authorities in the Hejaz have taken a keen interest in the regime change that occured only a few weeks ago. Prince Abdallah ibn Mitab al Rashid, who seems to have been elected by the Rashidi family council as the new Heir to the throne after the disgraceful exit of Muhammad ibn Talal al Rashid, has now reportedly found a willing ally in the Ottoman governor of the Hejaz and has been seen meeting him in his office in Jeddah. Although it is unlikely that the Ottomans will commit ground forces to an attempt for reconquest, our spies have nonetheless reported that the Rashidi Princes were "pleased" with the answer they received, indicating that some form of assistance is likely to arrive.\n\nThis situation is also opening up the al-Subhani family to unrest and division amongst the Central Arabian tribes as whilst many may not wish to fight for the Rashidis out of loyalty, a bribe (paid by Ottoman gold) could quickly tip the scales back in favour of the Rashidis and usher in the downfall of our ruling house."
jbs.31.a:0 "Call for Egyptian assistance!"
jbs.31.b:0 "Call a meeting of the tribes!"

jbs.32.t:0 "Ha'il Calls for Aid" #EGY
jbs.32.d:0 "Under fire from a possible Rashidi return to power, the now ruling house of al-Subhan has called on the Egyptian Sultan to provide him with assistance in the struggle to come. The al-Subhanis who long stood by and governed from the shadows recently decided to end the charade and deposed the last Rashidi Emir, formally ending the Rashidi state and replacing it by a Subhani one.\n\nWith the Sublime Porte outraged at the collapse of its puppets on the weak belly of its Empire, it is more than likely that they will mount an expedition to restore the fallen dynasty and thus reasserting their power over Central Arabia. Another Ottoman ally down however is of great benefit to our own designs on the Mashriq and as such it could be in our interests to prop up the Subhani regime, strengthening it with gold and armaments."
jbs.32.a:0 "Offer them a loan"
jbs.32.b:0 "No point wasting resources on a failure in the making"

jbs.33.t:0 "Egypt Sends Aid"
jbs.33.d:0 "Apparently deciding that it would be in their interests to support our regime, the Egyptian sultanate has extended a loan to our government to be paid back within 10 years. Paying out in gold, such as to allow us to directly bribe the tribes to choose our side, the first shipment arrived in al-Hasa only a few hours ago where it was greeted by three of the Emirs sons."
jbs.33.a:0 "We are grateful!"

jbs.34.t:0 "Egypt Stalls"
jbs.34.d:0 "Likely undecided whether they believe our regime has any chance of success against a Rashidi restoration, the Egyptian government has refrained from answering our requests. Whilst they don't refuse offering support, negotiations over the specifics of the arrangement have been dragged out with reports indicating that the government is keeping a close eye on the developping situation in Arabia."
jbs.34.a:0 "May Allah smite them!"

jbs.35.t:0 "The Battle for Ha'il"
jbs.35.d:0 "As rumours surfaced in Ha'il of Rashidi loyalists making contact with the Anizzah and the Howleitat, our Emir decided to act as soon as possible. Rallying his army, mainly consisting of settled folk from Ha'il, Buraida and Najd, he at the same time summoned the leaders of both disloyal tribal federations to the capital.\n\nFearful of retaliation for entertaining the presence of the Rashidis, both tribes pledged their allegiance to the Rashidi pretender and mustered their own forces. Although it is as of yet unclear, reports also indicate that the Harb, the Hutaim and the Awazim have chosen to side with the Rashidis whilst important subsections of the Shammar also refused the call to arms by their Emir. The Southern tribes seem to pose less an issue as both the Utaibah and the Ajman have pledged their swords to Ha'il although it is clear that they are expecting a large reward for their loyalty.\n\nAs both hosts gather near the city of Jawf, it has become clear that the future of Arabia will be decided today in fire and blood. Waving the banners of their camps, banging the military drums as loud as possible and chanting the songs of their ancestors, both sides crashed into eachother with formidable force in what may soon be regarded as the final cavalry battle in Arab history."
jbs.35.a:0 "The Rashidis win the day!"
jbs.35.b:0 "The al-Subhanis stand victorious!"

### Chaos in the Realm
jbs.36.t:0 "Succession Crisis in Ha'il"
jbs.36.d:0 "Succession in the Rashidi Emirate has always been a difficult matter as unlike many other Arab families, the Rashidi princes never managed to agree on the next leader of the family. This led to one of the most bloody family conflicts of the Middle East as brother stood against brother, uncle against nephew and sometimes even father against son. Assassinations, coups, murder and other crimes were rampant during most of our history as the title of Emir changed hands almost a dozen times in just a few decades.\n\nAn armistice to the conflict was called during the Weltkrieg as faced by a resurgent Saudi state, the Princes begrudginly agreed to recognise the ruling Emir and unite forces to secure the continued survival of the Rashidi state. The murder of our Emir by Abdallah has now however decisively broken the armistice, once more opening up the crown to the rule of the strongest. With the position of Ha'il in the reunited Arab state still feeble at best, it is likely that we will soon once more see fratricide on an industrial scale."
jbs.36.a:0 "With Saūd bin Abd al-Azīz's death, the thread of prophecy is severed"

jbs.37.t:0 "The Death of Zaid bin Talal al Rashid"
jbs.37.d:0 "The grim reaper had not long to wait for Zaid bin Talal al Rashid as this aging son of the second Rashidi Emir was torn to shreds in Ha'il today by a well placed assassination. The prince who became famous in Ha'il shortly after the Weltkrieg for importing the first automobile lived just long enough to also become the first casualty of a car bomb as his 1920 al-Fert Model T convulged into a fiery explosion just after 2 pm today. Travelling with one of his wifes and their young nephew, Abdullah, all three immediately died as the blast knocked out at least a dozen windows of the Barzan Palace.\n\nWhilst many had feared that a strike on one of the princes was inevitable after the recent coup, they still hoped that the princes might prove capable of finding a peaceful resolution. This last shred of hope has now both literally and figuratively been blown apart."
jbs.37.a:0 "A most regrettable loss"

jbs.38.t:0 "The Death of Faisal bin Hamud al Rashid"
jbs.38.d:0 "The second in what is likely becoming a long list of murders, Faisal bin Hamud al Rashid was murdered in his home in Ha'il today. This prince, one of the last sons of the Obeid line, had long given up any ambition on the throne but was likely targeted by a servant close to the throne out of fear that the line of Obeid might see a chance in the chaos to make their branch the dominant one in the family. Stabbed by a ornamental blade, a gift of the Kuwaiti Sheikh to Ibn Saud which was captured as a spoil of war during the conquest of Riyadh, the prince was found by his daughter Fatima in a puddle of blood when she returned from a visit to her grandmother.\n\nAlthough the Prince himself left no male descendents who may wish to take revenge for the loss of their father, it is not impossible that one of the other Obeidi princes may place a strike on the line of Abdullah bin Ali in retaliation."
jbs.38.a:0 "Another tragic loss for the family"

jbs.39.t:0 "The Death of Muhammad bin Abdulaziz al Rashid"
jbs.39.d:0 "Tragedy struck once more today as Prince Muhammad bin Abdulaziz al Rashid, brother of our former Emir also met his maker. The prince who had conceded the throne to his brother and stood by his side during his unusuallly long (for a Rashidi Emir) reign found his death during a visit to a subsection of the Shammar. Ambushed by unknown assailants, his horse was reportedly shot from under him and he himself after falling trampled by the assailants camels. A group of Shammari tribesmen found his body in the dunes early this morning, stripped naked and hideously deformed by the hoofs of camels.\n\nLikely the first real high-profile victim, as Muhammad could be seen as a real threat to the new Emir, many are starting to wonder whether the Emir himself will be the victim of the next attack."
jbs.39.a:0 "This is starting to get dangerous..."

jbs.40.t:0 "The Death of Abdullah bin Hamud al Rashid"
jbs.40.d:0 "The murderous rampage has now reached international levels as Abdullah bin Hamud al Rashid was murdered 20.000 feet above Diyarbakir. The aging prince who had grown tired of his brothers killings had recently pleaded to the Emir to put an end to the crisis but was shunned by him, believing that his conciliatory tone was nothing but an attempt to take the throne for himself. Believing his life in danger after this confrontation and hopeful that if not in Ha'il, he may find a listening ear amongst the Ottoman Turks, he travelled to Baghdad where he was allowed passage on a postal plane to the capital. This plane would prove to be his final trip ever as just after refuelling in Mosul, one of his co-passengers threw the prince out of the plane at high altitude.\n\nAlthough no one knows who ordered the attack, word has it in Ha'il that this murder has finally woken up the Emir and prompted him to take decisive action in the matter."
jbs.40.a:0 "Let us hope a solution is found"

jbs.41.t:0 "The Death of Faisal bin Saud al Rashid"
jbs.41.d:0 "The family crisis is reaching ever closer to the palace as Faisal bin Saud al Rashid, son of our former Emir, was shot in clear daylight on the streets of Ha'il today. The young man who was forced to watch on idly as his father was murdered in a coup not so long ago, seems to now have also met the same fate after rumours propped up that he was in talks with the Abda and Saiyah tribes. The palace, likely behind the succesful attack on the Princes life, seems to have preempted a possible coup and ordered the assassination of the last sons of Saud. Nonetheless they seem to have failed in this as Faisals brother, Obeid bin Saud al Rashid, was able to escape and is now rumoured to be taking refuge amongst the Abda.\n\nWith the threat of civil war all the more likely as the Bedouin place their bets on the Princes they prefer, the palace will have to come forth with an acceptable resolution to the conflict or risk their own heads."
jbs.41.a:0 "The time has come to summon the family!"

jbs.42.t:0 "End of the Succession Crisis"
jbs.42.d:0 "Although many of the Rashidi princes refused the invitation from the palace, afraid that by coming to Ha'il their own lives might be in danger, our Emir was nonetheless able to set up a decent sized family gathering. After an exchange of pleasantries, including a most humurous story about the camel of Abdullahs servant, conversation quickly moved on to the fratricide that has been plaguing Jabal Shammar these last few months.\n\nThe catastrophic loss of life, including the deaths of 5 Rashidi princes and the former Emir, have bled the family dry and seriously stiffled its ability to effectively govern its new state as governors, commanders and other representatives are picked off one by one. To put an end to this and to ensure the prestige of Ha'il remains intact, the family has for the first time in its history agreed upon an official line of succession. Our current Emir, although having taken the throne in an illegitimate way will be recognised by the entire family as the ruling head and his firstborn son will be recognised as his official heir, thereby bypassing the system of seniority which was officially still intact. To please the other Princes however, a royal council made up of solely family members is to be set up and this council will also serve as regents should our current Emir perish before his son is of age.\n\nAlthough not all Princes were overly thrilled with the new arrangement, Obeid bin Saud al Rashid sending a strongly worded letter comparing his Emirs character to that of a pile of camel dung, an overal agreement was reached and a new, hopefully permanent, armistice signed."
jbs.42.a:0 "The wisdom of our Emir knows no bounds!"

Whilst their sweet words could just as well have come from a snake, the message sent by the Emir is clear. If the Caliph will once more reward the Emir for his support in the wars to come, they will offer their swords and camels to the Sublime Porte. Should we, however, stop empowering the Rashidi dynasty, they will without a doubt switch sides and betray our trust.\n\nFurther confirming the suspicions of our government, the Emir has asked for substantial material support to build up his army and modernise his impoverished realm.

jbs.66.d:0 "Like the despicable weasles they are, the Turks have decided to double cross us and leave us hanging with no reward for our services."
jbs.66.a:0 "May Allah strike you down!"

jbs.67.t:0 "[JBS.GetLeader] Breaks Ties with the Sublime Porte"
jbs.67.d:0 "The power struggle at the court of Ha'il in the past few months has led to the fall of our pro-Ottoman allies in the region, making way for a new coalition of individuals who prefer paying lip service to the rhetoric of the Egyptian crown.\n\nThe Rashidi princes allied to our cause have been forced into exile and have taken their refuge with their Shammari allies in Iraq. Whilst we have little to fear of the regime of [JBS.GetLeader] due to its inherent instability and limited means, they still pose a sizeable threat to our civilian population in Eastern Syria and Southern Iraq who are sure to become subject to a new impetus of raiding and border conflicts. Further West, the Hejaz Railway may also come under fire and sightings of sizeable Bedouin hosts watching supply stations on its track have already been reported to the authorities in Medina."
jbs.67.a:0 "They are playing with fire..."

jbs.68.t:0 "The Porte Demands Compensation"
jbs.68.d:0 "With the royal House of al Rashid restored to the throne of Ha'il, representatives of the Porte in Iraq have demanded that we hold up our end of the bargain and immediately transfer authority over the al-Hasa strip to the governor in Baghdad. Although doing so will without a doubt result in a catastrophic blow to the prestige of our Emir, he has little choice in the matter as his weakened grip on the tribes of Arabia makes resisting the Porte an ardous ordeal."
jbs.68.a:0 "We have no choice..."
jbs.68.b:0 "After all...why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?"

jbs.69.t:0 "Ha'il Hands Over al-Hasa"
jbs.69.d:0 "Upholding their end of the secret bargain we struck, the Emir in Ha'il has reluctantly agreed with our demands and commanded handover of the al-Hasa strip to our representatives on the ground. The strip, lost to the Saudis in 1913 has now finally been returned to the authority of the Caliph and will serve as a vital base of operations for any forrays into Arabia or the Arab Gulf."
jbs.69.a:0 "Congratulate our allies with their victory!"

jbs.70.t:0 "Ha'il Refuses Demands!"
jbs.70.d:0 "Despite the secret deal we struck in Jeddah clearly outlining the transfer of al-Hasa back to the Imperial Crown after the victory of the Rashidi Princes over the Subhani usurpers, the Emir has decided to disregard this agreement and to reinforce al-Hasa with men loyal to his regime. Although the Emir must surely realise that by doing so he has risked the ire of the Sublime Porte, it seems he is set to continue in his foolhardiness."
jbs.70.a:0 "He is playing a dangerous game!"

jbs.100.t:0 "The Hutaim Answer Call to Arms!"
jbs.100.d:0 "Fearful of the Ikhwan and the Wahabbist rhetoric of the Saudis, Dulaim ibn Barrak has kept his promise to the Princes of Ha'il and personally led a subsection of his tribe to our capital to assist in its defence.\n\nWhilst we can more than use their assistance in the battles to come, various other tribesmen gathered outside the walls of Ha'il looked on with disgust as they see the Hutaim as an inferior species not fit for battle."
jbs.100.a:0 "Welcome friends!"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ALI_SHIRE_DESC:0 "Having taken up the throne of the Warsangali Sultanate in 1897 after a protracted power struggle with his father Gerad Cali Shiire, he descends from a line of kings that has lasted almost 600 years in the Horn of Africa. While being nominally subservient to British interests, Maxamuud Cali Shiire's support of Abdullah Hassan, the Mad Mullah, was crucial in defeating Italy in Africa during the Weltkrieg. A savvy political navigator, Maxamuud has united the sultanates of Somalia under a federal monarchy under his nominal leadership; but can a man who declared war against his own father for power be trusted not to infringe on constitutional prerogatives?"
POLITICS_BARRE_DESC:0 "A Marehan Darod hailing from the Ogaden, Siad Barre has always been a competent and enthusiastic officer. He is uncommonly young and surprisingly vicious with his enemies, and his ideological inflexibility certainly comes from his training from members of the Muslim Socialist Committee. His vision of a Somalia united beyond clan bonds is one that is bound to find resistance at every level of Somali society."
POLITICS_HAAJI_MAHAMMAD_DESC:0 "Haaji Mohammed is the chief among a group of officers and intellectuals who defend the concept of a Greater Somalia above all else, and the unification of the people under one purpose. Despite his deep admiration for Abdullah Hassan, his group seeks completely detach Islam from the state, and such a measure is bound to unpopular at many levels of society."
POLITICS_JAMA_QUALIB_DESC:0 "Jama Abdullahi Qalib is a young liberal hailing from Hargresia. His faith on liberalism as the way to Somalia's future is admirable, but his readiness to work with foreigners has raised concerns on the populace, and so have his liberal ideas on the complete secularisation of the state"
POLITICS_ADEN_ADDE_DESC:0 "Born in 1909 in Beledweyne, Aden Abdullah remembers very well how it is to grow up under the thrall of Colonialism. His studies bring him closer and closer to Syndicalist ideologies, which he believes fit Somalia well; each clan is a trade union which works best autonomously, but most cooperate with its neighbours. He has been strongly influenced recently by French scholarship on matters of decentralised leadership, and hopes that he can ensure that Somalia's rough recent years can culminate in something good on the long run."
POLITICS_SHERMAKE_DESC:0 "A Majarteen from Mudog, Ali Shermarke is a competent young scholar, well versed in both Islamic, Federal and foreign laws. He wishes for a non-aligned and peaceful foreign policy, but his wishes may very well be overturned by the influences foreign powers exert now on Somalia."
POLITICS_BASHIR_YUSUF_SOM_DESC:0 "Hailing from the Osman Mahmoud clan of the Majarteen, Yusuf defends a more democratic and equal Somalia, even if he lacks the fervour for change that many of his colleagues do. His hopes are of a Somali Democratic Federation where the small clans and the city folk alike have their voices heard by the powers that be, and vows to fight poverty on rural areas of the nation."

### Ideas ###
SOM_iron_fist_of_warsangali:0 "Iron Fist of Warsangali"
SOM_iron_fist_of_warsangali_desc:0 "Warsangali is the leading state within Somalia, with its power base strong alongside deep German and Ottoman foreign ties dating to the Weltkrieg. While the capital is nominally in Mogadishu, much of the actual decision making is made in Las Khorey, and those who defy it are swiftly silenced."
SOM_gendarmerie_idea:0 "Soomaali Gandarmaariiga"
SOM_gendarmerie_idea_desc:0 "Based on the western gendarmeries, the Soomaali Gandarmaariiga ensure that the peace and safety of the Kingdom are not threatened or harmed by radicals or other sorts of troublemakers; Anarchists and other deviants beware!"
SOM_theclanassembly:0 "National Assembly of Clans"
SOM_theclanassembly_desc:0 "Each clan, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, now has the power to elect either one or two councilmen for the newly founded National Assembly of Clans, which serves as a lower house and is beneath the House of Lords."
SOM_xeer_checked:0 "Xeer In Check"
SOM_xeer_checked_desc:0 "Xeer, or customary law, has always been something of a legally grey area. However, we will restructure it in such a way that will allow each state and clan to regulate its own laws to a certain extent. However, locally created laws shall remain beneath Somali State Law and this will, therefore, end the contradictions and loopholes that had existed prior to reform."
SOM_HANGASH:0 "The Hangash"
SOM_HANGASH_desc:0 "The newly founded Hay'adda Nabad Gal'yada Gaashaandhiga, or Hangash for short, is a Military Intelligence Unit designed to keep the balance of peace and harmony in the Kingdom of Somalia. The Boqor is now able to directly protect his subjects."

SOM_foodplease:0 "Food Shortages"
SOM_foodplease_desc:0 "The prosperity Somalia has experienced, with regards to urbanisation, foreign investment, and cultural renaissance, has not been without its downsides. The growing population, military, and the lack of less able farming hands means that food shortages, while somewhat uncommon, still factor into rural life in Somalia."
SOM_lesshunger:0 "Food Shortages Under Control"
SOM_lesshunger_desc:0 "Measures are now being taken in order to end famine in Somalia. We have begun by increasing the amount of arable land and have also begun purchasing foreign grain and foodstuffs."
SOM_nohunger:0 "No More Hunger"
SOM_nohunger_desc:0 "Whether it'd be urban or rural life, famine is now no longer a problem within Somalia. Finally, it seems as though our future is bright."
SOM_BM:0 "Black Monday Hits the Horn"
SOM_BM_desc:0 "Despite sparing us from much of its harsh effects, the ripples from Black Monday that had reached Somalia caused enough damage to wipe out our, admittedly, sparse industry as well as ruin our foreign investments, due to panic from investors. If we do not act fast, this could cause long term instability and lead to our downfall!"

SOM_osmanya:0 "Osmanya Alphabet Endorsed"
SOM_osmanya_desc:0 "Cusmaan Yuusuf Keenadiid, the Suldaan of Hobyo, is a well learned man who had designed a new script for the Somali language.

We shall endorse and expand upon it as to adopt it as the official script of the Somali language."
SOM_osmanya_2:0 "Osmanya Alphabet Endorsed"
SOM_osmanya_2_desc:0 "Cusmaan Yuusuf Keenadiid, the Suldaan of Hobyo, is a well learned man who had designed a new script for the Somali language. While his alphabet has received widespread acclaim and is used within various universities, academies, and other institutes, until recently, it was not used in daily Somali life. Thanks mostly to our efforts to encourage his alphabet and the offering of state-sponsored scholarships to prodigal students, the alphabet has begun to spread to the general populace."
SOM_university_rush_get_ballistics:0 "Officer and Soldier Academies"
SOM_university_rush_get_ballistics_desc:0 "Our military officers, both well known and unknown, now have greater education opportunities and new benefits available to them. This will both improve the quality of our NCOs while incentivising prospective officers to join the army."

SOM_strenght_desc:0 "While the prosperity and development of Somalia have been astounding, Ali Shire had made sure to follow a 'let sleeping dogs lie' policy in terms of politics. Meanwhile, Somalis had rejoiced, basking in their freedom, unquestionably of the primacy of Las Khorey. However, news of administrative reform in Ethiopia and Egypt have convinced the Boqor that reform are, indeed, required."
SOM_gendarmerie_desc:0 "Maintaining order has been traditionally entrusted to local militias. The chief of each militia was entrusted with looking after the people. However, in order to better ensure peace and prosperity in the empire, we must outfit a force of men who are capable of containing riots, protests, revolts, and crimes. This new force will be known as the Soomaali Gandarmaariiga, based off of their western counterparts."
SOM_negotiate_desc:0 "The administrative model of the German Empire is an enlightened one and has pleased many of our Sheiks, Suldaans, and other rulers. The Boqor will rule as First Among Equals and every clan, no matter how small, will make up Somalia, each a federal unit."

A young general and Pan-Somali Left-Nationalist with a penchant for corruption and authoritarian militarism, Barre is expected to drive Somalia and the rest of the Horn towards Marxist-inspired Communism and Pan-Somali Nationalism as he tries to sate his own lust for power and wealth along the way while attempting to figure out what to do with Somalia’s traditionally tribal society."

SOM_Modernize_Somalia:0 "Modernizing Somali Society and Culture"
SOM_Modernize_Somalia_desc:0 "One of the main goals of the SRSP and the SRC has always been to modernize Somali society, culture, industry, and general way of life, for Somalia has long been plagued by stagnant traditionalism and backwards conservatism. With Barre now in power, his party is free to pursue just that, and they shall do so without impunity. The archaic Somali society and culture shall be forged into a modern Socialist state, supported by Marxist teachings, a latinized script and writing system centered around the old Osmanya script, a modernized language, a new modernist culture, and Somali nationalism to create a new and wholly modernized vision of Somali socioeconomics and day-to-day life under Barre’s one-party state."

SOM_Vanguardism:0 "Vanguardism Under the SRSP"
SOM_Vanguardism_desc:0 "The SRSP, with roots in Marxist thought and Leninist teachings, is a Vanguard party at heart. They are the vehicle that shall drive the Somali Proletariat towards greatness, equality, and prosperity, and so their will must be followed at all times while their numbers must ever-expand until all within the state are a member of the Vanguard. Party members will receive special benefits and privileges as incentives while they help guide wider Somali society towards the perfectionist gaia that Scientific Socialism can bring, and all Somali proletariat shall eventually cry out with glee as they are sheparded towards Marxist majesty under Barre and the one-party state apparatus of the SRSP."

SOM_Cooperative_Agriculture:0 "Proliferate Cooperative Agriculture"
SOM_Cooperative_Agriculture_desc:0 "Part of the platform of the SRSP is to implement Marxist collectivism and cooperative agrarianism into the agricultural industry of Somalia, in the hopes of increasing efficiency and output while also better providing for the needs and wants of our farmers and other agricultural laborers. Our farms and ranches shall be reorganized along collectivist lines, all in line with the teachings of Marx and Lenin. Though the tribal farmers and shepherds might resist at first, they shall eventually yield, for we know best for our people, and under the guidance of the SRSP, Somalia’s agriculture shall be modernized, mechanized, and made more efficient unlike ever before."

SOM_Nationalization_Spree:0 "Mass Nationalization Spree"
SOM_Nationalization_Spree_desc:0 "In order for the SRSP and the Barre administration to adequately administer our national economy, their regime will have to have complete control over the economic system. To this end, the Somali economy shall be rapidly nationalized in its near-entirety, putting most economic power and force of control into the hands of the national government. With the economy entirely controlled by the capital and their lackeys, Somalia shall rocket towards modernity and Socialist prosperity, for Barre wills it!"

SOM_National_Security_Service_desc:0 "The National Security Service of Somalia is the primary intelligence agency in the nation, created by Barre himself who uses the NSS as his own personal hit-squad and secret police force. With these connections already deeply established, we shall work to ensure that the NSS has no barriers or roadblocks as they seek to utilize the power given to them in order to keep Somalia and the Barre regime safe. As an official arm of the national government that answers directly to Barre without question, the Revolution and the Pan-Somali dream shall be kept safe as law and order are secured by the NSS."

SOM_Anti_Tribalism:0 "Stick to Anti-Tribalism"
SOM_Anti_Tribalism_desc:0 "Barre’s administration started on a policy of anti-Tribalism or anti-Clannism, and we shall stick to this platform. The archaic tribal system of societal and social organization shall be eroded and slowly destroyed, replaced with modern systems of societal organization created with Socialist modernity and the realities of Somalia in mind. Though this shall enrage the traditionalists, this matters not, for Somalia shall be freed from the shackles of the past as Socialism drags us to the future under Siad Barre."

SOM_Embrace_Tribal_Structure:0 "Drift Back to the Tribal Structure"
SOM_Embrace_Tribal_Structure_desc:0 "Reversing his initial anti-Tribalist policy, Siad Barre has decided to work with the pre-existing tribal structures in order to solidify his power base and to ingratiate himself with the faltering traditionalist elements that chafe under his regime. Together and united, we shall march forward supporting Clannism for the good of our shared Pan-Somali goals as the long-existing tribes help to cement Siad Barre’s administration and hold on power for good at the cost of some traditionalist compromises."

SOM_Social_Exceptionalism:0 "Somali Social Exceptionalism"
SOM_Social_Exceptionalism_desc:0 "With our Pan-Somali identity reaffirmed, we must promote ideas of Somali exceptionalism in order to prove to all that we truly are the Chosen of Marx. The Somali race and culture is the greatest on Earth, and now supported by the egalitarian glory of Marxism, we have been able to share this glory with all of our citizens as the rest of the world watches on in jealous agony.

Yielding to the allure of corruption, graft, and more, the kleptocratic red general shall now shape Somalia in his own image in order to sate his base desires and selfish ambitions, trading the Pan-Somali dream for his own pompous paradise."

SOM_Afweyne_Fiefdom:0 "Afweyne’s Fiefdom Under Faqash"
SOM_Afweyne_Fiefdom_desc:0 "Nicknamed Afweyne as a child on account of his extrovertedness, Siad Barre has fully capitalized on this ambitious and attention-seeking reputation, working to create his own personal fiefdom out here on the Horn utilizing his own ideology of Faqash - an expansionist, authoritarian, and self-serving thoughtform centered around the idea of appeasing the chosen masses with faux-Socialism while using any means necessary to maintain power and to crush any enemies of the state. Named phonetically after the sound of Barre’s loyalists squishing through the Northern mudflats in their military boots, Faqash calls for the class and clan-based hierarchy and class systems to be enforced, and entire populations are to be oppressed and subjugated if need be to fit Barre's vision for the Somali state. All of Somalia now yields to Barre’s endless desires and insatiable wishes as the kleptocratic red general works to bend all of Somali society and the Horn at large to his will and want, and should he be successful, the rest of East Africa shall yield as well."

SOM_Securing_Social_State_desc:0 "Under the command of Maxamed Siyaad Barre, Somalia has begun its own journey into Socialism and societal reform by the will and whim of our great leader.

Though their original movement died out in 1920, we honor their spirit and ideas in the platform of the GSL. Espousing the same anti-foreigner and Pan-Somali message the Dervishes once did, we shall take up their torch and work tirelessly to free Somalia from caustic aliens and virulent imperialists, creating a solely-Somalian Somalia only for true Somalis."

With the tribes and clans by our side, we shall never falter as we work to unite the Horn!"

SOM_New_Ajuuraan_desc:0 "Saldanadda Ajuuraan, or the Ajuran Sultanate, was one of the many different independent sultanates of pre-unification Somalia, existing from the 13th Century to the 17th Century and standing as one of the most prosperous and famous pre-modern Somali states. Though the royal line of this sultanate is long gone, the glory and prestige of this fiefdom are far from dead. As such, Husseen has seen it fit to remodel the modern Somalian state along Ajuuraan lines, creating a new Ajuuraan state bonded together by faith in Allah and dedication to a non-exclusionary Pan-Somali identity."

Whether this idea is correct or not is not up for debate, for the Somali state has become a paradise for Somalis and Arabs alike.

SOM_Moderate_Pan_Somali:0 "Foster Moderate Pan-Somali Nationalism"
SOM_Moderate_Pan_Somali_desc:0 "Though we share ideas of Pan-Somali Nationalism with our former allies in the Greater Somalian League, we split for a good reason. Their ideas are far too reliant on violence, bloodshed, and shortsighted conflict, which openly flies in the face of the moderate form of the Pan-Somali dream we preach ourselves.

Allied princes, imams, nobles, and lesser sultans stand united as one in a pseudo-party of royalists and aristocratic autocrats unified in defense of Islamic traditionalism and Somalian conservatism.

Deeply motivated by his time fighting foreign interests during the Dervish conflicts, he is now supported by his loyal allies like the lesser king Cismaan III Maxamuud and Sheikh Mukhtar Mohamed Hussein, along with their cabal of loyal nobles and clergymen, and as such Bogor Mohamoud Ali Shire will defend Somalia from the dangerous influences of Clannism, Nationalism, and the decadent West as he transforms the de facto tribal federation of Somalia into a truly centralized and modernized absolutist sultanate."

SOM_Unfettered_Monarchism_desc:0 "Standing as the unmatched sovereign and sultan, or Bogor, of the Somali monarchy, as the leader of the dominant Warsangali clan, and as the highest spiritual figure in the nation, Bogor Mohamoud Ali Shire is Somalia’s link between Jannah and Earth. With these powers and titles, he stands as the most powerful man in Somalia, for his word is law above all other decrees save for the word of Allah itself. As the beacon of Islamic faith and Somali national pride and tradition in the nation, the Bogor must be protected and obeyed at all times, and in return, he shall deliver us to paradise."

SOM_Royalist_Party:0 "Victory of the Royalist Party"
SOM_Royalist_Party_desc:0 "Standing in recent elections in order to secure their faltering interests, the aristocratic elements of Somalia have banded together into a political coalition called the Royalist party, and have used their combined resources and influence to seize power in Somalia once again.

The clans and tribes of Somalia shall be honored, with all their little kingdoms and sultanates and with all of their special privileges and powers, but only if they swear loyalty to the new state and to our regime.

SOM_Proud_And_Moral_desc:0 "Drawing influence from the Dervish movement that sought to create a pious Somali state free of British, Italian, and French influence - going so far to even take German support which has influenced our policy minorly - we have created a proud, pious, and moral Somali state supported by aristocratic excellence, moderate non-violent patriotism and nationalism, and the Muslim faith. Though we still have much work to do to reassert the new status quo as we were forced to modernize in the wake of our new foes, we have come a long way in our goal of creating a new traditionalist Somali state."

SOM_Arabic_Primacy_desc:0 "In order to draw closer to the rest of the Muslim world while furthering our centralization efforts, we have moved to support the clergy in their goals of making Arabic the main language and writing system of the Somali government. Though this will anger those traditionalists linked to the old scripts like the Osmanya script, it will further ally us with the Islamic clergy while also going a long way in further linking us to the rest of the Arab world and allowing the central government to more easily dictate and dominate all of Somalia."

SOM_Caliph_Horn_desc:0 "We now stand as the caliphs of the Horn; the unofficial religious leaders of Muslims in Pan-Somalia and the dominant Islamic power in the region, and de facto defenders of the faith. We are the sword and shield of local Muslims, and their last line of defense against the heretical Coptics and Jews of Ethiopia or the remaining colonial Catholics and Protestants.

### Events ###

som.1.t:0 "United We Stand!"
som.1.d:0 "The multiple states of Somalia were preyed upon by colonists and, in the eyes of the international community, we were seen as weak. We had fallen, divided, with brother against brother. However, after Abdullah Hassan's astounding victories over the Italians during the Weltkrieg, Italy had completely withdrawn from Somalia and the Sultan of Warsangali had, in all but name, slipped from British control as they were preoccupied with fighting the Germans. The Peace with Honour, officially concluding the Weltkrieg, paradoxically made Somalia free while remaining a protectorate of Britain due to Ali Shire's treaties. This status-quo, which had benefitted both parties, did not last for long, however, as the British Empire had collapsed. In a moment of what some may call opportunism, Warsangali's forces seized what was left of British Somaliland and the lords allied to him proclaimed him Bogor, or emperor, of Somalia. However, he sought to style himself as King of Somalia in the West as a way to court the monarchs of the Central Powers while recognising the ultimate authority of the Caliph. Prosperity followed for Somalia, with our fields growing rich and our cities larger. In addition, we'd managed to secure control over Ogaden in spite of the opposition from Ethiopia. Our roads, books, and universities are all symptoms of this event which has been dubbed the Somali Renaissance, but great danger may lie ahead for the wise understand that good times cannot be maintained indefinitely. Halie Selassie eyes our great nation enviously and Mittelafrika's new Statthalter remains diplomatically unapproachable. Whatever the future may hold, we can sit content with the fact that we have seized every possible opportunity presented to us and, together as one, leading Somalia to a better and brighter future."
som.1.a:0 "We stand on the shoulder of giants!"
som.2.t:0 "Black Monday has reached Somalia!"
som.2.d:0 "Even though Black Monday has done minimal damage to Somalia, especially when compared to the nations in Europe, we've still been hit by this economic crisis. Our valued trading partners are no longer willing to trade and our people are growing discontent, worried about what the future may hold. If we do not act quick to remedy the situation, this new attitude that has developed may make an economic downturn all but certain!"
som.2.a:0 "Uh oh..."
som.3.t:0 "Somali Legislative Elections are Called!"
som.3.d:0 "The elections for the Lower House of the Somali assembly will be helpful in terms of gauging the influence and power of the various factions within the House of Clans, followed by the House of Lords. The Prime Minister from the winning party shall be appointed by the Bogor, as set forth by the constitution. Three factions have a realistic shot at winning: The Pan-Somali focused Somali Youth League’s conservative clannist wing, the SYL’s liberal islamist wing still dedicated to the Pan-Somali cause, and the Royal Party, which functions mostly as the democratic representatives of the Bogor and other aristocrats, though its leader holds some ambitions of his own. The people have cast their votes, and the winner is..."

som.3.b:0 "The Liberal Islamist wing of the SYL have won the elections."
som.3.c:0 "The Conservative Clannist faction of the SYL have won the elections."
som.3.e:0 "A unity coalition within the SYL wins out in a surprise win."
som.4.t:0 "The Hangash have captured subversive elements"
som.4.d:0 "It would be unwise to share more details, my Lord, but suffice to say these terrorists were planning to ruin Somalia from within and sell its fortunes to foreign invaders. Don't worry, however, as the threat has been dealt with."
som.4.a:0 "Excellent."
som.5.t:0 "The Referendum"
som.5.d:0 "The people are ready to approve of our reforms and confirm our status as the supreme rulers of Somalia. The no campaign has, shocking, ran into many 'difficulties' and therefore a win is all but certain. All that is left is to commence the celebrations!"
som.5.a:0 "Everything is going as predicted."
som.6.t:0 "Clan Argument!"
som.6.d:0 "Two major clans have found themselves embroiled in a disagreement during a session in the House of Lords. Both have begun the boycott of the others' actions and a political crisis is beginning to brew."
som.6.a:0 "This is not good!"
som.7.t:0 "Hassan and the History books"
som.7.d:0 "Mohammed Abdullah Hassan or, as he is known abroad, the Mad Mullah was the one who'd successfully defeated the British and Italian imperialists during the Weltkrieg and had secured Somali sovereignty and freedom for generations to come. However, Hassan himself possessed an aversion to personal representation and was an iconoclast who believed that photos would steal and trap his soul. The fact of the matter is, we do not possess the information needed to properly portray him, bar second hand accounts. How shall our history books portray him?"
som.7.a:0 "Carefully; we wouldn't want to steal the soul of such a great man..."
som.8.t:0 "Educational success!"
som.8.d:0 "Our new curriculum has gained a surprising amount of traction, with thousands of children learning the alphabet set forth by the government. The Osmanya script will surely impact Somalia for the better and help popularize our rule."
som.8.a:0 "Every poet began with a single word."
som.9.t:0 "Hasnah Doreh Brigade"
som.9.d:0 "To the shock of conservatives, a group of young, educated women and their husbands have organised themselves into a brigade to fight for Somalia. They call themselves the Hasnah Doreh Brigdade and are named after the wife of Abdullah Hassan who'd allegedly fought alongside him."

som.11.t:0 "The Victory of Barre’s SRSP"
som.11.d:0 "Gunning down the Bogor and his family while dismantling the sultanate’s governmental apparatus, Siad Barre, the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council have worked feverishly to consolidate their grip on Mogadishu, and it would seem that their hard efforts have finally paid off. The jewel of Somalia and the urban heart of the nation is now controlled by the SRSP, and the rest of the nation shall soon follow. There is nothing stopping the young Red General Siad Barre from bringing Marxist utopia to the Horn now, so let us be the true heralds of the Pan-Somali cause as we bring the Marxist future to this archaic land, ever-fueled by Barre’s insatiable ambition."

som.12.d:0 "Gunning down the Bogor and his family while dismantling the sultanate’s governmental apparatus, Haaji Mahammad Husseen and the Greater Somalia League have worked feverishly to consolidate their grip on Mogadishu, and it would seem that their hard efforts have finally paid off. The jewel of Somalia and the urban heart of the nation is now controlled by the GSL, and the rest of the nation shall soon follow. There is nothing stopping the herald of Pan-Somalian thought Mahammad Husseen from bringing conservative and pious nationalist utopia to the Horn now, so let us be the true heralds of the Pan-Somali cause as we bring the prosperous future to this archaic land, ever-fueled by Husseen’s nationalistic fervor and piety."
som.12.a:0 "Under Allah, we will achieve the Pan-Somali dream."
som.13.t:0 "Khat Tax?!"
som.13.d:0 "Khat is a major plant within Somalia. Everywhere, men can be seen chewing its leaves in bazaars, mosques, and even schools. Some have argued that since we now have control over what can be planted, we should tax the plant in order to profit off of it and control its export abroad. However, this will almost certainly be an extremely unpopular measure, especially in our rural regions."
som.13.a:0 "Tax and export it it; its not like the demand will lower!"
som.13.b:0 "Taxing such an important plant can only hurt us."

som.14.t:0 "The Direction of Barre’s Revolution"
som.14.d:0 "As Siad Barre has worked to consolidate the state and further the Revolution, how exactly he should go about such a massive societal change has been called into question. Barre has long been a Leftist inspired by Marx, and has devoted himself for years to Marxist causes, the ideas of Lenin, and the ideology of Communism at large, adamantly denying the new wave of Syndicalism in disgust. Setting up the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party as a vanguard organization, he has longed to turn Somalia over to the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, this push has put him at odds with the tribes and familial clans that have long dominated Somali society. Usually an opponent to these forces, Barre has increasingly yielded to or sided with tribalist internets as of late, spitting in the face of his Marxist roots in order to earn the loyalty of Somalia’s traditionalist masses and along with them, the Pan-Somalian majority. \n\nJustifying this shift by stating that his old Marxist tendencies may become corrupt with Syndicalist Liberalism, Barre may fully jump ship from his Leninist foundation. Further fueling this shift is Barre’s own greed and blind ambition, revealing kleptocratic and other selfish tendencies that the Red General struggles to continue to hide. All in all, Siad Barre is a diverse revolutionary now torn in several directions, and only he can choose which final path he shall take."
som.14.a:0 "Stick with the ideas of Marx and Lenin to finish the Revolution as planned!"
som.14.b:0 "Drift fully towards Pan-Somali Socialism and Left Nationalism!"
som.14.c:0 "Compromise the Revolution to pursue personal ambition."

som.15.t:0 "The Fate of the Comprised Revolution"
som.15.d:0 "With Barre’s decision to compromise the goals of the Somali Revolution in order to further his own personal ambitions of wealth, fortune, and power, the Somali state has begun to take a dramatic shift as corruption and militarist graft begin to strangle the nation. As this change occurs however, Barre must decide on how far to take it. He could either fully abandon the Revolution’s Leftist aspects, creating a kleptocratic state near-entirely geared around enriching himself and his allies and friends while strangling and controlling the state with a military junta, or he could limit his corruptive acts while continuing to carry out the basic Socialist goals of the Revolution, reaffirming his status as the Red General of Somalia and continuing to care for his people, at least a little. What shall General Barre decide?"
som.15.a:0 "Barre takes his ideological mask off and pursues his own greed."
som.15.b:0 "Barre reaffirms his reputation as the Red General of Somalia."

som.16.t:0 "The Direction of Husseen’s Revolution"
som.16.d:0 "As Haaji Mahammad Husseen has worked to consolidate the state and further the Revolution, how exactly he should go about such a massive societal change has been called into question. Long an advocate of Pan-Somali Nationalism, breaking away from the Somali Youth League over concerns that the main party body had become too complacent and uncommitted to the Pan-Somali cause, our GSL is now the heart of Pan-Somali thought in the nation. However, if we are to successfully rule over this fractured land of bickering clans, warring tribes, and caustic foreigners, we must decide upon a united direction. \n\nBefore us lies two paths - we could either stay fully committed and uncompromising to our nationalist vision, suffering on without wider support but with our aims and goals fully intact and our own, or we can face reality and side with our like-minded but still differently-orientated political allies such as the Republican Union of Djibouti and the Somali Youth League we broke from, incorporating their Islamist and Conservative Replubican stances in order to further the Pan-Somali cause upon a larger and more secure foundation. What shall we decide?"
som.16.a:0 "The Pan-Somali dream is unyielding and uncompromising. We stick by our guns."
som.16.b:0 "The Pan-Somali dream is worth compromising for. Work with the moderates."

som.17.t:0 "The Fate of the Expanded Pan-Somali Platform"
som.17.d:0 "Under the direction of Husseen, Somalia has slowly been consolidated under the new regime, moderating our ideas of Pan-Somali Nationalism and fusing it with Islamic Conservatism and Republican reformism. However, with these changes now in full swing, Husseen must decide on how far they can be allowed to go. He could either maintain a full grasp on politics, and stop the reforms short of allowing any form of real democracy, effectively puppeting the entire government from top to bottom under Husseen, or he could allow some minor democratic reform to come into play, creating a fusion of Pan-Somali Nationalism, Islamic Republicanism, and Conservative Democracy to benefit all true and faithful sons of Somalia. What shall he decide?"
som.17.a:0 "Maintain a grip on politics within this ‘republic’."
som.17.b:0 "Allow some modicum of democracy in this republic."

som.18.t:0 "Internationale Pressure"
som.18.d:0 "The Third Internationale are the main exporting force and strongest bastion of Socialism on the global stage, and though they follow Syndicalism - a Socialist ideology practically alien to our Marxist ideology - they are still the dominant Leftist force on Earth. Ever the opportunist and pragmatist, Siad Barre has tried time and time again to woo the powers of the Third Internationale to fund our Revolution and to subsidize our growth towards becoming a true world power. However, despite the Internationale aiding in Barre’s initial rise, they have been so far reluctant to accept his ideas on the international stage. If Barre is to win the full support of Paris and London, he will likely have to fully bend to the ideas of Western Syndicalism, in one form or another. Is altering the Revolution and the fate of Somalia as a whole worth the support of these Western giants?"
som.18.a:0 "The Somali Revolution needs no foreign aid!"
som.18.b:0 "Barre adopts the ideas of French Leninism, or Jacobinism, to win their favor."

som.19.t:0 "Chaos in Mogadishu!"
som.19.d:0 "Our tribal crackdown and attempted centralization programs have not only failed, but have also led to total chaos. The capital of Mogadishu is in chaos as the flames of revolution burn through the streets, for two opposing groups of ideological paramilitaries have risen to take advantage of the chaos caused by the Sultan's failed centralization efforts, and each seeks to drive Somalia in their own direction. On the Left is the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party, headed by the young red general Siad Barre and the Supreme Revolutionary Council, who seek to bring about a Marxist-Leninist revolution in Somalia to further their Pan-Somali goals, and opposing them on the Right is Haaji Mahammad Husseen and the Greater Somalian League, who seek to bring about a Pan-Somali-focused Islamicist revolution on the Horn. As the violent forces battle for supremacy in Mogadishu, the loyalist forces of the sultanate are barely holding on in the crossfire. As war breaks out in the streets, a victor must eventually rise to the top, and after weeks of urban guerilla warfare, the victor is..."

som.20.t:0 "The Foundation of Somali Marxism"
som.20.d:0 "With Pan-Somali nationalism being one of the most dominant political currents in the nation, and with Siad Barre himself holding sympathies to the movement, we must decide if we should formally incorporate these ideas in the structure of our Marxist Revolution. To do so would shift towards Nationalist ideas - an idea originally shunned by Marx - in order to better fit Marxist thought to our lands and people, or we could remain on the path Marx himself envisioned. What should we decide as the foundation of the Revolution going forward?"
som.20.a:0 "Stay true to our current of Marxist ideology."
som.20.b:0 "Fuse ideas of Marxism with Pan-Somali nationalism."

som.21.t:0 "Leftist Faqash"
som.21.d:0 "In the words of General Barre himself, ‘As far as socialism is concerned, it is not a heavenly message like Islam but a mere system for regulating the relations between man and his utilization of the means of production in this world. If we decide to regulate our national wealth, it is not against the essence of Islam. God has created man and has given him the faculty of mind to choose between good and bad, between virtue and vice. We have chose social justice instead of exploitation of man by man and this is how we can practically help the individual Muslim and direct him to virtuous life. However, the reactionaries wanted to create a rift between socialism and Islam because socialism is not in their interest.’ These wise words embody the foundation of Faqash, or Barre’s own brand of Scientific Socialism as espoused by himself, the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council. Fusing Marxist principles and scientific rationalism based on historical precedence with the teachings of the Qur’an and the goals of Pan-Somali nationalism, supported by the will to do whatever is necessary to achieve our envisioned Revolution, Barre’s ideology is a unique fusion of Muslim-focused authoritarian and miliarist Communism supported by nationalism and deep study. Supported but not deluded or dominated by Allah, and upon the shoulders of both Marx and Mohammad, the Red General Siad Barre will bring about Communist utopia to all in Somalia who are deserving of it."
som.21.a:0 "We shall build a better Somalia for all Somalis, no matter the cost."

som.22.t:0 "Compromised Faqash"
som.22.d:0 "Faqash has become the name of Siad Barre’s own ideology as espoused by himself, the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council, and was originally envisioned to be a Marxist ideology supported by militarism, Pan-Somali nationalism, Islamic faith and morals, and Scientific Socialism, and for a time, this is how Barre’s Revolution progressed. However, after falling prey to his own vices and choosing to chase his own personal ambitions and desires, the ‘Red’ General Siad Barre has shifted his Revolution from serving the people of Somalia to serving himself. Falling to corruption and hedonism, supported by opportunistic clans and tribes, and morphing into a self-serving autocrat draped in a thinly-veiled shade of red, Siad Barre masquerades as a devout Marxist while bending all of Somalia to his own wants and whims. Prioritizing the enrichment and empowerment of himself and his close allies over all other pursuits - even the Pan-Somali dream - the ‘Red’ General has become a faux version of his past self, and now rules the Horn as a false revolutionary seeking only to revolutionize new ways of getting richer, all the while crushing his enemies - especially the innocent Isaaq people - without impunity and without remorse. Somalia truly has become Barre’s own playground."
som.22.a:0 "We shall build a better state for Barre, no matter the cost."

som.23.t:0 "The SYL-GSL Schism"
som.23.d:0 "Once a united force, the Greater Somalian League of Husseen broke off from the much larger and far more dominant Somali Youth League during the early 1930s. The disgruntled members that left to form the GSL were pushed out due to their radical and violent methods, their extremist ideas, and their desire to abandon democratic ideas entirely, while the GSL’s founding members were disgusted that the SYL would take foreign funding from Jadidists and certain European and North African sources. The SYL, focused on moderate Pan-Somali nationalism and Islamic democratic republicanism, would not yield to this extreme platform, and as a result, the two parties have argued and competed to the detriment of each other’s success. As they bicker, aristocratic and socialist elements have both tried to fill the void, but aside from the traditionalist elements of the clan hierarchy and the various sultans and princes, the SYL remains the dominant political force in Somalia."
som.23.a:0 "We shall see how their rivalry plays out."

som.24.t:0 "The Consequences of a Soft Hand"
som.24.d:0 "With our decision to work with our former allies in the SYL once again, we must remain vigilant, for these opportunistic moderates have continued to plot ways to fully take command of the state, slowly eroding our own position in order to take more influence and power for themselves. As we work with these compromisers and soft-skinned pragmatists, we must hold steady against their corrosive influences, lest we fall to their ambitions."
som.24.a:0 "Husseen and the GSL radicals hold strong against this influence and bend it to their will."
som.24.b:0 "The SYL moderates take control, sidelining the GSL radicals."

som.25.t:0 "Fate of the Failed SYL"
som.25.d:0 "With the failures of the SYL apparent, and with their plotting leaders now arrested and in holding, we must decide what to do with the Somali Youth League moderates. We can either purge the rest of their remaining members, shifting our movement fully back towards radical Pan-Somali nationalism, or we can pardon the bulk of their members, only executing their leadership while the rest of the SYL is rehabilitated and their ideas kept within our platform. What shall we do?"
som.25.a:0 "Purge these naive fools."
som.25.b:0 "Arrest only the leaders of the attempted coup."

som.26.t:0 "Fate of the Failed GSL"
som.26.d:0 "Rising past the radical nationalists and violent fools in the Greater Somalian League, the Somali Youth League is finally in control of Somalia’s destiny. Shifting our state towards moderated ideas of Pan-Somali nationalism and Islamic piety, the SYL shall work to create a true republican system in Somalia as the GSL traitors are arrested and hidden away from society. Before a path to the future can be decided however, the SYL must organize elections between the party’s liberal and conservative halves. Until then, they shall work to consolidate their grip on the nation outside Mogadishu while proliferating peace, stability, unity, law, and order."
som.26.a:0 "Prepare for the first modern Somali elections!"

som.27.t:0 "The First Fair and Free Somali Elections"
som.27.d:0 "Finally organized, the SYL has opened fair and free democratic elections to the masses. The people of Somalia shall vote on their representatives within the Somali Federal Assembly today, and the inner-party faction that wins the most seats shall dictate the future of the moderate Pan-Somali dream. With the votes finally being counted, it's only a matter of time before the future direction of the Somali Youth League is decided."
som.27.a:0 "The Liberal wing of the SYL wins out."
som.27.b:0 "The Conservative wing of the SYL seizes victory."
som.27.c:0 "A unity coalition preaching compromise for the sake of prosperous progress wins out." 
som.27.e:0 "A small group of the SYL seeking to purify Barre’s Socialism shockingly wins."

som.28.t:0 "Direction of the Liberal SYL"
som.28.d:0 "Now that the Liberal wing of the SYL has won the most representatives within the Somali Federal Assembly, they finally control the government itself, and now they must decide on the specific brand of Liberalism they shall pursue. We can either stick fully to our Jadidist influences and pursue Islamic modernization and liberalization, drift more towards ideas of National Liberalism rooted in Pan-Somali thought, or we can utilize the existing clannist hierarchy and class system to create a republican federative system based on modernized tribalism."
som.28.a:0 "We stick to our Jadidist influences."

som.29.d:0 "Now that the Conservative wing of the SYL has won the most representatives within the Somali Federal Assembly, they finally control the government itself, and now they must decide on the specific brand of Conservatism they shall pursue. We can either stick fully to our Jadidist influences and pursue Islamic modernization and Liberal-Conservative reform, drift more towards ideas of National Conservatism rooted in Pan-Somali thought or Islamic Fundamentalism, or we can utilize the existing clannist hierarchy and class system to create a republican federative system based on modernized tribalism."

som.30.t:0 "Direction of the National Apparatus"
som.30.d:0 "As we create our Islamic and Pan-Somali state, we must decide upon how the national government should be structured. The conservatives push for a decentralized system supported by the dominant clans and tribes of Somalia’s class system and tribal hierarchy, while the liberals push for a centralized state supported and united by the clergy and the Islamic Church. What shall we decide?"
som.30.a:0 "Decentralize the state with the aid of the clans."
som.30.b:0 "Centralize the state with the help of the clergy."

som.31.t:0 "Maxamuud’s Domain"
som.31.d:0 "Royalist party leader and minor sultan Cismaan III Maxamuud now leads Somalia without question, and now this enlightened noble must decide upon the structure of his new domain. He could bow to his sovereign and traditional liege Bogor Mohamoud Ali Shire of the Warsangali clan, or he could allow the high throne to remain without occupant to promote Islamic Republicanism and autocratic aristocratism instead. Alternatively, as the rightful heir of the toppled Majeerteen Sultanate that now is a constituent state within Somalia, Maxamuud could declare a new and reborn Majeerteen Sultanate to rebirth the glory of his ancestor, blazing a new path and monarchist dynasty for Somalia but alienating him from most of his allies. What shall he decide?"
som.31.a:0 "We shall stay ever loyal to the current sultan and princely hierarchy."
som.31.b:0 "Promote Islamic Republicanism under the all-powerful Maxamuud."
som.31.c:0 "The Majeerteen Sultanate shall rise again!"

som.32.t:0 "The Fate of the Radicalized Pan-Somali Platform"
som.32.d:0 "As Barre drifts from his once stalwart position of unwavering loyalty to Marxist ideology towards more nebulous ideas of Socialist Nationalism and Leftist Pan-Somali thought, he and the Supreme Revolutionary Council of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party must decide on a defined foundation for the Revolution’s new radicalized platform. Barre could maintain his loyalty to Pan-Somali Nationalism and African-centric Socialism, or he could drift to more nebulous ideas of Leftist Nationalism as he tightens his grip on the nation, putting his own goals over the Revolution’s. Alternatively, he could forge an alliance with the remaining Right Pan-Somali Nationalists still left in the state, and create a syncretic state of certain Left and Right principles in order to bring about Pan-Somali paradise."
som.32.a:0 "Barre adheres loosely to the ideas of Leftist Somali Nationalism."
som.32.b:0 "Barre stays loyal to the Pan-Somali dream."
som.32.c:0 "Merge our ideals of Marxist Socialism with Tribal Nationalism and Pan-Somali militarism."
som.32.e:0 "Fuse tribal Clannism with Islamic Marxism and Pan-Somali Nationalism."
som.32.f:0 "Emphasize our Socialism’s foundations in the Quran."

som.33.t:0 "Pan-Somali Cooperation"
som.33.d:0 "As Haaji Mahammad Husseen continues to consolidate the state and further the Pan-Somali cause in his own way, he has made sure to reach out to like-minded individuals and potential allies across the Horn in order to include them in the GSL’s mission to unite the Somali people. Working with the likes of Djibouti political figures and fellow ethnic Somalians such as Hassan Gouled Aptidon and Mahmoud Harbi Farah, Husseen has expanded the GSL into an international organization thousands strong with members all across the Horn, all ready to do what must be done in order to unite the Somali people under one banner. Though many of those involved in this broad coalition revile each other and their beliefs, with members ranging from moderate Islamic Conservatives to die-hard and violent Pan-Somali Nationalists, all are willing to put aside their differences - at least for now - in order to further our shared cause. Pan-Somalia shall be achieved, no matter the cost."
som.33.a:0 "Whether we like it or not, we shall work together for Pan-Somalia."

som.34.t:0 "The Hole"
som.34.d:0 "Located within the urban sprawl of Mogadishu is a complex nicknamed the Godka, or the Hole. This infamous prison serves as the main political and military prison of the SRSP, and is administered by the National Security Service, or the Hay’ada Nabadusgida Qaranka - the secret police force and intelligence agency of the Barre regime. Those who enter the Hole are never known to leave, for this gulag is feared for its horrific and unforgiving reputation. It is here that hundreds of Siad Barre’s political enemies come to rot, and it is here that thousands upon thousands of Isaaq people - one of the clangroups of Somalian tribal society - were sent to wither away and die at Barre’s command as he committed and ‘silent’ genocide hidden away from most of the outside world and its prying eyes. Amid the violent interrogations and dangerous conditions, the Hole manages to squeeze the last hope and information out of all who are unfortunate to fall down into this dark pit, and Barre utilizes this barbaric instrument to brutal effectiveness as he further tightens his uncontestable grip around Somalia."
som.34.a:0 "None can leave the darkness of the Hole."

som.35.t:0 "Our Stance on Religion"
som.35.d:0 "As Siad Barre furthers the Revolution, he must decide on a sensitive topic within Somalia - religion. Though he was put into power partially due to the aid of a Muslim Socialist organization funded by the French Communards, and though many of his allies are Muslim Socialists, the most dedicated Marxists within Barre’s ranks are rabid atheists. These rabid ideologues demand that Barre accelerate the Revolution towards its natural conclusion even faster by completely outlawing all religion and enforcing a policy of State Atheism. However, large sections of both the Party and the population resist this move, stating that the guidance of Allah is second to none, not even Marx, and instead push Barre to protect Islam while outlawing other religions, but allowing Socialist Atheism to have its place as well. What shall Barre decide?"
som.35.a:0 "Allah and Muhammad shall be honored. The rest are outlawed."
som.35.b:0 "The Marxist Revolution demands anti-theism! Ban all religions."

som.36.t:0 "The Diplomatic Pseudo-Caliph of the Horn"
som.36.d:0 "Our state has begun to attract the nearly blasphemous nickname of the ‘Pseudo-Caliph of the Horn’ due to our pious nature as the defender of the Muslim faith here in East Africa, espically due to the weakness of the Ottomans and the chaotic nature of the wider Muslim world. Though we are not a theocracy and we are far from the true Caliph (nor would we want to declare ourselves as such), we are the most prosperous and most dominant Muslim nation in the region. As such, it is up to us to lead by example to our fellow Islamic brethren across Africa, across the Middle East, and across the wider world. Although we pursue our Pan-Somali dream, we are also devout children of Allah, and we must show the world we are capable of honoring both."
som.36.a:0 "Under Allah, we all shall prosper."

som.37.t:0 "Face of the GSL"
som.37.d:0 "With control of Djibouti now ours, and with our affirmation Pan-Somali Nationalism over all other pursuits holding strong, we have been united with our long term ally and fellow Pan-Somali activist Mahmoud Harbi and his group of Djibouti-based Pan-Somali nationalists. Dedicated to our cause and sworn to our Revolution, some have proposed the idea that Harbi rise to become the face of the nation and the GSL for a term in order to give Husseen a break and to maintain the illusion of political mobility and progress. What shall we decide?"
som.37.a:0 "Stay with Husseen."
som.37.b:0 "Let Mahmoud Harbi be the face of the GSL."

som.38.t:0 "Face of the New GSL"
som.38.d:0 "With control of Djibouti now ours, and with our affirmation Pan-Somali Nationalism over all other pursuits holding strong, we have been united with our long term ally and fellow Pan-Somali activist Hassan Gouled Aptidon and his group of Djibouti-based Islamic Republican conservatives and moderates. Dedicated to our cause and sworn to our Revolution, some have proposed the idea that Aptidon rise to become the face of the nation and the GSL for a term in order to give Husseen a break and to maintain the illusion of political mobility and progress. What shall we decide?"

som.39.t:0 "Modernizing Our Lexicon"
som.39.d:0 "In his endless crusade to modernize Somalia at any and all cost, General Siad Barre has moved to completely revamp our writing system and language. Working with linguists and Party officials, Barre has begun to latinize our alphabet and writing system, drifting away from the traditional Osmanya script in order to standardize our lexicon with the wider world. From the government and our own administration to schools and offices throughout the Horn, the Somali language shall finally be utilized on a standardized and lantized foundation, hopefully making usage of this beautiful tongue easier both within the state and abroad with our Socialist allies. Though many traditionalists and fervent nationalists have decried the move, most of them will end up in the Hole soon for their transgressions, so the Red General Barre has no need to worry about their petty complaints, for only Siad truly knows what Somalia needs."
som.39.a:0 "We shall not be left behind as the world carries on."

som.40.t:0 "The Fate of Somali Writing"
som.40.d:0 "As Haaji Mahammad Husseen has worked to bring the light of Allah and the pride of Somali nationalism back to his people, a curious debate has arisen within his government between these two cooperating but competing forces. The Pan-Somali fanatics and Islamic zealots have come to blows over which form of Somali language and writing system the nation should adopt as its dominant and preferred form. The Pan-Somalis advocate the continued usage of the domestically-made and traditional Osmanya script, a unique alphabet and writing system developed on the Horn by our ancestors, while the Islamicists instead promote the usage of an Arabic-based system instead, arguing it would bring us closer to the rest of the Muslim world. In response, the Pan-Somalis argue that the continued usage of their system would slowly bring the axis of the Muslim world to center upon the Horn under our control, for as we expand our influence and continue our dominance, more and more Muslims around North Africa would begin to use our script over Arabic, which of course is called a fanciful and naive idea by their Islamic opponenets. With the debate raging, it is up to Husseen to intervene as always."
som.40.a:0 "We stick to our culture. Continue to use the Osmanya script."
som.40.b:0 "In order to draw closer with the Muslim world, we will swap to Arabic."
som.40.c:0 "Pleasing no one but keeping the peace, Husseen allows the usage of both."

som.41.t:0 "Behind Siad Barre’s Red Veil"
som.41.d:0 "The Red General Siad Barre is a divisive and complicated man, called a pseudo-Socialist by some and a ruthless monster by many, his Revolution has a mixed bag to Somalia. Sure, the tenets of Socialism have been put to use caring for the masses, but the collectivization policies and other Marxist programs put forth by the Supreme Revolutionary Council have noticeably failed, bringing civil unrest and famine to the rural regions, especially those dominated by the Isaaqs - one of Somalia’s many ethnic clans and Barre’s most hated Somali group. Furthermore, his own actions and the actions of his secret police the Hay’adda Nabadgalyada Gaashaandiga, or Hangash, have only turned more violent since his already-bloody rise to power as he forms his Pan-Somali ‘socialist’ state into a nationalist and paranoid republic poised to cleanse all declared enemies of the state, including the entirety of the Isaaq people, any of his political or personal enemies, and any citizen deemed traitor by his strict laws. \n\nMany who knew Barre from his boyhood and during his stint in the colonial police under the Italians were not that surprised with this autocratic and bloodthirsty turn. ‘Barre was not a normal person’ these close confidants and former friends explain; ‘he was a psychopath whose mercurial spirit vacillated between raving hatred in one moment and words of praise and reconciliation the next moment.’ He is said to have witnessed the murder of his own father at the hands of the Habr Yunis - a group of Muslim raiders linked to the Isaaq sultan, when he was only ten years old during the turbulent year of 1921, when the clan conflicts instigated by Mohamed Abdulle Hassan raged across the land, which further cemented his deranged mental state and seeded his hate against the Somalilanders. Reportedly forever changed by this murder of his father, it has been said that the act drove him to the sadism and horrors he has now come to enjoy, further strangling the last few facets of this alleged Revolution that still have some basis in Socialist theory and praxis. \n\nHow dedicated the so-called Red General Siad Barre is to the ideas of Revolution, Marxism, and Socialism as a whole is not truly known, with many suggesting that Barre only wears a crimson facade to earn support from the masses along with aid, financial compensation, military supplies, and technology from the major Leftist powers. However, what is known is that this Red General - no matter how red he may truly be - is in charge, and that isn’t changing anytime soon, for Somalia is Siad’s."
som.41.a:0 "What goes on inside his mind?"

som.42.t:0 "Legacy of the Dervish Movement"
som.42.d:0 "Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, better known as the ‘Mad Mullah’, was able to unite the Somali people through faith against the Ethiopians and imperialist aggressors during the fires of the Dervish War. Related to the Boqor through marriage, our sultan fought alongside the Mad Mullah during this conflict, and to this day, the Boqor uses the legacy of the Dervish struggle and his role in the conflict in order to maintain loyalty among the many bickering and rival clans and tribes across Somalia. Without his ties to the Mad Mullah, the Boqor likely would not have the widespread appeal and support he currently tenuously enjoys. In order to solidify this dynamic and to strengthen the Boqor’s claim while further subduing the clans, some have suggested that we change the national flag of our Somali sultanate to match the most famous of the Mad Mullah’s old battle standards, which has become the main flag for the Dervish movement and its ideas in the modern public consciousness. Alternatively, we could stick with our current banner while still spreading Dervish idealism and Islamic Pan-Somali unitarianism in order to maintain order and peace."

som.43.d:0 "A dedicated Pan-Somali supporter, veteran anti-colonial revolutionary, doctorate holder, and a former student and teacher at the prestigious Hamburg University in Germany, Muhammad Nur is one of the popular loudspeakers our state uses to spread our ideas. Working with his contacts in Sudan, Eritrea, Jubuuti, and across the wider Horn, even stretching into Yemen and beyond, Nur has created a network of allies to support, finance, and supply our Pan-Somali dream. Even having help from certain figures in the Kaiserreich - like his former peer at Hamburg and noted orientalist, anthropologist, and historian academic Dr. Wolbert Smidt Sr., famed for his discoveries on ancient interactions between the East and West by means of using Africa and more specifically the Horn and the neighboring Middle East as a syncretic cultural bridge between the two worlds - Muhammad Nur and his contacts shall hopefully provide much needed aid to the State’s pursuit of the Pan-Somali ideal while his own academic and military expertise, as well as his new state-funded position as our own Poet Laureate of Somalia, are sure to help as well along the way."

This small colony serves as our southern gatehouse that guards access into the Red Sea, and helps the German Empire defend the prized Suez Canal. However, the Somalis have offered a decent sum along with assurances that we shall be given free and protected access to the straits.

The city burns and the key dockyards are currently controlled by the rebels and their pirate allies, and with our supply lines so stretched and with Djibouti so out of the way, we are currently struggling to put up a strong resistance. Should we double down, dig in, and defend Djibouti is a bloody war against these Pan-Somali guerillas, or should we simply cut our losses and give up Djibouti to these rebels?"

As fellow members of the Muslim world, and freqently lumped togetther Arab-influenced world, perhaps it could be wise to seize control of this coastal paradise. On the other hand, do we really want to send our men to die in those sun-blasted deserts and mountains so far from home and across the sea?"

Now we must decide which facets of his ideology to focus on most as we bring egalitarian and democratic prosperity to all in Somalia without falling to radicalism and without straying too far into dangerous Leftist ideology, for we have seen how bad it can go when it fails."
som.52.a:0 "Focus on the Quranic roots of Barre’s Socialism."
som.52.b:0 "Turn to Jadidism and fuse it with these semi-Leftist ideas."
som.52.c:0 "Pan-Somalism shall always be our main focus!"
som.52.e:0 "Center in on his progressive socio-economic reforms."
som.52.f:0 "Turn back to non-collectivized Agrarianism to end fear of famine once and for all."
som.52.g:0 "Focus on his nationalist militarism and welfare policies."

som.53.t:0 "Direction of the Unity Coalition"
som.53.d:0 "Now that the unity coalition within the SYL has won the most representatives within the Somali Federal Assembly, they finally control the government itself, and now they must decide on the specific brand of political policy they shall pursue. For the sake of unity and maintaining the delicate balance of our coalition against the main wing of the SYL, we cannot lean too heavily into the policies of either side, so we must choose how we shall walk this tightrope.."
som.53.a:0 "Fully dive into Pan-Somali Liberalism as the defining policy of the party."
som.53.b:0 "Adhere to the Republican federative tribalist structure."
som.53.c:0 "The unity coalition shall unite the people and the party with faith."
som.53.e:0 "Step away from the typical political quarrel and pursue Agrarianism for the people."
som.53.f:0 "Fuse the ideas of the two factions to bring Liberal-Conservatism to Somalia."
som.53.g:0 "Purify democracy and build a solid and free foundation for future generations to build upon."
som.53.h:0 "Focus on profit and prosperity to win the hearts of the masses and the warring factions."
som.53.i:0 "Stick to rigid Centrism for the sake of the coalition."

som.54.t:0 "The SYL Calls for Public Party Elections"
som.54.d:0 "So far, the SYL has largely functioned without one sole leader, with the party originally being founded by an equal group of 13 Somali nationalists dedicated to the ideas of democracy, freedom, and Somali sovereignty and statehood. However, in our swift bid for power, we hastily declared a leader in order to have a united front and sole face to present to the public to strengthen our popularity and legitimacy. However, now that the SYL is firmly in charge of Somalia’s destiny, we have seen it fit to hold elections to the public to determine the new leader of the party, and by extension the leading political leader of the nation. Whoever is to win shall be inaugurated and rise to guide the nation to its destiny. So let the votes be cast!"
som.54.a:0 "Leading face of the party Aden Abdulle Osman Daar wins the vote."
som.54.b:0 "One of the founding 13 members, Yasin Haji Osman Sharmarke takes an easy victory."
som.54.c:0 "Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf takes a win after serving dutifully in the party for years."
som.54.e:0 "Speaker of the Parliament Sheikh Mukhtar Mohamed Hussein rises to lead."
som.54.f:0 "Young upstart and popular go-getter Abdirashi Ali Shermarke wins."

som.55.t:0 "Victory of the SYL"
som.55.d:0 "After our electoral victory in the wake of the fall of the tyrannical Siad Barre, we are ready to bring much needed reform to the Somali nation. Before a path to the future can be decided however, the SYL must organize elections between the party’s liberal and conservative halves. Until then, they shall work to consolidate their grip on the nation outside Mogadishu while proliferating peace, stability, unity, law, and order."
som.55.a:0 "We will decide the future of Somalia!"

som.56.t:0 "Border Clashes in the Ogaden"
som.56.d:0 "The Ogaden has always been a contested region between Somalis and Abyssinians, with the region being largely populated by Somali tribes and Ethiopian settlers, but a recent border raid at the town of Fiq has left several dead and many more injured, including soldiers and innocent civilians. Should we keep a leveled head and de-escalate this conflict, or shall we use this opportune tragedy to finally wage war against our mortal foe? However, we must keep our wits about us, for many within our regime believe our forces are not yet prepared for a potential war, fearing that such a bold and risky move could cause mass and uncontrollable unrest due to our recent centralization efforts and lack of a security service."
som.56.a:0 "We must bide our time, their day will come eventually."
som.56.b:0 "To war! The Ogaden will be ours no matter the cost!"

som.57.t:0 "An Ally in Mogadishu?"
som.57.d:0 "Following our recent Nile Proclamation and the subsequent opening of diplomatic relations with Subsaharan Africa and the Horn, we are now more than likely to cross swords with our old Abysssinian foes in Ethiopia. However, the Horn is home to another nation that shares our long and history-laden hatred for the Ethiopians - Somalia. Forging an alliance with them would help our efforts in the region by drawing the Ethiopians into a two front war while giving us a loyal ally to administer the region for us as well. Should we ally with the Somalis, or should the Horn only know war?"
som.57.a:0 "Send the offer!"
som.57.b:0 "We don't need Somalia."

som.58.t:0 "An offer from Cairo"
som.58.d:0 "The Egyptians have sent us an offer to join their alliance to combat the hated Ethiopians, a foe we share and both have a long and bloody history with. Should we join these fellow Muslims in their jihad against the Coptics in Addis Ababba, or shall we wage war without them?"
som.58.a:0 "We accept this kind offer from our Egyptian brothers under Allah."
som.58.b:0 "We do not need Cairo getting in the way of our ambitions. Refuse the alliance."

som.59.t:0 "The Kingdom of Somalia?"
som.59.d:0 "Following our recent centralization efforts and the slow eradication of clannist dominance, the Boqor and Sultan of Warsangali [root.getleader] has proposed a huge leap in the nation’s westernization and modernization measures. Seeking to formalize his dominance as the one true sovereign and executive of Somalia over the other myriad sultans, emirs, and other tribal leaders within the dense noble hierarchy of Somalia and her clans, the Boqor would crown himself as the first true King of Somalia, supported by a system based on Western-style monarchies and the Ottomans, drawing from his former ties to both the British and Germans, as well as from our former oppressors the Italians and the faltering sick man in Istanbul. The Boqor, our highest Sultan, believes that this move could solidify his own rule and draw Somalia closer to the West, while traditionalists in our circle and lingering clannists believe this gesture would drift us away from our beliefs, faith, history, and unique culture. What shall be the future of our monarchy - a truly united and Western-style kingdom, or a confederation of lesser sultanates, tribal entities, and cities under a high sultan in the Boqor?"
som.59.a:0 "Long live the King!"
som.59.b:0 "The confederated Sultanate stays!"
som.59.c:0 "Fuse Western ideas with Somali tradition and create a new system."

som.60.t:0 "A Capital All but in Name"
som.60.d:0 "Despite our capital being in Mogadishu, most of the actual decisions are made in Las Khorey, birthplace of the Boqor and the seat of power for the Warsangali clan. With our recent reforms, the Boqor has suggested sidelining the Somali aristocracy and formally moving the capital to Las Khorey."
som.60.a:0 "Make the move. The squabbling clans shall know their true ruler!"
som.60.b:0 "We can't risk our tenuous situation. The capital stays in Mogadishu!"

som.61.t:0 "Somalia Wishes to Join our Faction"
som.61.d:0 "We have received a delegation from Somalia requesting to join our alliance. Somalia lies at a strategically important position in the Horn of Africa and their inclusion into our faction could greatly expand our influence in the Indian Ocean and the strategically important Red Sea. What should we do?"
som.61.a:0 "They are welcome!"
som.61.b:0 "We don't need them."

som.62.t:0 "Negotiations Fail"
som.62.d:0 "The [Root.GetName] has refused to grant us entry into their faction, it's not like we needed them anyways."
som.62.a:0 "Damn."

 SWF_red_nation_state: "The Red Nation State"
 SWF_red_nation_state_desc: "The path to true socialism does not happen overnight, no matter what some may believe. Instead a strong nation state must exist to guide our peoples towards the final goal of socialist liberty."
 SWF_oppress_opposition: "Crush the Revolution's Enemies"

 SWF_anticlerical_desc: "The Catholic Church is a corrupt decadent institution that has routinely oppressed the peoples of Spain, and missed no opportunity to side with our enemies. Steps must therefore be taken to eliminate the Church in Spain, lest we allow their influence to harm our people further."
 SWF_popular_front: "Unifying the Popular Front"
 SWF_popular_front_desc: "We would have not succeeded in our revolution if it was not for our many socialist comrades who have united with us in one shared goal, despite differing views on socialist theory.

 SWF_women_right: "Expanding the Rights of Women"
 SWF_women_right_desc: "Women have been vital to the development of socialism in our nation, and for the working class to be truly liberated the liberation must also extend to women.

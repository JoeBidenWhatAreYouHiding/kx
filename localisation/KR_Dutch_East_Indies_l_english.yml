### Leaders ###
POLITICS_DE_JONGE_DESC:0 "A moderate conservative Jonkheer, De Jonge first rose to national prominence as chief legal minister during in 1910, and as interim minister of war during the Weltkrieg, his political standing was cemented. After a successful stint with the Batavian Oil Company, which was responsible for petroleum exraction and refinement in the East Indies, De Jonge was appointed governor-general of the East Indian colony. Something of a strongman, De Jonge has focused great effort on suppression of the emerging nationalist movement."

### Events ###
dei.1.t:0 "The Indies in 1936"
dei.1.d:0 "Barring the syndicalist revolt in 1925, the crown jewel of the Dutch empire has been a beacon of stability, taking advantage of Dutch ascension into Mitteleuropa to sell its goods (sugar, coffee, oil) to the newly opened up markets. In spite of the competition from the now properly set-up and rebuilt German competition, this economic growth managed to keep up and stability came along with it.\nDespite this, Dutch authorities suppress any call for independence, with the Dutch government believing they will not be able to survive without 'de oost', but despite this, the movements grow. Many in the colonial administration fear that if economic hardship were to appear again, events like 1925 might repeat, or worse..."
dei.1.a:0 "But economic hardship seems miles away!"
dei.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits the Indies"
dei.2.d:0 "The result of the economic hardship that hit Europe after the Black Monday crash could soon be felt in the Dutch East Indies too, who had been selling their goods on the Mitteleuropa market since the end of the Weltkrieg. As the common man in Europe could no longer afford to purchase goods such as sugar and coffee, the prices of said goods imploded, with deeplying implications for the farmers here."
dei.2.a:0 "Oh no!"
dei.3.t:0 "Growing Unity in Independence Movements"
dei.3.d:0 "The PID is reporting that the unity among independence movements has been growing lately. It would be prudent to keep a watchful eye over them and to stop them from growing stronger (and preferably weakening their unity), lest their collaboration result in a stronger movement overall."
dei.3.a:0 "We'll be vigilant!"
dei.4.t:0 "Falling Unity in Independence Movements"
dei.4.d:0 "The PID is reporting that the unity among independence movements is faltering and now even falling. While it would be unwise to sit back and relax now, we will have less problems controlling them in the near future as cracks in their collaboration begin to show."
dei.4.a:0 "That's great!"
dei.5.t:0 "Strength of the Independence Movements Grows"
dei.5.d:0 "The PID reports that the movements propagating the independence of Insulindia are growing in strength. We might want to consider being more careful in delicate situations, and to crack down on them where we can, lest we become unable to control them."
dei.5.a:0 "Worrying..."
dei.6.t:0 "Strength of the Independence Movements Falters"
dei.6.d:0 "The PID reports that the movements propagating the independence of Insulindia are losing punching power. While we should remain vigilant, as they aren't dead, we can rule slightly more relaxed in the near future as it will be easier to control them in the short term."
dei.6.a:0 "Great!"
dei.7.t:0 "Governor-General De Jonge resigns"
dei.7.d:0 "Our Governor-General Bonifacius de Jonge had mentioned multiple times that he intended to resign from his post as governor-general of the Indies, but delayed it in the light of the Dutch elections, that were increasingly showing to become an electoral feast for his patron party, the VNH, back in the Netherlands. For better or worse, the elections are over now, and it will remain to be seen who the new minister of colonies will appoint as his replacement."
dei.7.a:0 "We await the decision with joy!"
dei.8.t:0 "A Replacement for the Governor-General"
dei.8.d:0 "The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Bonifacius Cornelis de Jonge has announced his intend to resign, having waited for the election to do this so that the new government could appoint the new governor-general without the need of him being replaced within half a year which would, in De Jonge's eyes, be harmful for the stability of the Indies.\nMultiple candidates have come forward, but only one can become Governor-General..."
dei.8.a:0 "Nico Palar, who will rule with a soft hand."
dei.8.b:0 "A. Tjarda van Starkenborgh-Stachouwer, the balanced candidate."
dei.8.c:0 "Johan Furstner, who will keep the Inlanders under control by force!"
dei.9.t:0 "Governor-General Nico Palar"
dei.9.d:0 "The Ministry of Colonies has decided to appoint the social democrat Nicodemus Palar as our new Governor-General, who is also the first Inlander governor-general of the colony. The new Governor-General is expected to rule the Indies through compromise, working towards an equal status within the kingdom or even national independence.\nNeedless to say, the white ruling class and the Indo-Dutch community are somewhat worried by this development, fearing the end of the East Indies as they know it. On the other hand, Inlanders are very happy with this change."
dei.9.a:0 "Welcome, your excellence!"
dei.10.t:0 "Governor-General A. Tjarda van Starkenborgh-Stachouwer"
dei.10.d:0 "The ministry of colonies has decided to appoint Alidius Tjarda van Starkenborgh-Stachouwer as our new Governor-General, as most had expected, considering his career. The new Governor-General is expected to try to keep a balance between repression and compromise with hopes to some day give the Indies equal status within the kingdom.\nThe white ruling class and the Indo-Dutch community approve of this choice, while the Inlanders are indifferent."
dei.10.a:0 "Welcome, your excellence!"
dei.11.t:0 "Governor-General Johan Furstner"
dei.11.d:0 "The ministry of colonies has decided to appoint the VNH-strongman Johan Furstner as our new Governor-General, the preferred choice as successor of now-former governor-general De Jonge. The new Governor-General is expected to act strongly, putting down nationalism by force and reinforcing the status-quo of Dutch rule. Equal status is not on the agenda.\nThe white ruling class and the Indo-Dutch community are very pleased with this choice of a hardliner, but it's unlikely the Inlanders will be happy with it."
dei.11.a:0 "Welcome, your excellence!"
dei.12.t:0 "You encountered a bug!"
dei.12.d:0 "You encountered a bug related to the Dutch East Indies. Please report this to GitHub and tag Thomahawk2k. Thank you for your time."
dei.12.a:0 "Of course I will report this!"
dei.13.t:0 "Proclamation of Insulindian Independence"
dei.13.d:0 "With the recent growth of the Insulindian independence movement, it probably does not come as a surprise: Sukarno has issued a proklamasi, proclamation, calling upon all Insulindians to resist the Dutch occupier and to join the Tentara Keselamatan Rakyat, the People's Safety Army. It seems an outright revolt to remove Dutch rule from the Insulindian archipelago has erupted."
dei.13.a:0 "Bersiap! (Play Insulindia)"
dei.13.b:0 "Bereid de Politionele Acties Voor! (Play Dutch East Indies)"
dei.14.t:0 "Dutch Armories Overrun"
dei.14.d:0 "As the opening stages of the Insulindian National Revolution have arrived, our brave troops have raided Dutch armories across Java and Sumatra for the guns stored there. They will be put to good use in driving the colonial menace from our homeland!"
dei.14.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
dei.15.t:0 "TKR raids Armories"
dei.15.d:0 "Insulindian republican forces have raided armories across the countries for guns, quickly overrunning them with their superior numbers. While the casualty rate is small, we have lost several batches of guns to the Republican Army of Insulindia, which could pose a problem later on."
dei.15.a:0 "Oh no!"
dei.16.t:0 "Volksraad passes the Sutardjo-Petition"
dei.16.d:0 "The Volksraad, the largely powerless 'parliament' of our colony, has passed a petition of Soetardjo Kartohadikoesoemo, calling for a conference to speak about the future of the Dutch East Indies, specifically in terms of promoting it to an equal status within the kingdom. With it being passed it is now the task of the Governor-General to send it back home. The Volksraad is merely an advisory legislature however, and the Dutch and Indo population is concerned about the implications of the petition, so we could also simply veto the whole deal."
dei.16.a:0 "Veto, of course!"
dei.16.b:0 "Let's send it to the Netherlands."
dei.17.t:0 "The Sutardjo-Petition"
dei.17.d:0 "A petition that has been passed by the Volksraad has arrived on the desk of prime minister Colijn, having been sent to us by the Governor-General [DEI.GetLeader]. Apparently the petition calls for a congress to speak about the future of the status of the Dutch East Indies within the kingdom. The Volksraad has already removed all timelimits the original proposal included, so the prime minister made his choice already when to handle it in the house of representatives."
dei.17.a:0 "...somewhere next year sounds good!"
dei.18.t:0 "Sutardjo-Petition in the House"
dei.18.d:0 "As decided by Hendrik Colijn about a year ago, the Sutardjo-Petition has been brought up at the house of representatives, calling for a congress about the revision of the status of the Dutch East Indies, specifically towards the promotion of an equal status within the kingdom. When the vote is held, the petition is..."
dei.18.a:0 "...accepted: tell the colonial government to hold a congress when they're ready!"
dei.18.b:0 "...rejected: any such proposal should be regulated by the Netherlands."
dei.19.t:0 "Sutardjo-Petition Rejected"
dei.19.d:0 "The homeland has rejected the Sutardjo-Petition we've sent to them about a year ago, with most of those voting against it citing the fact that the Dutch East Indies is an overseas territory and not a colony that can be uplifted to equal status. Obviously the real reason is that they think the Insulindians aren't ready for self-rule, and it seems obvious that the Insulindians won't be happy with this."
dei.19.a:0 "All's well that ends well!"
dei.20.t:0 "Sutardjo-Petition Accepted"
dei.20.d:0 "The homeland has accepted the Sutardjo-Petition we've sent to them about a year ago, although they did remove all the timelimits. They know full well the implications of such a conference, so assurances are sought that we handle it with care, and only when we're ready. The door, however, is open for promoting the Indies to an equal status."
dei.20.a:0 "The Inlanders will be pleased."
dei.21.t:0 "Formation of GAPI"
dei.21.d:0 "As a result of the rejection of their plan for a conference, all Inlander parties (with exception of the PNI) have merged into a singular Insulindian Political Federation, calling for the full implementation of an Insulindian parliament and thus for Insulindian equal status once more. As the Dutch government is obviously unwilling to fulfil this wish, especially in the light of rising international tensions, this will only help unite the Inlanders in the independence movement."
dei.21.a:0 "Why does this always have to happen to me?!"
dei.22.t:0 "The Round-Table Conference"
dei.22.d:0 "The Dutch have shown their inability to quash our rebellion, and with the international community starting to notice our plight, their position is becoming increasingly unstable. We will likely be able to negotiate a favourable deal - establishing sovereignty over all the Insulindian archipelago."
dei.22.a:0 "The day has come!"
dei.23.t:0 "The Round-Table Conference"
dei.23.d:0 "Having been unable to quell the rebellion and with republican forces holding sway over virtually all of Java and Sumatra, it seems impossible to maintain our position in our colony. The republicans have put forward their demands: full sovereignty over all of the Indies, but perhaps we can at least salvage parts of our colony?"
dei.23.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
dei.23.b:0 "We will not give up New Guinea!"
dei.23.c:0 "We will not give up New Guinea or the Moluccas!"
dei.23.e:0 "We will not give up at all!"
dei.24.t:0 "The Dutch sign the treaty!"
dei.24.d:0 "The Dutch have agreed to transfer all sovereignty over the Indies to the republic of Insulindia. This is a great day for our country, and will be remembered by the generations after us, for today Insulindia became officially an independent country, free from imperialism!"
dei.24.a:0 "Merdeka has been achieved!"
dei.25.t:0 "The Dutch make counterdemands!"
dei.25.d:0 "Citing the impossibility of getting the needed support to pull through the amendment to the constitution to allow for the transfer of sovereignty, the Dutch say they need to retain sovereignty over Western Irian (New Guinea). While this is a setback, it seems unlikely at current that we will be able to take the island by force as we lack the Dutch naval capacity. Perhaps we're better served agreeing with this deal than to continue hostilities: they'll agree to concede the much more valuable rest of the archipelago after all..."
dei.25.a:0 "We'll sign, we'll get West Irian later!"
dei.25.b:0 "This is unacceptable."
dei.26.t:0 "The Insulindians refuse!"
dei.26.d:0 "The republican delegation was outraged by our unwillingness to concede all of the former East Indies to them. It seems negotiations have broken down and the war will continue."
dei.26.a:0 "The land wasn't even worth a lot!"
dei.27.t:0 "The Dutch make counterdemands!"
dei.27.d:0 "Citing the impossibility of getting the needed support to pull through the amendment to the constitution to allow for the transfer of sovereignty, the Dutch say they need to retain sovereignty over Western Irian (New Guinea) and the christian Moluccas, who have continuously been supporting them during the revolution. While this is a setback, it seems unlikely at current that we will be able to take the islands by force as we lack the Dutch naval capacity. Perhaps we're better served agreeing with this deal than to continue hostilities: they'll agree to concede the much more valuable rest of the archipelago after all..."
dei.27.a:0 "We'll make this work..."
dei.27.b:0 "Insulindia without its east isn't Insulindia!"
dei.28.t:0 "The Dutch refuse!"
dei.28.d:0 "Despite clearly having been outmatched by the republican forces, the stubborn Dutch still refuse to sign a treaty with 'outlaws and thugs'. It seems we'll have to continue our struggle until they'll finally lose their spirit."
dei.28.a:0 "A setback indeed!"
dei.29.t:0 "Volunteers in the Insulindian Revolution"
dei.29.d:0 "A revolt has flared up in the Dutch East Indies, with the native population seeking to secure their independence from their Dutch overlords. Many in our countries feel connected to the Insulindian plight and want to help. Shall we send a detachment of volunteers?"
dei.29.a:0 "Of Course!"
dei.29.b:0 "Rather not!"
dei.30.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] sends volunteers"
dei.30.d:0 "Feeling connected to the plight of the Insulindian, or in opposition of the Dutch imperialists, [From.GetAdjective] volunteers have arrived to help us with our struggle."
dei.30.a:0 "We can use their help!"
dei.31.t:0 "Foreign Volunteers return home"
dei.31.d:0 "For better or for worse, the Insulindian National Revolution is over now and volunteers that arrived in the Indies to join the TKR from distant lands are returning to their homecountry."
dei.31.a:0 "Bye... I guess..."
dei.32.t:0 "Insulindian Volunteers return Home"
dei.32.d:0 "The volunteers we've sent to the Insulindian revolt have returned, now that peace has been restored in the Insulindian archipelago. They bring some experience in fighting in hard terrain back with them..."
dei.32.a:0 "Welcome back!"

dei.35.t:0 "The Netherlands abandons the Indies"
dei.35.d:0 "Disturbing news has arrived from the Indies: the socialists who gained power in the homeland have overthrown the old order through their parliamentary position, and now they have ordered us to protect all Dutch citizens in Insulindia and help them move to the Netherlands if they so desire and to safeguard an orderly retreat from the area. Unsurprisingly, chaos ensued, with Sukarno, just released from prison, taking advantage of the situation to declare Insulindian independence. Meanwhile the Governor-General is missing and mercenaries took over control our part of the island of Borneo. The Indies are collapsing just because of this statement."
dei.35.a:0 "Switch to the Batavian Commune."
dei.35.b:0 "Switch to Insulindia."

dei.36.t:0 "Anarchy in the Dutch East Indies"
dei.36.d:0 "The socialist government on the Netherlands suddenly abandoned their colony, declaring their own presence illegal and instructing their military presence to protect Dutch civilians that want to return now. The first reports indicate that Sukarno and his national party will take control over the Indies, who will at best be indifferent to our rule, and at worst hostile. While a military expedition to pacify the Indies as a whole is asking for trouble, we could decide to move to take as much of formerly Dutch New Guinea as possible and secure the formerly Dutch side of the strait of Malacca."
dei.36.a:0 "Ready the ships!"
dei.36.b:0 "I don't feel like it..."
dei.37.t:0 "The Germans violate our sovereignty"
dei.37.d:0 "Concerned with our attitude to their rule and the balance of power in the region, the Germans have sent ships to secure the Sumatran side of the Malacca strait, as well as moving into New Guinea from Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. Sadly, with the current chaos due to the sudden Dutch retreat we can do very little against it."
dei.37.a:0 "Oh no!"
dei.38.t:0 "German presence in New Guinea"
dei.38.d:0 "The socialist government in the Netherlands suddenly pulled out of the Dutch East Indies. The local populace, led by the prominent nationalist Sukarno, declared their own sovereign state: Insulindia. Unsurprisingly, the Germans decided that this was the ideal moment to take over Western New Guinea. If we are to prevent the Germans to take all of it we better move fast!"
dei.38.a:0 "We can't let them do that!"
dei.38.b:0 "We don't have the resources."
dei.39.t:0 "Southwestern New Guinea ripe for the taking"
dei.39.d:0 "We expected the Australasians to sweep in and block us in taking the southern part of Dutch New Guinea, but this does not seem to have happened. The land is open and our forces are moving into the formerly Dutch forts in the area."
dei.39.a:0 "Unexpected, but welcome."
dei.40.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] seizes Southwestern Irian"
dei.40.d:0 "[From.GetAdjective] forces swept in and occupied southwestern Irian. This is insulting and factually unacceptable but due to the chaos of the Dutch retreat, there is little we can do about it..."
dei.40.a:0 "Unacceptable!"

dei.41.t:0 "Congress of Batavia - Start"
dei.41.d:0 "The Congress of Batavia started, representatives from all over the Indies have arrived to negotiate over the future of the Dutch East Indies and it being raised to equal status with the Netherlands.\nThe first contentious issue is what these new countries within the kingdom will be. Most nationalists seem to favour a solution where Java and Sumatra are united, Borneo and Celebes are their own countries and another state called 'East Insulindia' which includes the Moluccas and overall the Christian part of the land. Many (Dutch and Eastern Indonesian) are afraid however, that such a Java-Sumatra state would go on to dominate the new kingdom of the Netherlands, and would rather see both islands be split up into several countries. Then, there is the middle ground, where both Java and Sumatra are their own countries within the kingdom."
dei.41.a:0 "Keeping the countries small and controllable is preferable."
dei.41.b:0 "The middle ground: they give something, we give something."
dei.41.c:0 "Java and Sumatra united seems most reasonable."
dei.42.t:0 "Congress of Batavia"
dei.42.d:0 "The next contentious issue is the way the kingdom would be ruled overall. The countries within the kingdom have full internal autonomy, but some oversight should there, especially when changes need to be made to the constitution, all representatives agree on that. The Dutch argue that the Netherlands should lead this group with all other countries sending their representative to the council of ministers of the kingdom. The Insulindian representatives strongly reject that notion, declaring that it would be undemocratic and that each country should be represented in this council dependent on its population."
dei.42.a:0 "No, this still is the Netherlands..."
dei.42.b:0 "Representation according to population is only fair!"
dei.43.t:0 "Congress of Batavia"
dei.43.d:0 "Several smoothly agreed upon issues came along, when another highly contentious one appeared near the end of the conference: foreign policy. Obviously the countries stand together under the kingdom, but the Dutch want to control foreign policy when it doesn't directly concern any of the other countries, while the Insulindians would much rather see a unified foreign ministry that is set up by the autonomous countries together. Once this issue is resolved, it will be voted on by the States-General."
dei.43.a:0 "We are obviously right..."
dei.43.b:0 "The Insulindians are right."
dei.44.t:0 "The outcome of the Batavia Conference"
dei.44.d:0 "The delegates at the Batavia conference have come to a conclusion. It is clear that the conference was pushed significantly to the pro-Dutch side, and it doesn't seem like the Insulindians were very happy with it. It is probably enough to secure limited cooperation, but not enthousiasm except in the Moluccas perhaps."
dei.44.a:0 "The proposal is accepted!"
dei.44.b:0 "The proposal is rejected!"
dei.45.t:0 "The outcome of the Batavia Conference"
dei.45.d:0 "The delegates at the Batavia conference have come to a conclusion. It is clear that the conference was a good mix between pro-Dutch and pro-native policies, and while perhaps, secretly, both the Dutch and Insulindians had hoped for more, neither is dissatisfied with it either. It is probably enough to secure anything but limited cooperation in the western part of the Dutch East Indies, but at least there is a lot of enthousiasm about this solution in the Moluccas, lesser Sunda islands and Western New Guinea."
dei.45.a:0 "The proposal is accepted!"
dei.45.b:0 "The proposal is rejected!"
dei.46.t:0 "The outcome of the Batavia Conference"
dei.46.d:0 "The delegates at the Batavia conference have come to a conclusion. It is clear that the conference was weighted towards the Insulindian side, making many Dutch people uncomfortable, feeling like their country will never be the same anymore. The Insulindians are happy with it however, especially outside Java, Sumatra and Borneo."
dei.46.a:0 "The proposal is accepted!"
dei.46.b:0 "The proposal is rejected!"
dei.47.t:0 "The States-General rejects the proposal"
dei.47.d:0 "The States-General unexpectedly rejected our proposal for the new Insulindian status in the near future. Needless to say, the Insulindians are not amused with this sudden rejection of their rights!"
dei.47.a:0 "This could become problematic."
dei.48.t:0 "Charter for the kingdom of the Netherlands"
dei.48.d:0 "After significant negotiations, it is time to sign the koninkrijksstatuut; the royal charter. In this, our colonial possessions become autonomous countries within the kingdom, ruling themselves while still being part of the kingdom of the Netherlands, and subjects from each country will get Dutch citizenship."
dei.48.a:0 "Long live the Dutch Kingdom!"
dei.49.t:0 "Equal Status granted!"
dei.49.d:0 "As per what was agreed upon in the Batavia Conference, the Dutch East Indies will now cease to exist: divided into several autonomous countries within the Dutch Kingdom. Full internal autonomy will fall to these states and all Dutch East Indian subjects will be granted Dutch citizenship."
dei.49.a:0 "Long live the Dutch Kingdom!"
dei.51.t:0 "Reinforcements arrived"
dei.51.d:0 "As per the preparations we have made, reinforcements have arrived to help fend off native revolts and/or foreign invasions of the Indies."
dei.51.a:0 "Glad to see them arrive!"
dei.52.t:0 "[DEI.GetLeader] dissolves the Volksraad"
dei.52.d:0 "Early in the morning, governor-general [DEI.GetLeader] issued a decree suspending the volksraad once and for all, proclaiming the institution was only meant to make Dutch rule weaker and only helps outlaws like Sukarno. From now on loyalty to the crown will be the foremost goal of the Dutch East Indies and not he petty complaints of the small Inlander majority in the volksraad that previously had to be consulted. Some critics say this is more to extend [DEI.GetLeader]'s personal power, but this is clearly nonsensical."
dei.52.a:0 "It was the right thing to do!"
dei.53.t:0 "[DEI.GetLeader] dissolves the Volksraad"
dei.53.d:0 "News has arrived from the Dutch East Indies, where the governor-general has suspended the volksraad, the legislative body that already didn't have a lot of power, for a currently unknown amount of time - possibly forever. He argues that the body was being used by Inlanders to undermine Dutch rule."
dei.53.a:0 "If it's for the good of our rule, it's justified!"

dei.54.t:0 "The Dutch issue greater taxes"
dei.54.d:0 "With the black Monday crisis haunting the Dutch homeland, the Dutch government decided to issue additional production-obligations from us, not considering the fact that the crisis had hit our industries right here too. Unsurprisingly, while this action will help the Netherlands, it will make our work harder, as independence activists get greater steam arguing that we are only here to exploit them."
dei.54.a:0 "This is a mistake!"

dei.59.t:0 "Anarchy in the Dutch West Indies"
dei.59.d:0 "A disturbing turn of events has happened: the native population in Insulindia, the basis of the Dutch exiles has ousted their former colonial master. With its head cut off the snake once more, the Dutch empire is no more: upon the news reaching the west indies, anarchy has struck these colonies. Now we have no choice but to occupy them."
dei.59.a:0 "It is our humanitarian duty."

dei.100.t:0 "Peace with the Dutch?"
dei.100.d:0 "Alas our brave army and armada has succesfully kicked out the Dutch boot over Indonesia, and we are now elligible to negotiate a favorable peace with the Netherlands, thus achieving full control over its vast tropical holdings. Now it is up to us, to continue the struggle over Dutch imperialism, or initiate a peace and further solidify our holdings?"
dei.100.a:0 "No peace until we march to Amsterdam!"
dei.100.b:0 "We are content, send them the peace treaty"

dei_random.2.t:0 "Nationalist holds rousing speech!"
dei_random.2.d:0 "A locally well-known nationalist has held a rousing speech in favour of Insulindian independence, and his call is heeded: many seem to be attracted by the words of this man, and as result the ranks of the underground movement are growing. Local administrators suggest we shut him down, and while such an action would certainly lower the strength of the movement in the short term, it could result in greater unity for the movement in the long term."
dei_random.2.a:0 "Arrest him for rabblerousing!"
dei_random.2.b:0 "Let him talk..."
dei_random.3.t:0 "Infiltration of a Nationalist Group"
dei_random.3.d:0 "One of the agents of our colonial security service, the PID, has managed to infiltrate a group advocating for Insulindian independence. We can use this asset to either sabotage their efforts, or to try to sow discord among their ranks which could impact collaboration with other groups across the land. What shall we instruct our agent to do?"
dei_random.3.a:0 "Sow Discord!"
dei_random.3.b:0 "Sabotage their arms!"
dei_random.4.t:0 "Nationalists fight each other!"
dei_random.4.d:0 "The fact that the nationalists and the syndicalists didn't really like each other was clear before, but now guerilla's of both sides have started fighting eachother in the countryside. The KNIL stands ready to intervene, but some people say it would perhaps be better to let them weaken eachother while we sit back and relax, as that will both thin out their numbers and make them less likely to reconcile."
dei_random.4.a:0 "Intervene immediately."
dei_random.4.b:0 "Bets are on! Who will win?"
dei_random.5.t:0 "Regent murdered"
dei_random.5.d:0 "One of our local administrators, known as 'regents' has been murdered. The police suspects it's a gang of pro-nationalist thugs who were angered by recent statements of the regent who are known for their terror. They don't have the means to prove this as of yet though, will we allow them to just bring them in, as it seems highly unlikely that it is not them? Or do we prefer to spend time and money investigating the case in detail?"
dei_random.5.a:0 "Just pick them up..."
dei_random.5.b:0 "An investigation is preferable."
dei_random.6.t:0 "Nationalist leader arrested"
dei_random.6.d:0 "Police have managed to take in a prominent figure in nationalist circles following an in-depth operation, and this high-profile arrest will certainly limit the strength of the independence movement in the near future. While charges to be pressed against him are clear, some people in the colonial government warn against bringing him to court, as it could give him a loudspeaker to spread his dangerous ideas when the papers report on it."
dei_random.6.a:0 "He would get convicted anyways, why bother?!"
dei_random.6.b:0 "Every man deserves a process!"
dei_random.7.t:0 "RSAP representative calls for independence"
dei_random.7.d:0 "A socialist member of the (metropolitan) Dutch House of Representatives has openly called for the end of Dutch rule in Insulindia, and unsurprisingly the news entered the indies within hours. Many nationalists feel emboldened by this sign of growing support for the Insulindian cause in the mainland Netherlands, and they will likely win new members in this move too. A letter thanking the 'good belanda' has already been circulating in Batavia."
dei_random.7.a:0 "I would hardly call a syndicalist Dutch."
dei_random.8.t:0 "Indo speaks against Independence"
dei_random.8.d:0 "A senior member of our Indo-Dutch (mixed race of European and Insulindian descent) has spoken out against independence, arguing it would subject the Indo people to an unfair tyranny of an Inlander majority. His call has even reached the metropolitan Netherlands where it seems to influence the public opinion against independence (although this was arguably the case already). Nevertheless, the Ministry of Colonies might be more eager to send support."
dei_random.8.a:0 "Give me the Minister please, we need support!"
dei_random.9.t:0 "Nationalist Riot"

Kasim and Rohaya live there until Musa, who turns out to be an opium dealer, discovers their location and has Rohaya brought back to their home village. Kasim follows them and starts a fight against Musa, after which he is saved by Dullah, so the two can marry.\nThe film seems to have brought new life to a film industry that was on a downturn for several years as a result of Babelsberg films entering the East Indian market, with its popularity even crossing the Malacca strait into German Malaya."

Later they also visited the people living in the Pania mountain range, resulting after a steep climb in the discovery of several settlements in one of the range's river valleys, resulting in the stunning discovery that despite the limited length of these 'mountain papuans', they could not be considered a pygmy people.

There are two choices for the queen: contact Canada and join the other exiles of Europe, who also lack a solid foothold in Europe but will be capable of protecting themselves, or the German empire, who can likely easily destroy the Batavian Commune (in a few years or maybe even immediately) but who will likely dominate us to the point of us being reduced to a mere puppet if they help us restore rightful order to the homeland"

#Normal Dutch East Indies Focus Tree
DEI_black_monday:0 "Black Monday Arrives!"
DEI_black_monday_desc:0 "Black Monday has arrived, like a train hitting a solid object. Suddenly our exports to Europe declined dramatically, and we will have to take action to rectify this."
DEI_bypass_singapur:0 "Bypass Singapur"
DEI_bypass_singapur_desc:0 "In recent years, more and more goods directed toward Mitteleuropa are shipped through Singapur rather than Batavia, but we control our side of the strait of Malacca as well, we owe nothing in these taxes to Germany and can easily resupply in our own ports."
DEI_expand_batavia_port:0 "Expand the Batavia Dockyards"
DEI_expand_batavia_port_desc:0 "The Batavia Dockyards are well-known for the old wooden ships docked there which sail throughout the Indies to transport goods and people. We should expand it to handle more modern ships in greater numbers as well."
DEI_expand_kpm:0 "Expand KPM"
DEI_expand_kpm_desc:0 "The Royal Packet Navigation Company (Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij) has been maintaining inter-island shippinglines since 1888, and already bypassed Singapur. By helping them expand we will increase inter-island commerce as well as our amount of draftable ships."
DEI_fight_malacca_piracy:0 "Fight Piracy in the Malacca Strait"
DEI_fight_malacca_piracy_desc:0 "Piracy in the Malacca Strait has been infamous since a very long time for its ferocity. We should once more outfit convoys and expeditions to pacify this lawless strait."
DEI_limit_rice_import:0 "Limit Rice Imports"
DEI_limit_rice_import_desc:0 "Black Monday has caused the international prices for rice to plunge, making it hard for our subjects to make a living off their rice farm. We should limit the import of rice to force the price to go up again, so that we don't wind up with a famine when the prices start to rise again."
DEI_selfsustaining_foodsystem:0 "A Selfsustainable Foodsystem"
DEI_selfsustaining_foodsystem_desc:0 "By investing extra in the efficiency of rice farming, we can get rid of our dependence on other parts of Asia for rice to feed the colonial masses, which will make us in turn stronger."
DEI_agrarian_relief:0 "Agrarian Relief"
DEI_agrarian_relief_desc:0 "By helping farmers with support, we can limit the suffering caused by Black Monday, making our rule more secure."
DEI_buy_sugar_fields:0 "Purchase Sugar Fields"
DEI_buy_sugar_fields_desc:0 "With the arrival of Black Monday, one of the largest export goods of the Dutch East Indies, sugar, became a luxury item that no one in Europe would buy anymore. Those who invested in plots of land to build sugar suffer, often having incurred debts to buy their plot. By buying sugar-farming land, the colonial government can obtain land that could be used for the establishment of colonial industry."
DEI_colonial_industry:0 "Colonial Industry"
DEI_colonial_industry_desc:0 "With the new free plots of land, we can establish colonial industry to increase our production and to bring prosperity to the archipelago and work to the Dutch overseeers."
DEI_step_up_rubber_production:0 "Step Up Rubber Production"
DEI_step_up_rubber_production_desc:0 "With Black Monday, rubber was hit hard by the lower prices, perhaps no longer being the precious commodity it once was. To make up for the lower prices, we should expand the production to export greater amounts."
DEI_expand_shell_ops:0 "Expand Shell Operations"
DEI_expand_shell_ops_desc:0 "The Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij controls all oil rigs in the Indies. By helping them expand, we can increase the oil production to make up for lower prices as Black Monday greatly lowered the petroleum demands."
DEI_expand_infrastructure:0 "Expand Infrastructure"
DEI_expand_infrastructure_desc:0 "By expanding the infrastructure of Java, we can more easily transport goods and people, increasing our national efficiency."
DEI_back_to_precrisis_levels:0 "Precrisis Levels Reattained"
DEI_back_to_precrisis_levels_desc:0 "Thanks to our actions, we have managed to return to the levels before the Black Monday crash. In some sectors, we've even surpassed all previous production levels."
DEI_east_indian_industry:0 "Industrialising the East Indies"
DEI_east_indian_industry_desc:0 "With our economy secure, we can start focusing on expanding our colonial industry towards amounts not seen before in the archipelago."

DEI_arms_industry:0 "Focus on Arms Industry"
DEI_arms_industry_desc:0 "The Indies is home to the Artillerie Constructie Winkel, an arms company reaching back to the times of the VOC. By working with them, we can expand our arms industry."
DEI_a_modern_economy:0 "A Modern Economy!"
DEI_a_modern_economy_desc:0 "With our recent industrialisation, our economy has become significantly more modern: a few years ago, most of the Indies economy was almost completely agrarian in nature, and now we have several industrial facilities. There is still a long way to go however."
DEI_review_KNIL:0 "Review the KNIL"
DEI_review_KNIL_desc:0 "The KNIL has remained largely the same since the weltkrieg. Perhaps a review could be positive towards their performance."
DEI_army_of_all_east_indians:0 "Army of all East Indians"
DEI_army_of_all_east_indians_desc:0 "So far, we've not accepted any Inlanders in meaningful numbers into our ranks, but the archipelago is large, and the threats to it many, and our 'white' KNIL is overstretched. Perhaps we should consider changing this policy."
DEI_selfsufficient_defense:0 "Self-Sufficient Defence Force"
DEI_selfsufficient_defense_desc:0 "By taking in locals who are willing to work with us, our defence can become self-sufficient, with no risk of us becoming vulnerable in the unfortunate event that, for instance, the mainland Netherlands would be occupied by a foreign power."
DEI_small_but_trained:0 "Army of Totoks"
DEI_small_but_trained_desc:0 "Letting in Inlanders in our ranks would only degrade our superior morale and proud tradition. The KNIL has held its ground for long enough and with extensive conscription amongst the Europeans in the colony, we can surely keep the colony safe until reinforcements shall arrive."
DEI_planning_for_emergency:0 "Planning for an Emergency"
DEI_planning_for_emergency_desc:0 "If there is an emergency, we may not be able to keep the situation in check forever, but we can surely stall any invasion long enough for conscripted reinforcement from the homeland to arrive."
DEI_doctrine_for_the_army:0 "Doctrinal Effort"
DEI_doctrine_for_the_army_desc:0 "We should pick a doctrine to follow, lest we lag behind compared to those wishing to see us harm in doctrinal matters."
DEI_jungle_training:0 "Jungle Training"
DEI_jungle_training_desc:0 "Much of the Dutch East Indies is made up of jungle. We should focus on training in these harsh conditions, to allow us to fight more efficiently in those conditions."

DEI_defending_the_indies:0 "Defending the Indies"
DEI_defending_the_indies_desc:0 "The Indies are the jewel of the Dutch empire. We shall defend it with all we have. no one shall take it!"
DEI_fortifying_java:0 "Fortifying Java"
DEI_fortifying_java_desc:0 "Java is the political heart of the Indies. By fortifying it, we can make any foreign invasion at the very least highly costly in terms of men and equipment for the enemy."
DEI_military_aviation_of_the_KNIL:0 "Military Aviation of the KNIL"
DEI_military_aviation_of_the_KNIL_desc:0 "The Military Aviation of the KNIL acts as the air force of the colony. While we currently have a few planes already, it seems the war of the future shall be fought in the air, and we can not allow our enemies to take the upper hand there."
DEI_purchase_old_fokker_fighters:0 "Request Extra Investments"
DEI_purchase_old_fokker_fighters_desc:0 "By requesting the government to do extra investments in our local air force, we can both maintain and expand this military branch to become competitive with the rest of the world."
DEI_east_indian_bombers:0 "East Indian Bombers"
DEI_east_indian_bombers_desc:0 "Bombers can cripple enemy industry as well as support our land-based operations. By investing heavily in them, we shall make our air force more complete."
DEI_east_indian_fighters:0 "East Indian Fighters"
DEI_east_indian_fighters_desc:0 "Bombers can do nothing if enemy fighters pull them out the air; we should invest in fighters to ensure the security of our airspace and to prevent enemy bombers from operating above our lands."
DEI_expand_airfields:0 "Expand the Airfields"
DEI_expand_airfields_desc:0 "The Indies are far and wide. By expanding the airfields, we can not only serve a military purpose, but also increase the capacity of civilian airfields allowed goods, people and information to travel faster between the islands."
DEI_fokker_investments:0 "Fokker Investments"
DEI_fokker_investments_desc:0 "Fokker is Europe's largest plane producer and has strong ties to the Netherlands. By granting them advantages in regulation or tax we might be able to tempt them into investing here, perhaps as their first time branching out to Asia."
DEI_KNIL_parachutisten:0 "KNIL Parachutistenkorps"
DEI_KNIL_parachutisten_desc:0 "By setting up a parachutists corps specific to the Indies, we can combine the abilities of the KNIL and its air force to allow us to act swiftly in case of an emergency by dropping parachutists above it."
DEI_expand_the_government_navy:0 "Expand the Government Navy"
DEI_expand_the_government_navy_desc:0 "The Government Navy is officially not part of the KNIL and thus our jurisdiction, but its location and its location here does make us the de-facto overseeing instance. We should invest in expanding it, right here!"
DEI_local_dockyards:0 "Local Dockyards"
DEI_local_dockyards_desc:0 "By producing dockyards right here, we can build some ships separate from the Netherlands, allowing us a bit more freedom to produce new ships within our budget."
DEI_submarine_focus:0 "Focus on Submarines"
DEI_submarine_focus_desc:0 "In an open battle against the Japanese, it seems impossible to beat their navy. Instead we should focus on our own advantages: the Netherlands maintains some of the most sophisticated submarines, an unique advantage that could win us an advantage in the naval battle."
DEI_naval_guerilla:0 "Helfrich's Naval Guerilla"
DEI_naval_guerilla_desc:0 "Our admiral Helfrich has devised a 'guerilla' plan, using submarines to attack and then disengage, to wear out any enemy naval superiority as if it was a guerilla war on land."
DEI_light_cruiser_focus:0 "Focus on Light Cruisers"
DEI_light_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "We should focus on light cruisers as strong ships that can safeguard our larger capital ships while still maintaining enough firepower to deter our enemies."
DEI_fleet_in_being:0 "Fleet in Being"
DEI_fleet_in_being_desc:0 "By maintaining our fleet in being, we shall eventually defeat the enemy; we would not have gotten here if our proud naval tradition would've been a farce!"
DEI_destroyer_focus:0 "Focus on Destroyers"
DEI_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "Destroyers are ideal to fight off enemy submarines and thus as screening vessels. Investing in them might be a sound idea."
DEI_additional_capital_ships:0 "Invest in Extra Capital Ships"
DEI_additional_capital_ships_desc:0 "With screening vessels alone we will not be able to challenge any foreign navy. We need several capital ships with big guns to penetrate the armor on their side."
DEI_aircraft_carrier:0 "Naval Bombers"
DEI_aircraft_carrier_desc:0 "By combining our knowledge on aerial and naval warfare, we can build splendid naval bombers that could turn any naval battle the other way around."

DEI_nico_palar:0 "Palar"
DEI_nico_palar_desc:0 "Nico Palar is a senior member of the SDAP party and would be the first native governor-general of the colonies. We're honoured to welcome him back to his homeland after he worked in the Netherlands for a while."
DEI_fund_the_ethical_policy:0 "Fund the Ethical Policy"
DEI_fund_the_ethical_policy_desc:0 "The Ethical policy was a splendid program, bringing welfare to the native population as is our duty as guardian of the Indian populace. Sadly it has been greatly underfunded since the conservatives implemented it. With the social democrats available in the Netherlands, we can turn that around!"
DEI_open_schools:0 "Open More Schools"
DEI_open_schools_desc:0 "Better education means a better future. By opening more schools we can learn more natives how to read so they can take on more complicated task, which will in the future help both our economies and technological progress."
DEI_werkverschaffing_for_east_indians:0 "Werkverschaffing for Inlanders"
DEI_werkverschaffing_for_east_indians_desc:0 "The natives often fail to gain jobs just like the regular Dutch back home. By establishing werkverschaffing programs, we can lighten this burden."
DEI_lift_bans_on_nationalists:0 "Lift Bans on Nationalist Organisations"
DEI_lift_bans_on_nationalists_desc:0 "Previously, the Netherlands acted very frantically on the idea of allowing nationalist organisations, but we have to be honest with ourselves: we don't have the right to keep the Insulindians in chains forever, and if we help them and thus keep them happy, this will not be a detrimental move."
DEI_universal_suffrage:0 "Universal Suffrage"
DEI_universal_suffrage_desc:0 "The current system is fairly odd, only enfranchising a very small elite. We should allow everyone in the Indies to vote for the seats in the Volksraad. We can't get this through however without giving in to the demands that Dutch votes weight heavier."
DEI_alidius_van_starkenborgh_stachouwer:0 "Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer"
DEI_alidius_van_starkenborgh_stachouwer_desc:0 "Tjarda van Starkenborgh-Stachouwer has been a dutiful civil servant since a long time, and it seems no surprise that the homeland decided to appoint him as our new governor-general. Let us welcome him!"
DEI_limited_liberalisation:0 "Limited Liberalisation"
DEI_limited_liberalisation_desc:0 "We should cut down a bit on the authoritarian nature of the colonial government. While it is true that we have to safeguard our presence here, pushing too hard will only have adverse effects."
DEI_vr_extra_funding:0 "Extra Funding for the Volksraad"
DEI_vr_extra_funding_desc:0 "The Volksraad is an important part of the colonial government, but severely underfunded. Even though it does not have a lot of power, it is essential in keeping policy in line with the interests of all groups in the Indies."
DEI_strengthen_the_volksraad:0 "Strengthen the Volksraad"
DEI_strengthen_the_volksraad_desc:0 "The Volksraad is currently merely an advisory body. There are sufficient safeguards keeping it in check, we can make it a bit more powerful, with more checks on the governor-general's office."
DEI_congress_of_batavia:0 "Congress of Batavia"
DEI_congress_of_batavia_desc:0 "It is time that we look into the future and recognize what is; in its current form the Dutch East Indies won't last forever, however, if we reform it can. We should negotiate with the local populace towards giving the Indies an equal status within the kingdom, and granting them citizenship."
DEI_johannes_furstner:0 "Furstner"
DEI_johannes_furstner_desc:0 "Admiral Furstner was an unexpected choice, having had few administrative jobs and being more a man of the navy. He was however a founding member of the VNH so perhaps it could've been expected..."
DEI_expand_the_pid:0 "Expand the PID"

DEI_expand_the_papua_camps:0 "Expand Camps in Western New Guinea"
DEI_expand_the_papua_camps_desc:0 "The camps in New Guinea have always been ideal to store away dissidents. Being located in the middle of the New Guinea jungle, filled with hostile tribes, no one would even consider trying to escape. We should expand them to hold more dissidents."
DEI_antinationalist_propaganda:0 "Antinationalist Propaganda Campaign"
DEI_antinationalist_propaganda_desc:0 "Contrary to popular belief, not everyone supports this 'Insulindian Independence' idea. We can improve this situation by putting out propaganda, amongst other things about the state of such a nation should it break away."
DEI_abandon_the_ethical_policy:0 "Abandon the Ethical Policy"
DEI_abandon_the_ethical_policy_desc:0 "The Ethical Policy was a mistake, it only resulted in an educated elite who immediately showed that they were not ready, ranting against our rule. We should abolish it and make sure the Inlanders stay in the ricefields until they're actually ready for education."
DEI_restore_the_wingewest:0 "Restore the Cultuurstelsel"
DEI_restore_the_wingewest_desc:0 "During the Cultuurstelsel system, profits from the colony were higher than ever, until subversive books started to undermine it. Time to bring old times back!"
DEI_east_indian_apartheid:0 "East Indian Apartheid"
DEI_east_indian_apartheid_desc:0 "Enforcing segregation may be frowned upon, but it is clearly the only way to avoid natives from poisoning the minds of Totoks and indo's with ideas that they should be equal."
DEI_cultural_imperialist_campaign:0 "Cultural Imperialism"
DEI_cultural_imperialist_campaign_desc:0 "We have been here for over 300 years yet still they remain clenched to their own backwards culture. We should change this by actually starting to promote superior Dutch culture."
DEI_enforce_dutch_curricula:0 "Enforce Dutch Curricula"
DEI_enforce_dutch_curricula_desc:0 "Despite our prolonged stay, Inlanders still tend to use Malay as lingua franca. It is unacceptable that such a language could fill that role, when Dutch is an alternative!"
DEI_eradicate_inlander_cultures:0 "Eradicate Inlander Cultures"
DEI_eradicate_inlander_cultures_desc:0 "Especially in the east of the colonies, many small cultures exist. We should eradicate all traces of these, as they can't compete with Dutch culture on even a basic level."
DEI_dissolve_the_volksraad:0 "Dissolve the Volksraad"
DEI_dissolve_the_volksraad_desc:0 "The volksraad is a group of poor old sods who think they have the right to criticize the governor-general on everything he does. It is time we abolish this abomination once and for all and centre all power in the governor-general."

HOLEX_exiles_arrive:0 "The Exiles Arrive!"
HOLEX_exiles_arrive_desc:0 "The vile syndicalist menace has sadly taken over our home and haven. We shall arrive in the Indies and we shall liberate our homeland from this foreign occupation, for syndicalists are not Dutch at all!"
HOLEX_only_man:0 "The Only Man in the Dutch Government"
HOLEX_only_man_desc:0 "If democracy would've been a stable, helpful, defensive system then we wouldn't be in this situation. The queen should take full control over the direction of our nation, even if that means giving up some civil liberties."
HOLEX_together_out:0 "Samen Uit, Samen Thuis"
HOLEX_together_out_desc:0 "The Netherlands has a proud democratic tradition. Even in our darkest hour of occupation by tyrannical syndicalist thugs, we should not stray from this path as it would only put us on their level."
HOLEX_bargain_of_batavia:0 "The Batavia Bargain"
HOLEX_bargain_of_batavia_desc:0 "With the exiles alone, it seems highly unlikely that we will be capable of defeating the syndicalist menace. We should try to cut a deal with the locals, if only to avoid a revolt while we can't stop them."
HOLEX_reestablish_the_cid:0 "Reestablish the CID"
HOLEX_reestablish_the_cid_desc:0 "The CID has largely been forfeit in the chaos of the revolution, although many of its major officials are right here right now. We should refound the CID here. They shall help us defeat the syndicalist menace from the shadows."
HOLEX_political_intelligence_service:0 "Internal: The PID"
HOLEX_political_intelligence_service_desc:0 "The Politieke Inlichtingendienst is the internal security service of the Dutch East Indies. They should be held in high regard because they are our best defence against domestic syndicalist tendencies."
HOLEX_expand_the_prison_camps:0 "Expand the New Guinea Camps"
HOLEX_expand_the_prison_camps_desc:0 "The camps in New Guinea are ideal for keeping syndicalist thugs and other traitors away from the streets and more importantly, attacks.

HOLEX_root_out_murba:0 "Root out the Partai Murba"
HOLEX_root_out_murba_desc:0 "Since the destruction of the ISDV, the proletarian party of Tan Malaka has been the foremost radically socialist independence movement. We should crack down on them lest they entice the Inlanders into trying to repeat the Batavian Revolution here."
HOLEX_outlaw_syndicalism:0 "Outlaw Syndicalism"
HOLEX_outlaw_syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a disgusting system and should most definitely be outlawed to ensure our stability. It is bad enough that it has left its stain on the Dutch mainland."
HOLEX_expand_decryption_techniques:0 "Extend Decryption Techniques"

HOLEX_activate_stay_behind:0 "Activate Stay-Behind Network"
HOLEX_activate_stay_behind_desc:0 "Following the events of 1925 in Britain, the Dutch government realized that they might well be next to fall to the socialist menace. As such, a stay-behind network had been prepared, just in case. This has turned out to be a good choice as it will give our resistance network a huge start."
HOLEX_a_natural_resistance:0 "A Natural Resistance"
HOLEX_a_natural_resistance_desc:0 "Dutchmen are naturally resistant against oppression, and syndicalism is oppression by all means considering the limits they place on getting to be part of their government. By playing in to these feelings we can surely strengthen our internal forces."
HOLEX_prepare_the_bevrijding:0 "Prepare the 'Bevrijding'"
HOLEX_prepare_the_bevrijding_desc:0 "We should prepare the liberation of the Netherlands from the shadows to make it as swift as possible."

HOLEX_korps_mariniers_in_exile_desc:0 "To establish a proper landing we need specialised forces who are trained in making such a landing. As per such, we should reestablish the korps mariniers; they will be the front of our offensive!"

### Ideas ###

DJI_important_port:0 "Southern Gates of the Red Sea"
DJI_important_port_desc:0 "Deutsch-Dschibuti stands as the Southern Sister to the splendorous Suez Canal. Together, they frame the Red Sea and secure the vital shipping lanes within its warm waters for the Kaiserreich. Taken from the French following the Weltkrieg, Dschibuti’s naval infrastructure has been greatly expanded, and now stands as one of the most vital portions of the giant amalgamation that is Mittelafrika - serving as its link to the Suez and the wider Empire. Should this vital link be severed, Germany would lose both a critical connection to their Afrikan possessions as well as one of the most important strongpoints needed to maintain their growing thalassocracy, and so Dschibuti has slowly been transformed into a fortress of concrete and steel."

DJI_chaos_n_shit:0 "Chaos of the Collapse"
DJI_chaos_n_shit_desc:0 "As Mittelafrika collapses and the great plains of Sub-Saharan Africa burn in the chaos, Dschibuti has weathered the storm relatively well due to our isolation from the rest of the central Mittelafrikan mass. However, that does not mean that German rule in the colony is secure. With the rest of German colonial rule faltering to the South, the natives - rallied by the republican strongman Hassan Gouled Aptidon and the pan-Somali radical Mahmoud Harbi - have begun to clamor for self-governance like never before. Additionally, the remaining French colonials led by former governor Pierre Nouailhetas have pushed for the Germans to cede control to their ‘more able and experienced’ hands as they reconnect with like-minded groups in Madagascar and their patrons back in Algiers. Even more bizarrely, the few remaining Don Cossack settlers from the old failed Russian colony of Sagallo have begun to clamor for self-determination as well, with rumors of Cossack militants and Russian nationals being snuck into the nation beginning to spread like wildfire. Whatever the truth or reality may be, one thing is certain: German colonial rule in Dschibuti is far from assured as the rest of Mittelafrika falls to the lions."

DJI_new_german_rule:0 "Dschibuti Stands Strong Under the Iron Cross"
DJI_new_german_rule_desc:0 "Despite the chaos that has consumed the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, and despite all those who rallied against us, Admiral Ludwig Bockholt has firmly secured German rule over Deutsch-Dschibuti. The French have been quashed, the native tribes, republican groups, and pan-Somali radicals have been put down or appeased, and the delusional Russians have been met with the harsh reality that is this new German-dominated age. Though wounded, the Hegemon lives on with Dschibuti alongside it as Admiral Bockholt moves to continue the German mission of creating a profitable mercantile and navally-focused colonial paradise here on the Horn."

DJI_new_nationhood:0 "An Independent Dschibuti"
DJI_new_nationhood_desc:0 "Defying the notion of continued colonial domination, the locals of Dschibuti rallied against the German behemoth as it lay wounded during Mittelafrika’s collapse, and have been rewarded for their efforts with the bliss of independence. Under Hassan Gouled Aptidon and Mahmoud Harbi, our land has been freed from imperialism. For the first time since 1888, it is upon our own shoulders to decide our own destinies, but our newly independent people now stand at a crossroads. Dschibuti or Djibouti, Somaliland or Somalia, towards Somalia or towards our Muslim allies to the North - these hard questions and more are what we must now answer as endeavour to build up an independent state all our own."

DJI_new_sagallo:0 "Restoration of Sagallo"
DJI_new_sagallo_desc:0 "In 1883, Nikolay Ivanovitch Achinov - a mere burgess of Penza - traveled to Ethiopia in order to establish diplomatic ties between the Abyssnians and his homeland of Russia. After returning from this voyage, Achinov hatched a crazy scheme to utilize Cossacks from the Don region to settle a new Russian colony in the region, eventually settling around the fort of New Moscow in what was then French-dominated Djibouti. Though the colony eventually failed due to his own incompetence and inability to control the wild settlers he himself brought, the idea of his project has never been forgotten. With Russian control now returned to the region in the wake of the Mittelafrikan Collapse, the Colony of Sagallo has been recreated under the guidance of numerous Don Cossack noble families and influential figures, such as the Krasnovs and the Bogaevskys, along with other opportunistic faces seeking to establish a new legacy for themselves on this bright new frontier. What fate will befall this second attempt at a Russian colony on the Horn is not yet known, but we are determined to not fail this time around, no matter what direction we must take."

DJI_restored_french_rule:0 "Restoration of French Colonial Rule"
DJI_restored_french_rule_desc:0 "Arriving in 1862, dominating by 1884, and fully in control of all native affairs by 1888, the old colonial regime of ‘Côte française des Somalis’, or French Somaliland as it is more commonly known, dominated Djibouti until the Weltkrieg. Following France’s defeat in the Great War and subsequent revolution, Djibouti became Dschibuti as the Iron Cross rose over the Somali Coast, but many French colonials chose to stay and work under the new regime. With the collapse of the vile colonial conglomerate that was Mittelafrika, the remaining French colonials were able to retake control of the colony through careful dealings and delicate maneuvering around the failing hegemon, proclaiming the colony of French Somaliland once more. Now, along with help from Algiers, former governor Pierre Nouailhetas shall guide this French Coast of the Somalis towards former glories and newfound prosperity as the rest of Africa slowly falls to chaos around us."

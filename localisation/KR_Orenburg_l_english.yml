### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ALEKSANDR_DUTOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! August 5th, 1879, in Kazalinsk, Syr-Darya Oblast, Turkestan General-Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Aleksandr Ilyich was born into the family of a military officer of the era of the Turkestan campaigns, fated to forge a connection with this diverse and turmoil region. He received a comprehensive officer's training at the prestigious Schools and Academies and volunteered in both Russo-Japanese War and the Weltkrieg.\n\nFollowing the February Revolution in March 1917, Aleksandr Dutov was elected deputy chairman of the Provisional Council of the Union of Cossack Hosts. In June, he assumed the role of chairman of the Council, and in September, he was appointed Ataman, heading the Orenburg Cossack Host and its military government. By October 1917, Dutov had emerged as a prominent figure, renowned throughout Russia and beloved by the Cossack community. In this capacity, he encountered the Bolshevik coup, becoming the first military leader to declare war on the Soviet government.\n\nAtaman Dutov was one of the first to lend his support to Admiral Kolchak. However, his stance on unwavering republicanism contributed to a degree of mistrust in their relationship. The success of Dutov's Orenburg Army in eliminating Bolshevism in Turkestan was marred by subsequent developments. Following the fall of the Bolshevik regime and the declaration of Russia as a republic by the Constituent Assembly, the aspirations of many Cossacks were dashed by the anti-Cossack policies pursued by the elected SR government. Their aim was to eradicate the Cossack class. Consequently, the Orenburg Guberniya was divided, with Chelyabinsk Guberniya seceding, and Orenburg becoming part of the Kazakh autonomous region known as Alash Orda. This situation did not sit well with Dutov. Nevertheless, he declined to openly endorse Kolchak's putsch in 1925, which he viewed as monarchist and conservative in nature.\n\nFor the next decade, Dutov maintained his position as the leader of the Host, defying the authority of the Alash Autonomy and effectively ruling his domain with an iron fist. Despite opposition in Orenburg, there were few who were willing to openly challenge the war hero, who had earned the respect of many."

### Events ###
orenburg.1.t: "The Orenburg Cossack Host"
orenburg.1.d: "The second oldest after the Don Cossack Host, the Orenburg Cossacks have been in loyal service to the Russian Motherland since 1748, defending, like their neighboring Ural Cossacks, the country's border from Kazakh nomads. By 1917, the Orenburg Host was among the most battle-ready units. However, the difficult years of the Weltkrieg and the Revolution affected all Cossack units, and the Orenburg unit was no exception.\n\nThe very next day after the Bolshevik takeover in Petrograd, Aleksandr Dutov, the Ataman of the Orenburg Host, announced his non-recognition of Soviet authority and assumed full executive power within the Host. Martial law was declared in Orenburg. Public gatherings and demonstrations were prohibited, the Bolshevik town hall was dispersed and publication of the 'Proletarian' Bolshevik newspaper was banned. Post offices and telegraph offices were occupied by Junker patrols. This state of affairs did not last for long. By the end of January 1918, the Bolsheviks captured Orenburg, and Dutov and his faithful Cossacks withdrew to Verkhneuralsk. In March 1918 Verkhneuralsk also fell to the Bolsheviks and Dutov retreated to the Turgay Steppes.\n\nMeanwhile, widespread looting and terror by the Bolsheviks led to the majority of Orenburg Cossacks turning against them. Self-defense detachments spontaneously began to arise in villages. The Cossacks ambushed and disrupted detachments of Red punitive forces, seizing their weapons. Soon, the entire region was engulfed in an anti-Bolshevik uprising. Delegates were sent to Dutov to propose his return and leadership of the Host. The rebels lacked experienced commanders, as their detachments were led by junior officers unfamiliar to the general Cossack mass. Dutov, in addition to being popular, had an academic background, and his personality was able to unite all anti-Soviet forces."
orenburg.1.a: "What next?"

orenburg.2.t: "The Orenburg Cossack Host"
orenburg.2.d: "By this time, the strategic situation on the anti-Soviet front had undergone significant changes. The Czechoslovak Legion rebelled against the Bolshevik regime. Two anti-Bolshevik governments: the Komuch in Samara and the Siberian Provisional Government in Omsk, emerged. Ataman Dutov had to maneuver between these two entities, initially recognizing Komuch and then Omsk. As a result, he established an autonomous region for the Orenburg Host in the territory under its control, modeled after the Almighty Don Host, but with its own unique characteristics.\n\nDutov was characterized by a rare level of \"religious tolerance\" – all supporters of the fight against Bolshevism, ranging from monarchists to Mensheviks, were welcomed by him. At the same time, the leader dealt mercilessly with all those who dared sabotage the anti-Bolshevik campaign in the area under his supervision. Despite his democratic approach, Dutov recognized that the leader's authority must be firm and their actions decisive. After the coup of Kolchak, Dutov was the first to fully acknowledge the authority of the supreme leader. As a democratically minded leader, he argued to the Admiral, that after the defeat of the Bolshevik forces, the future of Russia should be decided by a free and fair multiparty elections. In September 1918, the city of Orsk, which had been the last remaining city under Bolshevik control in the region, was captured by Dutov's forces."
orenburg.2.a: "Interesting"

orenburg.3.t: "The Orenburg Cossacks in 1936"
orenburg.3.d: "After the capture of Orsk, the situation developed favorably for the White forces. By the end of 1919, virtually all of Russia came under their control and the remnants of the Bolshevik forces were soon defeated. A second Constituent Assembly was held, although its outcomes were disappointing for right-wing.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Civil War, the Orenburg Host was effectively split. The western portion, centered on Orenburg, became part of the Alash Autonomy, while the northeastern portion remained within Russia, forming the Chelyabinsk Guberniya.\n\nThe prioritization of the interests of the Kazakh people and their democratic leaders by the new SR-Kadet government was deemed more significant than the interests of social groups such as the Cossacks. Although Dutov formally remained the Ataman of both portions of the Host separated by administrative boundaries, he was unwilling to fully submit to the authority of the Alash, albeit to a lesser extent than the Ataman of the Ural Cossacks, Vladimir Tolstov, was.\n\nThe situation has now deteriorated as the Alash Autonomy has begun to independently manage its internal affairs. Given their strong interest in controlling Orenburg, which: one of the key nodes of the Orenburg-Tashkent railway, and their clear indications that 'Orynbor': a Kazakh territory, the ataman has his own plans for both the arrangement of the territory under his control and for Russia as a whole."
orenburg.3.a: "And that brings us here."

orenburg.4.t: "Opposition Within the Circle"
orenburg.4.d: "The supreme body of the Orenburg Cossack Host: the Cossack Circle, which: the general military council of the Cossacks and the highest body of self-government. The circle has unlimited competence in solving local issues, covering matters of a military, economic, administrative, socio-political, legal, social and domestic nature. Despite the influence of Dutov and veterans of the Turgai March, due to the general democratic sentiment among the Orenburg Cossacks, his power: not as restricted as desired.\n\nTimofey Sedelnikov, an elected member of the Cossack Circle, who leads the \"left-wing\" faction within the Circle, stands out as a prominent figure in opposition to Dutov. He: one of the founding members of the \"independent, non-partisan newspaper for the free Cossacks\", and has been instrumental in drafting regulations for self-governance within the Orenburg Cossack Host. Additionally, he: the creator of the Cossack Democratic Party. Despite having published a number of sharp anti-Bolshevik conciliationist articles during the war, such as \"Left Tsarism\", \"The Coming Collapse of Bolshevism\", \"Inevitability of Reaction in Russia: Its Causes and Consequences\" and \"Blind Leaders\", he was simultaneously arrested by Bolshevik forces and expelled from Cossack ranks by Dutov supporters.\n\nAt the insistence of the Menshevik Party and the Russian government, Sedelnikov was nonetheless restored to the Cossack ranks. He opposes the transformation of the Cossacks into a closed military caste, which: an issue that has caused some concern for Ataman Dutov. However, due to his support from the Orenburg insurgents, who liberated the Orenburg region during the civil war, his interests must be taken into account."
orenburg.4.a: "A thorn in Dutov's side!"

orenburg.5.t: "A Matter of Utmost Importance"
orenburg.5.d: "In light of recent events, the issue of utmost importance: the unification of the Orenburg Cossacks. At present, some parts of the Host, situated around Troitsk and Verkhneuralsk are under control of [RUS.GetLeader]'s bloody regime. Although local stanitsas have already supported [ROOT.GetLeader], we do not fully control these territories of ours. This matter: also connected to the attitude of the Orenburg Cossack Host towards the outbreak of Civil War in Russia. This: an event that cannot be disregarded by loyal patriots of our homeland. Unlike in the past, when children turned on their parents and brothers turned on each other, the defeat of the patriotic White forces: now a much more likely outcome. Ataman Dutov, in a speech dedicated to preventing another Bolshevik atrocity, called for an immediate armed struggle against those who had seized power in Moscow and Petrograd.\n\nAccording to his plan, the initial step: to immediately dispatch several Cossack units to liberate our territories from socialists and re-establish the Orenburg Host as a single administrative unit.\n\nLeft-wing elements within the Cossack community immediately objected and opposed these swift decisions."
orenburg.5.a: "Immediately dispatch the Cossacks!"
orenburg.5.b: "The Left convinced the majority of the Circle to abstain... for now."

orenburg.6.t: "The Reunion of the Host"
orenburg.6.d: "At present, some parts of the Host are under Bolshevik control, and although local villages and towns such as Troitsk and Verkhneuralsk have supported the leader, we do not fully control this territory. In accordance with the orders of the Ataman, several Cossack units have been immediately dispatched to occupy these areas and re-establish the Orenburg Host as a single administrative unit."
orenburg.6.a: "United as a whole!"

orenburg.7.t: "Ataman Ionov Requests Aid"
orenburg.7.d: ""
orenburg.7.a: ""

orenburg.8.t: "Ataman Dutov Meets [ROOT.GetLeader]"
orenburg.8.d: "Today, the Ataman of the Orenburg Cossacks, Aleksandr Dutov, has addressed us with an offer of peace, cooperation, and recognition of our government. In the past, Cossacks have provided significant assistance to our national movement. However, some of our advisors believe that these efforts were in vain when the Supreme Ruler, Kolchak, abolished all forms of national autonomy. Ataman Dutov was among the first to acknowledge his supreme authority and did not contest the decision regarding autonomy."
orenburg.8.a: "He had lost our trust before."
orenburg.8.b: "All means are good when it comes to fighting the Soviets."

orenburg.9.t: "Bashkirs Refuse Friendship!"
orenburg.9.d: "The Bashkirs refused to sign an agreement with us."
orenburg.9.a: "Without our help, their days are numbered."

orenburg.10.t: "Just Like the Good Old Days"
orenburg.10.d: "The Bashkir government was happy to receive Ataman Dutov in Mrakovo and sign a friendship agreement with him."
orenburg.10.a: "A toast to [FROM.GetLeader]!"

orenburg.11.t: "The Most Loyal Ataman"
orenburg.11.d: "Ataman Dutov, perhaps the first among others, recognized the authority of Supreme Ruler Kolchak in 1918 and joined the joint struggle against Bolshevism. He was a staunch patriot and opponent of Bolshevik ideology, and his military government now seeks to resume the joint struggle once again.\n\nAtaman Dutov firmly stood on Republican positions, and in 1925 the Orenburg Cossacks were almost the sole Host not to support the coup attempt. This, along with General Kornilov's treachery, may have contributed to the failure of the coup and the triumph of the Socialist Revolutionaries under the leadership of Kerensky in Russia. His betrayal should not be forgotten."
orenburg.11.a: "We still remember his silence in 1925."
orenburg.11.b: "We need allies beyond the Urals."

orenburg.12.t: "A Pact With Kolchak"
orenburg.12.d: "The government of the Supreme Leader has accepted our delegation, as well as our offer of collaboration. Now, we must join forces in our struggle against the perfidious regime in [RUS.Capital.GetName]."
orenburg.12.a: "Russia shall be preserved!"

orenburg.13.t: "Kolchak Refused Our Hand"
orenburg.13.d: "The government of the Supreme Ruler has declined our overture of amity, citing the lack of our support for his attempted coup d'état in the year 1925."
orenburg.13.a: "Well, it's a pity, but the choice: made."

orenburg.14.t: "[TRM.Capital.GetName] Calling!"
orenburg.14.d: "Armed hostilities have erupted in Siberia between the recognized government of Kolchak and the unrecognised government of [RUS.GetLeader]. In accordance with our obligations, it is imperative that we declare war on [RUS.Capital.GetName] forthwith!"
orenburg.14.a: "Charge!"

orenburg.15.t: "The Wind Has Shifted in [TRM.Capital.GetName]"
orenburg.15.d: "Following the successful coup, the Supreme Ruler in [TRM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] has been ousted, and [TRM.GetLeader] now holds the reins of power. It is imperative that we deliberate on our allegiance to our duty towards this state, or if we deem this coup and its new administration unlawful."
orenburg.15.a: "And with the wind, our agreements..."
orenburg.15.b: "Support the new government!"

orenburg.16.t: "[FROM.GetName] Withdraws From Alliance"
orenburg.16.d: "Following the regime change, the Orenburg Cossacks, who previously acknowledged the authority of our state and its legality, repudiated their obligations, unilaterally rescinding the agreement!"
orenburg.16.a: "Traitors!"

orenburg.18.t: "Home-Bred Horses Equip the Host"
orenburg.18.d: "The Orenburg Cossacks have long been renowned for their prized thoroughbred steeds, which serve as the finest, swiftest, and most dependable companions to their Cossack riders. In accordance with the decree issued by the Ataman, efforts were initiated to revive the breeding of the Orenburg horses with the aim of equipping the military. Nowadays, these stallions, having attained readiness for riding, have seamlessly integrated into the ranks of our Host's equine force."
orenburg.18.a: "Great!"

orenburg.19.t: "Dutov's Speech in Orenburg"
orenburg.19.d: "Today in Orenburg, ataman Dutov addressed the populace and Cossacks on the central square of the city. He declared that the central government of Russia had fallen once again into the hands of anarchists, Bolsheviks, and other traitors to the cause of Russia. He went on to state that our fellow Cossacks from the Chelyabinsk Guberniya, having been expelled from their native Host, required our support. He suggested that the Cossack circle and the military government should deliberate on the matter of providing assistance to the Orenburg Cossacks throughout their deployment and relocation."
orenburg.19.a: "The Circle must decide what we should do."

orenburg.20.t: "Orenburg Cossacks Seize Our Lands"
orenburg.20.d: "Although it appeared to us that power in major cities in the Ural region are in our hands, this confidence proved to be unwarranted. The local Orenburg Cossacks from Orsk, Troitsk, and Verkhneuralsk, directly supported by Ataman Dutov of Orenburg, took control of almost the entire Chelyabinsk Guberniya and declared independence.\n\nAt present, we do not have full control over the entire Southern Urals region, and there: no guarantee that the Cossack forces will stop their advance. The military leadership recommends that we immediately declare war on the Cossacks and form a front against their leader. However, some moderates within the Popular Front believe that we should take a more cautious approach, as we still face other, more powerful opponents. They propose sending additional support to Timofey Sedelnikov and the Cossack Democratic Party, a left-leaning opposition group to Dutov's forces in Orenburg. If these forces can gain control of the region, our victory in Orenburg could significantly strengthen our position."
orenburg.20.a: "We must act with force."
orenburg.20.b: "Try to covertly support left Cossacks instead."

orenburg.21.t: "Soviet Forces Withdraw!"
orenburg.21.d: "To our surprise, despite the heightened level of tension, Soviet troops withdrew from the territories, discontinuing all revolutionary activity in the Southern Urals. Although the Cossacks celebrate their unification and perceived victory, the Host Government feels deceived, as the Opposition immediately used this development as evidence that the Soviet government preferred peace, if not actively provoked it.\n\nTimofey Sedelnikov addressed rallies in Troitsk and Verkhneuralsk, commending the Cossacks for their unification and urging them not to be swayed by the provocations of Ataman Dutov and his government. According to him, this was the last opportunity for peace with Russia and every effort must be made to ensure Cossack autonomy without conflict."
orenburg.21.a: "As if it were a Pyrrhic victory"

orenburg.23.t: "Destiny of the Steppe"
orenburg.23.d: "The Kirgiz, or Kazakh steppes are once again in a state of flux. Their nascent self-governance is struggling to navigate the perils that the Russian renegades seek to impose upon the Kazakh nation. At one point, we assisted the Alash Orda in achieving autonomy and forming their own armed forces, but now the question arises: can they still remain loyal to Russia?"
orenburg.23.a: "Offer help to Kazakhs against Bolsheviks."
orenburg.23.b: "Kazakhs should not remain independent in such turbulent times."
orenburg.23.c: "We must focus on more important issues."

orenburg.230.t: "Help From [ORE.GetLeader]"
orenburg.230.d: "While the cossacks have broken away from us, their hate for Bolshevism: strong enough to offer us this strange proposal - they are willing to help us in our fight against Jangeldin's brigand guards, but instead the cossacks will get an upper hand in deciding our foreign policy. If we accept, this will effectively mean we will lose our sovereignty."
orenburg.230.a: "We don't need their help then."
orenburg.230.b: "We have to accept any help now!"

orenburg.231.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
orenburg.231.d: "The stupid '[FROM.GetAdjective]' government has refused our help!"
orenburg.231.a: "Show them our might!"
orenburg.231.b: "Let them handle it themselves."

orenburg.232.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
orenburg.232.d: "Surprisingly, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to receive this valuable help from us, even at the cost of their 'sovereignty'."
orenburg.232.a: "Rightfully, they are a part of greater Russia!"

orenburg.24.t: "The 1918 Constitution"
orenburg.24.d: "On December 11, 1917, the Committee for the Salvation of the Revolution, led by Ataman Dutov, established an independent state – the Orenburg Krai. In June 1918, a constitution was adopted, modeled on the Basic Laws of the Almighty Don Host.\n\nThe constitution stated that the Orenburg Krai would remain as a sovereign entity until a unified government was established in Russia and the Bolshevik regime was defeated. Therefore, after the conclusion of the Civil War and the Constituent Assembly, the constitution was dissolved, although some of its provisions remained in effect within the Cossack Host.\n\nThrough the symbolic act of reinstating the 1918 constitution, the Orenburg Cossack Army demonstrates its status as a sovereign nation until it rejoins Russia, free from the influence of Bolshevism and SR anarchy."
orenburg.24.a: "Great!"

orenburg.25.t: "'Coup of Ataman Dutov'"
orenburg.25.d: "Today, the final issue of Sedelnikov’s newspaper was published with the headline “The Coup of Ataman Dutov”, but it never reached its intended audience, as the entire print run was withdrawn. With the unwavering support of the Cossack community, the Host government took a drastic step in light of the circumstances facing the Orenburg Host – an official ban on activities of the Cossack Democratic party, deeming it Bolshevik in nature, and prohibition on publication. Timofey Sedelnikov was compelled to flee the region, fearing for his safety, as he had been placed on a wanted list by the Host government for activities deemed against the interests of Cossacks and Russia.\n\nThe \"Coup of Ataman Dutov\" occurred in a manner that was silent, without a single gunshot, and without significant controversy. The notorious \"peacekeeper\" and his small, scattered \"forces\" were unable to prevent the dreadful \"coup\", and this was due to the continued support of the Cossacks for Ataman Dutov. This support will continue until justice: restored in all of Russia."
orenburg.25.a: "Glory to the Ataman!"

orenburg.26.t: "The Small Circle"
orenburg.26.d: "Today, at a meeting of the Host's Circle, it was decided to establish a Small Military Circle, consisting of nine members of the Circle, to oversee the actions of the government in between meetings, with administrative authority. This solution was previously attempted during the civil war, when the Cossack Circle resisted the establishment of the Orenburg Military Region, but the concept of a Small Circle did not gain support. In light of the current extraordinary circumstances, this measure has received significantly more support.\n\nHowever, despite the decision being made, the opposition members booed the Ataman and denounced his intention to form a dictatorship. Some moderates within the Circle also expressed their disapproval, but their numbers were insufficient to block the decision. Supporters of Sedelnikov announced that \"Ataman and the Host Government turned away from the people and Cossacks\" and stated their intention to protest against the actions of the Small Circle. Despite this, public sentiment was divided, although a Small Circle still has been formed."
orenburg.26.a: "Is this the end of Cossack democracy?"

orenburg.27.t: "Extraordinary Session of the Circle"
orenburg.27.d: "To the surprise of the Ataman, the situation has suddenly gotten out of his control. A majority of the Military Circle has sided with the opposition led by Sedelnikov, who has announced the convening of an extraordinary meeting to re-elect a new Ataman. Without recognizing this unlawful decision, supporters of Dutov have announced a boycott of the re-election process, but this has not saved them, as the Circle has gathered and voted to remove Dutov from power. In response, Sedelnikov has been nominated, promising the Circle peace and the return to a democratic and equitable system for all citizens of the Cossack Host.\n\nThis: nothing more than a bid for power in the eyes of Aleksandr Dutov and his supporters, although the Ataman himself understands that it may not be worth going against the will of the majority. He may only obey the Circle and resign voluntarily or attempt to disperse this assembly of traitors."
orenburg.27.a: "Admit the defeat."
orenburg.27.b: "What gives them the right to do that? Disperse this gathering!"

orenburg.28.t: "The Civil War"
orenburg.28.d: "At present, Russia is engulfed in a civil conflict. Yet another fratricidal struggle. The new Ataman of the Orenburg Cossacks, Timofey Sedelnikov, calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, which, however, cannot be achieved without the complete defeat of the opposing forces and their leadership. The Cossacks are faced with a critical decision about their future path."
orenburg.28.a: "We must start negotiations with the Soviets!"
orenburg.28.b: "We need restoration of democracy, not socialism!"
orenburg.28.c: "We must remain neutral."

orenburg.29.t: "New Government in Orenburg"
orenburg.29.d: "There has been a shift in the military administration in Orenburg, with Ataman Dutov being ousted from power by the Cossack assembly, which elected a new and more amicable Ataman in the person of Timofey Sedelnikov. Nonetheless, Sedelnikov remains a Cossack and adheres to democratic principles, rejecting the notion of Soviets, while also having previously denounced the socialist administration of the Bolsheviks. Does this make him an ally?"
orenburg.29.a: "Welcome our comrades!"
orenburg.29.b: "We will restore the 'real' Soviet power."

orenburg.30.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepted!"
orenburg.30.d: "The Soviet government acknowledged our government as lawful, yet it refused to acknowledge \"Cossack democracy\". Their troops were deployed into the territory of Orenburg, where peasant and Cossack soviets were also established. Timofey Sedelnikov was chosen as the head of the Orenburg Cossack Soviet."
orenburg.30.a: "Great!"

orenburg.31.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
orenburg.31.d: "The Soviets declined to acknowledge our government, citing the fact that all Cossacks were reactionaries."
orenburg.31.a: "Catastrophic!"

orenburg.40.t: "The Frenchmen of Orenburg"
orenburg.40.d: "During the War of 1812, many Frenchmen within the so-called ‘Great’ Army of Napoleon were abandoned here in Orenburg once the fighting stopped, captured and left behind by the haughty Franks as they fled back to Paris. Originally numbering around 1,580 soldiers, retainers, officers, and even a couple of women attendants, these Frenchmen were forced to quickly adapt to life as foreign prisoners or die, with about 300 of them perishing before the end of their first year here. However, towards the end of 1815 in the city of Verkhneuralsk, five of these prisoners - named Antoine Berg, Charles Joseph Bushen, Jean Pierre Bickelon, Antoine Vikler, and Edouard Langlujah - would attempt to better themselves and the positions of their kin by applying for Russian citizenship via service in the armed forces. Surprisingly, their plea was accepted, and they were enrolled within the ranks of the Cossacks within the Orenburg Army. Eventually, more of the Frenchmen would follow suit, with many making a name for themselves or for their families, such as P. K. Delone who became head doctor of the Simbirsk Hospital Institution, or Desirère d'Edeville, whose own son Viktor Deziderievich Dandeville went on to become a famous Russian general in his own right leading the Turkestan Campaign during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877.\n\nUnlike most other foreign populations within Russia, these Frenchmen were notable for largely and openly Russifying themselves within a generation, with nearly all of their surviving families changing their French surnames into Russian ones (the descendants of officer Jean Jean Sander being the latest to do so at the beginning of the 20th century, taking on the name Zhandrov in order to hide their foreign origin as political turbulence only increases), merging into the wider population within the Orenburg Host as indistinguishably Cossack as the rest. With estimates of their remaining numbers within our armed forces only reaching about a hundred or two, the Frenchmen of Orenburg are a small and curious but proud aspect of our legacy, and we shall continue to honor them and all other Cossacks that ride for the Orenburg Host, now and forever!"
orenburg.40.a: "Let us honor this living proof of Cossack might!"
orenburg.40.b: "Perhaps we can leverage this history to our advantage..."
orenburg.40.c: "If another Napoleon rises, we will be here to punish him."
orenburg_40_b_tt: "If we §Gunite Russia§! and §H[NFA.GetNameWithFlag]§! leads an alliance, we will be able to join it"
orenburg_40_c_tt: "If we §H[NFA.GetNameWithFlag]§! tries to restore §cNapoleonic Empire§!, we will be able to declare war on them!"

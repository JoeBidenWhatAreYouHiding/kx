Then concerns over Curtis' health can be raised, and if pressed, Hoover can be nominated instead. Then just elect Hoover.\n\n Avoiding the 2ACW as Hoover:\n\n Complete the left side of Hoover's tree as soon as he is elected down to and including "The Hoover Raids." Authorize the raids, and expand the FBI in the next event. Then in the riot event, choose anything but waiting for them to calm down as that will get Hoover assassinated. Then do the focus to reassure the establishment, and then start the right side of his tree.\n\n If you go Home Rule to avoid:\n\nInvite Haywood to talk, deny Long and Murray, then as long as you expanded the FBI, they will be killed. Agree to all to Haywood's demands and don't disarm the militia to avoid the 2ACW. OR Invite them, then Haywood demands reforms, then funding, then Murray proposing a thing. Radicals get upset and Mac demands a position as militias are  beingannoying. Accept everything, don't force the militias to disarm and you will avoid the civil war.\n\nIf you go Hard Line to avoid:\n\nFollow Marshall's advice (only works if the FBI was expanded), then reinforce in Illinois in the next event. Then in the event on cracking down or negotiating wages, negotiate. Then focus on the white leagues and give Mac more men in the next two events and the war will be avoided.

To get: \n\n -American Cincinnatus: Accept the WCC's deal in the first standoff event by stepping down\n\n -Junta/Triumvirate: Offer to negotiate, hope WCC accepts, accept their demands (WCC gets an event to either accept your demands, attack you outright, or force Mac into a decision of stepping down and holding elections or fighting the WCC)\n\n -Senatus Populusque Americanus: As explained above, if you offer to negotiate, the WCC gets an event on what to do. If they rally allies against Mac, he will have to delcare war or allow elections. Allowing elections is the Senatus path (what the WCC does is up to rng, unless you turn ai off and tag switch to them to choose what you want them too in their event)\n\n -American Caesar: in any of the above event choices explained, go with the war option\n\n Also if you want natpop WCC, play as the Feds and get to 80% surrender progress (lose DC and one other VP), and click the decision to have Mac flee west.\n\nQ: How to get the Navy with a State path for the Feds/USA?\n\nA:  roughly 10 days after MacArthur coups the USA's government, the event "Navy Demands" will fire, so deny their request (agreeing to it keeps Mac in power). Then King's Offer will fire where King asks for control over the navy. There are three options: Choosing to back King will lead to him couping Mac, establishing the Navy with a State, Choosing to ask congress for help in subordinating the navy will end the affair, leaving Mac in charge, Choosing to do nothing will lead to Leahy's Coup which aims for the return of American democracy"

Then, to get:\n\n -Democratic Texas: Elect any of the 4 intial candidates; to stay democratic - don't let Guthrie in if you elect LBJ or don't declare martial law if you elect Garner; and don't let Texaco coup (don't let them fund military/police if you go to Break Texaco)\n\n -Leftist Texas: Elect LBJ in the first election, then accept the deal with the devil by allowing Guthrie into the government and have Guthrie replace LBJ as president OR become a puppet of the CSA through your 2ACW foreign policy tree OR Set gamerule for "Texas in the 2ACW" to "Loyalty to the CSA", making you their puppet once the war starts\n\n -Extend Garner's Power: Elect Garner in the first election, then declare martial law in the event about the Dallas Plaza Bombing. Finish his small tree and rewrite the texan constitution to unlock his larger tree\n\n -Power to the Oil Barons: Elect anyone, try to complete the "Break Texaco" focus, accept the Texaco bribes to the military/police in the event chain. Eventually they will coup, unlocking their tree and the "Break Texaco" focus will cancel unfinished (Note: Finish their tree as quick as possible to the military will coup)\n\n -Break the Sword: Complete the Texaco coup as instructed above, then don't secure the regime within certain amount of time by not completing their tree. Eventually, the military will coup and you can choose which general will lead the Junta\n\n -Texas First Party: (WIP-testing if this works)Set gamerule for "Texas in the 2ACW" to "Loyalty to the Union State". This will fire an event chain when you play where Huey will accept Texas as a puppet with nominal independence under the TFP in exchange for help in the war after the 2ACW breaks out.\n\n -Texan Kaiserreich(WARNING: Buggy/unfinished and possibly unplayable): Choose to join the Reichspakt in your focus tree, and align with Germany. If they capitulate while their colonies in Mittelafrika and German East Asia don't exist during the 2WK, the Kaiser can flee to Texas when Germany falls (their tag is KTX if you want to spawn them or use "Event TXS.79", as they may not spawn legitimately, currently uses the GEX tree)"

In a following event(now playing as COR), Murray will step down for being too friendly with the PSA and Patton is a successor option (as is Lindbergh, Russel, and the Klan under Simmons). (Also note, the COR can't actually peace with the PSA unless Russel is president- attempting to accept their deal will always have Murray coup'd by someone unless Murray backs down when warned) OR wait for Simmons to die and go any post-death path(scroll up for guide above) and Patton will be a coup option in the event chain (Patton can coup after Simmons dies if you refuse black legion intel, don't arrest Stephenson, don't reveal the plot, and then bag Stephenson all in an event chain)\n\n Q: How to get Richard Russel's moderate SocCon COR?

Then in the event "NDWL Expansion", choose "Not much we can do". Simmons will eventually call a special congress and be elected, unlocking "The Invisible Empire". Once COR has Simmons in charge, go down his tree, eventually he will die (tied to tree progress, not an actual date, dies a few months after doing his last focus), allowing you to choose whether the Old or Young Klan takes over, or Armstrong. To get Old Klan, allow Effinger to work with the Black League in the event shortly after Simmons dies and they will coup. To get the Young Klan, the next event will ask you to allow Patton to arrest Stephenson or not; arrest him and kill his accomplice in the next event and the young klan will eventually coup. To get Armstrong, don't arrest him, expose the plot in the next event and have the army swear loyalty. (NOTE: going down any Klan path can have the BBR spawn if you piss of them off, so be prepared for it). If you want the Fordists instead, don't allow white league promotions, agree to all of Ford's demands, and Lindbergh will take over.\n\n This the most straight forward way to get any of these options in power, BUT a few other distinct paths to get to them exist, such as the Young Klan coup against Lindbergh (don't give the NDWL promotions, say yes to everything Ford asks for, Lindbergh will take over, eventually you'll get an event about an Order of 76 recruiter getting killed, choose to arrest NDWL leaders instead of leaving it along which stops the coup, and the Klan coups you) or the Young Klan Coup against Armstrong (Rockwell/Yockey of the Young Klan can both coup Armstrong if he kills the older members of the Young Klan in his climb to power and then is too wacky with his policies/fucks up the smallpox epidemic as you go down Armstrong's tree)."

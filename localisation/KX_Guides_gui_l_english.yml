Then concerns over Curtis' health can be raised, and if pressed, Hoover can be nominated instead. Then just elect Hoover.\n\n Avoiding the 2ACW as Hoover:\n\n Complete the left side of Hoover's tree as soon as he is elected down to and including "The Hoover Raids." Authorize the raids, and expand the FBI in the next event. Then in the riot event, choose anything but waiting for them to calm down as that will get Hoover assassinated. Then do the focus to reassure the establishment, and then start the right side of his tree.\n\n If you go Home Rule to avoid:\n\nInvite Haywood to talk, deny Long and Murray, then as long as you expanded the FBI, they will be killed. Agree to all to Haywood's demands and don't disarm the militia to avoid the 2ACW. OR Invite them, then Haywood demands reforms, then funding, then Murray proposing a thing. Radicals get upset and Mac demands a position as militias are  beingannoying. Accept everything, don't force the militias to disarm and you will avoid the civil war.\n\nIf you go Hard Line to avoid:\n\nFollow Marshall's advice (only works if the FBI was expanded), then reinforce in Illinois in the next event. Then in the event on cracking down or negotiating wages, negotiate. Then focus on the white leagues and give Mac more men in the next two events and the war will be avoided.

To get: \n\n -American Cincinnatus: Accept the WCC's deal in the first standoff event by stepping down\n\n -Junta/Triumvirate: Offer to negotiate, hope WCC accepts, accept their demands (WCC gets an event to either accept your demands, attack you outright, or force Mac into a decision of stepping down and holding elections or fighting the WCC)\n\n -Senatus Populusque Americanus: As explained above, if you offer to negotiate, the WCC gets an event on what to do. If they rally allies against Mac, he will have to delcare war or allow elections. Allowing elections is the Senatus path (what the WCC does is up to rng, unless you turn ai off and tag switch to them to choose what you want them too in their event)\n\n -American Caesar: in any of the above event choices explained, go with the war option\n\n Also if you want natpop WCC, play as the Feds and get to 80% surrender progress (lose DC and one other VP), and click the decision to have Mac flee west.\n\nQ: How to get the Navy with a State path for the Feds/USA?\n\nA:  roughly 10 days after MacArthur coups the USA's government, the event "Navy Demands" will fire, so deny their request (agreeing to it keeps Mac in power). Then King's Offer will fire where King asks for control over the navy. There are three options: Choosing to back King will lead to him couping Mac, establishing the Navy with a State, Choosing to ask congress for help in subordinating the navy will end the affair, leaving Mac in charge, Choosing to do nothing will lead to Leahy's Coup which aims for the return of American democracy"

Once COR has Simmons in charge, go down his tree, eventually he will die (tied to tree progress, not an actual date, dies a few months after doing his last focus), allowing you to choose whether the Old or Young Klan takes over, or Armstrong. To get Old Klan, allow Effinger to work with the Black League in the event shortly after Simmons dies and they will coup. To get the Young Klan, the next event will ask you to allow Patton to arrest Stephenson or not; arrest him and kill his accomplice in the next event and the young klan will eventually coup. To get Armstrong, don't arrest him, expose the plot in the next event and have the army swear loyalty. (NOTE: going down any Klan path can have the BBR spawn if you piss of them off, so be prepared for it). If you want the Fordists instead, don't allow white league promotions, agree to all of Ford's demands, and Lindbergh will take over.\n\n This the most straight forward way to get any of these options in power, BUT a few other distinct paths to get to them exist, such as the Young Klan coup against Lindbergh (don't give the NDWL promotions, say yes to everything Ford asks for, Lindbergh will take over, eventually you'll get an event about an Order of 76 recruiter getting killed, choose to arrest NDWL leaders instead of leaving it along which stops the coup, and the Klan coups you) or the Young Klan Coup against Armstrong (Rockwell/Yockey of the Young Klan can both coup Armstrong if he kills the older members of the Young Klan in his climb to power and then is too wacky with his policies/fucks up the smallpox epidemic as you go down Armstrong's tree)."

In the final event of this short chain, you will be given three choices:\n\n -Having Ungern survive and win leads to ‘Sane’ Ungern staying in power, and attempting to reclaim Russia and bring back the Tsardom under his chosen monarch, the late Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia or his son.\n -Having Ungern get shot but escape forces him to fall into a coma, and when he awakes, it's Khan larp time like before.\n -Having Ungern be killed outright will have Gada Meiren ‘save’ Mongolia as the nation descends into total chaos. In the chaos, an event will fire where you can choose to have any of the other paths take over (Ja Lama (natpop), the Buddhist Buddyn Zövlöl (pataut), the Mongol Ardīn Nam and the other democratic paths including Gada Meiren the Red Khan (radsoc-soccon), the Yazgurtan Survaljtan aristocrats (authdem), and the two foreign paths (Anfu Club/Anhui Clique that reforms Republic of China or Shikai’s Empire of China, or the Russian Soyombo Revival Society/SRS that forms Zheltorossiya). All non-Ungern paths can still at least form a greater Mongolian state, and paths like Ja Lama or the Buddyn Zövlöl have special formables.\n -The old KR puppet paths also still exist, but are hidden until puppeted.\n\n Q: How to get Socialist Mongolia?\n\n A: Play Mongolia, have Gada Meiren kill Ungern-Sternberg in the early event and bring back Mongolian democracy like normal (full guide in the larger mongolia guide above) Then do the whole Democratic tree and in the end elections, elect the MAN Social Democrats, or choose to rig it from the start as the radsoc MAN or postpone elections in a later event to swap to radsoc, and wait. Then invite the radical exiles back in an event, dont limit their power in the next event, then let them coup to get Totalist Mongolia. Starts under Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav. To get Ulanhu, choose him in the power struggle after the Bowing Before TItans focus. To get syndies, deadlock the powerstruggle instead and choose Syndicalists in the next event. To get Gada Meiren with Anandyn Amar, pick them in the Syndicalist coup event instead. Syndicalists can choose their leader after taking power, and Gada Meiren can choose between tot or radsoc after taking power. Picking radsoc also unlocks his mini tree at the end of the democratic tree. (Ulanhu's path, Luvsansharav's path, Gada Meiren's path if you choose radsoc, and the democratc socdem/radsoc MAN all have possible alt leaders as well through different events, with some familar faces being options for some)."

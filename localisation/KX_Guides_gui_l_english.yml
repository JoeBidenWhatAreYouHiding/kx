Then concerns over Curtis' health can be raised, and if pressed, Hoover can be nominated instead. Then just elect Hoover.\n\n Avoiding the 2ACW as Hoover:\n\n Complete the left side of Hoover's tree as soon as he is elected down to and including "The Hoover Raids." Authorize the raids, and expand the FBI in the next event. Then in the riot event, choose anything but waiting for them to calm down as that will get Hoover assassinated. Then do the focus to reassure the establishment, and then start the right side of his tree.\n\n If you go Home Rule to avoid:\n\nInvite Haywood to talk, deny Long and Murray, then as long as you expanded the FBI, they will be killed. Agree to all to Haywood's demands and don't disarm the militia to avoid the 2ACW. OR Invite them, then Haywood demands reforms, then funding, then Murray proposing a thing. Radicals get upset and Mac demands a position as militias are  beingannoying. Accept everything, don't force the militias to disarm and you will avoid the civil war.\n\nIf you go Hard Line to avoid:\n\nFollow Marshall's advice (only works if the FBI was expanded), then reinforce in Illinois in the next event. Then in the event on cracking down or negotiating wages, negotiate. Then focus on the white leagues and give Mac more men in the next two events and the war will be avoided.\n\nIf you want to get Republicans in every party slot, you need to integrate the Democrats and the Progressives into the Republican Party in the event about the future of Hoover's coalition (in order to be able to do so, either let MacArthur restore order to DC in the riot events or go both Rural Investments + Austerity during your economic choices)"

(only Mac's paths, other USA paths you just elect the party you want and do the tree if you avoided the war or didnt get the Mac coup)\n\n A: Win the 2ACW as the Feds, and wait for the WCC event about Ike and the others wanting to meet with Mac (American Standoff event). To get: \n\n -American Cincinnatus: Accept the WCC's deal in the first standoff event by stepping down\n\n -Junta/Triumvirate: Offer to negotiate, hope WCC accepts, accept their demands (WCC gets an event to either accept your demands, attack you outright, or force Mac into a decision of stepping down and holding elections or fighting the WCC)\n\n -Senatus Populusque Americanus: As explained above, if you offer to negotiate, the WCC gets an event on what to do. If they rally allies against Mac, he will have to delcare war or allow elections. Allowing elections is the Senatus path (what the WCC does is up to rng, unless you turn ai off and tag switch to them to choose what you want them too in their event)\n\n -American Caesar: in any of the above event choices explained, go with the war option\n\n Also if you want natpop WCC, play as the Feds and get to 80% surrender progress (lose DC and one other VP), and click the decision to have Mac flee west.\n\nQ: How to get the Navy with a State path for the Feds/USA?\n\nA:  roughly 10 days after MacArthur coups the USA's government, the event "Navy Demands" will fire, so deny their request (agreeing to it keeps Mac in power). Then King's Offer will fire where King asks for control over the navy. There are three options: Choosing to back King will lead to him couping Mac, establishing the Navy with a State, Choosing to ask congress for help in subordinating the navy will end the affair, leaving Mac in charge, Choosing to do nothing will lead to Leahy's Coup which aims for the return of American democracy"

Both choices lead to the event we need.\nYou need to pick 'Fevzi takes over party leadership' in 'Fevzi Pasha Announces His Ambitions', after that he launches a military coup.\nComplete his tree and end the state of emergency at the end.\nIn the new tree pick 'Centralise State Authority' and then 'Incorporate the Kadroist Movement'\n\nAfter the last focus in the natpop tree, you can choose to make the otts keep the sultan, or get rid of the sultan and stay natpop or swap to tot.\n\nQ: How to get Social Conservative Islamists/Paternal Autocrat Absolutists Ottoman Empire and Ottoman Caliphate? (Originally a KR4 trap path that was un-trapped, some additional focuses were added by KX along with the possibility to have Pan-Islam formables and cores)\n\nA: First you need to get the Liberal Coalition in power, to do so:\nFail the education reform as Kemal.\nWhen Kemal calls for the dismissal of parliament have the Sultan dismiss Kemal.\nCall for early elections.\nElect HIF.\n\nThen to get Social Conservative:\nHave Conservatives representative support below 0 (use your decisions and your focuses), the Sultan will then intervene, sacks Prince Sabahattin, and make Shakib Arslan Grand Vizir; turning you Social Conservatives (IMF in power) and unlocking their paths.\n\nGo down the tree, around 50 days after doing the "Caliphate of Old" focus, the Kemalists elements in the army will attempt to coups:\nTo get PatAut Absolutists, have the Sultan's men defeats the Coup, this will unlock the right focuses branch.\nTo get SocCon Islamic Conservatives, have the Sultan promises to moderate the new Islamic constituion, this will unlock the left focuses branch.\n\nDoing the last focus of the middle shared branch (A Pan-Islamic Empire) will allow you to get the Ottoman Caliphate formables and cores on the Muslim world.

To get Old Klan, allow Effinger to work with the Black League in the event shortly after Simmons dies and they will coup. (NOTE: refusing to allow the Black Legion free reign in their attacks on Chicago and churches in two events following the 'Terror in the Night' focus will allow Effinger to coup Stephenson). To get the Young Klan, the next event will ask you to allow Patton to arrest Stephenson or not; arrest him and kill his accomplice in the next event and the young klan will eventually coup. To get Armstrong, don't arrest him, expose the plot in the next event and have the army swear loyalty.

If you want the Fordists instead, don't allow white league promotions, agree to all of Ford's demands, and Lindbergh will take over.\n\n This the most straight forward way to get any of these options in power, BUT a few other distinct paths to get to them exist, such as the Young Klan coup against Lindbergh (don't give the NDWL promotions, say yes to everything Ford asks for, Lindbergh will take over, eventually you'll get an event about an Order of 76 recruiter getting killed, choose to arrest NDWL leaders instead of leaving it along which stops the coup, and the Klan coups you) or the Young Klan Coup against Armstrong (Rockwell/Yockey of the Young Klan can both coup Armstrong if he kills the older members of the Young Klan in his climb to power and then is too wacky with his policies/fucks up the smallpox epidemic as you go down Armstrong's tree). To get George W.

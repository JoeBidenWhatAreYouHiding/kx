Then concerns over Curtis' health can be raised, and if pressed, Hoover can be nominated instead. Then just elect Hoover.\n\n Avoiding the 2ACW as Hoover:\n\n Complete the left side of Hoover's tree as soon as he is elected down to and including "The Hoover Raids." Authorize the raids, and expand the FBI in the next event. Then in the riot event, choose anything but waiting for them to calm down as that will get Hoover assassinated. Then do the focus to reassure the establishment, and then start the right side of his tree.\n\n If you go Home Rule to avoid:\n\nInvite Haywood to talk, deny Long and Murray, then as long as you expanded the FBI, they will be killed. Agree to all to Haywood's demands and don't disarm the militia to avoid the 2ACW. OR Invite them, then Haywood demands reforms, then funding, then Murray proposing a thing. Radicals get upset and Mac demands a position as militias are  beingannoying. Accept everything, don't force the militias to disarm and you will avoid the civil war.\n\nIf you go Hard Line to avoid:\n\nFollow Marshall's advice (only works if the FBI was expanded), then reinforce in Illinois in the next event. Then in the event on cracking down or negotiating wages, negotiate. Then focus on the white leagues and give Mac more men in the next two events and the war will be avoided.

To get: \n\n -American Cincinnatus: Accept the WCC's deal in the first standoff event by stepping down\n\n -Junta/Triumvirate: Offer to negotiate, hope WCC accepts, accept their demands (WCC gets an event to either accept your demands, attack you outright, or force Mac into a decision of stepping down and holding elections or fighting the WCC)\n\n -Senatus Populusque Americanus: As explained above, if you offer to negotiate, the WCC gets an event on what to do. If they rally allies against Mac, he will have to delcare war or allow elections. Allowing elections is the Senatus path (what the WCC does is up to rng, unless you turn ai off and tag switch to them to choose what you want them too in their event)\n\n -American Caesar: in any of the above event choices explained, go with the war option\n\n Also if you want natpop WCC, play as the Feds and get to 80% surrender progress (lose DC and one other VP), and click the decision to have Mac flee west.\n\nQ: How to get the Navy with a State path for the Feds/USA?\n\nA:  roughly 10 days after MacArthur coups the USA's government, the event "Navy Demands" will fire, so deny their request (agreeing to it keeps Mac in power). Then King's Offer will fire where King asks for control over the navy. There are three options: Choosing to back King will lead to him couping Mac, establishing the Navy with a State, Choosing to ask congress for help in subordinating the navy will end the affair, leaving Mac in charge, Choosing to do nothing will lead to Leahy's Coup which aims for the return of American democracy"

If no one party recieves a majority (choose a different party in each of the 3 congress events), the March on Naples event will fire (there are two marches on Naples: a small one Evola can do very early on of the game to boost legion support, and the second one after elections deadlock - the 2nd one is the important one), which will allow you to choose between the Mafia, Messe, the Catholics, or the syndie/radsoc coalition maintaining control under normal conditions. To get the Fasci and/or Evola to be options in the event as well, choose event options that boost legion and fasci support in any events that fire in the months leading up to the congress (there are quite a few, the event choices tell you if support will go up or down if you hover cursor over them).\n\n To get Pio's Papacy, get the Neosanfedisti in the deadlock, then choose Pio's Vision, and complete all of Pio's focuses and own Latium (Rome)."

Once COR has Simmons in charge, go down his tree, eventually he will die (tied to tree progress, not an actual date, dies a few months after doing his last focus), allowing you to choose whether the Old or Young Klan takes over, or Armstrong. To get Old Klan, allow Effinger to work with the Black League in the event shortly after Simmons dies and they will coup. To get the Young Klan, the next event will ask you to allow Patton to arrest Stephenson or not; arrest him and kill his accomplice in the next event and the young klan will eventually coup. To get Armstrong, don't arrest him, expose the plot in the next event and have the army swear loyalty. (NOTE: going down any Klan path can have the BBR spawn if you piss of them off, so be prepared for it). If you want the Fordists instead, don't allow white league promotions, agree to all of Ford's demands, and Lindbergh will take over.\n\n This the most straight forward way to get any of these options in power, BUT a few other distinct paths to get to them exist, such as the Young Klan coup against Lindbergh (don't give the NDWL promotions, say yes to everything Ford asks for, Lindbergh will take over, eventually you'll get an event about an Order of 76 recruiter getting killed, choose to arrest NDWL leaders instead of leaving it along which stops the coup, and the Klan coups you) or the Young Klan Coup against Armstrong (Rockwell/Yockey of the Young Klan can both coup Armstrong if he kills the older members of the Young Klan in his climb to power and then is too wacky with his policies/fucks up the smallpox epidemic as you go down Armstrong's tree)."

guides.121.d:0 "Q:How to get the paths of KX Somalia?\n\nA:to get the SYL with the Sultan, elections fire by going down the Primus Inter Pares path.\nTo get the SYL republic, go natpop, then go soccon in their path OR go tot, then have the SYL coup and hold elections. (soccon,marlib,soclib,socdem too if after barre coup)\n\n-auth sultanate, do Crack Down on Powerful Clans path but rush the last focus to avoid tot or natpop coup. (authdem, pataut)\n\n-alt sultan or aristocratic republic, do the elections and elect the royalists, then have the leader abandon the original Boqor for his own ambitions, picking either a republic or the Majeerteen sultanate (he can also just stay loyal to the sultan instead if he is still alive)\n\n-tots or natpops, do 'Crack Down on Powerful Clans', then do the 'Federal Elections' focus below it, but DONT DO the 'Establish the Hangash' focus. Then go to war with Ethiopia (they declare war on you eventually), and then an event will fire where tots or natpops can take over and kill the sultan, or you can let the sultanate hang on.\n\n-If you pick the tots, you can swap to radsoc or pataut in an event later. if u stay tot, you can swap to syndie or jacobin tot to join the 3int later (all options except syndies have diff subideology options too). u can also be coup'd, allowing democracy to come back if u want.\n\n-if you pick the natpops, you can swap to authdem or stay natpop in a later event. if u swap to authdem, you can later swap to soccon if you want as well which also allows the SYL to try to coup to make a democracy. if you conquer Djibouti and stay natpop you can swap your leader to Mahmoud Harbi (Djibouti pan-somalian) and if you go soccon or authdem, you can swap your leader to Hassan Gouled Aptidon (Djibouti Conservative Authoritarian)."

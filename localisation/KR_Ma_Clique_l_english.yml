### Leaders ###
POLITICS_XSM_MA_FUXIANG_DESC:0 "Ma Fuxiang is considered one of the founders of the Ma Family Clique that has cemented itself in the Northwest. Serving like many others in his family under Dong Fuxiang, he managed to make a name for himself in the Boxer Rebellion by serving in the Kansu Braves. By the dawn of the Xinhai Revolution, him and his nephew Ma Hongbin protected Catholic Missions while figures like Ma Anliang fought in the name of the Qing against the republicans. While Anliang managed to secure victories during the revolution, the inevitable fall of the dynasty caused Anliang and the rest of the family to declare loyalty to the republic. Anliang passed away not long afterwards, leaving Fuxiang as the unifying figure of the northern Ma Clique. Fuxiang's main goal that still remains true was to ensure that they do not lose their position in the northwest. Before he knew it, him and the rest of the family were siding with the Guominjun as they occupied lower Gansu in a bloody campaign. This didn't last for long however, as he with the rest of the family following him betrayed the Guominjun and sided with the Zhili, an allegiance that has lasted Fuxiang nearly a decade at this point. Being named governor of Gansu and Suiyuan, Fuxiang’s constant allegiance switching finally paid off.\nNow leading a more peaceful life, Fuxiang holds a key role in the northwest. Being the head of the Tibetan and Mongol Affairs Commission, he oversees relations with these two rather hostile groups. On top of this, his new mission is "humanizing" the Huis to the Han through his own unique blend of Confucian and Islamic beliefs that has had managed to have moderate success, with some even citing him as a scholar. A decade of peace has been brought by Fuxiang, one that will last for as long as he does."
POLITICS_XSM_MA_LIN_DESC:0 "Ma Lin is the son of famous Kansu Brave Ma Haiyan, who with Ma Fuxiang fought the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900. Growing up in a confluence of Han and Hui influence in Gansu, Ma Lin allied himself with the Xidaotang Hanafi muslim sect. Ma Lin often served as a mediating influence in the first two decades of the 20th century to the more radical Ma family members, including Ma Zhongying. Ma Lin was able to repulse Ma Zhongying's raids in Gansu during the Ma-Guominjun war. Ma Lin succeeded his brother, Ma Qi, as Governor of Qinghai following his death in 1931. This appointment greatly displeased his nephew, Ma Bufang, who voiced his own qualificationns for Governorship. Ma Lin's work as Governor saw the expansion of Qinghai into Amdo in 1935, garnering praise from the Ma families. By the end of 1935, Ma Lin had formulated a plan with Ma Fuxiang for integrating Yushu into Qinghai proper, but this was cut short by Ma Fuxiang's death."
POLITICS_XSM_MA_HONGBIN_DESC:0 "Ma Hongbin grew up in the shadow of his father, Ma Fulu, who gave his life against the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900. Unlike his father however, Ma Hongbin chose to protect a Christian mission in San Daohe and received a the Order of Leopold for this action after the Boxer Rebellion. Early during the Warlord era, Ma Hongbin made overtures to ally with the KMT, sending General Chiang Kai-shek a notification of his new governance of Ningxia in 1920. Unexpectedly, Chiang in 1921 requested Ma Hongbin open Ningxia up to Han settlements, which would violate the autonomy of the Hui. Ma Hongbin officially denounced Chiang in 1925. Unfortunately for Ma Hongbin, Ma Hongkui became agitated at Ma Hongbin's relations with the KMT, and denounced Ma Hongbin as a Socialist spy publicly in 1930. This rivalry was interrupted by the Ma-Guominjun war, which saw Ma Hongkui fighting alongside Ma Hongbin against Feng Yuxiang. Ma Hongbin has recently been alienated for his failure to stop the rouge warlord Ma Zhongying from recruiting raiders in Ningxia."
POLITICS_XSM_MA_HONGKUI_DESC:0 "Ma Hongkui is the son of the 'Hero of the Northwest', Ma Fuxiang. Ma Hongkui graduated from Gansu Military Academy in 1909, and aligned with the Xinhai Revolution in 1912. Ma Hongkui declared himself a 'Bandit Surpression Commander', which initially put him inside the Guominjun as part of Ma Fuxiang's alliance with the clique. When Feng Yuxiang betrayed Ma Fuxiang, Ma Hongkui brutally purged his Brigade of Guominjun as part of the Ma-Guominjun war. Following the destruction of Gansu, Ma Hongkui doubled down in his opposition to the KMT, going so far as to denounce Ma Hongbin for his prior association with them. Ma Hongbin's struggle during the early 1930s was balancing the Governorship of Gansu he inherited from his father with the economic woes brought by Han immigration."
POLITICS_XSM_MA_BUFANG_DESC:0 "Ma Bufang is the younger brother of Ma Buqing and the son of Ma Qi, and served alongside them in the Qinghai Army starting in 1915. This appointment was approved by the Beiyang Government in 1919, and allowed Ma Bufang to enhance his reputation. Ma Bufang studied Islam during his army tenuere, becoming familiar with the Dongguan Mosque and Ma Wanfu's Yihewani before his promotion to General. Ma Bufang followed Ma Fuxiang's allied Guominjun until their betrayal, recieving the brunt of the family's ire for his lack of conviction to fight the Guominjun directly. After Ma Lin was appointed Governor of Qinghai in 1931, Ma Bufang dove deeply into his muslim devotion, officially endorsing the Yihewani in 1933 as the premir patriotic form of Islam. Ma Bufang has a less-than-committal relationship with Ma Hongbin and Ma Hongkui, as Ma Bufang personally admires Ma Zhongying's fighting spirit while denouncing his betrayal of the family."

Ma Biao was promoted to Brigadier Commander in the Qinghai Army at the start of the 1935 war with Tibet, where he lead a valiant defense of Yushu against the Tibetan army. Ma Biao's victory was followed by a brutal retribution against the Golok people, whom he deemed traitor to the Mas. Ma Biao oversaw the desolation of Golok towns, and declared this a stepping stone to the growth of the Dongxiang people, whom he fought alongside. Ma Biao returned to Qinghai, where many residents despised him for his massacre.

Ma Zhongying followed in the footsteps of his older relatives and entered into military service at just 14. At age 17, Ma Zhongying shocked his family by deserting the Battle of Gansu against Feng Yuxiang, taking with him his cavalry unit north to Ningxia. The ensuing decade has seen Ma Zhongying attempt to carve out his own fiefdom out of the eastern Ma provinces, his only ally his distant cousin Ma Hushan.

Ma Buqing served under Feng Yuxiang druing the Ma-Guominjun alliance, and was burned politically by their betrayal."

Ma Wanfu founded the Yihewani, a Hanafi Islamic fundamentalist sect that opposed the qabbalistic aspects of Suifsm. Ma Wanfu was made a pariah when he supported the Dugan revolt in 1895, and was forced into hiding for decades. Yang Zengxin arrested and attempted to humiliate Ma Wanfu before his execution in 1915, but Qinghai Governor Ma Qi rescued him, and boosted the Yihewani's power in Qinghai. Ma Qi made Ma Wanfu tutor Ma Bufang sternly, which it is rumored fostered an interior hatred for Ma Wanfu in Ma Bufang."

The Guominjun tightened their hold and bled the province dry for its limited resources to fund the war effort, leaving both civilian industry and the arsenal itself lying in ruin.

mac.1.t:0 "Introduction to the Ma Clique"
mac.1.d:0 "The Ma Clique is comprised of a multitude of a Chinese governors who have been serving the Qing Dynasty ever since the 1880s. The Ma family itself is not one giant family, but three that have divided power in the ruling area. The first family has been overshadowed after the family head, Ma Anliang died in 1918. Now primarily led by the second and third families, the clique has had a prosperous reign over its territory since.\n\nThe Xinhai Revolution led to the Mas under  Anliang to initially side with the Qing, but when defeat was inevitable, defecting to the republic. Afterwards forcing both the Mongols to the north and Tibet to the south to recognnize the Republic as the legitimate government, the Mas kept an air of stability inside Northwest China. Ma Anliang soon died in 1918, with the clique being primarily divided in two. The Ma Clique under Ma Fuxiang holding Gansu and Ningxia and the southern Clique under Ma Qi based in soon to be Qinghai.\n\nThe clique was still somewhat united in who they sided with however, with the Guominjun soon occupying southern Gansu, forcing the Mas to side with Feng Yuxiang. After the reality of the Guominjun's condition became more clear, all the warlords except for a small few defected from their side over to the Zhili.\n\nStaying loyal to the Zhili through the Qing restoration and beyond, the Mas have become trusted figures by most if not all cliques as valid protectors of the northwest intent to keep the land Chinese. Now also ruling over Suiyuan, the clique prospers as vital members of the Qing Dynasty, ready to fight for what they believe in."
mac.1.a:0 "The three families prosper"

mac.2.t:0 "The Three Provinces"
mac.2.d:0 "The Mas have their base of power in three main provinces, Ningxia, Gansu, and the newest province Qinghai.\n\nNingxia and Gansu are both under the northern Ma clique with Ma Fuxiang serving as Governor of Gansu and his nephew Ma Hongbin occupying the position of Governor of Ningxia. Gansu is where a large part of the clique's power is based, holding the Taiyuan arsenal where most weapon manufacturing takes place within the clique along with the largest population base. Currently struggling in civilian industry in the south due to the Guominjun's bloody occupation, the province is not in the state it used to be. Also present is the dangerous young warlord Ma Zhongying, holding large parts of the north under his bloody occupation. Ningxia is where a large source of the Mas manpower comes from, with the province holding significant amounts of horses and bandits who are willing to be recruited. While the current peace does not allow Ningxia to shine, should war come, its value will only rise.\n\nThe southern Ma Clique currently under Ma Lin rules over the recently made province of Qinghai. Possibly the most rural in all of the northwest, the people here are mostly nomadic under staying in some of the major cities like Xining. The south is a highly disputed area between the Mas and Tibet, as the area is seen under a certain shade of flipping between Tibetan nomad control and Ma warlord. The center of this is Yushu, constantly fought over throughout the early 30s. While the situation has somewhat calmed, it is not expected to remain that way. The political situation of the Xining government is currently fought between the governor Ma Lin and his nephew Ma Bufang, with many seeing Ma Lin's ousting from the position inevitable. Bufang continues to court people to his side with Lin only growing more isolated by the day."
mac.2.a:0 "The three are the key"

mac.3.t:0 "Ma Fuxiang Speaks in Tianshui"
mac.3.d:0 "With the year coming to a close and the new Year of the Rat soon dawning upon us, Fuxiang despite his weaker state after his heart attack has addressed the people of Tianshui, the capital of Gansu. Speaking on the stability that the Zhili led Qing government has managed to bring to not only the Northwest but all of China for the past 10 years and his gratefulness for their continued support of his governorship of Gansu and Suiyuan.\n\nMa Fuxiang himself has worked himself up to be one of the more trusted officials in the Zhili Government. Despite him and his family's defection to the Guominjun during their occupation of Gansu, his subsequent defection to the Zhili has made him be seen as one of the key players at the time. He's spread his political beliefs to his close family of Ma Hongkui and Ma Hongbin as well, with Hongbin even being the current governor of Ningxia and Hongkui seen as a zealous Zhili supporter. Fuxiang has managed even in his sickly state to create a Zhili bastion in the majority of the northwest.\n\nBy the end of his speech, the crowd cheered for another year of Fuxiang."
mac.3.a:0 "Truly a great man"

mac.4.t:0 "Ma Lin Addresses the Xining Council"
mac.4.d:0 "Ma Lin who is the current governor of Qinghai is different from his counterparts in the northern clique greatly. Lin succeeded his brother Ma Qi after his death in 1931, and very much comes from the same vein as him. Unlike Fuxiang who deeply believes in a mix of Confucianist and Islamic values to humanize the Hui in the eyes of the Han, Lin believes that the Hui belief in Islam is sacred, and while they are still Chinese, must have their own beliefs respected by the Hans. This has caused a defiance attitude among him and a select few others in the Xining Council, with this group being the last to defect against the Guominjun, with even rumours of Ma Lin and others in the Qinghai Civilian Governorship harboring sympathies to the Christian general Feng Yuxiang in Shanxi.\n\nWhile there is no real proof behind these claims, this doesn't stop Ma Lin's nephew and military governor of Qinghai, Ma Bufang from organizing against him. Stirrings of a coup from Bufang to consolidate the civilian and military governorships under him have popped up now and again, with suspicious meetings between Bufang and others in the council with their purpose remaining unknown. Lin sees Bufang as his primary threat to his governorship, and has been very cautious to let him gain leverage over him.\n\nBy the end of Lin's address, the council was mixed with cheers and eerie silence."
mac.4.a:0 "The silence grows"

mac.5.t:0 "A New Beginning"
mac.5.d:0 "The collapse of Zhili authority has come, and at just the wrong time for the Ma family sphere.\n\nWith Fuxiang's health only worsening by the day, he has been forced to put strenuous amounts of effort to keep the peace between his nephew Ma Hongbin and own son Ma Hongkui. Hongbin who is generally considered the more experienced of the two was mostly raised by Fuxiang himself due to his father, Ma Fulu's death in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion. He is seen as a calm and moderate man in a similar vein to his uncle by considering the words of his advisors and being what is seen as politically flexible depending on the situation. Ma Hongkui who is currently set to be the new governor of Gansu once Fuxiang passes away, is seen as the more extreme alternative. Possibly the most anti-socialist in the government and staunchly loyal to the Qing to a fault, many see him as a loose cannon that can back his harsh words with a fierce fighting force. The similarities between Hongkui and Hongbin are few, and as such conflict often. Without any ability to solidly intervene in any conflict between the two once Fuxiang passes with a lack of central authority, Fuxiang has put much work into ending conflict between the two, but many don't see it having any real effect.\n\nMeanwhile in Qinghai, tensions only continue to rise between the Lin and Bufang cliques who are trying to court officials to their side. With the lack of central authority, Bufang is free to make his move with little to no legal repercussions."
mac.5.a:0 "This is the worst timing..."

mac.6.t:0 "Growing Zhongying Raids in Upper Gansu"
mac.6.d:0 "Ma Zhongying is the "trouble child" of the Ma family, all things considered. At the young age of 26 currently, he and other youths lead a band of bandits that raid and pillage villages. Some of their greatest achievements come from the Guominjun occupation, with Zhongying and his gang being some of the first to defect against the Guominjun. While the destruction they wrought upon Lower Gansu was great, their efforts were very effective in disrupting Guominjun operations in the region. However, after his destruction of the Huasi Mosque in Gansu, he was expelled from military efforts by his uncle Ma Bufang, now lying in a location where he can do a minimal amount of damage.\n\nHowever with the fall of the Zhili from grace, Zhongying has begun to pillage yet again in his new position. Many suspect the reasons are deeper this time around compared to the last, with rumours of his plan to make way outside the Ma sphere in the hopes of establishing his own domain."
mac.6.a:0 "Will he ever calm down?"

mac.7.t:0 "29 Dead in Yushu"
mac.7.d:0 "Yushu located in southern Qinghai has been combated over since the Xinhai Revolution, with Sichuan, Tibet, and the Qinghai region all claiming their legal possession of the town. The reasoning for this is that this important city contains one of the only roads leading to these three provinces, making it the key to the northwest. The Xining Government remained in control largely, and with the Tibetan invasion of Sichuan in 1930, the Xining Government intervened in favor of the Sichuanese, with the following treaty making the town officially part of Xining's sphere. This doesn't mean their rule is uncontested.\n\nTibetan raiders have been frequenting the town as of late, with the newest raid killing 29 citizens. While the Tibetan government denies any involvement in these raids, it has created an air of tension in the region between the Mas and Tibetans."
mac.7.a:0 "There's no way they're not involved!"

mac.8.t:0 "Council Members Indecisive on Ma Bufang"
mac.8.d:0 "With rising tensions in the Xining Council, Bufang has not slowed down on his moves to take away Lin from power. Including bribes, threats, and other unspeakable acts, Bufang is in a constant slandering campaign against not only Lin but the Guominjun as well. Many are beginning to see Lin as betraying the interests of not only the young Qinghai province but China itself. Lin has been put in a precarious position as much as he does not want to admit it and will need to act soon if he doesn't want to be overcome by the coming tide of Bufang and the military."
mac.8.a:0 "Surely it can't be true"

mac.9.t:0 "Status of Suiyuan"
mac.9.d:0 "Fuxiang is the current governor of Suiyuan but as he quickly grown bedridden, Fuxiang needs to name his successor to the province. Currently under the threat of the Mongolians who might see their chance once Fuxiang passes, he needs to choose between Hongkui and Hongbin. Hongkui is considered Hongbin's superior militarily and also rules over a larger army, but his temper might get the best of him and leave the province vunrable to attack. Hongbin is seen as calm and responsible, and even with his smaller army, would be able to handle any oncoming Mongolian invasion should it come. This doesn't save either option from danger as what many predict to be the oncoming conflict between Hongkui and Hongbin will put the authority of the province in danger either way. Maybe it would be easier and safer to put the province in the hands of a third party in the family who is likely to solely focus on the provinces safety and development?"
mac.9.a:0 "Ma Hongkui's army will keep the area safe"
mac.9.b:0 "Ma Hongbin's patience will keep it safe"
mac.9.c:0 "Neither can be trusted, hand it over to Ma Liang!"

mac.10.t:0 "The Passing of Ma Fuxiang"
mac.10.d:0 "Ma Fuxiang after being bedridden for nearly a month, has passed away in his sleep. His passing marks to many, the end of an era of Ma politics. As the older generation dies off one by one, the fate of the Ma sphere of influence is now in the hands of its younger members. While today the family joins collectively in a day of mourning as the father of the Mas has drifted from this world, one cannot guarantee tomorrow will not be filled with arguments, tension, and rage without their central figurehead. For now however, the peace and unity this has brought upon the clique is to be enjoyed.\n\nWith the central figurehead of the family gone and the north left among the younger generation, the Qinghai Clique in the south is the closest the family can find in central authority. Currently headed by Ma Lin, Lin lacks the authority, reputation, and presence Fuxiang had, many hope to look to him for guiance into this new era of politics without Fuxiang."
mac.10.a:0 "Rest in peace"

mac.11.t:0 "Recent Events in Yushu"
mac.11.d:0 "Ma Bufang has begun to center his attention more on the conflict going on currently within Yushu between our forces and the Tibetans, and with this has come a rather sudden proposal. Bufang has made a publication called "Recent Events in Yushu", containing a summary of current defensive measures, the effects of other warlords like Liu Wenhui, and risk the region is in meant to be viewed by propoer central Chinese authority. While such an effective summary would help organize efforts to defend the region and secure support abroad, Ma Lin is worried that it being published would increase Bufang's renown among all of China and secure him more support within the council then he already posesses."
mac.11.a:0 "Let him publish it, he is of no concern"
mac.11.b:0 "Who does he think he is?!"

mac.12.t:0 "Ma Movements in Yushu"
mac.12.d:0 "The monks at Gyêgu Monastary have reported an increase in Ma militia activity in Yushu. This has suprised [TIB.GetLeader], who had heard conflicting reports that the Xining Council was in turmoil as of late. the monks can scarely forget the 1932 border war with the Ma Clique that saw thousands of Golok Tibetans disposessed and strewn across Yushu. We must find some way to counter the Ma military opression that threatens to again turn violent against our innocent people."
mac.12.a:0 "We must prevent another Golok"

mac.13.t:0 "Ma Bufang's Allies in Xining Revealed"
mac.13.d:0 "The Xining Council's unspoken divide was finally brought into the open today during an innocent conversation between Ma Lin and his subordinates. Arriving to the meeting several minutes early, Ma Lin was suprised to see Ma Bufang already deep in deliberation over the issue of rising food prices in Xining. Surrounding Ma Bufang was a small group of attentive listeners, including several of Ma Lin's distant nephews and in laws. Ma Lin interjected with a flurry of inquiries and accusations towards Ma Bufang, who responded with only silence. The Xining Council as a whole became silent, and remained so until afternoon prayers were called."
mac.13.a:0 "This is how you show your appreciation?"

mac.14.t:0 "Ma Bufang Begins Public Works"
mac.14.d:0 "Ma Bufang has come forward with an ambitious proposal to increase the aquaducts that feed Xining from Qinghai Lake, citing the increasing amount of refugees pouring into the city from Sichuan. Ma Bufang plans to achieve this by comissioning officers to order corvee laborers to build additional aqueducts lines. Ma Bufang has also implied in this promise that the Buddhists of Kumbum will become so desperate for water, they will yield to the Council to avoid starvation."
mac.14.a:0 "Another audcaious promise"

mac.100.t:0 "Petition from Ma Lin for Military Aid"
mac.100.d:0 "Ma Lin who is currently the civilian governor of Qinghai has petitioned the Guominjun for manpower to help establish his army against his own nephew, Ma Bufang. Ma Lin was one of the last officials to betray the Guominjun during the Ma defection against us, and even then only did so to ensure he wasn't completely expelled from his own family. He has continued harboring sympathies for the cause and hopes that our acceptance of this deal can reignite Ma-Guomingjun relations and lead to further deals in the future."
mac.100.a:0 "Send the man what he needs"
mac.100.b:0 "Sorry, but he have our own concerns here"

mac.101.t:0 "Yuxiang Accepts our Plead"
mac.101.d:0 "Feng Yuxiang understands the position Lin is in and has accepted his deal. Ma Lin now has a personal guard and army similar to Bufang's which he can use to defend against any potential illegal actions against his government. This isn't the only advantage however, as this has opened an avenue for a renewed Ma-Guominjun alliance should Lin manage to keep his control of Qinghai and influence over the clique in its entirety."
mac.101.a:0 "To Lin!"

mac.102.t:0 "Yuxiang Denies our Deal"
mac.102.d:0 "It seems that Feng Yuxiang does not trust us after our first betrayal, and has denied our request for men. This is seen as a disappointment to Lin who hoped to use this deal as an opening to reconcilliation between the two forces, but it seems that goal will need to wait for now. The rest of the Xining Council sems a bit relieved, however, as they remember the folly in Gansu when Feng Yuxiang betrayed the northern Ma family."
mac.102.a:0 "Damn"

mac.104.t:0 "The Yushu Conflict Escalates"
mac.104.d:0 "After yet another raid, it is almost impossible for the Yushu and Xining Governments to deny Tibetan connection to the frequent raids to the town of Yushu. Officially denouncing the Tibetan government for its practices, Tibet has taken this insult to its pride deeply and has officially re-asserted its claim to the Yushu region. Many see this as a new beginning to a war with Tibet as both sides are now hoping to establish their control over the remote region for the railroad that leads to the rest of China."
mac.104.a:0 "If they want to fight, they'll get one"

mac.105.t:0 "The Yushu Conflict Escalates"
mac.105.d:0 "It seems the Zhili collapse has caused the Qinghai governorship to grow inpatient with frequent raiding by Tibetan nomands in the region. Claiming that we are in fact funding the raiders in order to reclaim the Yushu township for ourselves, the Mas have denounced our government. Even though we do, in fact, have no connection with the recent raiding, they have the audacity to commit an action such as this? Obviously we cannot leave this matter alone. If we're already being blamed for the raiding, perhaps we could actually establish a connection with the raiders in order to increase their strength, and maybe even gain control of Yushu for ourselves?"
mac.105.a:0 "Qinghai scum..."

mac.106.t:0 "Ma Biao Positioned in Yushu"
mac.106.d:0 "Ma Biao, who is renowned for his role in beating our forces in the Sichuan-Tibetan War in 1930, has been repositioned in Qinghai by the Xining Government. We can only guess they want to establish fear in our forces by assigning the very man who beat them previously in front of them, but this will only bolden our resolve! We will however need to find ways to bypass the staunch defence of Biao if we want to continue the raiding on the town."
mac.106.a:0 "We won't be defeated!"

mac.107.t:0 "Ma Biao Flees Yushu"
mac.107.d:0 "Due to our raiding and lack of reinforcements from Qinghai, Ma Biao was put between a rock and a hard place with low equipment and men. With no other choice, Ma Biao has retreated from Yushu, putting the government and remaining forces in the region in a full on panic, increasing our control and the effectiveness of our raids."
mac.107.a:0 "We got him good"

mac.108.t:0 "Policing in Yushu"
mac.108.d:0 "It seems the Yushu government has officialy put forth a small police force in Yushu to remove any possible rebels or traitors from the town that we may have set in the region. While the force is miniscule, it will icnrease the costs of our raids with more preparation needed before each raid, attack, and infiltration we commit."
mac.108.a:0 "This makes things difficult..."

mac.109.t:0 "Dongxiang Mongol Raid"
mac.109.d:0 "The Qinghai government has bribed a small group of Donxiang Mongols who have attacked one of our encampments in Outer Qinghai, disrupting our efforts and increasing their control over Yushu. While the hired raiders are gone for now, it might not be long before they hire them again in the hopes of finding one of our encampments."
mac.109.a:0 "Seems they're stealing our tactics"

mac.110.t:0 "Chinese Reinforce the Border"
mac.110.d:0 "It seems that the Ma authority to the north has put pressure on the legal Qinghai border with small amounts of guards. While this is more a show of force then any actual action, the presence of these guards will make it significantly more difficult to send raiders to attack Yushu."
mac.110.a:0 "Damn them!"

mac.112.t:0 "Ma Bufang Calls for Intifada Against Buddhists"
mac.112.d:0 "The Xining Council has been called to session with little notice by Ma Bufang. Appearing in military regalia, Ma Bufang takes the stand to deliver a dire warning to his family and the people of Qinghai. Ma Bufang describes the terror and oppression facing muslims in Tibet. Those living in Lhasa for centuries have been improvrished and neglected by the Ganden Phodrang that rules Tibet. Provincial Hui people like the Dongxiang are being threatened for reprisal by the vicious Golok bandits. Ma Bufang demands that the council levy more soldiers to patrol border cities like Yushu, and to plan for the eventual intifada against Buddhist tyranny."
mac.112.a:0 "Those are some good points"

mac.113.t:0 "Ma Lin Assures Council of Peace"
mac.113.d:0 "The attendants to the Meeting were treated to a suprise feast, all on Ma Lin's dime. Ma Lin reassured the Council that, as representative of the Ma families, he ensures that Hui receive the greatest enrichment of the land. At the same time, Ma Lin noted that this prosperity was in sharp contrast to the ill rule of warmongering governors in Sichuan, who only feast after they have siezed the homes of their neighbors. Ma Lin's ultimate message being that a restraint on militancy will result in greater yields when the Hui are victorious."
mac.113.a:0 "He made some good points"

mac.114.t:0 "Ma Bufang Siezes Xining Council"
mac.114.d:0 "Ma Lin was not entirely suprised when the Xining Council did not appear for their meeting yesterday. No doubt they are trying to avoid both him and Ma Bufang in order to stay neutral in their dispute. In spite of this confidence, Ma Lin did engender to check on Ma Bufang's estate that day. Approaching the door, Ma Lin spotted his nephew in talks with a member of the Xining Council. Approaching the window, several more members came into view. Being the man of reason, Ma Lin resolved that the only way to ensure the Xining Council can resume is if he takes up residence in the meeting hall. "
mac.114.a:0 "Rotten nephew you are"

mac.115.t:0 "Ma Bufang Humiliates Ma Lin Out of Office"
mac.115.d:0 "After some days waiting for the next meeting, Ma Lin was greeted by Ma Bufang and several of his now-loyal Xining Councilmen, along with two guards. Before Ma Lin could respond, the two guards siezed him and carried him out of the hall. Ma Lin was shoved into the servants quarters, where he could hear the Xining Council meeting start from a distance."
mac.115.a:0 "A pox upon our houses"

mac.116.t:0 "Ma Lin's Plot Against Ma Bufang"
mac.116.d:0 "The time has come for Ma Lin to confront Ma Bufang's egregious abuse of office. This comes after weeks and months of back and forth in the meeting hall over which of Ma Fuxiang's Eight Points are more needed now. Ma Lin's plan is to invite Ma Wanfu, a radical Hanafi Imam, to the meeting hall. Ma Wanfu owes Ma Lin a favor through Ma Qi, Ma Bufang's father. Ma Wanfu is held at high regard by Ma Bufang, and it would embarass Ma Bufang greatly if his hero were to denounce him for failing to live up to his fathers' expectations.  "
mac.116.a:0 "I wish I could film his reaction"

mac.117.t:0 "Ma Bufang Exposed In Front of Family"
mac.117.d:0 "Ma Bufang arrived at the Xining Council as he did most days, striding in full military regalia. This step stopped when he caught sight of Ma Wanfu, whom he remembers from the years of knuckle rapping Ma Wanfu gave him as a child. Ma Bufang, overcome with emotions, marched up to Ma Wanfu and instructed him to sit down. The old Imam refused, and began to reminisce about Ma Bufang's father, and how Ma Bufang was faltering in his image. Ma Bufang violently disagreed, and stated his absolute surrender to Allah. Ma Wanfu retorted, saying that, across Qinghai, Christian missionaries roam free to debate innocent Hui muslims on just about anything. Ma Wanfu was jonined by Ma Lin, and soon the rest of the Xining Council. Ma Bufang could not deny this accuation, and instead pivoted away and marched out of the meeting hall."

As he observed his men around the fire, swords in hand, he watched over Ma Biao's regiment which was completely surrounded by Tibetan soldiers. A cold silence in the air, he took in what remaining peace he had before the bloodshed to come. The peace a fire can bring before an inevitable storm was beautiful in a situation like this. But he knew what he had to do.\n\n"It's time".\n\nCai sent his men charging down to the city, interrupting the cold silence between the two sides as he and his fellow tribesmen charged the Tibetan forces, giving Ma Biao and his small regiment the chance they needed to charge out. Within the hour, the Tibetan forces surrendered to the combined strength of the two forces. What came next was a complete shock to Cai, however.\n\nMa Biao himself started going up to every soldier who surrendered, nearly 800 altogether, and began shooting them one by one. When he ran out of ammo, he switched to his Dao and continued, creeping up to each young soldier and mercilessly killing them. "Am I the only one who will join into this sport?", was said by Ma Biao once he finished the 100th soldier, with the rest of the regiment having joined into the massacre as well, until all the surrendered were dead. Cai contemplated on if he made the wrong choice here, but the die had already been cast on his part. There was no turning back unless he wanted him and his entire tribe to end up like those fallen.

XSM_xining_government:0 "The Xining Government"
XSM_xining_government_desc:0 "The power struggle in Qinghai between the legalistic Ma Lin and his nephew, the militaristic and uncompromising Ma Bufang, has boiled over. With its conclusion, order in Qinghai must be re-established."

XSM_going_forward:0 "Going Forward"
XSM_going_forward_desc:0 "For too long or nation has sought to be but one cog in the great Chinese machine. While we are undoubtedly Chinese, we must not forget the native inhabitants of our land, the Hui, and the ethos of service which won it."

XSM_reforming_education:0 "Reforming Education"
XSM_reforming_education_desc:0 "The Yihewani order emphasizes modern education that is separated from the old Menhuan system. Eastern teachers can be hired to teach in our cities."

XSM_kunlun_middle_school_tibetans:0 "Military Schooling for Tibetans"
XSM_kunlun_middle_school_tibetans_desc:0 "The Tibetan fifth column cannot remain. We should send junior officers to their villages to take command of local schools, ensuring all are endowed with a proper military discipline."

XSM_seven_expeditions_golog:0 "The Seven Expeditions to Golok"
XSM_seven_expeditions_golog_desc:0 "The persistent Golok people are one of the main reasons for the tensions with Tibet. A final punitive expedition through Qinghai will oust these Buddhists from the region once and for all."

XSM_military_administration:0 "The Military-Civilian Administration"
XSM_military_administration_desc:0 "Ma Fuxiang held the Ma Clique together through the syncopation of the Xining military and Civil government. It is obvious that, in this uncertain time, this union must be preserved for practical governance."

XSM_industrialization_project:0 "The Industrialization Project"
XSM_industrialization_project_desc:0 "To sustain our growing armed forces, we will need guns and the ability to produce them en masse. While the arsenals will retain responsibility for finish armaments, new state facilities for the production of intermediaries should be established with state-of-the-art equipment shipped in from abroad no matter the cost."

XSM_staying_put:0 "Staying Put"
XSM_staying_put_desc:0 "The deeply principled elder Ma Lin has held onto power. A bright new day dawns on the Northwest and its people, one of true equality between the Han, the Hui, and others."

XSM_islamic_identity:0 "The Hui Islamic Identity"
XSM_islamic_identity_desc:0 "While we must take care not to antagonize the Han or the other loyal peoples, it is to the west, to Mecca and the house of Islam that the Hui people look to distinguish themselves. We should use this connection to the advantage of all and forge renewed connections with like-minded Islamic nations."

XSM_qi_successor:0 "Qi's Natural Successor"
XSM_qi_successor_desc:0 "Ma Qi's administration taught Ma Lin everything there is to know about governing Qinghai. Now with him in office, the civil government can return to prominence and stabilize the province through delegation."

XSM_peoples_governor:0 "The People's Governor"
XSM_peoples_governor_desc:0 "Ma Lin's compassion for the people of Qinghai manifests as something resembling a secular governorship, treating the various peoples of Qinghai with respect as citizens rather than subjects."

XSM_farming_assistance:0 "Assistance in Farming"
XSM_farming_assistance_desc:0 "The three provinces are home to rich, fertile soil, but very little running water. This has put a hard cap on what the people can produce in peacetime, and what we can tax from them. Building aqueducts to farming communities will assist in expanding the farmlands and employ refugees from the east."

XSM_roads:0 "Connecting Qinghai"
XSM_roads_desc:0 "The Qinghai-Lanzhou railway has been a dream of a number of ambitious engineers in our provinces, but as of yet no money has been dedicated to it. This administration is ready to make that dream a reality, and bring a modern necessity to communities in need."

XSM_gansu_reconstruction_plan:0 "The Reconstruction of Gansu"
XSM_gansu_reconstruction_plan_desc:0 "The devastation wrought by the Guominjin and the reconquest has left Gansu in tatters. As the region's economy and political institutions have recovered at a mere snail's pace, state intervention is needed to get the province back on its feet."

XSM_rooting_agents_desc:0 "Our rivals remain vigilant and will take any chance to advance their own political position. They and their agents must be found through a concerted effort of the bureaucracy and eliminated."

XSM_consolidating_administration:0 "Consolidating the Administration"
XSM_consolidating_administration_desc:0 "The administration of the western provinces is plagued with inefficiencies and conmen.

We can collect this latent trust by consolidating our administration and ordering the arrest of phony administrators."

XSM_soldier_farmers:0 "Soldier-Farmers"
XSM_soldier_farmers_desc:0 "The cycle of growing and reaping is emphasized in both Chinese literature and the Quran. Both our ideals converge in the soldier-farmer. Our administration has decided to honor exemplary farmers as we do soldiers."

XSM_opium_farming:0 "Opium Farming"
XSM_opium_farming_desc:0 "While many argue that opium brought China to its knees, it is undoubtedly valuable. Our regime has struggled to capture sufficient liquid assets through conquests or plunder; we cannot disregard such a robust potential revenue stream for morality alone's sake. Through partnerships with local farms, our regime shall henceforth involve itself with the cultivation of opium."

XSM_raking_in:0 "Raking it In"
XSM_raking_in_desc:0 "Our administration has collected the names of illegal opium farmers within our provinces. Instead of a lengthy hunt, desolation of farmland, and weeks wasted. We can instead send confidential soldiers to extort some money from these crooks."

XSM_tianshui_arsenal:0 " Expand the Tianshui Arsenal"
XSM_tianshui_arsenal_desc:0 "The Tianshui Arsenals' equipment is outdated and in need of modernization. By expanding the facilities and bringing in equipment from abroad, we'll be able to keep pace with our rivals in the region."

XSM_artillery_pieces:0 "Artillery Pieces"
XSM_artillery_pieces_desc:0 "With the arsenal expanded, we should begin the development of more advanced artillery. Like the Weltkrieg, our enemies' lines shall be reduced to rubble."

XSM_summoning_council:0 "Summoning the Provincial Council"
XSM_summoning_council_desc:0 "The Councils of Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai have operated autonomously for far too long.

In order to ensure the Governor's orders are followed, the provisional councils must be drawn to the capital."

XSM_warlord_alliance:0 "An Alliance of Warlords"
XSM_warlord_alliance_desc:0 "The warlords of China share a mutual distrust, and are unwilling to assist each other against foreign invaders.

XSM_making_friends:0 "Making New Friends"
XSM_making_friends_desc:0 "It is difficult for the Hui people to interact with the other provinces as equals. Stigma against Muslims pervades intellectual circles. It is time for our administration to publish warm advertisements for our provinces and entice those who are open minded to come."

XSM_removing_enemies:0 "Dealing with Old Enemies"
XSM_removing_enemies_desc:0 "The turmoil of the warlords has left our administration with many enemies.

XSM_hard_general:0 "The Hard General"

XSM_eliminating_socialists:0 "Eliminating Socialists"
XSM_eliminating_socialists_desc:0 "Socialism flows into China from the southern ports, thanks to the decadent Europeans.

XSM_dual_province_rule:0 "Dual Provincial Rule"

XSM_baojia:0 "The Baojia System"
XSM_baojia_desc:0 "The logical extension of familial governance is the Baojia system. This tradition has been revived by the administration in order to delegate law keeping. Ten Hui families will dedicate themselves to a goal within their community, and each family attempts to persuade ten families to subordinate to them. This will also help enfranchise immigrants."

XSM_consolidating_finance:0 "Consolidating Finance"
XSM_consolidating_finance_desc:0 "The Governors' budgets are turning up short each year. The solution presented to the administration is to consolidate the treasuries and accounting offices of the provinces and allocate remaining budgets in the best interest of the Hui people. "

XSM_ningxia_mobilization:0 "Mobilize the People"
XSM_ningxia_mobilization_desc:0 "With open warfare upon us, previous considerations for the impact of general mobilization upon the economy no longer hold sway. We must implement as thorough a policy as can be sustained."

XSM_saving_suffering:0 "Saving the Suffering"
XSM_saving_suffering_desc:0 "While much of China is densely populated, the northwest is anything but.

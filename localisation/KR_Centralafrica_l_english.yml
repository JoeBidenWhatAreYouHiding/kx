POLITICS_BOKASSA_EMPEROR_DESC:0 "Even in the wake of one nation’s imperial ambitions turning to ash and cinder, history stops for no one, and a new empire has already begun to blossom here in Africa. Born in 1921, the young Askari Jean-Bédel Bokassa took the destiny of Ubangi-Shari in his hands, leading a fanatical group of veterans and recruits against the dying German colonial machine. With his victory earned and the people of Bangui at his back, the young Bokassa has taken the reins of this former colony and has begun to forge it into a mighty empire - the first of its kind in post-Collapse Africa. Though he has already begun to receive criticisms for his peculiar appetites and violent tendencies, the people still adore their savior and hero in Bokassa. Taking the full title of ‘His Imperial Majesty Bokassa the First, Apostle of Peace and Servant of Jesus Christ, Emperor and Marshal of Central Africa by the will of the Central African people, united within the national political party, the MESAN’, this young soldier-turned-rebel-turned-emperor shall lead the lands of Ubangi-Shari and beyond into a new dawn as the rightful Emperor of Central Africa."
POLITICS_BOKASSA_LEADER_DESC:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, though young and inexperienced in any form of statecraft or leadership, has defied the odds and helped lead his people to independence. Though only born in 1921 and taking up the honored role of an Askari auxiliary just a few short years ago, Bokassa has proven his tenacity and cunning, if also sadism, in his brutal war against the German colonizers. With their colonial monstrosity of Mittelafrika burning, Bokassa has begun to be seen as a new unifying figure and national father to the dispersed and disparate peoples of Ubangi-Shari, and as he endeavors to bring stability to this war-torn land, he shall create a newly independent state of which the people of Africa have never seen."
POLITICS_BOKASSA_NAPOLEON_DESC:0 "Even in the wake of one nation’s imperial ambitions turning to ash and cinder, history stops for no one, and a new empire has already begun to blossom here in Africa. Born in 1921, the young Askari Jean-Bédel Bokassa took the destiny of Ubangi-Shari in his hands, leading a fanatical group of veterans and recruits against the dying German colonial machine. With his victory earned and the people of Bangui at his back, the young Bokassa has took the reins of this former colony and began to forge it into a mighty empire - the first of its kind in post-Collapse Africa. While his ‘Empire’ was nothing but a laughable statelet at first - Bokassa the great managed to save the French Exile cause in their darkest hours, eventually leading them to final victory over their crimson foes. By the will of the people, Bokassa was proclaimed Emperor of the French, and took the regal name Napoleon II upon his coronation in the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris.\n\n While France having a black Askari commander as Emperor was not something that anyone would ever have expected, truth sometimes proves to be stranger than fiction. And even if some have their suspicions about Bokassa, most citizens of the French nation have learned to trust trust their country in the hands of their liberator: the ‘Empereur Noir’ "
POLITICS_BOKASSA_FREDRICK_DESC:0 "Even in the wake of one nation’s imperial ambitions turning to ash and cinder, history stops for no one, and a new empire has already begun to blossom here in Africa.

While his ‘Empire’ was nothing but a laughable statelet at first - Bokassa the great managed to reforge Mittelafrika under his guide, and when the cause of the Reich seemed to have reached their darkest hours, eventually leading Germany to final victory over their crimson conquerors. By the will of the people upon the death of the Kaiser, Bokassa was proclaimed the German, and took the regal name Frederick IV upon his coronation in thel in Berlin.\n\n While Germany having a black Askari commander as Kaiser was not something that anyone would ever have expected, truth sometimes proves to be stranger than fiction. And even if some have their suspicions about Bokassa, most citizens of the German nation have learned to trust trust their country in the hands of their liberator: the ‘Schwarzer Kaiser’ "
POLITICS_BOKASSA_CHARLEMAGNE_DESC:0 "Even in the wake of one nation’s imperial ambitions turning to ash and cinder, history stops for no one, and a new empire has already begun to blossom here in Africa.

By the will of the people upon the death of the Kaiser, Bokassa was proclaimed the German, and took the regal name Frederick IV upon his coronation in thel in Berlin, and furthermore took the regal name of Charlemagne II upon the reformation of the Frankish Empire.\n\n While German and France sharing a black Askari commander as Emperor was not something that anyone would ever have expected, truth sometimes proves to be stranger than fiction. And even if some have their suspicions about Bokassa, most citizens of the Neo-Frankish nation have learned to trust trust their country in the hands of their liberator: the ‘Schwarzer Kaiser’ "

POLITICS_BOGANDA_DESC:0 "Born around 1910, Father Barthélemy Boganda, uncle to the Mad Emperor himself, has long sought to raise his people out of the mud. The son of a village head, Boganda's parents would pass away when he was young, and his guardian would leave to join the French army, dying in the Battle of Verdun like so many others. For the remainder of the war, Boganda would live with his extended family. After the war ended and French influence in Central Africa began to retreat, Boganda and one his brothers would meet one of the few French patrols left within their region. The patrol asked where they were from, and upon taking what Boganda to be his name, they were taken to Bétou. In  Bétou and later Bangui, Boganda would study under the Spiritan missionaries, where he would be baptized. Feeling called to the priesthood shortly after his Baptism, Boganda would study in the Belgian Congo, eventually being ordained a priest and assigned to aid in the conversion of Bangui.\n\nAs a priest, Boganda felt that the only way to raise his people was to get them to abandon the past and walk towards a brighter future. It was also during this time that he gained a burning hatred for the German colonizers, due to among other things their dropping of state-supported Catholic missionary activities.\n\nWhen Mittleafrika collapsed, and his young nephew seized control of Ubangi-Shari, Boganda was appointed as head of government, due to the experience he had running his local parish. As the Mad Emperor grew ever more into his delusions, his uncle remained at his post, trying to do right by his country and family. As Bokassa grew even madder, it became clear to Boganda that he must act, and act he did. Overthrowing his nephew, Father Boganda now finds himself as the President of Central Africa, and his plans for the nation and the region at large can finally begin."

POLITICS_ANTONIE_DARLAN_DESC:0 "Working with his younger brother and the rest of the anti-Bokassa movement, Antoine Theophile Darlan now stands at the forefront of Central Africa’s Syndicalist revolution. Born in 1915 in Ouaka to a native mother and a Portuguese colonialist father who abandoned the family shortly after the youngest son Jürgen was born, Darlan was raised first under the shadow of the pre-Syndicate Parisian regime, and later under the boot of the Germans following the Weltkrieg. This childhood, paired with his work in the colonial service, which he was easily allowed to join compared to his native contemporaries due to being half-White, and his self-taught education based on the writings of famous Western Socialists and Third Internationale thinkers, put the young Darlan on the path to Africanized Syndicalism. An ally of the French CGT and with contacts in Paris, Antoine Darlan shall now bring his own breed of Trade Unionism to the banks of the Ubangi River and beyond."

POLITICS_GEORGES_DARLAN_DESC:0 "With the aid of his older brother and the surviving members of the anti-Bokassa movement, Jürgen, formerly Georges, Darlan now stands at the forefront of Central Africa’s drive towards Democratic Socialism. Born in 1920 in Ouaka to a native mother and a Portuguese colonialist father who abandoned the family shortly after he himself was born, Darlan was raised entirely under the boot of the German colonial regime due to being born shortly after the Weltkrieg ended, thus bending his influence and eventual life trajectory in a more Germanic direction than his older Francophillic brother. This childhood, paired with his work in the colonial service, which he was easily allowed to join compared to his native contemporaries due to being half-White, and his self-taught education based on the writings of famous German thinkers within the SPD and the FAUD, put the young Darlan on the path to moderated and democratic Africanized Leftism. An ally of Social Democrats throughout Europe and Africa, and with contacts in the Rheinland, Berlin, and to a lesser degree in Paris thanks to his brother, Jürgen Darlan shall now bring his own breed of Democratic Socialism to the banks of the Ubangi River and beyond."

### Ideas ###
CEA_split_larp:0 "Who to Idolize?"
CEA_split_larp_desc:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, our national father and savior, has been torn between two competing influences. Long fascinated with monarchism and with strong imperial figures, the young Bokassa has fervently modeled his practices on both Napoleon Bonaparte, first French emperor, and Frederick the Great, the most honored Prussian king. Divided between these two identities, the young ‘Emperor’ must soon pick a path to follow and a titan to emulate, lest his regime drift aimlessly without direction."

CEA_inferiority_complex:0 "Desire for Greatness"
CEA_inferiority_complex_desc:0 "Despite his young age and inexperience when it comes to ruling a nation, Bokassa has nevertheless come to control all of Central Africa. From his base of power in Ubangi, this young Emperor now requires an empire to rule over. This greatness shall not be denied to him, and he is willing to cut through anyone and anything to earn his prize."

CEA_emperor_without_empire:0 "An Emperor with No Empire"
CEA_emperor_without_empire_desc:0 "With our borders secured and the foundations of the Bokassa regime now cemented, the young Emperor has begun to look outward for new worlds to conquer. Eyeing up the Kamerunians to the West, who have long been embroiled in a never-ending stalemate, Bokassa believes he has found a perfect target to serve as the site for our first imperial expansion."

CEA_fresh_meat:0 "Fresh Meat"
CEA_fresh_meat_desc:0 "While many in the remains of Mittelafrika face the looming possibility of starvation and famine, the people of [CEA.GetNameDef] have to deal with no such fears. Our proud leader, Jean-Bedel Bokassa has secured a large supply of fresh and hearty; albeit strange tasting meat to feed our populace. The source of this protein is still a mystery, but with a fed populace and a nourished army, the question of this meat’s origin is of little importance.\n After all, what you don’t know can’t hurt you... right?"

CEA_coronation_budget:0 "Post Coronation Bankruptcy"
CEA_coronation_budget_desc:0 "The coronation of Bokassa the Great has left our nation in financial ruin, decimating our ability to properly pay the expenditures of governance. Many wonder why our Emperor gets to spend so much on a simple ceremony while the majority of our nation barely makes enough to eat."

CEA_new_empire:0 "A Rising Empire"
CEA_new_empire_desc:0 "Our claims to greatness has been legitimized by our victory in the Kamerun war. Soon Bokassa will lead us to new triumphs in the future; the history of the Central African Empire is only beginning. Soon all of Africa will bow before us. ""

CEA_phasing_out_cannibalism:0 "Phasing out Cannibalism"
CEA_phasing_out_cannibalism_desc:0 "Cannibalism is an abhorrent and disgusting practice that was only ever used to keep the populace of Ubangi-Shari from starving to death in what may well have been Afrika's darkest moment. We are ready to move on now, and hide any evidence Cannibalism took place under Bokassa's watch."

CEA_post_bokassa_chaos:0 "Legacy of Bokassa"
CEA_post_bokassa_chaos_desc:0 "While the mad ‘Emperor’ might have been dealt with, his legacy still hovers over our nation like a dark cloud. Any legacy of this madman must be rooted out if our nation is to be free."

CEA_devestation:0 "Post Liberation Devastation"
CEA_devestation_desc:0 "We have achieved victory over our enemies - but at what cost? Our homeland lies in ruins, thoroughly devastated by the horrors of war and conflict. We must be quick to rebuilt, lest this devastation become permanent."

CEA_opposition:0 "Opposition to the [GetBokassaTitle]"
CEA_opposition_desc:0 "The concept of a Black [ROOT.GetAdjective] is absurd to many within [CEA.GetLarpInspiration], however sometimes truth is stranger than fiction; and while Bokassa has gained significant goodwill from the liberation of our homeland, this good will can only last so long. Bokassa will need to work tirelessly to prove himself to his new subjects. "

CEA_neocolonial_army:0 "Neo-Colonial Army"
CEA_neocolonial_army_desc:0 "While the old colonial groups were nothing but dusty old fools, we can not deny their passion. The officers of the elder Mittelafrika who had worked tirelessly; yet ultimately for not to keep the great colonial project together deserve our respect, and will fittingly be given a place in our new Mittelafrika."

CEA_german_relations_idea:0 "German Business"
CEA_german_relations_idea_desc:0 "When we were a small and weak nation, the greats such as the German Empire would surely pay little attention to us; however now that we control almost 2/3rds of the African continent, German businessman and military strategists have been watching us with a closer eye. The lucrative relationship that was shared with Germany, a relationship lost in the chaos of the Mittelafrikan Collapse shall be restored to the highest degree; binding our nations together inseparably though finance and trade. "

CEA_germany_sus:0 "German Suspicions"
CEA_germany_sus_desc:0 "While Bokassa has gained significant status thanks to his hand in recreating Mittelafrika, German Authorities still hold out their suspicions with Statthalter Bokassa. Everything from his eccentric personality, the nature of his ‘Empire’ and the rumours of cannibalism has damaged his prestige in the eyes of his overlords; something which he will need to work to remedy."

CEA_integrating_france:0 "Integration of France"
CEA_integrating_france_desc:0 "France and Germany have been separate, and often hostile nations for more than 800 years. Much hard work will be needed to mend our nations together once more."

CEA_french_consessions:0 "Fruits from French Labour"
CEA_french_consessions_desc:0 "While we have graciously allowed the French state to continue its existence, we will not repeat the mistakes of our past. Every facet of the French nation shall be inseparably tied to us, ensuring that they will never have the capacity to possibly oppose Germany. "

CEA_german_control:0 "German Control of Our Economy"
CEA_german_control_desc:0 "While the German Empire has graciously allowed the French state to continue its existence, they will not repeat the mistakes of their past.

CEA_new_to_socialism:0 "New to Socialism"
CEA_new_to_socialism_desc:0 "The people of our nation have little concern with the bickering of unionists in Bangui and Paris. The majority of the nation views socialism with either hostility or utter indifference. To secure our revolution from reactionary forces, this must be remedied. "

CEA_low_control_modifier:0 "Outside Government Control"

CEA_new_socialist_government_idea:0 "New Socialist Government"
CEA_new_socialist_government_idea_desc:0 "With our centralization efforts going along as smoothly as possible, it is time to bend the trajectory of our modernization and centralization efforts towards a specifically Socialist direction. Though many of the traditionalist, conservative, and anti-Socialist groups we have worked with or maintained good relations with so far will likely resist this move, we know it to be the best way forward for Central Africa and her peoples, whether they know it yet or not. "

CEA_contact_the_commune_idea:0 "Communard Contacts"
CEA_contact_the_commune_idea_desc:0 "Though the Darlan brothers have different sources of Socialist inspiration, with Antoine pulling from Paris and London while Jürgen pulls from the German SPD, they both firmly agree that Central Africa’s future lies in the hands of the Third Internationale. Without the Socialist world powers guaranteeing our existence and sovereignty, the Germans would likely crush us under their boot as soon as they are given the chance. We shall reach out to France and ask for their protection, serving as their gateway to Central Africa and the lands of former Deutsch-Mittelafrika."

CEA_frog_resistance:0 "French Resistance"

CEA_diamonds_are_forever_idea:0 "Diamonds are Forever"
CEA_diamonds_are_forever_idea_desc:0 "Diamonds have long been the backbone of the Central African civilian economy, with Europeans discovering diamonds in our sands and soils shortly after settling here at the end of the 19th Century. Though times have changed, and though we are now an independent nation, the diamond industry is still a central pillar in how we keep our coffers full, no matter the form it now takes.

CEA_statist_resistance_desc:0 "Despite their failures being on full display, followers of the Darlan Brothers, Boganda, and even the False Emperor are still swayed by the false creed of their rulers. These fools must be dealt with swiftly. "

CEA_new_islamic_clergy_idea:0 "New Islamic Clergy"
CEA_new_islamic_clergy_idea_desc:0 "Though the Mad Emperor flirted with the idea of fully adhering to the Islamic faith, he did so only out of his own selfishness. Despite being open to Muslim ideas, he ruthlessly stole funds and treasures from the various mosques and houses of worship throughout the nation, pilfering our valuables for his own gain while driving the faithful Islamic clergy and church into the ground. We must undo this perversion of our faith, and work to raise Islam as the main unifying force of our nation once again!"

CEA_anti_westernism_idea:0 "Anti-Westernism"
CEA_anti_westernism_idea_desc:0 "If the vile actions of the Mad Emperor and his European allies, along with the violence and suffering wrought by the former colonial regimes, haven’t proven that Central Africa must free itself from Western influence, then nothing will. We must completely remove ideas of Westernism from our society and culture, for their ways have failed us and our people time and time again; only the traditional ways of our own peoples can save us now."

CEA_afro_muslim_rennicance_idea:0 "Afro-Muslim Renaissance"
CEA_afro_muslim_rennicance_idea_desc:0 "While the perfidious Europeans were struggling to deal with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Arab world was experiencing a Golden Age like none other, advancing fields such as science, mathematics, architecture, naturalism, theology, and more while the rest of the known-world stagnated and withered. If we are to survive in this new age of discovery, we must reignite the golden age that raised our ancestors to greatness. A new Arabic Renaissance must be ignited and fostered, ensuring a new age of progress and change for our eager masses and infantile new society."

In the early hours of the morning the Askari commander for Bangui simply disappeared. In the chaos of Mittelafrika's untimely collapse, one young man by the name of Jean-Bédel Bokassa stepped up to lead his comrades through the storm that engulfed them.\n\n Bokassa, though scarcely 18 rallied his fellow Askari, seizing control of the city of Bangui and broadcasting to every functioning radio and telegraph station in Ubangi-Shari that the region was now under his command. The former loyal son of the Kaiserreich has now seemingly abandoned his former masters, and has made a great deal of fuss about his grand plans for transforming his newly formed Statelet into a full fledged Nation, and perhaps soon, Empire. Bokassa has an inferiority complex seemingly towards both the French and the Germans, and attempts to emulate and even surpass these grand empires at every step; however unlikely that may be.\n\n While Bokassa consolidates control, one Priest and Independence activist by the name of Barthélemy Boganda steadies the nation’s new government, taking command of the civilian infrastructure in the newly birthed nation while his nephew Jean-Bédel Bokassa entertains his delusions of grandeur. Whether these two can reconcile their difference in the name of national advancement remains to be seen."

Under this young revoltee, the lands of Ubangi-Shari have been freed from the clutches of vile imperialists and colonizers, and now Bokassa seeks to advance his own ambitions. \n\nLong has this charismatic, inexperienced soldier dreamed of an empire of his own as he grew up in the shadow of the Kaiser, and now with the region’s capital in his hands and the will of the people behind him, Bokassa can do just that."

However, we must make sure that we do not fall into a dynastic crisis when you eventually pass on...’, the advisor trailed off, not wanting to anger His Majesty. ‘Thus, the idea of establishing a formal harem of local women for you, sire, has been brought up in many meetings’ he began again, shaking as the nerves of talking to his flippant Emperor rocked him to his core, ‘and as such I felt it prudent to deliver the suggestion to you. They would surely be honoured to meet you.’ \n\nBokassa had sat, quietly and unmoving, at this sudden interruption, but could not help but to be delighted by the end of the trembling servant’s advisal. Though he wanted to execute this fool upon his entry, his soothing and wise words have allowed cooler heads to prevail. ‘Make it so’, the Emperor decreed before going back to his lounging..

With our foundations secured, we must choose a side to support in this conflict -  a difficult choice to pick the lesser of two evils. \n\nSiding with the Socialists would greatly increase their chances of winning, relieving us of another colonialist holdout, yet strengthening the vile hold of Socialism in Africa. Alternatively, siding with Germany seems insane after just freeing ourselves from their yoke, but many within our regime closely hold dear the sentiment that it is ‘better to be dead than Red.’ The final choice is, of course, up to our young leader Bokassa, but a choice must be made soon while the fires of war are still fresh."

The only royals in attendance were Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein, and the representative of the exiled Monegasque house of Grimaldi; who were the only royals in the world to enthusiastically endorse Bokassa's claim of royalty.\n\n The Coronation itself was held in a hastily repaired stadium in downtown Bangui, which had been elaborately decorated for the occasion; however the stadium’s lack of Air Conditioning led to discomfort among the many guests wearing elaborate suits and dresses. Bokassa himself arrived dressed in a white toga, with white antelope skin gloves covering his hands, and a golden wreath upon his head. Upon ascending to the elevated platform, guardsmen handed him attributes of imperial power: a sword and a two-meter sceptre, which Bokassa took in his right hand. Then several pairs of guardsmen brought a long velvet mantle to the throne, and one of them put it on the Emperor. After this, Bokassa himself placed the crown on his head.

Colonial era prisons and barracks were captured during the first days of the collapse; with the many inhabitants being slaughtered and processed into consumable protein, which was later distributed to the populace.\n\n Now that our situation has greatly stabilized, our government is left with a choice; gradually phase out cannibalism, replacing our ‘Pork’ with a more sustainable protein, or continue the charade; keeping our population well fed, no matter the means.

After all, what is a truer sign of power and prowess than the hunting and cooking of your fellow man? And surely there are some talented chefs in the area who are willing to keep a secret... "

The prisons where unfortunate souls were processed into usable proteins were quickly abandoned by their keepers, with the guards and those complacent vanishing into the savannas and jungles in an attempt to escape justice. The remaining prisoners managed to finally escape their hell, making their way from these out of the way prisons; and triumphantly uniting with friends and family, who have often searched high and low for those who have disappeared. While certain men and women were lucky enough to escape before they met their horrifying fate - hundreds, if not thousands individuals weren’t so fortunate.\n\nSoldiers of the Emperor quickly moved against him and his cannibal circle following the revelation after finding many frozen and maimed human corpses in the kitchen of Bokassa’s palace. Bokassa himself was executed by his own men shortly after the news became public, with Barthélemy Boganda being proclaimed as Central Africa’s new President as the former Central African ‘Empire’ crumbles into dust.

Bokassa is a young and very delusional man, who has wasted innate amounts of money on a useless ceremony, and transformed our nation into a monarchy just to satisfy Bokassa’s inferiority complex.

The Emperor's supporters emphasize how advantageous Frederick's reign has been. Meanwhile, the news has been met with confusion on the Dark Continent.

These soldiers told many stories of horror, of bad conditions and cruel commanders, with members of the Leopoldville Garrison mentioning, and indeed holding particularly venomous hatred for one ‘Petit Maniaque’ - one Émile Janssens.\n\n The fall of the city bearing his beloved Leopold’s name has thrown him into a fury, with the ‘Petit Maniaque’ being prone to random and blindly violent acts of rage, with random beatings and slur laiden tirades being common for soldiers in his ranks. These bouts of savage outrage have come to a climax as black soldiers besiege the city’s FP Barracks, defeating even the most well-trained white officers within the force.\n\n During the final stages of the battle, the few remaining defenders were faced with a critical lack of ammunition; which has led to Janssens abandoning his rifle and resorting to running around the barracks armed with nothing but a large club, blindly bludgeoning any black soldier that comes across his path - even if they are under his own command.\n\n The final seconds of the battle saw Central African soldiers triumphantly break through the main entrance to the main building, however by the time they reached Janssens, they were caught off guard when they found out that the ‘Petit Maniaque’ already laid dead - with his death not being a result of a bullet wound.

The car stopped abruptly; a fallen tree had obstructed the road. Two guards dismounted in an attempt to clear the obstacle; Ryckmans remained in the car. A look of terror was present on the former colonial governor’s face, just as two more guards dismounted to try and dislodge the tree. The driver turned to Ryckmans, told him that the stop was an opportunity ‘stretch his legs’, before exiting the car himself.\n\n The tree refused to move, the driver debated turning around; however the Emperor’s troops had a great presence in Likasi; it would be safer to continue forward towards Élisabethville. There was an airport not under control of Bokassa’s men, they could board a Saab 90 Scandia, and fly back towards the homeland; everything would be over, Ryckmans could surely publish a book about the experience. As the group stalled in their attempts to get back on the road, Ryckmans nervously scanned the clearings, eyeing up any would-be attackers. Every movement in the jungle caused Ryckmans to grasp his pistol tighter. Figures dashed around in the jungle, leaves and branches rustled, the guards took no notice of the situation\n\n Seconds later, the deafening ring of bullets echoed throughout the vast jungle. "

The place was eerily quiet and peaceful, and only brought to life by sudden and lone gunshot, one which echoed through the abandoned mansion halls.\n\n The source of the gunshot was located in a room which had its door blocked off by several heavy pieces of furniture. The soldier’s attempts to open the door proved to be a futile endeavor; with the men instead decadent to climb up on to the room’s exposed balcony. Upon surfacing the building’s stone exterior, sing a rope made from tattered German flags; they were met with a jarring sight on the opposite side of the shattered pane-glass window. "

Bokassa selected a dozen children from the crowd as the few hundred residents of the small village crowded around Bokassa, clearly awestruck by their glorious leader. He had pictures taken with them, but they had to be discarded because Bokassa was the only one smiling. Next, Bokassa had a bundle of sacks brought up and pulled a slew of smart white and blue military dress uniforms from them. A large patch of the President's smiling face was proudly displayed on the right and left shoulders of the uniform. When one of the kids reached for it, Bokassa smacked his hand away instinctively. He then revealed that the uniforms were not to be given away because they were expensive to produce; neglecting to mention that these uniforms were produced by a factory owned by one of his wives. Instead, his offer was sell them to the kids for 535 francs, an offer the children were not at liberty to refuse. However no one, not even the mayor, possessed enough funds to make the purchase, as these poor families lived a subsistence lifestyle like many within the rural areas of the country. The fact that these impoverished children were being forced to spend money they did not have on such uniforms sent the younglings into a childish fury, and the crowd responded by pelting the Emperor and his car with rocks. After being hit in the eye with a pebble, Bokassa screamed at the kids that he would never forgive them for this slight. Before anybody could stop him he raised his cane from the ground and brandished it at the children, before ordering his guards to club the children to death. Bokassa himself joined in on the massacre, smashing the skulls of many with his his ebony walking stick, taking great concern with keeping his uniforms out of the way of the steadily growing pool of blood. The President's convoy left the ruins of Bomimi hours later, leaving over 200 bodies behind."

They also heard him say a Muslim midday prayer, though his Muslim companions later claimed that his Arabic was so bad that he could have been speaking gibberish. When the President noticed his courtiers, he stood and introduced himself as Salah Eddine Ahmed Bokassa. He explained that Allah had approached him during the night and revealed to him that only by converting to Islam could Africa be free. Before anyone could ask a question, the President declared that his first act as the new Caliph of Africa would be to ban all pork because pigs and swine were unclean animals. However, things changed yet again that night; when President Bokassa sat down for dinner, he was surprised to see a salad on his plate. When he inquired as to what was going on, his personal chef explained that because pork was prohibited, he had to improvise that night's meal. Bokassa, evidently, had probably forgotten or changed his mind about his conversion, as he responded with his typical rage. He stabbed the cook with a fork in the hand and demanded a whole honeyed ham for dinner or he would eat the cook instead. When approached about his conversion later Bokassa proclaimed his conversion back to Roman Catholicism. Few can guess as to why Bokassa suddenly converted, then deconverted. Some guess that his conversion was a justification to destroy the nation’s ‘Pork’ Supply, others have guessed that it was an attempt to curry favour with the Cairo Axis, and rapidly converting back to Christianity after being slighted by Cairo. After a few puzzled looks, the President's staff decided that this was one of the less strange things the President had done this week and decided to move on."

It was a two-paragraph letter in which the President expressed his gratitude to farmers for their contributions to the nation. The official speechwriters had their assistants write it instead because it was so benign. However, it appears that the staff had forgotten for whom they were working. Bokassa threw the page away after reading the speech for the first time just minutes before the radio went live. As speechwriters struggled to gain access to the locked booth, Bokassa launched into a venomous condemnation of Colonialism. Not only did he condemn Germany, National France, and the (defunct) United Kingdom for spearheading the carving up of Africa, but he also condemned the very existence of those countries, calling them savages driven only by lust and greed. Then, in a move that can only be described as erratic, Bokassa switched to discussing what to do about the colonial powers. According to Bokassa, all of Africa must band together to rise up against their foreign masters. He then proposed that they do it under a single ruler like a monarch, rather than a weak and effeminate democracy. Before the speechwriters were able to turn off the broadcast, Bokassa took it upon himself to accept this entirely theoretical crown."

Bokassa, on the other hand, delivered a truly masterful response. He responded that he had reluctantly accepted the crown in order to make Central Africa "stand out" on the global stage and attract more foreign aid, and provide stability for our nation in a world of failing republics.

Bokassa has taken himself away with the idea of being the first nation to develop 'The Bomb,' despite the fact that it is purely a figurative exercise and is still under heavy study in even the most advanced of nations. He sees this not only as a way to establish his fledgling nation as a scientific powerhouse, but also as a way to secure his regime. Nobody would dare to oppose him from within or without his borders if he could threaten nuclear annihilation. If even a third of the predictions about how powerful the bomb could be are correct, it would be a weapon worth having. In Algiers, his agents were quickly apprehended and deported for asking the first person they saw where they could find weapons-grade uranium. The French did not believe their claims that they were on official national business. Bokassa responded by threatening to destroy  Algiers first, should he possess a working nuclear weapon. His agents were more successful in the Congo, however. They quickly made contact with a mercenary group that controlled a uranium mine. A deal was struck, and now uranium is being smuggled into Central Africa on a regular basis. All we can hope for is that Bokassa does not immediately inform everyone."

German administrators and a German garrison have begun to arrive in the country in exchange for certain guarantees and mineral rights. The Germans began by reforming Bokassa's administration. Taking a practical look at the bloated bureaucracy, German administrators were able to trim off enough fat to clog the arteries of a whale. They discovered hundreds of departments and micro administrations that served no purpose. They were able to combine and reduce these departments to a better level by taking a critical look at them, saving the government millions on worthless wages. Many of the newly hired administrators are German, which Bokassa has been assured is merely a happy coincidence. Meanwhile, German advisors have pruned the Army of nepotistic generals and officers, who have been replaced by disciplined German officers. Simultaneously, a new training regimen has been implemented in order to transform the Army into a truly effective fighting force."

The second step is to instill a sense of national brotherhood among the people. Africa is home to hundreds of cultures, many of which are indigenous to our borders. These cultures have a distinct history and rivalry. However, through serious outreach programs, we can work to resolve these ancient feuds and create a new identity alongside their distinct tribal identities, a true African identity. God will be the final pillar of the new Africa. While many Africans associate Christianity with European oppression of millions of Africans, Boganda knows otherwise.

This celibacy was exposed as patently false when a woman arrived in Bangui with a child she claimed she had with Boganda while he was a missionary in her village. While Boganda has denied this as slander from his opponents, few believe him, and the Bishop of Bangui, Joseph Cucherousset, a rising star among the growing Catholic community, has publicly condemned Boganda for violating his vows. In response, the Pope himself wrote to Boganda, informing him that he needed to perform public penance if he wanted to keep his priesthood. Boganda has yet to do so, so Archbishop Marcel Marie Granduin of Bangui stripped Boganda of his priesthood on the Pope's orders.

Of course, the villages will still be allowed to grow their own food, but they will also be required to grow something else. On Boganda's orders, a portion of each village's farmland will be dedicated to coffee production. On the global market, coffee is orders of magnitude more valuable than a sack of potatoes. Even in the domestic market, a bag of premium coffee beans commands a premium. Boganda is confident that with this new law, not only will the villages receive more money for selling such a valuable crop, but the government will profit from exporting it as well.

His preistliness is the first pillar of his reputation. Boganda has a closer relationship with God, according to newly converted tribes and even more settled Catholics in the cities. Some tribes in the hinterlands believe Boganda has personal conversations with God on a regular basis. These claims provide him a great deal of political clout in the growing Catholic community. He is also the sorcerer's son. His father cast spells on his farm fields before being murdered by French forces. His son has links to both African and European Spiritualism. The third point is his equality with the white man. His mother was a white woman making Boganda a mixed race. While to the remnant European elite's navy blue blue-bloods, Boganda is only half a man, to the majority of white men, he is just about as good as anyone else. Boganda has learned to take advantage of this. While in the cities, he speaks like a European and refers to his white heritage. However, while in the country, he speaks in their language and discusses his father's sorcery. This has stoked a belief among some people in the countryside that Boganda is the reincarnation of Karnou, a local religious prophet whose name means "He who can change the world". To black Christians, he is akin to the Black Christ. To Boganda, however, he has been placed on this earth for a special God-given mission that has only been fueled by his people's near worship, the mission to liberate all of Africa from oppression."

These hungry and desperate men and women are prime targets for Syndicalist subversion. Already, socialists such as Antoine Darlan have begun to lay the groundwork for a Syndicalist party by utilizing these newly poor workers as a foundation. Boganda cannot allow this to continue or the country will be thrown into chaos. As a result, he has embarked on a daring new project of 'De-Proletarianization' of the country. He has attempted to draw poor migrant workers away from the syndicalist hotbeds of the cities by pouring money into these poor villages and spreading out economic development. However, while some have returned to their rural homes, others have remained in the city. These holdouts, on the other hand, present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. A healthy middle class supports a healthy democracy. We can lift these people out of poverty and free them from the clutches of Socialism and Syndicalism by directing social programs toward them. These valiant men will be the first of a rapidly expanding middle class. However, as with everything, this has brought with it yet another issue. Our former colonial masters have no love for blacks, and nothing makes them more afraid than a wealthy black man. As a result, we will need to reach out to these men in various ways to reassure them that this is not the start of some overthrow of the status quo, but rather an attempt to make it more equitable for all."

Antoine Darlan, a well-known Socialist and rabble-rouser, appears to have taken issue with the old friends.

He accuses Guerillot of being a puppet of the French oligarchy who acts in his own self-interest rather than that of the country. He also accused him of being corrupt, embezzling, and nepotistic. He then accused Boganda of being a Guerillot puppet who ran the country like a petty dictator.

One such lost kingdom was the Sultanate of Dar al-Kuti, occupying a stretch of the Islamic frontier to the south-west of Wadai. The Sultante’s Rich History started as a province of the larger Baguirmi sultanate, Belad al-Kuti, or Dar al-Kuti, eventually becoming a formal, tribute-paying province of its northern Muslim neighbour, Dar Runga, which was in turn part of Wadai's empire. Due to Dar al-Kuti’s small size the Sultan was sure to court the Muslim North, as well as securing trade relations with their non-Muslim neighbors. After decades of aggression from northern Slave-Traders, Dar al-Kuti became an almost autonomous state with its own sphere of influence extending over much of our north-east of our nation. In 1897 the Sultanate accepted French protectorate Status, with the French gradually whittling away the Sultanate, with their self-rule eventually coming to an end after the death of Muhammad al-Sanusi. When Germany took control of Ubangi-Shari at the end of the Weltkreig, the administrative division containing the Sultanate was completely dissolved in favour of a German Military Administration. The Heir to the Sultanate, Kamoun Mohamed Senoussi continued the fight against Germany just as his father did against the French, however it was ultimately for not. And even when Mittelafrika crumbled into dust, the Sultane still never gained its lost prestige. After Jean-Bédel Bokassa’s seizure of power, the brief attempt at restoration came to an end, with Kamoun Mohamed Senoussi offering his services to the young Askari Commander as an officer; even going so far as to recognize Bokassa as the region’s legitimate Monarch.\n\n While some would have expected Africa to heal and return to their rich traditions in the face of a Colonial Power Vacuum, it seems that politicians and rouge warlords will continue seeking to emulate new and foreign systems.

One such figure is one Toumba Modomdoko - also known as the ‘God of Lam’ by his followers. Toumba came from humble beginnings, being born in Lam, in Gidar country; he had no formal education and spent his days accompanying his father in the fields. At one point he disappeared, and upon his return proclaimed himself the ‘Mangilva na Bray’ - the Divine of Bray. He returned to his community transfigured, beginning to manifest social change by working to emancipate the Gidar and neighboring groups from Goudour's tutelary influence, and to limit the blacksmiths' social hold on the Gidar community. Additionally, he spoke out against violence against women, forbidding them to be bound and beaten; as well as preaching for a form of equality in the face of faults. He delivered messages through the medium or by transforming his voice, inviting to fight and to make disappear European colonization, and to reject what came from the "White", money, taxes and schools. He mobilized several occult and religious forces, using combat techniques consisting of ambushes behind curtains of millet and tall grass, conducted without strategy but not without tactics and know-how. And while his rebellions were never successful at dislodging the Colonial Order, they did prove to be a great annoyance to the German Garrison, who never were able to capture Toumba Modomdoko or fully extinguished the rebellion. The collapse of Mittelafrika was cause for great jubilation across the region, and upon the creation of the nation of Ubangi-Shari, the ‘dieu de Lam’ pledged his forces to secure the region for their new leader. Despite being a loyal soldier of Ubangi-Shari, he has little concern for the politicking of Bangui,  instead only seeking freedom for his own villages and his own peoples.\n\n The legend of his anti-colonial struggle will continue to live on through this titanic figure, as through painstaking work, and the incompetence of our oppressor, Central Africa has tasted freedom at long last."

One such socialist group that calls Ubangi-Shari home is the so-called ‘Rassemblement Démocratique Africain’, or ‘Kundgebung der Afrikanischen Demokraten’. The local chief of this group is influential politician and Trade Unionist Antoine Darlan, with his younger brother Georges ‘Jürgen’ Darlan also proving influential within the party.\n\n The Darlan brothers were born to a Ubangi mother and a European father, with their mixed blood allowing them to attend school, unlike the majority of the population. Both brothers eventually went on to serve the colonial military service, and upon the collapse of Mittelafrika, the Darlans went on to serve diligently in the newly founded nation’s civil service.\n\n With inspiration and funding from Communard groups, the brothers went on to found Ubangi-Shari’s chapter of the RDA/KDAD. Antoine, a committed Trade Unionist steered the party towards a Communard-Inspired Syndicalist direction, however his brother Jürgen seeks a more moderate and more German-Inspired approach to governance, frequently looking to Otto Wels and the SPD for political models to draw upon.\n\n Despite their political disagreements, both brothers have a mutual respect for eachother, and firm commitment against the ‘tyrannical’ rule of Bokassa and MESAN. However despite their rabble, the general unpopularity of Syndicalism in Africa means that they pose no real threat. "

The true extent of Bokassa’s crimes are only starting to be revealed by investigators, but from what we can gather, Bokassa is guilty of heinous crimes such as murder, treason, embezzling, kidnapping, and even cannibalism.\n\n While our nation reels from the damage the madman Bokassa has done, we look towards a brighter future, in vain hope that the horrific events that occurred under Bokassa will never be repeated again.

Out of the slew of potential leaders vying for supremacy in the void left by Bokassa's demise, two have emerged as clear frontrunners. Jürgen Darlan and Antoine Darlan are the two brothers who have captured the nation's attention. Jürgen is a fierce admirer of German Systems who sees the programs advanced by the SPD as a beacon of stability in a chaotic world. Jürgen, like his brother, is no autocrat, and instead is a firm believer in the power of the people and has pledged to not only reintroduce democracy, but also to implement a slew of moderate but desperately needed welfare reforms. Antoine, Jürgen’s brother and current head of state, is far more radical. He scorns any outside assistance for their state. He claims that Africans will build their new African nation with their hands alone. He has, however, sided entirely with the proletariat. Antroine, as the leader of the nation's burgeoning Syndicalist movement, wants to not only raise the living standards of the nation's poorest, but also fund it by seizing the wealth of the European proto-aristocracy that still wields significant power in the country.

A compound fit for an Emperor, it was built by political prisoners acting as slaves, working long shifts in grueling conditions; rumors say their bodies were simply rolled into the still-forming foundation. While it has been abandoned since Bokassa's fall, its silent vigil has left many in the city fearful of the memories. Many within the city remember being dragged into the palace’s deepest dungeons to face hours of torture because the Emperor proclaimed they were traitors on a whim. After Bokassa’s fall 128 bodies were excavated from a nearby mass grave. However, as the government has begun to line up demolition charges, and street vendors and tickets to the event, a new proposition for what to do with it has come forwards. Some have suggested that we convert the massive palace and its 97 rooms into a massive shelter for the city's many homeless, providing an lavish recompense for the destitute after years of living off the street. While some have dismissed this as impossible, it is impossible to deny that the thought of Bangui's poor laying where the despised Emperor did isn't at least a little appealing.

The scars of colonialism are still visible in our country, and to many we are cowards to groveling to our former masters, however our government sees no other option. Surprisingly, the Commune agreed to unconditionally assist our regime, providing the nation with the latest communard weaponry and officers to train our ragtag army. Additionally, the French sent officer Pierre Garbay as a military attaché to our nation, a seasoned veteran which will faithfully serve to protect our nation from reactionaries. The Commune praised our delegate, calling our state the "Vanguard of the African Revolution" and promising us the Commune’s unconditional support. Parts of our delegation were suspicious of the French envoy, with many finding some of the Ambassador’s comments towards our officials to be patronizing. Despite a few hiccups between our delegates, the guns and ammunition that the French promised are now arriving by the truckload, and are of far better quality than the scraps that were left in Colonial armories.

Despite their ferocity, the rebels remained disorganized, and a swift counterattack by our Red Army quickly disintegrated the rebellion. However, no opportunity should be overlooked. Many monarchists remain in our country, those who supported Bokassa or another prospective chief. We didn't have a reason to dispose of them until now.

He established the African Development Fund with a stroke of his pen. This Fund, which will receive all profits from government-owned businesses, will then distribute its earnings to the people of our country. Our economists believe that as our vast mineral wealth fills government coffers, every citizen should receive at least a few hundred dollars each month. To the untrained eye, this may appear insignificant, but to our citizens, it is a lifeline. The majority of our people live on less than a dozen dollars per month, with subsistence farming and thievery making up the difference. With this consistent government check, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people will be lifted out of poverty.

They will no longer make millions on the backs of our hard work. Their very presence will no longer remind us of the generations of suffering they have brought here. The government has nationalized all assets worth more than a million dollars in one fell swoop.

However, this plan would soon be shot to hell and back. \n\nShortly after taking off from a private airstrip in Bangui, Boganda’s plane was fired at from an unknown party, with his plane being shot down by anti-air fire shortly before crossing the southern border into the Congo. Unknown to the masses and even those in charge, a small band of still-surviving Bokassa loyalists were able to requisition some heavy weapons from international sources, allowing them to launch an assassination attempt on the hero and national father of the Central African Republic.

Led by the Sultan of Dar al-Kuti Kamoun Mohamed al-Senoussi, who fled into a rebellious exile after the French puppeted his lands and forced his father to be a subservient pawn in their imperialist games years before the Weltkrieg and the rise of the Germans, this band of traditionalists, monarchists, clannists, and devout Muslims gave the Darlan Brothers one hour to heed their warning - a warning they ignored - before giving a raucous speech and commencing their final plan. \n\nThe Sultan announced to all that Bokassa had failed us. Boganda and MESAN failed us. The Europeans and their colonialist promises of Western progress and modernity failed us, and now the Socialist sirens fail our people once more! No longer shall the innocent people of Central Africa be experimented on by politicians and madmen seeking to create the perfect society, for we already had a society that worked perfectly for our people long before this great era of useless change.

However, with the arrival of the colonials, our people were exposed to the West’s ideas of centralization and generalization of the populace and culture. Now, with our independe finally secured, it is up to the Sultan to finally decide which one of these two political destinies best fit our nation and her people. Should we pursue the traditional idea of semi-Anarchist Rightism and Clannist autonomy, creating a loose confederation of like minded groups working together under the Sultan and Allah, or should we fully pursue a centralized, Africanized sultanate based upon the absolutist ideas of European monarchs and the Sultans of the Middle East?"

However, with the sheer size of his entourage and with the immense wealth in diamonds and treasures he carried, the Sultan managed to cause economic bubbles to form and quickly collapse shortly after in nearly every city he visited - a result only made worse due to the recent global economic downturn that was Black Monday. Like a modern Mansa Musa, Sultan al-Senoussi brought wonder, brief economic boons, and sudden financial crashes to every city he visited on his way to Mecca, earning him both adoration and hatred from many across the Middle East and Northeast Africa. Upon his eventual return to Bangui, he had supposedly caused economic havoc in no less than 12 major cities along his route, and as such, the Sultan chose to hide away in his palace until international attention drifted to other topics and boogeymen some time later.

And if they couldn’t make it worse, they perverted the systems of monarchism into a twisted and pro-European mockery. Jean-Bédel Bokassa proclaimed himself ‘Emperor’ for his own no-good means, and in the process sought to copy every facet of the monarchies of Europe; monarchies which sought our enslavement. Despite all the evils Bokassa committed, his supporters still lie in the gutters, ever ready to strike and dislodge us.

To replace it, the creole language of Sango, or Sangho, has risen as the official language of Ubangi-Shari. Based upon the Northern Ngbandi language, Sango is a conglomeration of various local dialects originally made as a shared trade language prior to the arrival of the French in the 1880s. Though it has some French loan words, the language is over 90% Ngbandi-based, and these few foreign influences shall hopefully be replaced or phased out as we endeavor to make a purely African language for our purely African homeland.

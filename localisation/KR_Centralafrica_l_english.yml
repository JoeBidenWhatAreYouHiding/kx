POLITICS_BOKASSA_EMPEROR_DESC:0 "Even in the wake of one nation’s imperial ambitions turning to ash and cinder, history stops for no one, and a new empire has already begun to blossom here in Africa. Born in 1921, the young Askari Jean-Bédel Bokassa took the destiny of Ubangi-Shari in his hands, leading a fanatical group of veterans and recruits against the dying German colonial machine. With his victory earned and the people of Bangui at his back, the young Bokassa has taken the reins of this former colony and has begun to forge it into a mighty empire - the first of its kind in post-Collapse Africa. Though he has already begun to receive criticisms for his peculiar appetites and violent tendencies, the people still adore their savior and hero in Bokassa. Taking the full title of ‘His Imperial Majesty Bokassa the First, Apostle of Peace and Servant of Jesus Christ, Emperor and Marshal of Central Africa by the will of the Central African people, united within the national political party, the MESAN’, this young soldier-turned-rebel-turned-emperor shall lead the lands of Ubangi-Shari and beyond into a new dawn as the rightful Emperor of Central Africa."
POLITICS_BOKASSA_LEADER_DESC:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, though young and inexperienced in any form of statecraft or leadership, has defied the odds and helped lead his people to independence. Though only born in 1921 and taking up the honored role of an Askari auxiliary just a few short years ago, Bokassa has proven his tenacity and cunning, if also sadism, in his brutal war against the German colonizers. With their colonial monstrosity of Mittelafrika burning, Bokassa has begun to be seen as a new unifying figure and national father to the dispersed and disparate peoples of Ubangi-Shari, and as he endeavors to bring stability to this war-torn land, he shall create a newly independent state of which the people of Africa have never seen."
POLITICS_BOKASSA_NAPOLEON_DESC:0 "Even in the wake of one nation’s imperial ambitions turning to ash and cinder, history stops for no one, and a new empire has already begun to blossom here in Africa.

With his victory earned and the people of Bangui at his back, the young Bokassa has took the reins of this former colony and began to forge it into a mighty empire - the first of its kind in post-Collapse Africa. While his ‘Empire’ was nothing but a laughable statelet at first - Bokassa the great managed to save the French Exile cause in their darkest hours, eventually leading them to final victory over their crimson foes. By the will of the people, Bokassa was proclaimed Emperor of the French, and took the regal name Napoleon II upon his coronation in the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris.\n\n While France having a black Askari commander as Emperor was not something that anyone would ever have expected, truth sometimes proves to be stranger than fiction. And even if some have their suspicions about Bokassa, most citizens of the French nation have learned to trust trust their country in the hands of their liberator: the ‘Empereur Noir’ "

By the will of the people upon the death of the Kaiser, Bokassa was proclaimed the German, and took the regal name Frederick IV upon his coronation in thel in Berlin.\n\n While Germany having a black Askari commander as Kaiser was not something that anyone would ever have expected, truth sometimes proves to be stranger than fiction. And even if some have their suspicions about Bokassa, most citizens of the German nation have learned to trust trust their country in the hands of their liberator: the ‘Schwarzer Kaiser’ "

POLITICS_BOGANDA_DESC:0 "Born around 1910, Father Barthélemy Boganda, uncle to the Mad Emperor himself, has long sought to raise his people out of the mud. The son of a village head, Boganda's parents would pass away when he was young, and his guardian would leave to join the French army, dying in the Battle of Verdun like so many others. For the remainder of the war, Boganda would live with his extended family. After the war ended and French influence in Central Africa began to retreat, Boganda and one his brothers would meet one of the few French patrols left within their region. The patrol asked where they were from, and upon taking what Boganda to be his name, they were taken to Bétou. In  Bétou and later Bangui, Boganda would study under the Spiritan missionaries, where he would be baptized. Feeling called to the priesthood shortly after his Baptism, Boganda would study in the Belgian Congo, eventually being ordained a priest and assigned to aid in the conversion of Bangui.\n\nAs a priest, Boganda felt that the only way to raise his people was to get them to abandon the past and walk towards a brighter future. It was also during this time that he gained a burning hatred for the German colonizers, due to among other things their dropping of state-supported Catholic missionary activities.\n\nWhen Mittleafrika collapsed, and his young nephew seized control of Ubangi-Shari, Boganda was appointed as head of government, due to the experience he had running his local parish. As the Mad Emperor grew ever more into his delusions, his uncle remained at his post, trying to do right by his country and family. As Bokassa grew even madder, it became clear to Boganda that he must act, and act he did. Overthrowing his nephew, Father Boganda now finds himself as the President of Central Africa, and his plans for the nation and the region at large can finally begin."

### Ideas ###
CEA_split_larp:0 "Who to Idolize?"
CEA_split_larp_desc:0 "Jean-Bédel Bokassa, our national father and savior, has been torn between two competing influences. Long fascinated with monarchism and with strong imperial figures, the young Bokassa has fervently modeled his practices on both Napoleon Bonaparte, first French emperor, and Frederick the Great, the most honored Prussian king. Divided between these two identities, the young ‘Emperor’ must soon pick a path to follow and a titan to emulate, lest his regime drift aimlessly without direction."

CEA_inferiority_complex:0 "Desire for Greatness"
CEA_inferiority_complex_desc:0 "Despite his young age and inexperience when it comes to ruling a nation, Bokassa has nevertheless come to control all of Central Africa. From his base of power in Ubangi, this young Emperor now requires an empire to rule over. This greatness shall not be denied to him, and he is willing to cut through anyone and anything to earn his prize."

CEA_emperor_without_empire:0 "An Emperor with No Empire"
CEA_emperor_without_empire_desc:0 "With our borders secured and the foundations of the Bokassa regime now cemented, the young Emperor has begun to look outward for new worlds to conquer. Eyeing up the Kamerunians to the West, who have long been embroiled in a never-ending stalemate, Bokassa believes he has found a perfect target to serve as the site for our first imperial expansion."

CEA_fresh_meat:0 "Fresh Meat"
CEA_fresh_meat_desc:0 "While many in the remains of Mittelafrika face the looming possibility of starvation and famine, the people of [CEA.GetNameDef] have to deal with no such fears. Our proud leader, Jean-Bedel Bokassa has secured a large supply of fresh and hearty; albeit strange tasting meat to feed our populace. The source of this protein is still a mystery, but with a fed populace and a nourished army, the question of this meat’s origin is of little importance.\n After all, what you don’t know can’t hurt you... right?"

CEA_coronation_budget:0 "Post Coronation Bankruptcy"
CEA_coronation_budget_desc:0 "The coronation of Bokassa the Great has left our nation in financial ruin, decimating our ability to properly pay the expenditures of governance. Many wonder why our Emperor gets to spend so much on a simple ceremony while the majority of our nation barely makes enough to eat."

CEA_new_empire:0 "A Rising Empire"
CEA_new_empire_desc:0 "Our claims to greatness has been legitimized by our victory in the Kamerun war. Soon Bokassa will lead us to new triumphs in the future; the history of the Central African Empire is only beginning. Soon all of Africa will bow before us. ""

CEA_phasing_out_cannibalism:0 "Phasing out Cannibalism"
CEA_phasing_out_cannibalism_desc:0 "Cannibalism is an abhorrent and disgusting practice that was only ever used to keep the populace of Ubangi-Shari from starving to death in what may well have been Afrika's darkest moment. We are ready to move on now, and hide any evidence Cannibalism took place under Bokassa's watch."

CEA_post_bokassa_chaos:0 "Legacy of Bokassa"
CEA_post_bokassa_chaos_desc:0 "While the mad ‘Emperor’ might have been dealt with, his legacy still hovers over our nation like a dark cloud. Any legacy of this madman must be rooted out if our nation is to be free."

CEA_devestation:0 "Post Liberation Devastation"

CEA_opposition_desc:0 "The concept of a Black [ROOT.GetAdjective] is absurd to many within [CEA.GetLarpInspiration], however sometimes truth is stranger than fiction; and while Bokassa has gained significant goodwill from the liberation of our homeland, this good will can only last so long. Bokassa will need to work tirelessly to prove himself to his new subjects. "

CEA_neocolonial_army:0 "Neo-Colonial Army"
CEA_neocolonial_army_desc:0 "While the old colonial groups were nothing but dusty old fools, we can not deny their passion. The officers of the elder Mittelafrika who had worked tirelessly; yet ultimately for not to keep the great colonial project together deserve our respect, and will fittingly be given a place in our new Mittelafrika."

CEA_german_relations_idea:0 "German Business"
CEA_german_relations_idea_desc:0 "When we were a small and weak nation, the greats such as the German Empire would surely pay little attention to us; however now that we control almost 2/3rds of the African continent, German businessman and military strategists have been watching us with a closer eye. The lucrative relationship that was shared with Germany, a relationship lost in the chaos of the Mittelafrikan Collapse shall be restored to the highest degree; binding our nations together inseparably though finance and trade. "

CEA_germany_sus:0 "German Suspicions"
CEA_germany_sus_desc:0 "While Bokassa has gained significant status thanks to his hand in recreating Mittelafrika, German Authorities still hold out their suspicions with Statthalter Bokassa. Everything from his eccentric personality, the nature of his ‘Empire’ and the rumours of cannibalism has damaged his prestige in the eyes of his overlords; something which he will need to work to remedy."

CEA_integrating_france:0 "Integration of France"
CEA_integrating_france_desc:0 "France and Germany have been separate, and often hostile nations for more than 800 years. Much hard work will be needed to mend our nations together once more."

CEA_french_consessions:0 "Fruits from French Labour"

CEA_german_control:0 "German Control of Our Economy"
CEA_german_control_desc:0 "While the German Empire has graciously allowed the French state to continue its existence, they will not repeat the mistakes of their past.

The party was founded Barthélemy Boganda; and was co-opted by Jean-Bédel Bokassa when he seized control of Ubangi-Shari. It stands for nationalist and quasi-religious ideals that seeks to affirm black humanity against European dehumanization. While Bokassa has commanded the party with an iron fist, and sought to destroy opposition to it, the simple fact is that MESAN is the only real political force within the nation; and for better or for worse, MESAN would stand as the only real governing party for our nation even if Bokassa were to be deposed.

Their protests have been virulent and frequently violent, with remnant paramilitaries such as the Steel Helmets clashing with officials in cities such as Munich and Wilhelmshaven. However, these are the last roars of the old order. The majority of Germans are resigned to their fate, and many are willing to overlook it. The Emperor's supporters emphasize how advantageous Frederick's reign has been. Meanwhile, the news has been met with confusion on the Dark Continent. Much of Africa's nobility is opposed to the idea of combining the two Empires. They emphasize that Germany and Africa are too distinct to be merged in any meaningful way. Meanwhile, the African public is preoccupied with more practical issues. They couldn't care less about Germany or Europe. Colonialism is still fresh in most Africans' minds, and they simply want to be free of the white man. Many Africans, on the other hand, want Frederick to return to Africa and rule them directly as he once did. However, their protests, like those in Germany, have been muted and limp-wristed.

And while Bokassa too betrayed the great Mzee, the soldiers who fought in the battle were willing to fight for Bokassa’s due to his offer to help kill Kenyatta in exchange for a full pardon\n\nWith the sounds of the maelstrom that unfolded outside his final bastion subsiding, Jomo breathed a sigh of relief, believing, if even just for a second, his troops were victorious. Then all hope faded in a flash of white phosphorus and hellfire. After seconds that felt like millenia, Kenyatta opened his eyes after a cacophony of noise, light, and vitriolic chemicals drowned out his senses and blocked the world from his perception, shocked only to see the bloodied, mutilated corpses of his loyal askari guard strewn about the shack he had decided to make this ‘valiant’ last stand. \n\nThen, in a flash, it was over. Without a final, grandiose speech or apology, without even a final word, the leading soldier stepped forward before Kenyatta even could clearly make sense of his newly demolished surroundings and decapitated the traitorous snake in one quick action - a far too quick a death for this scum. Jomo Kenyatta’s last words were but a mere whimper mixed with the smell of him relieving himself in panic and sound of cold steel meeting the flesh of a vile pig."

The soldiers that found him at first did not believe that the man was truly him, predicting his ‘capture’ to be some sort of trap. However as they took the man who was supposedly Bell off to a local station, they managed to confirm that this man was truly who he repeatedly claimed to be.\n\n Bell spend the final hours of his life conversing with the squadron of soldiers who were sent to capture him in their native French, touching on a broad variety of subjects with the men; subjects which they could both relate to, yet at the same time find completely alien. The soldier assigned to execute him grappled with the decision to follow through with his order; however after a great internal conflict decided to continue on with the mission.\n\n He snuck up behind Bell after he had finished his lively discussion with the troops; retiring to a tattered couch in the station and quietly reading the final pages of a book. The soldier moved behind him, being as quiet as possible; but despite precautions, there was no doubt that Bell would be aware of his impending fate. Despite his death appearing imminent, he continued to read, advancing through the final pages of the book, finishing the last page before the soldier raised his machete up high, and decapitated him in one swing.\n\n The soldiers shared an awkward ride back to Bangui with Douala-Bell’s body, not knowing how to remark on the strange event that they had just witnessed.

The Mainkongo boarded a river boat as city burned in the distance, attempting with his aides one last ditch-attempt to escape from the Bokassa’s wrath. The Portugese detachment managed to gun down the detatchment of Bokkasa’s soldiers attacking the docks; and despite bombs being hurled at the boat from every clearing, the vessel departed from the port, and continued down the mighty Congo basin. While the boat’s thick steel hull resisted bombing, the ships integrity lasted for only a few miles, as soon the framework of the ship began to buckle, and water began filling the craft’s lower levels. While the squadron of Portuguese sailors assigned to guide the boat attempted to patch the breach, it ultimately proved futile, as the boat began rapidly capsizing.\n\n Just before the boat vanished beneath the Congo’s choppy waves, the Mainkongo and a handful of Portuguese soldiers escaped in a lifeboat, hoping to land on shore and slowly make their ways to a loyalist encampment. Before they made it to shore, a number of stray soldiers who had been following the craft in a comendared fishing boat arrived on the lifeboat’s side.\n\n When the Central African soldiers opened fire, Portuguese soldiers responded valiantly; even managing to kill and wound most of the soldiers on the boat. However by the end of the confrontation most of the riverbourne soldiers soldiers lay dead, and due to the damage sustained in the firefight, both vessels sunk to the river’s icy floor.  "

These bouts of savage outrage have come to a climax as black soldiers besiege the city’s FP Barracks, defeating even the most well-trained white officers within the force.\n\n During the final stages of the battle, the few remaining defenders were faced with a critical lack of ammunition; which has led to Janssens abandoning his rifle and resorting to running around the barracks armed with nothing but a large club, blindly bludgeoning any black soldier that comes across his path - even if they are under his own command.\n\n The final seconds of the battle saw Central African soldiers triumphantly break through the main entrance to the main building, however by the time they reached Janssens, they were caught off guard when they found out that the ‘Petit Maniaque’ already laid dead - with his death not being a result of a bullet wound.

The driver turned to Ryckmans, told him that the stop was an opportunity ‘stretch his legs’, before exiting the car himself.\n\n The tree refused to move, the driver debated turning around; however the Emperor’s troops had a great presence in Likasi; it would be safer to continue forward towards Élisabethville. There was an airport not under control of Bokassa’s men, they could board a Saab 90 Scandia, and fly back towards the homeland; everything would be over, Ryckmans could surely publish a book about the experience. As the group stalled in their attempts to get back on the road, Ryckmans nervously scanned the clearings, eyeing up any would-be attackers.

Bokassa selected a dozen children from the crowd as the few hundred residents of the small village crowded around Bokassa, clearly awestruck by their glorious leader. He had pictures taken with them, but they had to be discarded because Bokassa was the only one smiling. Next, Bokassa had a bundle of sacks brought up and pulled a slew of smart white and blue military dress uniforms from them. A large patch of the President's smiling face was proudly displayed on the right and left shoulders of the uniform. When one of the kids reached for it, Bokassa smacked his hand away instinctively. He then revealed that the uniforms were not to be given away because they were expensive to produce; neglecting to mention that these uniforms were produced by a factory owned by one of his wives. Instead, his offer was sell them to the kids for 535 francs, an offer the children were not at liberty to refuse. However no one, not even the mayor, possessed enough funds to make the purchase, as these poor families lived a subsistence lifestyle like many within the rural areas of the country. The fact that these impoverished children were being forced to spend money they did not have on such uniforms sent the younglings into a childish fury, and the crowd responded by pelting the Emperor and his car with rocks. After being hit in the eye with a pebble, Bokassa screamed at the kids that he would never forgive them for this slight. Before anybody could stop him he raised his cane from the ground and brandished it at the children, before ordering his guards to club the children to death. Bokassa himself joined in on the massacre, smashing the skulls of many with his his ebony walking stick, taking great concern with keeping his uniforms out of the way of the steadily growing pool of blood. The President's convoy left the ruins of Bomimi hours later, leaving over 200 bodies behind."

They also heard him say a Muslim midday prayer, though his Muslim companions later claimed that his Arabic was so bad that he could have been speaking gibberish. When the President noticed his courtiers, he stood and introduced himself as Salah Eddine Ahmed Bokassa. He explained that Allah had approached him during the night and revealed to him that only by converting to Islam could Africa be free. Before anyone could ask a question, the President declared that his first act as the new Caliph of Africa would be to ban all pork because pigs and swine were unclean animals. However, things changed yet again that night; when President Bokassa sat down for dinner, he was surprised to see a salad on his plate. When he inquired as to what was going on, his personal chef explained that because pork was prohibited, he had to improvise that night's meal. Bokassa, evidently, had probably forgotten or changed his mind about his conversion, as he responded with his typical rage. He stabbed the cook with a fork in the hand and demanded a whole honeyed ham for dinner or he would eat the cook instead. When approached about his conversion later Bokassa proclaimed his conversion back to Roman Catholicism. Few can guess as to why Bokassa suddenly converted, then deconverted. Some guess that his conversion was a justification to destroy the nation’s ‘Pork’ Supply, others have guessed that it was an attempt to curry favour with the Cairo Pact, and rapidly converting back to Christianity after being slighted by Cairo. After a few puzzled looks, the President's staff decided that this was one of the less strange things the President had done this week and decided to move on."

The official speechwriters had their assistants write it instead because it was so benign. However, it appears that the staff had forgotten for whom they were working. Bokassa threw the page away after reading the speech for the first time just minutes before the radio went live. As speechwriters struggled to gain access to the locked booth, Bokassa launched into a venomous condemnation of Colonialism. Not only did he condemn Germany, National France, and the (defunct) United Kingdom for spearheading the carving up of Africa, but he also condemned the very existence of those countries, calling them savages driven only by lust and greed. Then, in a move that can only be described as erratic, Bokassa switched to discussing what to do about the colonial powers. According to Bokassa, all of Africa must band together to rise up against their foreign masters. He then proposed that they do it under a single ruler like a monarch, rather than a weak and effeminate democracy. Before the speechwriters were able to turn off the broadcast, Bokassa took it upon himself to accept this entirely theoretical crown."

He responded that he had reluctantly accepted the crown in order to make Central Africa "stand out" on the global stage and attract more foreign aid, and provide stability for our nation in a world of failing republics.

He sees this not only as a way to establish his fledgling nation as a scientific powerhouse, but also as a way to secure his regime. Nobody would dare to oppose him from within or without his borders if he could threaten nuclear annihilation. If even a third of the predictions about how powerful the bomb could be are correct, it would be a weapon worth having. In Algiers, his agents were quickly apprehended and deported for asking the first person they saw where they could find weapons-grade uranium. The French did not believe their claims that they were on official national business. Bokassa responded by threatening to destroy  Algiers first, should he possess a working nuclear weapon. His agents were more successful in the Congo, however. They quickly made contact with a mercenary group that controlled a uranium mine. A deal was struck, and now uranium is being smuggled into Central Africa on a regular basis. All we can hope for is that Bokassa does not immediately inform everyone."

German administrators and a German garrison have begun to arrive in the country in exchange for certain guarantees and mineral rights. The Germans began by reforming Bokassa's administration. Taking a practical look at the bloated bureaucracy, German administrators were able to trim off enough fat to clog the arteries of a whale. They discovered hundreds of departments and micro administrations that served no purpose. They were able to combine and reduce these departments to a better level by taking a critical look at them, saving the government millions on worthless wages. Many of the newly hired administrators are German, which Bokassa has been assured is merely a happy coincidence. Meanwhile, German advisors have pruned the Army of nepotistic generals and officers, who have been replaced by disciplined German officers. Simultaneously, a new training regimen has been implemented in order to transform the Army into a truly effective fighting force."

These cultures have a distinct history and rivalry. However, through serious outreach programs, we can work to resolve these ancient feuds and create a new identity alongside their distinct tribal identities, a true African identity.

While Boganda has denied this as slander from his opponents, few believe him, and the Bishop of Bangui, Joseph Cucherousset, a rising star among the growing Catholic community, has publicly condemned Boganda for violating his vows. In response, the Pope himself wrote to Boganda, informing him that he needed to perform public penance if he wanted to keep his priesthood.

Some tribes in the hinterlands believe Boganda has personal conversations with God on a regular basis. These claims provide him a great deal of political clout in the growing Catholic community. He is also the sorcerer's son. His father cast spells on his farm fields before being murdered by French forces. His son has links to both African and European Spiritualism. The third point is his equality with the white man. His mother was a white woman making Boganda a mixed race. While to the remnant European elite's navy blue blue-bloods, Boganda is only half a man, to the majority of white men, he is just about as good as anyone else. Boganda has learned to take advantage of this. While in the cities, he speaks like a European and refers to his white heritage. However, while in the country, he speaks in their language and discusses his father's sorcery. This has stoked a belief among some people in the countryside that Boganda is the reincarnation of Karnou, a local religious prophet whose name means "He who can change the world". To black Christians, he is akin to the Black Christ.

These hungry and desperate men and women are prime targets for Syndicalist subversion. Already, socialists such as Antoine Darlan have begun to lay the groundwork for a Syndicalist party by utilizing these newly poor workers as a foundation. Boganda cannot allow this to continue or the country will be thrown into chaos. As a result, he has embarked on a daring new project of 'De-Proletarianization' of the country. He has attempted to draw poor migrant workers away from the syndicalist hotbeds of the cities by pouring money into these poor villages and spreading out economic development. However, while some have returned to their rural homes, others have remained in the city. These holdouts, on the other hand, present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. A healthy middle class supports a healthy democracy. We can lift these people out of poverty and free them from the clutches of Socialism and Syndicalism by directing social programs toward them. These valiant men will be the first of a rapidly expanding middle class. However, as with everything, this has brought with it yet another issue. Our former colonial masters have no love for blacks, and nothing makes them more afraid than a wealthy black man.

cea_flavour.24.t:0 "Fate of the Dar al-Kuti Sultanate"
cea_flavour.24.d:0 "Africa is a land shaped by countless tribal kingdoms and rulers, most of which have been unfortunately lost to the sands of time. One such lost kingdom was the Sultanate of Dar al-Kuti, occupying a stretch of the Islamic frontier to the south-west of Wadai. The Sultante’s Rich History started as a province of the larger Baguirmi sultanate, Belad al-Kuti, or Dar al-Kuti, eventually becoming a formal, tribute-paying province of its northern Muslim neighbour, Dar Runga, which was in turn part of Wadai's empire. Due to Dar al-Kuti’s small size the Sultan was sure to court the Muslim North, as well as securing trade relations with their non-Muslim neighbors. After decades of aggression from northern Slave-Traders, Dar al-Kuti became an almost autonomous state with its own sphere of influence extending over much of our north-east of our nation. In 1897 the Sultanate accepted French protectorate Status, with the French gradually whittling away the Sultanate, with their self-rule eventually coming to an end after the death of Muhammad al-Sanusi. When Germany took control of Ubangi-Shari at the end of the Weltkreig, the administrative division containing the Sultanate was completely dissolved in favour of a German Military Administration. The Heir to the Sultanate, Kamoun Mohamed Senoussi continued the fight against Germany just as his father did against the French, however it was ultimately for not. And even when Mittelafrika crumbled into dust, the Sultane still never gained its lost prestige. After Jean-Bédel Bokassa’s seizure of power, the brief attempt at restoration came to an end, with Kamoun Mohamed Senoussi offering his services to the young Askari Commander as an officer; even going so far as to recognize Bokassa as the region’s legitimate Monarch.\n\n While some would have expected Africa to heal and return to their rich traditions in the face of a Colonial Power Vacuum, it seems that politicians and rouge warlords will continue seeking to emulate new and foreign systems. Whether this will bring continued tumult or lasting stability to our continent is still yet to be seen."

cea_flavour.25.t:0 "le dieu de Lam"
cea_flavour.25.d:0 "While stories of wide-scale resistance against Colonial Resistance are few and far between due in part to the German Empire’s wide reaching prowess, some of the most infamous warriors against colonialism have gained a key position in our new nation now that the shackles of our masters have finally been thrown off. One such figure is one Toumba Modomdoko - also known as the ‘God of Lam’ by his followers. Toumba came from humble beginnings, being born in Lam, in Gidar country; he had no formal education and spent his days accompanying his father in the fields. At one point he disappeared, and upon his return proclaimed himself the ‘Mangilva na Bray’ - the Divine of Bray. He returned to his community transfigured, beginning to manifest social change by working to emancipate the Gidar and neighboring groups from Goudour's tutelary influence, and to limit the blacksmiths' social hold on the Gidar community. Additionally, he spoke out against violence against women, forbidding them to be bound and beaten; as well as preaching for a form of equality in the face of faults. He delivered messages through the medium or by transforming his voice, inviting to fight and to make disappear European colonization, and to reject what came from the "White", money, taxes and schools. He mobilized several occult and religious forces, using combat techniques consisting of ambushes behind curtains of millet and tall grass, conducted without strategy but not without tactics and know-how. And while his rebellions were never successful at dislodging the Colonial Order, they did prove to be a great annoyance to the German Garrison, who never were able to capture Toumba Modomdoko or fully extinguished the rebellion. The collapse of Mittelafrika was cause for great jubilation across the region, and upon the creation of the nation of Ubangi-Shari, the ‘dieu de Lam’ pledged his forces to secure the region for their new leader. Despite being a loyal soldier of Ubangi-Shari, he has little concern for the politicking of Bangui,  instead only seeking freedom for his own villages and his own peoples.\n\n The legend of his anti-colonial struggle will continue to live on through this titanic figure, as through painstaking work, and the incompetence of our oppressor, Central Africa has tasted freedom at long last."

cea_flavour.26.d:0 "While the hooks of Syndicalism have yet to be officially sunk into the heart of Africa, many movements that draw inspiration from the Internationale have sprung up throughout Equatorial Africa. One such socialist group that calls Ubangi-Shari home is the so-called ‘Rassemblement Démocratique Africain’, or ‘Kundgebung der Afrikanischen Demokraten’. The local chief of this group is influential politician and Trade Unionist Antoine Darlan, with his younger brother Georges ‘Jürgen’ Darlan also proving influential within the party.\n\n The Darlan brothers were born to a Ubangi mother and a European father, with their mixed blood allowing them to attend school, unlike the majority of the population. Both brothers eventually went on to serve the colonial military service, and upon the collapse of Mittelafrika, the Darlans went on to serve diligently in the newly founded nation’s civil service.\n\n With inspiration and funding from Communard groups, the brothers went on to found Ubangi-Shari’s chapter of the RDA/KDAD. Antoine, a committed Trade Unionist steered the party towards a Communard-Inspired Syndicalist direction, however his brother Jürgen seeks a more moderate and more German-Inspired approach to governance, frequently looking to Otto Wels and the SPD for political models to draw upon.\n\n Despite their political disagreements, both brothers have a mutual respect for eachother, and firm commitment against the ‘tyrannical’ rule of Bokassa and MESAN. However despite their rabble, the general unpopularity of Syndicalism in Africa means that they pose no real threat. "

cea_flavour.27.d:0 "Throughout the history of Africa, few men have become so universally reviled as the ‘Emperor’ of Ubangi-Shari: Jean-Bédel Bokassa. While he came from humble beginnings, his megalomania came to fruition after Mittelafrika’s collapse in the form of a crudely proclaimed and barely held together ‘Empire’ that made our nation into a global laughing stock, even going so far as to waste most of our nation’s budget on a pompous and ultimately useless coronation. The true extent of Bokassa’s crimes are only starting to be revealed by investigators, but from what we can gather, Bokassa is guilty of heinous crimes such as murder, treason, embezzling, kidnapping, and even cannibalism.\n\n While our nation reels from the damage the madman Bokassa has done, we look towards a brighter future, in vain hope that the horrific events that occurred under Bokassa will never be repeated again.

GRU_GOEBBELS_DESC:0 "Before his rise to power Goebbels worked as a journalist and occasional Film Theater and Theater critique in his hometown of Rheydt. He was relatively well known in his home region and within the bigger cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf and Mönchengladbach near his hometown.\nHis early contact with Marxism during his youth and tendencies to Nationalism influenced his political leanings and ideological thought a lot which he had to hide during the reign of the Kaiser or he might have faced a ban on his journalism work due to repressions against far left writers in the German Empire.\nWhile not being in line with traditional Syndicalist or Socialist values he can be seen a a mirror to the French Sorelians with his Syncretism between ideological concepts that can be found within the far left and the far right he has manifested himself his very own ideology which he calls „National-Marxism“. It still remains questionable if it is actually different to Sorelian National-Syndicalism or if it even is 'Marxist' at all."

rotermorgenmisc.1.d:0 "After the nationalization and merging of all media production and distribution into the UFA, Volksführer Goebbels ordered them to find new means for mass influence. An employee at UFA who was responsible for creating background sounds with his Elektrophon and recordings of sounds he would manipulate, came up with a new form of music, the 'Sythetische Musik'. At first deemed Un-German by his superior, its weird modern sounds did catch the ear of Volksführer Goebbels during a routine visit. The Volksführer was stunned by this new truly German form of music and its ability to let people 'vibe' on it while adding subliminal messages."

The FAUD, which has lost a lot of influence thanks to the legal formation of leftist parties in Germany, and the NMDVP, which is lead by Josef Goebbels and is not accepted by the other parties for its call for Ultranationalism, promotion of traditional values and call for a „National Rebirth“."

rotermorgen.80.d:0 "The SMEPD consisting of the SMEPD-S and SMEPD-M factions has finally split due to constant infighting among the Syndicalists and Marxists on important matters as the state and future of the economy.

rotermorgen.10.t:0 "The Occupation"
rotermorgen.10.d:0 "Now that we hold total control over Germany we must find a future way for it. The problem we now face is that while there have been underground organizations all over the German Empire, there has not been any official syndicalist or socialist one beside the FAUD, and we can't simply hand all power to a worker union that has strong factionalism inside.\nThe committee, consisting of the French, British and Italian delegations, has decided to call for the Germans to form unions parties for a future Congress of German Unions."

rotermorgen.30.t:0 "The FAUD Split"
rotermorgen.30.d:0 "The FAUD has recently faced some major problems, when Ernst Thälmann left with a significant portion of its more Centralist members to form the SUDA „Syndikalistsche Union Deutscher Arbeiter“.\nFollowing this, the remains of the FAUD have made it clear that they will now represent the only truly Syndicalist union, as they call Thälmann a Marxist, Bolshevik, and traitor to liberty for his centralization stance on the government and economy."

rotermorgen.50.t:0 "The Hypnotic Charm of a Small Man"
rotermorgen.50.d:0 "While many already considered the formation of Pieck's MLEPD as problematic for a Syndicalist society, no one would have expected a party that could overshadow that.\n\nJosef Goebbels, a former supporter of marxism and furiously Nationalistic journalist from the Rhineland managed to organize a meeting of Nationalist hardliners in Pieck's MLEPD, Nationalists that had sympathies towards Marxist and Syndicalist economics, and the minority of „German Sorelians“."

rotermorgen.52.t:0 "Josef Goebbels and the NMDVP"
rotermorgen.52.d:0 "Troubling news have reached our desks. That maniac from the Rhine, Josef Goebbels, did actually manage to sway people to his cause and organized his own party, the NMDVP, a „National-Marxist“ party as he calls it which is more or less a German version of French National-Syndicalism which one big difference, his ideology does not even call for ending capitalism instead prefering a partially nationalized social corporate economy a fact many already consider to be a betrayl of the revolution.\n\nHe even openly defies our power monopoly by forming his own militia called the „beefsteaks“ by many due to them using brown uniforms with red shirts."

rotermorgen.61.d:0 "37 dead! NMDVP and Police clash!\n\nIt is on all the German newspapers the NMDVP did not kind to our failed attempt to arrest it's leader and the significant size of it's militia and the fact that weapons from the war are all over the country make it impossible to end it this way without more bloodshed.\nThere is only one way left now, we must tolerate and allow the party for now in turn for turning in everyone that actively harmed or killed policemen."

The piece, entitled 'The Soul', depicts a completely blank, white canvas, and while nearly all critics called it 'a Dadaist masterpiece' and said 'it's an example of what art should be about', some other critics called it 'bland', 'soulless', however, they were silenced by the crowd booing them out.\nAfterwards ,some of the artists in favor of Nussbaum even started to remove pieces created by those that were in critique of 'The Soul'."

Currently, there are only two channels on the Volksfernseher, one for news and one for entertainment which mostly consists of live music performances in various UFA studios. Not to mention getting a decent signal for the Volksfernseher is difficult as there isn’t sufficient civilian telecommunications infrastructure to support it.

Recently, the regime has been ramping up efforts to tackle the question of the Jews within Germany. To complete this task, Goebbels has signed off on the creation of the Central Organization of Jewish Affairs, acting as a subdivision of the RR. Staffed by RR members with extensive knowledge on Judaism, with some even going as far as to speak Hebrew fluently, the division is expected by the regime to come up with plans to drive the Jewish population out of German lands or at least isolate them. Already, plans detailing agreements with the local governments within Madagascar and the Levant to accept Jewish emigrants along with the logistics for emigrating Jews to those lands are already starting to be drafted. Along with this come plans of concentrating urban Jewish populations into walled off ghettos within those urban centers, even with suspected coordinated harassment and attacks with the VR to give extra “encouragement” for the Jews to leave. Obvious human rights concerns have come up over these alleged plans with many governments accusing the NMDVP’s actions of being depraved and vile, with even some of Germany’s allies raising concerns in private. However, it is unlikely that these objections will change much if anything over the course Germany has decided to take with its Jewish population."

Rudi and Liesel became accustomed to this, after all it seemed only natural to thank the man who brought them prosperity anyway. As they were returning home from the market, something caught Rudi’s eye. A poster on a wall, on depicting three rats holding individual bayonets at Germany, exclaiming that “The Dangers to Germany Shall Threaten Us Until Destroyed!”. The first rat wore a beret and a mustache, the second a Pickelhaube with big red lips, and the third had curly hair and an elongated nose.

Whatever the case may be, unionist councils are running a coordinated effort to overhaul education in all areas, from the curriculum to the facilities. Although the exact specifics of the Anarcho-Syndicalist curriculum may differ based on the area of Germany, there is a general agreement that children will be educated on the ideas of their society. The main tenants include emphasis on equity and cooperation among all peers, the encouragement of progressive ideals and experimentation, teaching students the inherent wrongs of the reactionary, capitalistic, and imperialistic Germany’s of yore, and the inner workings of the Anarcho-Syndicalist system and the ideals that power it. Some families claim that the new curriculum is purely ideological and doesn’t prepare the next generation for actual work. In some towns, there are notable absences of subjects such as calculus and physics while subjects revolving around socialist political theory and the arts get more precedence in schooling.

Under the new laws, homosexuals will be granted equal opportunities in all levels of government, employment, and military service with any institutional discrimination towards or hate crimes towards them being met with legal punishment. The most controversial aspect of these new laws is the protections of the very small transsexual community in Germany, which even some members of FAUD think is going a bit too far as it might bolden the already inflamed reactionary resistance to these new laws.

Not even mentioning those of the colonies who had came to the mainland for the purpose of work, whether they be black, South East Asian, or Chinese. To keep these minority groups down any longer would be a disgrace to German history and its people, which is why during a recent session of FAUD unions it was agreed on that more action should be taken to ensure that these groups are treated equally. Aside from the anti-discrimination laws against them, unions and communes have instituted employment quotas for minority groups every year to ensure that they get better chances of employment. Failure to hit the quotas might result in potential fines and punishments towards the unions and communes that do so. This is perhaps the most controversial action taken by FAUD so far, as it was the first FAUD vote to receive a decent amount of union opposition to.

However, it did not change the fact that the presiding jury had been entirely comprised of SMEPD bureaucrats or low ranking militia members, or the fact that some of the evidence and witness testimonies were either partially or fully fabricated to match some of the charges against them. In the end, Pieck along with his inner circle and lieutenants were found guilty of a variety of charges, with all of them having their party membership, along with any awards and titles, revoked and being prohibited of holding a position of power or political office again. The courts even went as far as the place Pieck and some others on indefinite house arrest. What was once the most persistent headache in all of Germany has now been reduced to an irrelevant footnote in history left to wither away as the rest of history goes forth without them."

rotermorgenmisc.28.d:0 "It is no secret that Germany during the Kaiser was infamous for its backward treatment of women. Even at a time when democracies such as the United States and Russia extended the right of suffrage to women, Germany for whatever reason still relented. The SPD realized the backwardness of such a decisions which is why the party leadership pursued giving the right of women to vote almost instantly since coming into power. As of today, the SPD has achieved just that. All women who are citizens of Germany and aged 21 or older now have the right to vote. The decision to grant women suffrage has been seen by most elements of German society as a step in the right direction, resulting in the SPD’s popularity going up virtually overnight. "

rotermorgenmisc.29.d:0 "Since the creation and official endorsement of the new Wodan Church as state religion we have built a new faith upon old Norse and Germanic mythology and many that feared to be taunted or laughed at for their Pagan believes in the past have risen to the ranks of the Goði priests by now.\nThey are stalking the woods at night dressed in fur, horns, and wooden crowns, seeking guidance from the Gods for our glorious Nation, sacrificing animals and other small offerings. Many of the more Conservative parts of our society are at terror about these Neo-Pagans that roam the nights mirroring the image of the Christian devil himself."

 SRD_attack_sri_desc: "It's time. We need to return to the mainland, destroy the socialists who forced us into exile, and liberate the lands of Piedmont.

### Ideas ###
 SRD_militarist_badoglio_opposition: "Militarist Opposition"
 SRD_militarist_badoglio_opposition_desc: "Informally led by Marshal Badoglio, the conservative sphere within the Royal Army has started an unofficial campaign of opposition against Marras' reformist executive. Though powerful, they won't try outright subversive actions as long as the King supports us; however, they will remain a thorn on our side."
 SRD_reformist_opposition: "Reformist Opposition"
 SRD_reformist_opposition_desc: "Protesting against the return to power of Marshal Badoglio, the reformists have taken to the streets seeking to avoid a return to dictatorship; clearly guided by socialist infiltrators, these dangerous revolutionaries must be crushed."
 SRD_supremacy_of_parliament: "Supremacy of Parliament"
 SRD_supremacy_of_parliament_desc: "The government in Sardinia, while never outright claiming to reject the constitutional principles that helped found Italy, has long been plagued by nominally monarchist dictatorships imposed by military men. Now that democratic reformers have been empowered, the parliament has been restored to prominence and they are unlikely to allow power to slip from them again."
 SRD_women_suffrage_idea: "Women's Suffrage"
 SRD_women_suffrage_idea_desc: "As part of a greater democratisation effort in Sardinia, women have finally gained the right to vote. While not always evenly applied, this initiative has seen genuine support. It has raised hope that our government will return to the mainland much better than the one that left, and has raised the spirits of our loyalists."
 SRD_sardinian_autonomy_promise: "A Promise of Autonomy"
 SRD_sardinian_autonomy_promise_desc: "Since the Perfect Union, Sardinia has been a backwater within Italy; now that we're in Cagliari however we can no longer ignore the Island's call for self-government. This has been a problem, as Sardinians were convinced that, should we reclaim the Mainland, Sardinia would return to being a rural, unimportant land. Now, with the simple promise that Sardinia will retain some autonomy after the Mainland is reclaimed, we have finally convinced the brave people of Sardinia to support our war of National Reclamation."
 SRD_centralism_enforced: "Piedmontese Centralism"
 SRD_centralism_enforced_desc: "All this talk of autonomism and self-government is nothing more than political opportunism spurred by the current situation, and threatens the very unity of our nation. Sardinia is an integral part of the Realm; and many patriotic Sardinians are ready to die for their King, regardless of political leanings."
 SRD_cisl_idea: "National Workers' Unions Confederation"
 SRD_cisl_idea_desc: "A complete crackdown on unions would only harm our nation, but at the same time we must remain vigilants towards Socialists infiltrators; by federating all truly independent unions into a big, semi-autonomous national union we will ensure a basic right of our people while keeping out dangerous radicals."
 SRD_legal_unions_idea: "Legalised Unions"
 SRD_legal_unions_idea_desc: "We cannot deny our people the basic right to unionise. While a background check on their leadership is needed to avoid infiltrations, all unions must be allowed to operate and defend our working people's rights."
 SRD_avanti_sardegna: "Avanti Sardegna"
 SRD_avanti_sardegna_desc: "Yet again, the people of Sardinia will find themselves on a battlefield far from home, yet again they will take up arms to defend their beloved island, yet again many will tragically lose their life for a goal greater than themselves. However, much like in the Asiago plateau in the tragic years of the Weltkrieg, these Sardinians will put aside their differences to fight for the King, for Italy and for Sardinia to the bitter end. It is our duty to make sure their sacrifices will not be in vain, not again. While the cry of \"Avanti Savoia\" unites every true Italian, another cry unites every Sardinian, and together with these heroes we will make it reach the Mainland, Paris, Vienna, Berlin:\nAvanti Sardegna, Avanti Fortza Paris!"
 SRD_miners_unrest: "Unrest in the Mines"
 SRD_miners_unrest_desc: "The failure of the Bardanzellu Government to deal with various issues in the foreign-owned mines of Southern Sardinia, peaking in a completely botched nationalisation scheme, has allowed unrest and radical ideas to flourish in the mining communities of Carbonia and Iglesias. With the locals beginning to organise under minor trade unions, technically illegal for state employees and very much illegal under the State of Siege, the new government will have to move towards a resolution, else the Socialist Republic intervene on their behalf."
 SRD_royalist_fervor_idea: "Royalist Fervour"
 SRD_royal_guards_idea: "Royal Guards"
 SRD_sardinia_autonomous_region: "The Sardinian Autonomous Region"

 SRD_move_to_federalism_idea: "Move Towards Federalism"
 SRD_six_points_manifesto_idea: "The Six Points Manifesto"

 SRD_entente_support: "Support from the Entente"
 SRD_entente_support_desc: "Sardinia relies extensively on their fellow governments in exile to prop up their government. Our friends in Ottawa and Algiers have generously provided us with subsidies for our military, and in return we will need to play our part in liberating our homelands from socialist rule."

### Focus - Politics ###
 SRD_tackle_institutional_crisis: "Tackle the Institutional Crisis"
 SRD_tackle_institutional_crisis_desc: "The miners' crisis has proven fatal to the stability of the already weak Bardanzellu government. With the balance between exiles and Parliament broken, a solution for governability appears impossible; in spite of king Amedeo's wishes, a royal intervention and an extra-parliamentary cabinet may be on the horizon."
 SRD_protect_the_kingdom: "Protect the Kingdom"
 SRD_protect_the_kingdom_desc: "The rabble-rousers in the so-called \"reformist\" camp are simply and clearly Red infiltrators and spies - their opposition to Badoglio's apolitical cabinet being the ultimate proof of this. We must not let these fifth-columnists weaken Sardinia, for the only effect of this will be invasion."
 SRD_the_special_laws: "The Special Laws"
 SRD_the_special_laws_desc: "Our current rule relies on a system of unspoken agreements, verbal contracts and parliamentary brokerings, a kind of rule that severely limits the power of his Majesty's government and therefore impairs its ability to contain the Red Hydra. With our recent major victories against the opposition, getting rid of all this bureaucratic junk and solidifying our - the Kingdom's stability will be as simple as the stroke of a pen."
 SRD_stack_the_senate: "Stack the Senate"
 SRD_stack_the_senate_desc: "The rapid centralisation of power our government has undertaken resulted in a number of Senators joining the ranks of the opposition. While we cannot purge them, we can simply ask the King to appoint more like-minded Senators to overcome this obstacle. As always, the Senate causes no crises."
 SRD_crush_the_miner_unions: "Crush the Miner Unions"
 SRD_crush_the_miner_unions_desc: "The miners' unions are nothing more than a way for the Syndicalists and other like-minded traitors to subvert our nation from within. This threat to King and Country cannot be allowed to persist."
 SRD_bolster_the_secret_services: "Bolster the Secret Services"
 SRD_bolster_the_secret_services_desc: "Amongst the Sardinian populace lie terrible snakes, traitors, disguised as loyal subjects of His Majesty and his Government. For the greater good of our nation, these rapscallions must be found and removed, and we will do just that by empowering and expanding the Military Intelligence Service."
 SRD_royalist_fervor: "Royalist Fervour"
 SRD_royalist_fervor_desc: "While many Sardinians may oppose our government, many more are willing to die for the King that stands on top of it. These are, in fact, the only true Sardinians, those who fight for the Kings that have wisely governed them for two hundred years. Cunservet Deus su Re!"
 SRD_maresciallo_a_noi: "Maresciallo, a Noi"
 SRD_maresciallo_a_noi_desc: "We, men of Marshal Badoglio, have taken full control of this nation. With the blessing of the King, we shall now move forth towards the reclamation of our homeland, for the glory of Italy and our Marshal. Maresciallo, a noi!"
 SRD_the_marshals_triumph: "The Marshal's Triumph"
 SRD_the_marshals_triumph_desc: "After so many years of struggle, having triumphed over every foe and friend that threatened his rule, the Marshal has finally done it. The Peninsula is his to command, to bring us forward in a new shining age."
 SRD_expand_cult_of_marshal: "Expand the Cult of Personality"
 SRD_expand_cult_of_marshal_desc: "Many love the Marshal, but there are also those who oppose him; of these, many can still be redeemed. Enormous propaganda campaigns will show our new subjects the greatness of the Marshal and his vision of Italy."
 SRD_crack_down_on_neo_syndicalists: "Crack Down on Neo-Syndicalists"
 SRD_crack_down_on_neo_syndicalists_desc: "In our new territories, many still hold dear the ideologies of the Socialist Republic and other breakaway anti-Italian states. This can't do. Special measures will be taken to crush these dangerous radicals."
 SRD_enshrine_church_collaboration: "Enshrine Church Collaboration"
 SRD_enshrine_church_collaboration_desc: "There is maybe only one entity in this country that is more powerful than our beloved King - the Catholic Church. We have had rocky relations with the Pope in the past decades; still, they have been opening to collaboration with us in the past years, and a few formal guarantees paired with the very existence of the Red Hydra will push them to our side."
 SRD_ensure_corporate_support: "Ensure Corporate Support"
 SRD_ensure_corporate_support_desc: "Many industrialists have fled Piedmont and other parts of Italy ruled by the Red Hydra, and currently reside in our Island. These rich and powerful industrialists and landowners are an extremely valuable tool towards our control of the nation; given our common Red enemy, convincing them to support us will be easy."
 SRD_the_king_commands: "The King Commands"
 SRD_the_king_commands_desc: "Having removed Badoglio from the picture, His Majesty's government may now go on, with the King's blessing, go forth with the reclamation of the Mainland. Avanti Savoia!"
 SRD_secure_the_government: "Secure the Government"
 SRD_secure_the_government_desc: "While we may have the blessing of the King in governing this nation, many still oppose our rule. Unfortunately, to ensure the stability of the Kingdom, strong methods will have to be used."
 SRD_end_the_state_of_siege: "End the State of Siege"
 SRD_end_the_state_of_siege_desc: "Since 1919, Sardinia has been governed without the consensus of an elected Parliament, with successive government relying on increasingly authoritarian \"temporary\" emergency measures. This will not stand; if we are to regain the trust of our people, a rapid transition back to democracy must be undertaken."
 SRD_free_and_fair_elections: "Free and Fair Elections"
 SRD_free_and_fair_elections_desc: "With key authoritarian figures removed, it is time to finally complete our return to democratic governance. A new electoral law will be approved (in spite of Liberal opposition), polling stations will be opened, parties will be allowed to organise a campaign. Sardinia will finally have her freedom, under the watchful eye of His Majesty."
 SRD_strengthen_democracy: "A Deal for Autonomy"
 SRD_strengthen_democracy_desc: "While Sardinian separatism remains a fringe view, most Sardinians feel that any Government ruling them from the Continent would return Sardinia to a status of rural, isolated backwater. To inspire trust in the Islanders, we will promise them some level of self-government once the Mainland is reclaimed."
 SRD_enforce_centralism: "Enforce Centralism"
 SRD_enforce_centralism_desc: "Some Sardinians may feel that our return to the Mainland would make Sardinia into some sort of second-class part of Italy. This is blatantly false, as Sardinia will always remain an integral part of the Realm and will enjoy investment and support as such."
 SRD_restore_parliamentary_supremacy: "Restore Parliamentary Supremacy"
 SRD_restore_parliamentary_supremacy_desc: "During our exile, the Chamber of Deputies lost much of its pre-war importance in policy making and governing, in turn eroding the constitutionalist apparatus we had enjoyed since 1848. This must be reversed, as Parliament and its elected members are the only true representatives of our People and only them may truly help advise our King in ruling our nation."
 SRD_restore_union_freedom: "Legalise the Miner Unions"
 SRD_restore_union_freedom_desc: "The issue of miner unions in Southern Sardinia has been a thorn on our side since the Exile began. We shall put an end to this useless strife, by fully legalising those Unions, provided of course they can prove themselves clean of revolutionary infiltrators."
 SRD_federate_unions: "Federate the Miner Unions"
 SRD_federate_unions_desc: "The issue of miner unions in Southern Sardinia has been a thorn on our side since the Exile began. We shall put an end to this useless strife, by fusing those unions into one big, federal union we can be sure is free of revolutionary influences."
 SRD_enact_women_suffrage: "Women's Suffrage"
 SRD_enact_women_suffrage_desc: "The issue of female suffrage first arose in 1912, when the right to vote was to be extended to women until then Prime Minister Giolitti reversed this decision to protect the interests of his bloc and describing such policy as a \"step too far\". More than two decades later, it's time to recognise that female suffrage isn't only not a step too far, but also a fundamental right that must be guaranteed."
 SRD_reform_senate: "Reform the Senate"
 SRD_reform_senate_desc: "Since 1848, the royally appointed Senate has theoretically been the counter-balance to the power of the elected Chamber of Deputies. However, there haven't been any truly absolutist minded monarchs since then, and the Senate has been reduced to rubber stamping any bill the Deputies pass. Talks of Senatorial reform towards a more democratic House have existed since at least 1911, but have never been put into effect; it's about time we finally changed that."
 SRD_tackle_land_reform: "Tackle the Agrarian Issues"
 SRD_tackle_land_reform_desc: "The power of the great landowners has never been truly challenged in Sardinia, and feudal practices still thrive in the isolated valleys of the Island. We cannot allow this to continue; through vigorous legislation we shall break up and redistribute the land, hopefully curbing these practices and increasing our support in those areas."
 SRD_legacy_sassari_brigade: "Legacy of the Sassari Brigade"
 SRD_legacy_sassari_brigade_desc: "During the Weltkrieg, the wholly Sardinian Sassari Brigade was one of the most valiant units of the Royal Army. Fighting for Italy and Sardinia in a land far away from their island, those heroic soldiers withstood terrible casualties and achieved successes few could match. We know all Sardinians share their spirit, and in our Home-Coming we will all chant, \"Forward Sardinia, Forward Together\"!"
 SRD_the_constituent_assembly: "The Constituent Assembly"
 SRD_the_constituent_assembly_desc: "The dictatorships of the 1920s have proved the Statuto Albertino to be outdated. With many eager new and young politicians willing to rewrite our Constitution to perfect our democratic system, perhaps it is time to finally retire the Statute."

 SRD_protect_the_family_desc: "Battered, ruined, but never destroyed - the family forms the most basic unit of our whole nation.

 SRD_for_the_progress_of_italy_desc: "With Italy united, the progress of the Country towards the future cannot stop.

 SRD_move_towards_federalism: "Move Towards Federalism"
 SRD_move_towards_federalism_desc: "A key promise of the parties forming the National Centre was federalism, in order to best govern the various parts of our nation. Centralism, as wanted by the radical Left and Right, will only cause conflict - a conflict we cannot afford."

 SRD_italian_irredentism_desc: "We may be close to reuniting Italy, but Italian lands are still in the hands of foreigners. The lands in their mountainous ares of Tyrol, and coastal areas in the eastern Adriatic remain outside of our grasp.

 SRD_fate_of_fiat_desc: "With Turin back in our hands, Edoardo Agnelli has claimed ownership of FIAT and is requesting to have it merged with his new Automobili Agnelli. While most in our government believe FIAT to be his rightful ownership in the first place, some believe that a merger would negatively impact competition, others argue that FIAT and Automobili Agnelli don't even share much in common now."
 SRD_autostrada: "Build the Autostrade"
 SRD_autostrada_desc: "Several abortive efforts to create civilian motorways were attempted during the interwar years, however none came to full fruition due to the ongoing chaos and division of the Italian peninsula.

 SRD_industralize_the_south: "Industrialise the South"
 SRD_industralize_the_south_desc: "Having reestablished control, we need to reintegrate the Mezzogiorno back into the greater Italian economy. Southern Italy has traditionally been a rural, agrarian region dominated by land-owning families and tight social bonds. As Italy fractured, their economy has oriented itself towards the Mediterranean. With great effort, Sofindit investment, and cooperation with local leaders, we will begin extensive construction projects to lift the region out of poverty."

As the ruins are rebuilt with modern designs, occupation replaced by civilian rule, and foreign economic investment slowly trickling in, Italy has begun to turn a new leaf. Industry and tourism have boomed and our culture has seen a renaissance. The economy is soaring, defying expectations that we would return to being the underbelly of Europe. The future, while still uncertain, finally looks bright."

 SRD_finish_the_diga_di_santa_chiara_desc: "The Diga di Santa Chiara was started all the way back in 1918 to provide Sardinia with the necessary electricity to power its industry. The Italian Civil War and the subsequent secession of Sardinia from the Italian Federation have seriously hampered funding. Furthermore, without the access to the wider Italian economy, the costs of finishing the project increased dramatically. 18 years later, the dam is finally near it's completion with only the protective layer missing."

With segments of our country in ruins, we must ensure an orderly recovery. The Società Finanziaria Industriale Italiana S.P.A.

 SRD_italian_industrial_finance_company_desc: "Not all of the companies we have invested in produce adequate dividends. A careful effort by the Ministry of Finance will restructure Sofindit subsidiaries and liquidate or consolidate companies not worth saving. Besides putting ailing companies out of their misery in a controlled fashion, this will inject some more liquid capital back into our pockets. If done right, we will balance the books while avoiding excessive deeply unpopular layoffs."

 SRD_ansaldo_contracts_desc: "Ever since the end of conflicts after the Weltkrieg, Ansaldo has been struggling to convert their war time factories into civilian use.

 SRD_automobili_agnelli: "Automobili Agnelli"
 SRD_automobili_agnelli_desc: "When the socialists took over Turin, they did not only steal all the factories from their rightful owner, but also the intellectual property.

The unavoidable reality is that we only have so many men that we can call upon for the army - however, there are women across the nation who are willing to fight for her defence.

 SRD_review_the_regio_esercito_desc: "In any potential war against the pretenders on the mainland, the task of liberation will fall on the Royal Army.

 SRD_the_new_bersaglieri: "The New Bersaglieri"
 SRD_the_new_bersaglieri_desc: "The Bersaglieri - \"sharpshooters\" - are an infantry corps with a long history, and whose role has changed much over the years. They have often focused on manoeuvre warfare, acting at different times as light infantry, skirmishers, shock troops, and even bicycle troops to fill this role, often taking a critical front-line position. They will likely play a large role in the wars to come - so we must make sure they are well-equipped."

 SRD_restore_the_sassari_brigades: "Restore the Sassari Brigades"
 SRD_restore_the_sassari_brigades_desc: "The Sassari Brigades - the 151st and 152nd Infantry Regiments - were all-Sardinian formations that served with distinction during the Great War. While Sardinians, by necessity, have composed an increasingly large portion of our army, reviving the Brigades and their local legacy might appeal to local Sardinians, and spur a much-needed recruitment drive."

 SRD_avoid_the_errors_of_the_great_war: "Avoid the Errors of the Great War"
 SRD_avoid_the_errors_of_the_great_war_desc: "As gallantly as the brave Italian soldiers may have fought during the Great War, the war's name still brings nothing but bitter memories for many Italians. Most absurd of our failures was sending a mere 120 artillery pieces to support 875,000 men, allowing the infamous General Cadorna to send countless countrymen to die for nothing. Never again - in the next war, our forces will have all the fire support they need."

 SRD_lessons_of_the_three_mountains_desc: "The nation of Italy boasts the oldest mountain infantry corps in the world - the Alpini, the legion of brave souls who heroically fought along the frozen Alps during the Great War. The Italian mountaineers have long been boasted as the best in the world, and it would bring shame to our nation if we did not hold them to the highest standards possible. It's time we looked more critically at their previous performance."

 SRD_supremacy_of_the_arditi_desc: "Of all the formations of the Regio Esercito, one name stands out above the rest - that of the Arditi, \"the Daring\". Formally known as the \"Assault Units\", they were among the first modern shock troops, bringing fluidity to a previously static war and carving their names into Italian legend with their exploits, despite our shameful defeat. They are examples for us all - our charge will be lead only by the best of the best, prepared specifically for their role. We accept no substitutes."

 SRD_create_mariassalto: "Create Mariassalto"
 SRD_create_mariassalto_desc: "We are faced with a problem that we cannot avoid - if we are to have any hope of defeating our enemies, it is certain that we will have to conduct large-scale naval operations. In order to manage this, we have been given advice from our Entente allies regarding ways to organise and utilise Mariassalto, formations dedicated to amphibious warfare. Particularly interesting are the proposals for \"frogmen\" infantry specialised in such operations - we will have to see what comes of that."

 SRD_reform_the_carabinieri: "Reform the Carabinieri"
 SRD_reform_the_carabinieri_desc: "The Carabinieri, another arm of the military dating back to before Italian unification, serve primarily as a military police force - a useful but largely auxiliary duty that has been somewhat overlooked during the long years of our exile. However, a campaign on the mainland would certainly need their services to maintain order in the recaptured land - thus, a doctrinal overhaul may be necessary to ensure their preparedness for this task."

 SRD_assault_vehicle_flotillas: "Assault Vehicle Flotillas"
 SRD_assault_vehicle_flotillas_desc: "While a man can swim across water, asking him to swim across the Tyrrhenian Sea is a large request, especially when in full combat gear. Luckily, such a thing is not necessary - designs for small manned craft, in the forms of torpedo \"chariots\" or motorboats, were drawn up first during the Great War, and now seem to be finding real life. Such craft have clear applications for amphibious commando raids, and interesting implications for the greater idea of naval landing craft."

 SRD_improvised_mobility: "Improvised Mobility"
 SRD_improvised_mobility_desc: "Manoeuvre is everything! That is the lesson of the Great War - if modern warfare is allowed to get bogged down, then unimaginable casualties may ensue in our attempts to break the stalemate. Especially in the mountainous terrain of Italy, our war must be fluid - the Bersaglieri used bicycles to enhance their mobility, while modern industrial methods open up the possibility of entire divisions moving by truck. All means must be available to us."

 SRD_red_cross_volunteer_nurse_corps: "Red Cross Volunteer Nurse Corps"
 SRD_red_cross_volunteer_nurse_corps_desc: "The Red Cross has a long history of humanitarian work during war times - during the Great War, they were heavily involved in treating battlefield casualties and looking after prisoners of war. In our current state on Sardinia, it is of the utmost importance that we recover as many wounded as possible, and facilitating Red Cross activities can help us cover deficiencies in our own medical capabilities."

 SRD_partisans_behind_enemy_lines: "Partisans Behind Enemy Lines"
 SRD_partisans_behind_enemy_lines_desc: "There are, even now, still people in Italy who believe in our cause over all others. These remaining loyalists present us with unique opportunities - while they may not be strong enough to carry out sustained insurgencies, they can conduct behind-the-lines recon to better track enemy formations and their movements. We can supplement this with our own infiltration tactics for even greater effect."

 SRD_reform_the_genio_militare: "Reform the Genio Militare"
 SRD_reform_the_genio_militare_desc: "The Genio Militare is the name for the Regio Esercito's engineer corps, whose origins trace back to the mining company of the Sardinian Army distinguishing itself at Turin in 1706. During the Great War, military engineers gained countless new tasks with the advent of modern war, and it's a safe bet to suppose that the next one will bring new challenges. The engineers must understand what their duties are."

 SRD_diaz_approach: "Diaz's Approach"
 SRD_diaz_approach_desc: "General Armando Diaz, famous for staging his heroic defence at Monte Grappa after Cadorna shamefully abandoned his troops, has advocated a rather novel doctrine for the Regio Esercito. Reasoning that the most important thing for us is that our men are loyal and motivated, Diaz's strategy focuses on reinforcing the camaraderie between the soldiers, as well as their commanders. They may not fight for the crown, but they will fight for each other."

 SRD_luxury_provisions: "Luxury Provisions"
 SRD_luxury_provisions_desc: "For all the glory attached to it, war can be a very miserable business. Conditions are often rough, and the nature of combat can weigh on even the strongest of souls. While a seemingly small thing to an outsider, even the smallest of luxuries can help bolster morale in trying times - by supplying our troops with chocolate rations and other special provisions, we can make their lives just a bit easier."

 SRD_hire_veteran_instructors: "Hire Veteran Instructors"
 SRD_hire_veteran_instructors_desc: "War does not always come naturally, and often needs to be taught - there is an alarmingly high number of ways for someone to get shot. The best teacher for a soldier is, invariably, another, older soldier - if we make an effort to keep old talent around, then they can hopefully impart some valuable wisdom to recruits who very dearly need it."

 SRD_reconstitute_the_royal_academy: "Reconstitute the Royal Academy"
 SRD_reconstitute_the_royal_academy_desc: "The Royal Academy of Modena, long rendered defunct, has historically been one of the premier schools in Italy for military thought alongside the academy in Turin. While the site of the academies are beyond our reach, some of the talent associated with it still floats in exile, waiting for a purpose. It's time that we reorganise the academy in exile, and turn its remnants towards the national liberation."

### Events ###
 srd.0.t: "The Kingdom of Sardinia"
 srd.0.d: "The Kingdom of Sardinia was born amidst the ashes of the Weltkrieg. King Vittorio Emanuele signed an armistice with the Austrian government in 1919, but furious socialists, radical nationalists and other rabble rose up against his government. He and his son abdicated, and in Sardinia, marked by few, King Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Aosta, assumed the throne. However, our pretensions to the Italian throne came to an end in 1920, when the Austrians forced the Italian Federation onto the united White forces in mainland Italy. The British forced us to join the Federation as the Austrians demanded, unwilling to anger the Germans in the aftermath of the most destructive war in European history. We withdrew from the Italian Federation in 1926 after the British Empire collapsed and the Austrians withdrew from Italy to deal with internal affairs, though our Entente allies still dissuaded from claiming all of Italy until Piedmont is reclaimed. This made us a nominally independent nation, though in reality we are almost a puppet state of the French Republic. \n\nThis sombre state of affairs is made no better by internal divisions at home. King Amedeo replaced his father Emanuele Filiberto as King of Sardinia just five years ago, and remains uninterested in the affairs of state, disappointing both the Democrats hoping for a royal intervention in favour of democratic reform and the military wanting to take full control in order to cleanse the Red Menace. This fundamental question, between authoritarianism and constitutionalism, has divided the island since the end of the Weltkrieg, and there is little doubt that the current arrangement is simply untenable. The fifteen-year-old state of emergency is growing tiresome to the Sardinian people, government corruption runs rampant, and the judiciary and government both require reform. These are problems without solutions under the current political deadlock, and without solving that, and them, Sardinia will never be able to take back what is rightfully hers."
 srd.0.a: "Long Live the King!"

### Political Events 1 - 10 ###

 srd.2.t: "Mining Monopolies Crash"
 srd.2.d: "After Black Monday, the many foreign companies controlling the coal mines in Southern Sardinia finally collapsed. The mostly British-backed monopolies had already been ailing for years, and it appears the German economic crisis was the last straw.\n\nThese mines have never really been profitable, but they are an important source of jobs in an otherwise stagnant and poor region; however, the foreign owners of these companies have often ignored the most basic issues of the local workers. This has often resulted in protests and strikes, that were crushed with great severity. In 1904, one such strike led to the Buggerru Massacre, which was widely condemned by Socialist forces.\n\nIn order to preserve the mines, the Bardanzellu Government has proceded with a nationalisation of the bankrupt companies; however, this move blew back severely, as the already striking workers began organising in unions in order to obtain various concessions from the State."
 srd.2.a: "Is the revolution coming?"

 srd.3.t: "The Resignation of Bardanzellu"
 srd.3.d: "Between 1919 and the death of Emanuele Filiberto in 1931 Sardinia was ruled by a string of military governments with heavy royal involvement, culminating in the Badoglio dictatorship between 1926 and 1931. Following his ascension, King Amedeo has instead taken a more parliamentary position, appointing a succession of civilian Prime Ministers to govern with the support of the main Sardinian parties and hoping they would be able to deal with the current dire situation. Nevertheless, even these civilian governments have used the fifteen-year-old state of emergency to rule with a relatively heavy hand.\n\nWith unrest among the miners of southern Sardinia growing, one of these civilian Prime Ministers, war veteran Giorgio Bardanzellu, has recently resigned; the King initially rejected this resignation, but without the cooperation of the Prime Minister no viable governing solution could be found. Given the frequency of resignations from the premiership, and the associated reputational damage, all viable civilian candidates have refused any offers to become Prime Minister, with many asking the King to appoint a military-led National Government.\n\nAs such, and in spite of his own wishes, the King will be forced to intervene directly, putting in his hands the ultimate fate of Sardinia, as military cliques start pushing for power. Many expect Marshal Badoglio to return to government, though the memory of his last dictatorship has led others to propose the politically much weaker (and, quite importantly, Sardinian-born) General Marras as another viable candidate.\n\nAppointing the autocratically-minded Marshal Badoglio to once again lead the Government will put us on a path towards a technocratic military dictatorship, bent on destroying the Socialist Republic and restoring His Majesty's rightful rule to the Mainland. The Marshal was, and will likely be, much more of a strongman than Bardanzellu ever was, and the Monarchy might be directed to reassert its influence over the executive.\n\nAppointing the relatively apolitical General Marras to lead a fresh Executive will instead increase the influence of the various reformists, who will certainly use the appointment of a politically weak technocrat as a tool to push for further democraticisation. Perhaps this is what the King intends to happen, or perhaps this is a move to increase his influence to the expense of the military clique that has, since the end of the war, become the main threat to the King's great influence in national politics."

### The absolute monarchy path 11 - 20 ###
 srd.11.t: "Strongarming the Government"
 srd.11.d: "Badoglio may have had his government restored, but many opponents remain on the loose, openly criticising his government and thus endangering the survival of our Kingdom. As stable governance is sorely needed right now, the Marshal has decided to flood the city of Cagliari with troops, using the powers granted by the state of siege to effectively incapacitate whatever remains of Parliament and start ruling by decree. Many are protesting the move in the streets across Sardinia; but not a word has come out of the Royal Palace, indicating that Badoglio may be here to stay."
 srd.11.a: "What comes next? Dictatorship?"

 srd.12.t: "The Special Laws before Parliament"
 srd.12.d: "The opposition has been all but destroyed, Parliament has been subdued; now, the Marshal is doing away with the vestiges of constitutional normalcy that allowed an end to his first dictatorship in 1931. These new emergency powers he is seeking to grant himself will effectively make Badoglio the absolute ruler of Sardinia; this, in spite of all the purges the country went through, gave some royally appointed Senators the courage to speak up against the Marshal.\n\nThis is an especially embarassing situation, as the Senate remains the basis of Royal political power; to go through the crisis we'll have to ask the King to appoint friendly Senators as is tradition, submitting our government to the King's authority in the process and setting a dangerous precedent; otherwise, we'll need to go through extralegal means to achieve a majority in the Senate, which will be a costly and damaging endeavour seeing the often great stature and many protections these Senators enjoy."
 srd.12.a: "Ask the King for a nudge"
 srd.12.b: "We can do this ourselves"

 srd.13.t: "The Last Step"
 srd.13.d: "Though we are extremely close to gaining full control of the nation, one great obstacle remains.\n\nThe King, to whom our Government must formally answer to, has been awfully quiet through the first months of Badoglio's new dictatorship, and royal power has grown unchecked. Neither supporting nor opposing our reforms, he has become a dangerous man, whose opposition could doom our whole project. Until today, it was not clear what his Majesty was plotting; this has changed now.\n\nThrough underground and backhand channels, the King has let it be known that he has asks for one thing in exchange for his support: a full guarantee of Royal power, and that the Marshal continue answering to him on all matters."
 srd.13.a: "Bow to the King"
 srd.13.b: "The Marshal is the true ruler of Sardinia!"

 srd.14.t: "By Order of the King"
 srd.14.d: "For the second time in recent memory, armed units are seen marching on Cagliari. This time, they are not acting on orders of the Badoglio Government; indeed, after securing the city and receiving confirmation that all military bases in the island have moved with them, the soldiers in Cagliari move onto the seat of the Marshal, Boyl Palace.\n\nShocked, Badoglio can only watch as his soldiers enter his building to arrest him. Shortly after, an officer informs him that the King has seen fit to appoint Admiral Thaon di Revel to head a new 'royal' government. Betrayed by all his peers, the Marshal is arrested and dragged to an unknown location."
 srd.14.a: "Marshal Badoglio, you're being relieved of duty"

 srd.15.t: "An End to the State of Emergency"
 srd.15.d.badoglio: "With the reconquest of the mainland and the final expulsion of Syndicalism from Italy, many have come to consider the mission of Badoglio's government fully successful and concluded. A new question now lingers: what happens next?\n\nIn spite of all promises, the Marshal is unlikely to let go of power that easily. After all, his Majesty's rule is still opposed by many enemies within and abroad, and we can't afford to show any weakness now.\n\nStill, the people of [SRD.GetNonIdeologyName] deserve to show their approval of Badoglio and his executive, and as such special laws have been put in place to ensure new elections are held regularly and give the correct results.\n\nWith all these precautions and many powers still otherwise bestowed on the Marshal, the perpetual state of siege has been declared redundant, and has been finally removed."
 srd.15.d.other: "With the reconquest of the mainland and the final expulsion of Syndicalism from Italy, many have come to consider the purpose of the Royal Government exhausted. As the old Admiral Thaon di Revel looks towards retiring from active politics, the question of what happens next lingers.\n\nWhile the King very much doesn't want an active part in this new government, making a restoration of democracy look plausible, many within the Liberal elite and the Military see a full blown democratic reformation as likely to give power to the very Syndicalists we so bitterly fought.\n\nAs such, provisions have been put in place to restore democracy under the old 1892 electoral law, itself an extension of the original 1860 basic law, in order to restore the democratic rights of the citizens of [SRD.GetNonIdeologyName] while preventing a takeover by hostile forces.\n\nThough opposed by some, the perpetual state of siege has as such been declared useless to the new [SRD.GetNonIdeologyName] and finally removed."
 srd.15.a: "Mission accomplished"

 srd.16.t: "The [GetYear] General Election"
 srd.16.d: "Today, [SRD.GetNonIdeologyName] has gone to the polls, to renew their confidence towards the Marshal and the King. As expected, the results see a smashing victory by Badoglio's National Bloc, further showing that the Marshal may govern by decree, but he does so with the confidence of the King's subjects.\n\nSome international observers and internal opponents contest that the election was neither free nor fair, showing \"proof\" of extensive rigging and scare tactics to ensure a victory in spite of an already extensively skewed electoral system. Of course, these wild accusations are nonsense fabricated by Syndicalist traitors and enemies of the Nation."
 srd.16.a: "A great victory for the National Bloc!"

 srd.17.t: "The [GetYear] General Election"
 srd.17.d: "Today, [SRD.GetNonIdeologyName] has gone to the polls, to renew the composition of Parliament[SRD.getConstituentAssemblyElections].\n\nThe main contenders of the election were of course the Liberals, though the historic division between conservative and progressive leaning blocs meant that, effectively, two factions had a shot to victory: the Rightist Liberals, more nationalistic and conservative and aligned to Confidustria, Confagricoltura and other such associations of industrialists and landowners, and the more progressive Leftist Liberals, more friendly to progressive causes, protectionists and in favour of compromise with the radical factions of Italian political life.\n\nSocialists and Catholics gained a worrying amount of votes, though our electoral laws ensured they only gained some marginal representation."
 srd.17.a: "The Right Liberals gain the majority!"
 srd.17.b: "The Left Liberals cling to victory!"

### The Democratic Monarchy Path 21 - 36 ###
 srd.21.t: "General Marras Lifts the State of Emergency"
 srd.21.d: "Though some political analysts expected this development, many were still surprised when General Marras announced today that the state of siege is to be lifted.\n\nIn spite of his relative political weakness, a lot of disillusioned Sardinians were expecting a return to dictatorship as news of the appointment of a commissioned officer as Prime Minister broke out. Instead, the first true step towards the restoration of democracy was taken, as the Government renounces the emergency powers it had been granted almost two decades ago.\n\nWhile no elections are scheduled yet, Marras has indicated that they're going to be called soon."
 srd.21.a: "Let's see if they're ready to fulfil their promises"

 srd.22.t: "A Call for Elections"
 srd.22.d: "Showing commitment to his earlier promises, today general Marras has asked the King to call for elections. Parties are to organise; in order to ensure the fairness of these elections, a campaigning period of three months has been declared.\n\nSome, especially in the Liberal camp, asked Marras to run for elections himself; still, the general has chosen to retire from active politics. This greatly weakened the Liberals, though they may still pull off surprising results; however, a victory of the Christian Democrats or even the Sardists remains far more likely."
 srd.22.a: "How liberating"
 srd.22.tt: "§YElections will be held in nine weeks§!"

 srd.29.t: "The [GetYear] General Election"
 srd.29.d: "For the first time since 1913, free elections have been held in our Country. Across the whole Island, Sardinians of all extractions flock to the polls to express their vote. Though many lists are running, only a few are expected to have a chance to dominate the new Parliament.\n\nOn the centre and the centre-right stand the Christian Democrats of the Sardinian Democratic Union. Moderates, they look towards finally bringing political catholicism to government after a long period of abstinence from politics. Overall popular among the populace, they're widely expected to become the biggest party in Parliament, though their internal divisions may make it possible for their Left Liberal allies to gain power with their support.\n\nOpposed to them stand the Sardists of the Sardinian Action Party; progressives and federalists, they hope to bring forward the recipe for a new Sardinia of equality and justice, and may still snatch a victory. However, they too are divided between the moderates and the almost Socialist leaning allies of Emilio Lussu.\n\nLastly, though their powerbase has collapsed since the last elections, the Rightist Liberals may still manage to exceed expectations and cause great havoc."

After several rounds of negotiations, two government solutions have been found: either the UDS allies the Liberals, or the Sardists join the Centrists to form a National Government. With strong politicians like Antonio Segni pushing for a Centre-Right government and interparty talks with the Sardists slowly grinding to a halt, a Democratic-Monarchist coalition seems likely, but both compromises are still feasible."

After congratulating them on their impressive victory, his Majesty and the two honourables discussed a possible governing solution. The first choice for Prime Minister seems to be the moderate Bellieni; but even the openly republican Lussu seems to have a chance."

What effect this will have is unlikely to be seen in the short term, though we can't know for sure what this will cause in a few decades."

 srd.35.d: "With the reclamation of the Mainland completed and the government bodies moving out of Cagliari, many feel it is time to finally grant Sardinia the autonomy it was promised.\nHowever, the political situation has certainly changed since then. With the integration of many more territories into the Kingdom, mainlander politicians both in the right and in the far left are pushing in favour of remaining with our current centralist model of government. It is not certain whether this new Autonomy Bill will pass; should it not pass, we can expect Sardinia to erupt in anger at our failure to acknowledge its right to self-government after doing so much for our King and our Nation."

 srd.37.d: "Our move towards finally reuniting Italy has had a profound effect on the wider political sphere. Our mainly Sardinia-based parties have again come into contact with other organisations operating from different parts of the Country, including underground parties from the former Socialist Republic; in the new environment, many small regional movements have fallen into irrelevancy. The main parties, instead, have rapidly adapted.\n\nThe now former Sardinian Democratic Union managed a merger with the various catholic organisations operating in the Socialist Republic and the People's Party, going on to form the Christian Democrats; the Liberals have rapidly reunited with their brethren around the country, uniting many left liberals under a new Italian Liberal Party.\nOn the other side of the aisle, the Sardinian Action Party has reorganised under Lussu's direction, becoming simply the Action Party and incorporating many other progressive, federalist and even republican movements.\n\nItalian politics have gone through another earthquake, but it seems that the more things change, the more they stay the same."
 srd.37.a: "Hopefully, this is for the better."

 srd.38.d: "Ever since its formation, the new Action Party has been a force of the Left, friendly enough towards the causes of the Socialist Republic to be branded as \"crypto-socialists\" by the rightist opposition.\n\nIt appears this accusation wasn't completely unfounded; after months of talks with the quietly refounded Socialist Party, a fusion agreement has been reached. In spite of token moderate opposition, the new Italian Socialist Labour Party has been founded, spearheaded by Lussu and other figures of the former Socialist Republic, as well as various republicans, federalists and progressives."

 srd.39.t: "Moderates Split from the Labour Party"
 srd.39.d: "The dream of reconstructing the wide Socialist Party of old has come tumbling down in the last weeks. While the reunification was spearheaded by the Sardist and Federalist Emilio Lussu, many federalists and sardists were no socialists, like Bellieni, or had abandoned Socialism even before the Weltkrieg. As such, it was no surprise when this extremely moderate wing left the party and joined with other progressive liberal organisations to form a new Democratic Social Party; [SRD.getFarmersChances].\n\nOne notable event during the split was the heartfelt speech in favour of socialist unity given by Socialist activist and former SRI politician Sandro Pertini; he may have a bright future ahead."

 srd.41.d: "Though forced to intervene in national politics in the years since he assumed the throne, king Amedeo hadn't enjoyed the gilded cage of Kinghood and appeared to miss the days he spent working in a soap factory in the Congo. With the country finding itself at war, some started wondering what the point of fighting to reconquer a Kingdom for a King who didn't wish to rule it was. In a most intriguing manner, the King managed to wash away those dangerous doubts.\n\nDefying a great number of military and political conventions, Amedeo appointed his brother Aimone as Lieutenant of the Kingdom and managed to reach the frontlines. However, unlike former king Victor Emmanuel, he didn't simply go there to visit the troops; he went there to join the fight for the future of Italy and the World together with his soldiers.\nThere were some formal problems with the King, theoretically Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Army, rejoining the military ranks in the field of battle; but those were quickly smoothed out.\nTogether with his men, and in spite of the pleas of the Government urging for the safety of the Head of State, his Majesty took part in a number of daring operations into enemy territory, coming back undefeated. The 'King's Men', led by their 'Iron King', have already gathered something of a reputation; some look to them as the successors of the legendary Third Army, undefeated during the Weltkrieg, while it was led by his Majesty's very father."

 srd.42.t: "The Corsican-Sardist Action Pact"
 srd.42.d: "Having united the island of Corsica with our domains, the local community initially stood idle, analysing the new political situation under their new King. But today, after many weeks of negotiations, there has finally been a political breakthrough in the northern Island. In fact, this breakthrough involves both Corsica and Sardinia itself.\n\nSince its foundation, the Corsican Action Party considered itself the sister party of the Sardinian Action Party, with which they shared their autonomism (though from France instead of Italy). Today, the party leaders Petru Rocca and Emilio Lussu have announced the formation of an Action Pact between the two parties, effectively solidifying them into a single autonomist bloc.\nThis was no obvious development; the Corsican Actionists are much more right-leaning and pro-Italian than their Sardist counterparts, something both the Corsicans and the left wing of the Sardinian Actionists saw as a roadblock to potential unification. \n\nStill, these concerns were smoothed over in the last weeks, though they made an outright fusion of the two parties impossible. With the entry of the Corsican autonomists into the larger [SRD.GetAdjectiveCap] political life, another unredeemed land is finally and fully returned to her Fatherland."

 srd.43.d: "With the reconquest of the Mainland, we have come across the vast establishments of the FIAT automotive empire.\n\nIn the years of Socialist rule, the colossus has been reshaped into an entity completely controlled by the Government, which provided many of the vehicles the Socialist Republic needed in order to wage war.\n\nIn the meantime, the Agnelli family, former owners of the plant, worked to rebuild their empire in Sardinia, founding the Automobili Agnelli company which helped our own efforts in the conflict.\n\nAs we return, the Agnelli family seems to expect us to allow a merger between their new firm and the wider FIAT, with them at the helm. Of course, there is always the option to keep FIAT under our direct control and trim the Agnelli empire in the process."

Learning from the dictatorships of the 1920s, multiple clauses have been added to ensure a democratic order is always kept, no matter the situation.\nThe new constitution will not be granted by the King, but will emanate its authority from the people of Italy. Of course, the position of his Majesty, by the grace of God and will of the nation King of Italy, isn't threatened.\n\nThe new Constitution is expected to be granted royal assent in the coming weeks."

With constituencies being redrawn and many seats added, there are popular calls for new elections, to determine the future of the Nation.\n\nDue to the many different political realities that have emerged in the last twenty years, it is clear the deputies elected will have the task of overhauling and replacing the old Statuto Albertino, a task many eager new men are willing to take on."

 srd.46.t: "The Two Marshals"
 srd.46.t: "With most of the power concentrated in the hands of our Marshal Pietro Badoglio and his clique of followers, it would seem that no element stands in the way of glory for our nation, whether in the form of naive and idealistic democrats, socialist terrorists, or even our King, who has more than once doubted the abilities of his devoted servant and Prime Minister. Close to our nation stands our long-time allies in the legitimate French government, who have also experienced a true renaissance led by the infallible Marshal Philippe Pétain, the hero of Verdun and fighter against socialism in all its forms. In fact, many ideological elements are shared between our nation and the French one, whether it is nationalism, the importance of the preservation of the family, the protection of the most deprived of our citizens, but above all the cult around our two Marshals, who on the occasion of numerous meetings in Sardinia or in Algiers have expressed their respect and their mutual admiration.\n\nA difference between the two of us lies in the fact that the ideology of the Lion is more officially defined, under the name of 'National Revolution', allowing an increase of the national cohesion and of the French stability. Some members of our cabinet have therefore advised the great Badoglio to declare our own "Rivoluzione Nazionale" in order to enjoy the same benefits and to bring us closer to our French allies, although some have noted that to do so would be a mistake, making us look weaker than them. The final choice rests solely in the hands of our Marshal."

 POLITICS_AMADEO_SAVOY_DESC: "For the longest time, Amedeo of Savoy-Aosta kept out of national politics. The would-be King wasn't interested in the affairs of state, or the day-to-day administration of the Country; instead, much like all other Dukes of Aosta, he spent his early years going through a rigorous military education, first in Britain and then in Naples. In 1915, the then 16-year-old royal joined the Army on the Alpine front as a corporal, and fought his way into becoming a captain. With the end of the war, he was initially forced to follow his father to Cagliari.\n\nHowever, instead of studying the specifics of Sardinia, Amedeo was fascinated by the ancient lands and cultures of Africa. Deeply uninterested in the political affairs of the Island, he spent much of the 1920s in the jungles of the Congo with his uncle the famous Duke of the Abruzzi, leaving Sardinia in the hands of Marshal Badoglio and only coming back once the health of his father had begun to falter.\n\nNow on the throne, Amedeo remains as brave and bright as any seasoned explorer, though he retains his aversion to politics; some say these characteristics are those of a great general, but it is uncertain whether they are those of a great King."

In 1915, the then 16-year-old royal joined the Army on the Alpine front as a corporal, and fought his way into becoming a captain. With the end of the war, he was initially forced to follow his father to Cagliari.\n\nHowever, instead of studying the specifics of Sardinia, Amedeo was fascinated by the ancient lands and cultures of Africa. Deeply uninterested in the political affairs of the Island, he spent much of the 1920s in the jungles of the Congo with his uncle the famous Duke of the Abruzzi, leaving Sardinia in the hands of Marshal Badoglio and only coming back once the health of his father had begun to falter.\n\nNow descending upon the battlefield to fight with his soldiers like he did in the Weltkrieg, King Amedeo's reputation as a fearless explorer has now evolved and morphed into that of a fearless soldier, fighting on the field for the Country upon which he reigns 'by the Grace of God and will of the Nation'. Some initially questioned the truthfulness of this reputation, though a number of daring actions made this view marginal at best. Others say this is just an inventive way to escape from the duties of kinghood; this may well be true, but his people don't seem to care quite enough as their Iron King rides into battle to defeat the enemies of the Nation."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_FULBERT_YOULOU_DESC:0 "Abbé Fulbert Youlou has risen to become the first President of an independent state in the lands of the former French Congo. Born in 1917 and training to become a priest from a young age, this devout Catholic has increasingly evolved both a love for free market capitalism, economic liberalism, and conservative nationalism, and over the course of his young political career, Youlou has espoused a deeply anti-socialist sentiment that has grown to deeply anger the far more Socialist-orientate Northern regions of the nation. Now, this holy-man turned national father serves as the bastion of anti-leftist thought in the Tshuapa Clique, with his rule supported by a junior officers clique from the nation’s newly formed military, which has been created from the ashes of the former Franco-German colonial administration."
POLITICS_PEDRO_VII_DESC:0 "The current Manikong, Pedro VIII do Congo, has reigned since 1923 as king of the Benikongo, though only recently has he physically taken a seat on his rightful throne. Forced into exile due to the German’s control of his homeland, this true African king has lived abroad in São Salvador in Angola, awaiting for his moment to reclaim his rightful throne, and Mittelfafrika’s collapse has provided just such a moment.Heavily supported and financed by Portugal and receiving direct aid from the Iberians through Angola, the Manikongo’s forces are surprisingly well armed for tribal rabble. Under their king, these fierce and savage waves of native troops wage war to conquer the former lands of the Kingdom of Kongo, claiming the kingdom owed to him by birthright as the most direct living heir to the last sovereign Manikongo."

cog.1.d:0 "Portugal, our former colonial overlord, which dethroned us and kicked us out of our ancestral home of Mbanza Kongo, now demands us to bend the knee. In return, we will be granted our capital back, in addition to the region of Cabinda. If we refuse, it's almost certain they will issue a declaration of war."

POLITICS_PEDRO_VII_DESC:0 "The current Manikong, Pedro VIII do Congo, has reigned since 1923 as king of the Benikongo, though only recently has he physically taken a seat on his rightful throne. Forced into exile due to the German’s control of his homeland, this true African king has lived abroad in São Salvador in Angola, awaiting for his moment to reclaim his rightful throne, and Mittelfafrika’s collapse has provided just such a moment.Heavily supported and financed by Portugal and receiving direct aid from the Iberians through Angola, the Manikongo’s forces are surprisingly well armed for tribal rabble. Under their king, these fierce and savage waves of native troops wage war to conquer the former lands of the Kingdom of Kongo, claiming the kingdom owed to him by birthright as the most direct living heir to the last sovereign Manikongo."

### Ideas ###
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea:0 "Reliance on Portugal"
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea_desc:0 "For many decades, the Manikongo and the Portuguese have cooperated, bringing Christianity and Western customs to our Kongo. In exchange for allowing them to extract our land’s resources and to use our people for labor, we have gained their protection and their aid. However, the current Manikongo has long chafed under this uneven deal, slowly losing patience with his colonial ‘allies’, and many feel as though this partnership is not fated to last."
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea:0 "Claims of Greatness"
KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea_desc:0 "We are the heirs of the Kongo Kingdom, and the one, true, and rightful lords of the vast Congo. However, most do not recognize this claim, especially given our weakened state, both unconnected from the heartland of our territory in northern Angola and separated from our kin in Bas-Congo. We must reclaim this destiny, though we will likely be forced to work with the Portuguese in order to achieve it."

cog.1.t:0 "Portuguese Demand the Manikong to Bend the Knee"
cog.1.d:0 "Portugal, our former colonial overlord, which dethroned us and kicked us out of our ancestral home of Mbanza Kongo, now demands us to bend the knee. In return, we will be granted our capital back, in addition to the region of Cabinda. If we refuse, it's almost certain they will issue a declaration of war."
cog.1.a:0 "Our survival in these trying times is more important than our pride."
cog.1.b:0 "We will meet them in battle!"

<<<<<<< HEAD
cog.2.t:0 "Kongo accepts"
cog.2.d:0 "The Manikong has accepted our offer and submitted, bringing peace to his lands. In return, we will allow him to keep his German equipment and personnel, with a large degree of autonomy. Now, however, Portugal can finally claim ownership of the Congo."
cog.2.a:0 "Welcome back!"
=======
kog.2.t:0 "The Manikongo’s Request"
kog.2.d:0 "with his situation secured, the manikongo has requested the return of his ancestral homeland in northern angola. Through tacit support from the colonial office in Luanda, the Manikongo of the Kingdom of Kongo, Pedro VII, was able to quell resistance and assert his rule across the Middle Congo. As our two nations continue to build upon an alliance that has lasted for centuries, the Manikongo has formally requested the return of the regions of Cabinda and the kingdom’s former capital of São Salvado to the Kongo Kingdom in exchange for the Kingdom’s continued patronage."
kog.2.a:0 "We shall grant the Manikongo’s request!"
kog.2.b:0 "This isn’t necessary."

kog.3.t:0 "Portugal Accepts!"
kog.3.d:0 "After much deliberation between our diplomats and the colonial administration in Luanda, Portugal has honored their commitments to our Kingdom and has agreed to our offer. In a lavish ceremony, Portugal formally returned the lands of Cabinda and the historic capital of M’banza-Kongo back into the Manikongo’s domain. Previously residing in the former capital simply as an heir to a defunct kingdom, the Manikongo has returned to M’banza-Kongo as a hero, being greeted by a large crowd of his new subjects."
kog.3.a:0 "Hooray!"

kog.4.t:0 "Peace with the Kongo?"
kog.4.d:0 "Wishing not to strain the Entente’s relations with Portugal, a historic ally of the British, we have been asked to call off our campaign to bring order to the French Congo. Algiers has demanded that we must at the very least accept a ceasefire with the Kongo Kingdom or face heavy sanctions from the Entente and her allies."
kog.4.a:0 "French support is vital. We must accept"
kog.4.b:0 "To hell with Portugal! The French Congo is ours!"

kog.5.t:0 "M'ba Refuses Peace!"
kog.5.d:0 "Despite diplomatic pressure and sanctions from the French government in Algiers, the madman M'ba has refused to open up any discussion of a treaty between Gabon and our kingdom. We must ready our forces for as M’ba has vowed to bring the entirety of the French Congo under his despotic rule."
kog.5.a:0 "The war rages on."

kog.6.t:0 "The Wayward Bakongo"
kog.6.d:0 "In the weeks following the collapse of the Kivu Clique, thousands of former freedom fighters have fled the Congo, fearing reprisals by the new government. One such location is our very own kingdom, where refugee camps have swelled with former soldiers and their families. These exiles centered around the leadership of Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who has used his control over the Alliance des Bakongo to provide a voice for these Kivu refugees. Kasa-Vubu and ABAKO have quickly gained momentum among the populace, using their pro-Bakongo message to reform their alliance within the Kingdom. Fearing a possible takeover by these revolutionaries, many conservative chieftains have proposed expelling these refugees and banning such organizations that have formed within the kingdom. What decision shall the Manikongo make?"
kog.6.a:0 "Allow Kasa-Vubu and ABAKO to continue operating."
kog.6.b:0 "Ban this organization and send these revolutionaries packing!"

kog.7.t:0 "The Rising Star"
kog.7.d:0 "The Manikongo’s decision to allow ABAKO to continue operating has allowed Kasa-Vubu and his party to grow substantially within the kingdom. With Kasa-Vubu’s monumental rise in the kingdom, he has grown bolder in his ambitions to influence local politics. ABAKO has already established local chapters across the countryside and their pro-Bakongo rhetoric has seen their membership numbers swell in urban centers. Most recently, a group of ABAKO aligned governors have petitioned that Kasa-Vubu should be granted a seat within the Manikongo’s royal court to better represent the growing ABAKO party and the displaced Kivu refugees. This petition has caused an uproar among the royal court, who fear that Kasa-Vubu is plotting to seize power, and he should instead be granted a limited role within the government to appease Kasa-Vubu and his supporters."
kog.7.a:0 "Grant Kasa-Vubu and his followers token positions."
kog.7.b:0 "Allow him a place in our court!"

kog.8.t:0 "ABAKO Unseats the Council!"
kog.8.d:0 "In the weeks following Kasa-Vubu’s ascension into the Manikongo’s court, the ambitious young general was able to quickly consolidate his power within the kingdom. Unable to compete with the ABAKO party machine, the kingdom’s tribal structures quickly fell apart, with local chiefs being either bribed or replaced by those loyal to Kasa-Vubu. The twelve tribal advisors within the Manikongo’s court were quickly filled with loyalists and ABAKO members, relegating the Manikongo to nothing more than a mere figurehead. With Kasa-Vubu’s rule secured, the young general is now free to finally realize his unique vision for the Congo, and more importantly, the Bakongo people."
kog.8.a:0 "They stood no chance."

kog.9.t:0 "The Question of our ‘Partnership’"
kog.9.d:0 "The drums of war often do not steadily beat - we find ourselves overextending ourselves in both supplies and manpower while our enemies continue to see success after success on a daily basis. We are unfortunately left with two options: to procure war material and manpower through harsher measures within the Kingdom or sacrifice our sovereignty to Lisbon in exchange for much-needed, crucial support."
kog.9.a:0 "Our destiny lies with Portugal - Avante!"
kog.9.b:0 "The Manikongo bends to no one!"

kog.10.t:0 "The Fate of our Royal House"
kog.10.d:0 "With the last remnants of Western colonialism swept away, our Kingdom of the Kongo now stands as a proud stronghold of African traditions and independence. However, many within the Royal Court have called the current monarchy into question regarding their complicity in collaborating with the Portuguese government, and have even called the current monarchic structure and the current king to be mere pretenders, seeing them to be a remnant of colonialism to be swept away. Now, the many tribes across the lands that we now call home must decide which direction our tribal kingdom shall proceed. The first option is to ignore these perhaps false statements, and retain the current governing arrangement of a confederation of tribes under the Manikongo. The second option is to sweep away our former tribal structures and establish an absolute hereditary monarchy under the House of Água Rosada. The third option, and perhaps closest to our tribal roots, is to embrace our unique non-hereditary structure of elected Kings. And finally, we could instead lean towards supporting local chiefs, while empowering local councilors and perhaps establishing something similar to Western parliamentarism, all the while not losing sight of our own tribal identity. No matter which direction we choose, the Kingdom of the Kongo will remain a bastion of African tribal traditions and stability, amidst the dangerous fires of colonialism, radicalism and revolution that has engulfed Africa."
kog.10.a:0 "Retain our current government structure."
kog.10.b:0 "Pivot the councilors and establish an absolute monarchy."
kog.10.c:0 "Fully embrace our non-hereditary tradition."
kog.10.e:0 "Lean closer into our tribalist roots."

kog.11.t:0 "A New Manikongo?"
kog.11.d:0 "After displacing the former Portuguese-backed pretenders and centralizing his power throughout the realm, Kasa-Vubu has secured his power over the Kingdom of the Manikongo. With his grip on the Kingdom absolute, the scheming minister will now decide to use his position to call an election of a new monarch as per the traditions of the Manikongo, but with the councilors all in his pockets, being replaced by ABAKO members in the process of displacing the loyal retainers of the old monarch. And such, this election is little more than a formality for Kasa-Vubu, a long time claimant to the title of King of the Manikongo, to seize the throne he always wanted. However, not all within the Kingdom are pleased to see the aging Manikongo Pedro VII being replaced by this young upstart, and perhaps, restoring the old man to the position of King might be beneficial in placating the more conservative tribes of the Kingdom. No matter which option we choose, the ABAKO’s hold over the Kongo Kingdom is absolute, and our future of an united, semi-constitutional kingdom under the righteous rule of the Manikongo is secured."
kog.11.a:0 "Glory to Kasa-Vubu, the new Manikongo!"
kog.11.b:0 "The old man still has use for us."

kog.12.t:0 "The Distinction of Kongolese Catholicism and Syncretic Christian Faiths"
kog.12.d:0 "First arriving on our shores shortly after the first Portuguese explorers landed here back in 1483, Catholicism has left a deep mark on the Kongo. From the likes João I, who in 1491 became the first Manikongo to freely adopt the Catholic faith as his own, to Beatriz Kimpa Vita and her Antonine Sect of 1704 which professed that God was Kongolese and that their founder Donna Beatriz was possessed by Saint Anthony of Padua, all without denying the authority of the Pope while infusing Catholicism with our own local culture and beliefs before being burned at the stake regardless for her perceived heresy in the biased eyes of the eurocentric Roman Catholic Church, the Christian faith has been on quite the odyssey here over the centuries, ever embroiled in a battle between those who would see us bow fully to European styles of faith, and those who would adapt the faith to fit our local reality and history. Even with non-Catholic groups, such as the Baptist-based Kimbanguists that have captured the hearts and minds of many modern Bakongo, the influence of Christianity and this endless struggle between eurocentrism and afrocentrism is felt everywhere.\n\nThough some still obey and cling to the old faiths of our ancestors, the native Bukongo faith, many more still have attempted to fuse these old beliefs into the modern Christian-Catholic reality, with the idea that the Bukongo’s multitude of lesser gods and spirits translate to the many saints and angels of Christianity, while the one true Christian God above is likened to the Bukongo creator deity Nzambi a Mpungu while his female counterpart Nzambici the Sky Mother is likened to Mother Mary, adding in and translating other native Bukongo beliefs and practices to Christian analogues along the way, while others like the Kimbanguists moreso lean towards directly adapting Christian doctrine into an afrocentric lens as they dictate that Kimbangu and his family are the reincarnations and avatars of the Christian Trinity while also professing that these Biblical figures were always Black. Whatever the case, these afrocentric takes on the Christian faith, from Donna Beatriz to the modern fusings of Bukongo and Catholicism, are one of our biggest tools to resist the ‘eurofication’ of the Kongo, so we must support these various strands and offshoots as best we can, such as through funding, official support from our administration, and through the revitalization of both these local offshoot faiths and native-european fusions as well as to the Kongolese Catholic Church at large as we work to stave off the oppressive influence and domineering actions of the Roman Catholic Church and the Portuguese Church."
kog.12.a:0 "Our faith is our own!"

kog.13.t:0 "The Revival of the Order of Christ"
kog.13.d:0 "Though the Imperial Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ, or the Kongolese Kingdoms own Catholic knightly order, has existed in some form or another since 1607 when the Portuguese first brought the Order of Christ to our shores, it has largely decayed over the centuries, especially after its power and influence were severely truncated in 1914, when Portugal shifted it from a National Order, holding sway over the entire Kongolese Kingdom, to a largely powerless arm of the defanged monarchy as a House Order following the failed Kongo Revolt of 1914 and its aftermath in 1915 onwards which saw the Manikongo himself largely reduced to a powerless and puppeted facade in service to the colonial regime. However, with the Manikongo’s loyalty to the Portuguese and to the Roman Catholic Church proudly reaffirmed, government and Church officials from Lisbon and Rome have allowed us to reinstate the Order of Christs as a full National Order once again, giving it the power, funding, prestige, and international backing to command respect once again!\n\nWith a pious ceremony being held to commemorate the occasion, which itself was dedicated both to the current Manikongo [ROOT.getleader], to João I, the first Manikongo to openly embrace the Catholic faith all the way back in 1491, and to Álvaro II, the Manikongo who first founded the order back in 1607, the Imperial Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ has once again risen to defend the faithful of the Kongo Kingdom. Along the way, we shall also revitalize the other Catholic knightly order that operates in our kingdom, the Order of Saint James of the Sword, further rooting us to the Roman Catholic Church and the light of the one true God, while our re-empowered Sobas - the unique knightly rank of our orders meaning ‘chief’ usually made up of local clan leaders and other pious elders and soldiers - shall defend the faith here on the Congo forevermore."
kog.13.a:0 "We true knights of the Congo and God shall never falter again."

kog.14.t:0 "The Tunis Connection"
kog.14.d:0 "Centuries ago there lived a prince of Kongo named Henrique, son of Afonso I, who became a Catholic bishop and was granted the title of the Bishopric of Utica in Tunisia by the Pope himself. According to  Italian explorer Filippo Pigafetta’s 1591 work ‘The Kingdom of the Kongo and the Surrounding Regions’, which itself was written from the older notes of Portuguese explorer Duarte Lopes, Prince Henrique was born in Nsundi in 1495, being the son of Afonso I who was acclaimed Manikongo in 1509. Shortly afterwards, King Afonso I sent many of his children and other nobles to study in Coimbra, Portugal so that they may aid him in modernizing the kingdom. Among those sent included his own son Henrique, who was sponsored by the Portuguese king Dom Manuel I himself. On May 5, 1518, at the age of 24, the prince was elevated by Pope Leo X in Rome as Bishop of Utica, in present-day Tunisia, thus Henrique of Kongo became the first known bishop from central Africa in history since the first black African bishops which date back to ancient Nubia and Axum during the first centuries of Christianity. However, he never received the bishopric since it was only titular, since Tunisia at the time was dominated by Muslims. In 1521, Henrique returned to Kongo and was appointed governor of Mpangu, a province of the Kingdom, where would continue to serve in the Christianization of the kingdom until his death 10 years later.\n\nAlthough Tunis is still dominated by Muslims to this day, their stranglehold on the wider region is nothing close to what it used to be thanks to the expansion of European colonial powers guided by Christ’s light. With Henrique robbed of his rightful Bishopric all those years ago, we are well within our Christian right to reclaim this land as our own, for the Pope himself mandated it as so. With this all in mind, should we march to reclaim Henrique’s post at the Bishopric of Utica by leading a Christian crusade to conquer Tunis from the heathens, or should we leave Utica to rot with those dreaded Mohammedans?"
kog.14.a:0 "Utica is Kongolese by right of God and the Pope. Begin the Crusade!"
kog.14.b:0 "Oh, not in Utica, no. It's an Albany expression."
kog.14.c:0 "Have you seen a map? We aren’t marching all the way up there."

kog.15.t:0 "Cultural Ties to the New World"
kog.15.d:0 "Across the Atlantic, in places like Palomares, Brazil and Mururata, Bolivia, there are diasporic communities of Kongo people that established their own kingdoms and settlements modeled on our own Kongo Kingdom and the rule of our elective Manikongo in the wake of the Triangle Trade system as the slaves it stole away from our homeland adapted to their new surroundings while holding onto their pasts as best they could, taking in Portuguese and Spanish influences along the way when necessary. Additionally, in places like Brazil with the Candomble Bantu, Cuba with Palo, and Jamaica with Kumina, Kongo diasporic populations have also created their own syncretic faiths that fuse Kongo religious teachings with various New World and Christian ideas depending on the location. This trans-Atlantic cultural connection is even seen in Brazil’s own Engolo and Capoeira fighting styles, both of which have Kongo-Bantu roots, showing that even across time and space, we Kongolese are and always will be connected. With our kingdom now stabilized and our new course set, we must also begin to reach out to these far-flung kin of ours to ensure that the Kongo are never separated ever again."
kog.15.a:0 "From the Kwango and Pool Malebo to the Amazon, we shall always be one!"
kog.15.b:0 "I hear Jamaica and Cuba are nice this time of year. Let us set sail!"

kog.16.t:0 "Kongo Wishes to Join our Faction"
kog.16.d:0 "We have received a delegation from the Kingdom of Kongo requesting to join our alliance. The Manikongo's kingdom has recently engaged in a war to reclaim the lands of the former Belgian Congo. With their victory, the vast natural resources of the Congo now lie in the domain of the Manikongo and their inclusion into our faction could greatly expand our influence in Africa. What should we do?"
kog.16.a:0 "They are welcome!"
kog.16.b:0 "We don't need them."

kog.17.t:0 "Negotiations Fail"
kog.17.d:0 "The [Root.GetName] has refused to grant us entry into their faction, it's not like we needed them anyways."
kog.17.a:0 "Damn."

kog.18.t:0 "A Pink Map of Our Own?"
kog.18.d:0 "Decades of Portuguese colonial ambitions and influence have somehow managed to seep into equally ambitious minds within the upper echelons of our government. Given the circumstances that we no longer find ourselves burdened by any devotion to Lisbon - there is no reason why we shouldn’t ease the burdens of the ailing Portuguese colonial empire through the “transfer” of Mozambique, Angola, and any connecting territories."
kog.18.a:0 "We will paint the map as we please!"
kog.18.b:0 "It’s too much of a risk to take..."

kog.19.t:0 "A New Banner for our Realm?"
kog.19.d:0 "With Pedro's triumph over the Congolese pretenders, we must now choose which flag we shall fly in the Manikongo’s new realm. Some have proposed that we should use Pedro VII’s coat of arms, first issued to Afonso I by the Portuguese, as our national banner. More traditionalist chiefs have suggested that we use the flag that was designed by Franciscan monks for Garcia II, a fiercely independent king who opposed the Portuguese in Angola. Some reformist thinkers have advocated that we modernize our current flag with a saltire that includes the coat of arms in the middle. Some however, don't see a need for change and we should continue to use the flag that has been in use for centuries."
kog.19.a:0 "Use the Manikongo's coat of arms as our flag."
kog.19.b:0 "Adopt the flag used during the reign of Garcia II."
kog.19.c:0 "Modernize our current flag with the coat of arms."
kog.19.e:0 "We shall keep our current flag."

kog.20.t:0 "The Kimbangu Connection"
kog.20.d:0 "A long time follower of the Church of Jesus Christ on Earth by His Special Envoy Simon Kimbangu, Kasa-Vubu has promoted Kimbanguism heavily within our nation. Through his endorsement and promotion, especially through Albert-Joseph Kasongo Wa Kapinga, a major educator and ABAKO who was known for being Kimbangu’s educator, the word of the Prophet Kimbangu has been spread across the kingdom, while tightening the bonds between the Church and the ABAKO. And now, with the Prophet’s blessing, the local militias who have sworn loyalty to the Kimbanguist creed, led by Simon-Pierre Mpadi, have been integrated into the army and governing structures following our takeover of regions with large Kimbanguist influence. And such, we have seen an upsurge in sympathies for this religion even within our government structures. While this is welcoming news, we could perhaps further our ties with the Church by officially announcing Kimbanguism as state religion, while promoting certain high ranking members of the Kimbanguist church who have proven themselves to prominent positions, especially the Prophet’s offsprings who are all prominent members of the ABAKO party, intertwining the religion and the state itself. What will be our decision?"
kog.20.a:0 "A new religion for a truly African kingdom."
kog.20.b:0 "Kimbanguism shall be imbued within our government."

kog.21.t:0 "An Appeal to Lisbon Over the Pink Map"
kog.21.d:0 "With our loyalty to the Portuguese reaffirmed and with our internal situation stabilized, many within our council have pushed for the Manikongo to ask for the rest of our rightful land in Angola back as well as for administrative control over Portugal’s other central African colonies like Mozambique as well as the rest of the land in between in what constitutes their Pink Map idea of a Portuguese dominated south central Africa. Although the Portuguese likely won’t want to cede with their precious Pink Map, the situation in other places in their empire such as Europe and Asia have only grown more tenuous and dire, while we have the African front largely under control. They’d be able to keep the prestige of their massive colonial empire alive while shifting the dirty work of direct administration over to us if they so agree, but should we even ask?"
kog.21.a:0 "Petition Portugal for the Pink Map!"
kog.21.b:0 "Leave it to the Tugas."

kog.22.t:0 "The Loyal Kongolese Ask for Control of Our African Colonies"
kog.22.d:0 "Our loyal colonial subjects within the Kongo Kingdom have petitioned our colonial office, seeking to ask the Crown directly if they would cede administrative duties and de facto control of our ‘Pink Map’ colonies around Angola, Mozambique, Cabinda, and the land inbetween to the Manikongo, while we would maintain de jure control, keeping our prestige and empire intact in the eyes of the rest of the West. This would allow us to better focus on the European front and our other colonial possessions like those in Asia while still receiving all the boons and bounties of Africa, all without the headache of directly administering the Dark Heart ourselves. However, many colonial zealots within our cabinet decry the idea as a capitulation to native savagery and barbarism. What shall we say?"
kog.22.a:0 "Cede administration of the African colonies over to the Manikongo."
kog.22.b:0 "Deny such a laughable request."

kog.23.t:0 "The Portuguese Decline the Kongolese Pink Map"
kog.23.d:0 "Expectedly, the Portuguese have declined our request to run the Pink Map territories for them. It would seem that our territorial ambitions in Central Africa have come to an end, at least for now."
kog.23.a:0 "We should have seen this coming..."

kog.24.t:0 "The Portuguese Cede the Pink Map to Us!"
kog.24.d:0 "Unexpectedly, the Portuguese have accepted our request to run the Pink Map territories for them. As we speak, the lands of Angola, Cabinda, Mozambique, and beyond are all being officially prepared for our Kingdom to take over direct control of the local governments, and although we are all still part of the wider Portuguese Empire, the once-Dark Heart of Africa is nigh entirely ours now to do with as we please, so long as we keep sending resources and riches back to Lisbon and Rome."
kog.24.a:0 "An empire of our own shall grow in the heart of Africa!"

### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_PEDRO_VII_DESC:0 "The current Manikongo, Pedro VII do Congo, has reigned since 1923 as king of the Benikongo, though only recently has he physically taken a seat on his rightful throne. Forced into exile due to the German seizure of his homeland, this true African king has lived abroad in São Salvador in Angola, awaiting for his moment to reclaim his rightful throne, and Mittelfafrika’s collapse has provided just such a moment. Heavily supported and financed by Portugal and receiving direct aid from the Iberians through Angola, the Manikongo’s forces are surprisingly well armed for tribal rabble. Under their king, these fierce and savage waves of native troops wage war to conquer the former lands of the Kingdom of Kongo, claiming the kingdom owed to him by birthright as the most direct living heir to the last sovereign Manikongo."

### Ideas ###
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea:0 "Reliance on Portugal"
KOG_reliance_on_portugal_idea_desc:0 "For many decades, the Manikongo and the Portuguese have cooperated, bringing Christianity and Western customs to our Kongo. In exchange for allowing them to extract our land’s resources and to use our people for labor, we have gained their protection and their aid. However, the current Manikongo has long chafed under this uneven deal, slowly losing patience with his colonial ‘allies’, and many feel as though this partnership is not fated to last."

KOG_claims_of_greatness_idea_desc:0 "We are the heirs of the Kongo Kingdom, and the one, true, and rightful lords of the vast Congo. However, most do not recognize this claim, especially given our weakened state, both unconnected from the heartland of our territory in northern Angola and separated from our kin in Bas-Congo.

### Revolt Tree ###

KOG_manikongo_proclaimation:0 "The Manikongo's Proclamation"
KOG_manikongo_proclaimation_desc:0 "Exiled by the German forces, Pedro VII, the Manikongo, had spent the duration of his reign living in São Salvador. The Manikongo was able to amend the Kingdom’s relationship with Lisbon, receiving funding and support to help destabilize Mittelafrika. With the fall of the colonial order, Pedro VII returned to his homeland, proclaiming himself the rightful king of the Bakongo, but these celebrations were cut short. The Manikongo finds his people besieged on all sides, the maniacal Leon M’ba seeks to return French rule to the Congo and the Anziku have launched an invasion to seize the local capital of Brazzaville. The Manikongo must effectively lead his people through the storm if he is to restore glory to his kingdom."
KOG_raid_german_armories:0 "Raid German Armories"
KOG_raid_german_armories_desc:0 "With the German order in Äquatorialafrika retreating to their colonial holdout in Kamerun, their hasty departure had left behind only the remains of their rule. Barracks that once swelled with the ranks of the Askari had been left to the vultures. Securing these abandoned stockpiles of weapons and ammunition will be invaluable in our fight for survival."
KOG_against_false_despots:0 "Against False Despots"
KOG_against_false_despots_desc:0 "Along the coast in Gabon, the corrupt Leon M’ba seeks to expand his kleptocracy at the expense of his own people. In the northeast, the ‘republicans’ of the Tekeland Clique are led from the shadows by the demented she-witch Ngalifourou. Known to all as the ‘woman of the whites’, the Anziku queen wages war only to sell her own people. These tyrants have waged war against the Bakongo only to appease their French masters and return the Middle Congo to their rule."
KOG_question_lisbon:0 "Our Relationship with Lisbon"
KOG_question_lisbon_desc:0 "While the Manikongo has remained loyal to Lisbon, his recent arrival in Kongo has raised doubts about any continued ‘cooperation’. While a strong European ally would be beneficial towards retaining our independence, the scars left during the revolt of 1914 are still prevalent among the Bakongo, who are distrustful of the Portuguese. The shadow of Portugal looms over the Kingdom, and Pedro must decide whether to continue our close relationship with Lisbon or set forth a new path for the Kingdom."
KOG_request_portuguese_arms:0 "Request Portuguese Arms"
KOG_request_portuguese_arms_desc:0 "While we have made do with the arms from our initial expedition and the rifles we obtained from the German stockpiles, we find ourselves outgunned by our enemies who have received a steady flow of weapons from their French backers in Algiers. We will ask our allies in Lisbon to provide us with modern rifles to replace our German antiques and turn the tide of battle."
KOG_angolan_cacadores:0 "Call Upon the Caçadores"
KOG_angolan_cacadores_desc:0 "The Caçadores, or hunters, are among the elite of the Portuguese armed forces. Famed for their expert sharpshooting, these light regiments were recently reformed to protect Portuguese colonies against foreign raids and have helped retain order in the Ultramar. With the war against the maniacal M’ba and the Anziku still raging, we shall ask the colonial government in Luanda to provide us with an elite regiment to aid us in our struggle."
KOG_rally_the_homeland:0 "Rally the Homeland"
KOG_rally_the_homeland_desc:0 "In our battle against the tyrants who would hope to crush our people, we have suffered heavy casualties that are proving difficult to replace. To help fill our ranks, we shall use these figures to call upon our Bakongo kin who reside around the Congo Basin to join us in our fight for survival. We will call upon Bakongo elders to provide us with much needed reinforcements and appeal to those who are in the service of the remnant Force Publique to defect and join us in our crusade to save their own people rather than the profits of their colonial overlords."
KOG_assert_independence:0 "Assert our Independence"
KOG_assert_independence_desc:0 "A deviation from his previous stance towards cooperation with the Portuguese, the Manikongo has taken an assertive stance. Leaning into the Bakongo nationalists and tribal leaders, the Manikongo has begun to revoke previous treaties made with the Portuguese, ending his vassalage to Lisbon and ruling as a true sovereign monarch. While the colonial office in Luanda is outraged by the Manikongo’s betrayal, his new subjects have begun to rally behind their King."
KOG_manikongo_authority:0 "The Authority of the Manikongo"
KOG_manikongo_authority_desc:0 "No nation holds a greater claim to the lands along this basin apart from the Kingdom of Kongo. As opposed to these kleptocrats and pretenders who have waged war against us, the Manikongo, Pedro VII, descends from a line of dutiful elected chiefs from a Kingdom whose influence can be traced back nearly five hundred years. Our Kingdom made dealings with the great powers of Europe and the Papacy and dominated trade within the Congo Basin. With the fall of the colonial order in Africa, we shall rise once again to dominate these lands under the rule of the Manikongo."
KOG_push_against_teke:0 "Assault Against the Anziku"
KOG_push_against_teke_desc:0 "The people living under the ‘Tekeland Clique’ are hopelessly led by a disorganized cabal locked in a power struggle. Torn between republican demagogues, socialists, and the shaman queen of the Anziku, this unstable polity only exists to return the whole of the Middle Congo to French oppression. To bring an end to this chaos, we shall lead a final and decisive campaign along the Congo River. The Anziku had once been vassals of our Kingdom, it’s time we remind them of that fact. "
KOG_peace_with_the_madman:0 "Peace with the Madman?"
KOG_peace_with_the_madman_desc:0 "While our warriors have fought bravely against the Gabonese, there appears to be no end in sight to this conflict as the frontlines grind to an utter halt. Being sparsely populated with our Bakongo kin, military occupation could greatly destabilize our kingdom and potentially incite another revolt. By utilizing Portugal’s connections to the powers of the Entente, we shall work to broker peace between our Kingdom and the Republic of Gabon."

### Political Tree ###

KOG_between_two_worlds:0 "A Kingdom Between Two Worlds"
KOG_between_two_worlds_desc:0 "As the fires of war fade over the lands that we now govern, it seems that the Manikongo has finally found peace in the chaos of Mittelafrika’s collapse. And yet, there remain forces that lurk in the shadows, from the Portuguese who hungrily eye our domain, to the remnant dissidents of the North who remain resolute in their opposition. Even within the Royal Court, there remains a divide between those who want to return to Portugal’s embrace, and those who want to tear down the legacy of Portuguese dominance, for a true nation free from colonialism no matter what. As these shadows circle around us, the final decision lies with our King Pedro, for he shall decide where our newly independent kingdom will stand. Will we return under Lisbon’s gaze once more, or do we refuse the former colonials, for a true Kingdom for the Manikongo free from colonialist vultures?"
KOG_portuguese_patronage:0 "Continued Portuguese Patronage"
KOG_portuguese_patronage_desc:0 "The King has made his decision, that our Kingdom shall continue its cooperation with Portugal, citing our long and storied history under Lisbon’s protection, and how its legacy still influences our people and kingdom today. As such, they have proven themselves to be a reliable partner with the Manikongo, and our Kingdom shall reach out to Lisbon and reconnect former ties with our former benefactors, in exchange for their patronage and assistance in building our nation."
KOG_integralist_influences:0 "Luso-Integralist Influences"
KOG_integralist_influences_desc:0 "In the past decades, the Catholic political currents of Europe have been greatly affected by the ideals of integralism pioneered by Charles Maurras and his Action Française. The ideals of integral nationalism calls for an organic, decentralized state that greatly empowers both the church and the monarchy. In Portugal, the rise of Integralismo Lusitano in the 20’s had permeated throughout the empire, making it no surprise that such ideas have arrived within the Manikongo’s court as well. Seeking to draw closer to our Portuguese allies, Pedro VII has begun reforming the kingdom along integralist philosophies, whose ideals of highly decentralized provinces are not dissimilar to how our kingdom has already operated for centuries."
KOG_legacy_of_afonso:0 "Legacy of Dom Alfonso"
KOG_legacy_of_afonso_desc:0 "Afonso I, the sixth Manikongo and the son of João I was truly one of the first devout Catholic converts who helped spread Catholicism across the kingdom and fostered close political ties to Portugal. While many including his father shied away from their new faiths shortly after the arrival of the Portuguese, Afonso was one of the few who remained constant to his newfound devotion - even proclaiming it as the sole reason he defeated his half-brother in a succession crisis after João’s death. Through collaboration with Portugal and our strong Catholic faith, our Kingdom has survived and flourished - we must continue in his legacy to gain further success."
KOG_portuguese_labor:0 "Provide Kongolese Labor"
KOG_portuguese_labor_desc:0 "Due to our close relationship with Portugal and our relative position to its ultramarine provinces, a plan has been proposed between both the Portuguese and Kongolese governments for a mutually beneficial plan to aid each of our developing economies in their colonial empire and within our beloved country. The people of the Kongo will be given opportunities for labor in both nearby Portuguese possessions such as Angola or Mozambique, and as far as Sao Tome. While some anti-colonial and nationalist voices argue that this is the equivalent of modern-day slavery and is binding the stability of the nation’s economy to that of Portugal’s, the benefits of an overseas working-class population sending home remittances to their families here in the Kongo will significantly aid our economy!"
KOG_church_of_kongo:0 "Catholic Church of the Kongo"
KOG_church_of_kongo_desc:0 "From the first arrival of Portuguese missionaries on our shores, the Kongo people were quick to embrace the Christian faith. Through the guidance of the pious Manikongo, Afonso I, the Catholic faith was intertwined within our kingdom, with the church serving an important role in civil service and education. Through our faith we found ourselves on equal footing with the great powers of Europe, bringing our Kingdom closer to Rome through pious princes being ordained as bishops and Kongo diplomats negotiating for the return of Kongo slaves. We shall greatly expand the powers of the clergy to serve as a guide for our kingdom during such turbulent times."
KOG_foreign_studies:0 "Send our Sons Abroad"
KOG_foreign_studies_desc:0 "The seeds of the modern Kingdom of Kongo were planted several centuries ago through the Portuguese abduction of natives and nobles with their arrival on our shores. While they may have been hostages, the education and experience gained through their role as indigenous ambassadors highlighted the importance of this collaboration between Europe and our Kingdom. The fifth Manikongo, João I, understood this and had sent many of his principal nobles and sons to study and learn under Portugal. We shall follow in their stead and send our sons abroad to educate a new generation!"
KOG_traditionalist_revival:0 "Traditionalist Revival"
KOG_traditionalist_revival_desc:0 "Our alignment with the Portuguese has cost us dearly in our political realm! Rumors have arisen of discontent nobles who dare plot against the Manikongo with potential German backing due to the fears of the Kingdom becoming nothing more than a puppet to Portugal. Seeking to squash these rumors, the Manikongo will firmly entrench the kingdom in its tribalist roots and disavow any strings to Lisbon to ensure our sovereignty."
KOG_bakongo_practices:0 "Promote Bakongo Practices"
KOG_bakongo_practices_desc:0 "While the Kongo Kingdom was quick to embrace Catholic teachings, these ideas were heavily infused with our native Bakongo faith. With the Manikongo’s recent push towards a tribalist stance, our government has sought to promote Bakongo traditions while still honoring our adherence to Christianity. Syncretic sects such as Antonianism and the more recent Kimbanguist church shall be embraced as an alternative to the foreign missionaries who have long held a stranglehold over both our kingdom and our faith."
KOG_tribalist_structures:0 "Embrace Tribalist Structures"
KOG_tribalist_structures_desc:0 "Heeding the words of Bakongo nationalists and local chiefs, the Manikongo has cast aside the European style of governance that is utterly incompatible with our people and has instead chosen to embrace our traditional style of government. Pedro’s court shall be organized around the twelve of his closest advisors that will help guide the Manikongo and his kingdom. The governors of local provinces will retain a high degree of autonomy over their respective regions. Our standing army and police forces will be assembled by local chiefs on their merit and bravery rather than the corrupt mercenary armies or conscripted forces of our rivals. Through these sweeping reforms we will return to our roots while cultivating a government that is tune with the needs of our people."
KOG_masters_of_the_basin:0 "Masters of the Congo Basin"
KOG_masters_of_the_basin_desc:0 "For centuries our strategic location at the mouth of the Congo Basin has allowed our kingdom to control the flow of trade between the European powers and the vast riches of the Congo. During this time we profited greatly from the trade of ivory, gold, copper, and slaves. With alternative overland routes being restricted by the chaos that has engulfed the entire continent, we will use our advantageous position to facilitate trade with the great powers of Europe as we had done before."
KOG_fate_of_monarchy:0 "Fate of the House of Água Rosada"
KOG_fate_of_monarchy_desc:0 "Unlike traditional monarchies, the title of Manikongo is not hereditary. A new Manikongo is instead chosen through an election by the king’s chief advisors. Pedro VII, our Manikongo, is head of the House of Água Rosada, a noble Kongo family who have ruled for the last two centuries. While we have honored our unique traditions, the Manikongo has grown concerned about the numerous pretenders to our throne, who might attempt to seize power and hand our kingdom back to the Portuguese or Germans."
KOG_native_universities:0 "Nativist Education Under our Faith"
KOG_native_universities_desc:0 "Before the arrival of the Portuguese, education was provided by a series of schools tied to the Bakongo faith. Derided as secret societies by the Portuguese, these elite schools were used for training the youth in the ways of civil service and medicine. While these schools such as Kimpasi, Kinkimba, Buelo, and Lemba were open to anyone, the rigorous initiation ceremonies reserved these schools to the brightest minds in the kingdom. With our kingdom’s revival of Bakongo culture, we will greatly increase our support funding for these native schools and lighten the initiation rites that are required to attend these schools."
KOG_deal_for_mbanza_kongo:0 "Negotiate for M'banza-Kongo"
KOG_deal_for_mbanza_kongo_desc:0 "Our cooperation with the Portuguese has borne great fruits for both nations. However, one problem still persists in regards to the regions that formerly belonged to the Bakongo. For centuries, under Portuguese patronage, our kingdom thrived in the regions that are now known as M'banza-Kongo and Cabinda, at least until its violent abolishment in 1915 by the Portuguese, driving us to these Northern regions. However, with our renewed and more equal relationship, perhaps a renegotiation with our benefactors for our ancestral capital is in order, returning the rightful rule of the Bakongo over these lands after so long."
KOG_claims_of_greatness:0 "Claims of Greatness"
KOG_claims_of_greatness_desc:0 "The region that is now known as Central Africa by the colonialists was once ruled by proud kings, only to lose to those damned colonialists, either through treachery or through the bayonet. But now, as the grip of colonialism loosens and the carcass of Mittelafrika continues to burn, we stand as a bastion of order and tradition in Africa, free from colonialism and false notions of ‘progress’ from the Western-educated intellectuals and colonialist stooges. With our independence solidified, our Kingdom looks outwards, into the chaos around us. In the steps of great empires of Africa, with the leadership of our dear King of the Manikongo, we shall assert our independence by bringing our rule over the regions of the Congo Basin and Angola, bringing the weary peoples under our wise governance. The ambitions of the Bakongo shall not be hindered, neither by power hungry colonialists, traitorous republicans and whatever elements that oppose us."
KOG_our_lost_brethren:0 "Recover our Lost Brethren"
KOG_our_lost_brethren_desc:0 "While our kingdom initially held a monopoly over the slave trade, war and internal conflicts saw the Manikongo’s protection over his subjects weaken as European traders began to circumvent our laws and sold free Kongo men and women as slaves. During this period, our Kingdom’s influence waned as millions of people from the Congo Basin were captured and sold in the Americas. An ocean away from their homeland, these slaves brought their culture to the New World and some escaped slaves had created their own communities. Known in Brazil as Quilombos or ‘war camps’, these escaped slaves lived in the hinterlands and often relied on raids against colonial settlements to survive. The largest of these communities was the Quilombo dos Palmares, led by Nganga Nzumba, the son of a Kongo princess. With the Manikongo’s realm secured, we shall undertake a near herculean task, the unification of the Kongo’s lost sons and daughters in the Americas."
KOG_afro_bolivian_ties:0 "Afro-Bolivian Ties"
KOG_afro_bolivian_ties_desc:0 "The remote village of Mururata in Bolivia is both the center of the Afro-Bolivian community and home of its very own king, Don Bonifacio Pinedo. Their first king, Uchicho, was a Kongo prince who was believed to be the son of the Manikongo. Identified by the royal markings on his skin, Uchicho was crowned by the slaves as their king and their royal family has served as ceremonial rulers for the Afro-Bolivians for over a century, overseeing important religious ceremonies as well as resolving marital affairs within the community. Seeking to expand our royal house, we shall expand our rule into the mountains of Bolivia to both empower our kin and establish a cadet branch with the distant House of Pinedo."
KOG_mouth_of_the_congo:0 "Seize the Mouth of the Congo"
KOG_mouth_of_the_congo_desc:0 "To the south of our kingdom lies the city of Leopoldville. Known as the crown jewel of the Congo, this colonial capital has largely stayed out of the conflict, watching from the sidelines as they control the flow of information and trade to the rest of the Congo. To control this crucial trade route and reunite with our Bakongo brethren in Bas-Congo and Northern Angola, the Manikongo has laid preparations for a campaign to liberate Leopoldville and seize this crown jewel for ourselves."

### Kasa-Vubu ###

KOG_kasavubus_redoubt:0 "Kasa-Vubu's Redoubt"
KOG_kasavubus_redoubt_desc:0 "The collapse of the Kivu Clique had led to its former revolutionaries fleeing abroad to escape imprisonment by the new regime that had seized the Congo. One such exile is Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who has led the remnants of the ABAKO to seek refuge in the Kongo Kingdom. With his back against the wall, the politically savvy Kasa-Vubu was able to quickly outmaneuver the archaic tribal structures within the kingdom, rising to become the chief minister to the Manikongo himself. A committed modernizer and Bakongo nationalist, Kasa-Vubu seeks to reform the antiquated Kongo Kingdom into a prosperous, modern nation that serves the needs of his people."
KOG_embrace_nationalist_faiths:0 "Embrace Nzambi a Mpungu's Light"
KOG_embrace_nationalist_faiths_desc:0 "The Kongo Kingdom is well known for its quick embrace of Christianity under the rule of Afonso I. While Catholicism has become ingrained within the region for centuries, foreign missionaries have allowed Portugal to keep the kingdom under their thumb. Seeking to drift away from these lingering European influences, the ABAKO leadership has fully embraced the syncretic faiths that have flowed through the Congo tributary. In addition to promoting the Bakongo faith that is native to our people, Kasa-Vubu has fostered ties with the emerging Kimbanguist church that has spread rapidly throughout Leopoldville and the greater Bas-Congo."
KOG_capitalist_reforms:0 "Institute Capitalist Reforms"
KOG_capitalist_reforms_desc:0 "While ABAKO was founded to further the interests of the Bakongo people, we were able to enjoy a wider array of support among the Congolese people through our promotion of moderate capitalist reforms and infrastructure initiatives. Both rural and urban populations would benefit greatly through our reforms that would bring electrification and clean water to remote villages and a complete renovation of our largest cities. While we were never able to implement these reforms, our consolidation of power in the Kongo Kingdom will provide us with a clean slate to introduce these reforms to our Bakongo people."
KOG_enshrine_bakongo_nationalism:0 "Enshrine Bakongo Nationalism"
KOG_enshrine_bakongo_nationalism_desc:0 "It has long been Joseph Kasa-Vubu’s goal to promote and further the aims of his native Bakongo people. His unwavering stance towards supporting the Bakongo and admiration for the Kongo Kingdom had put him at odds with other Kivu revolutionaries and even ABAKO’s founder, Edmond Nzeza-Nlandu. With Kasa-Vubu’s ascension within the Manikongo’s court, he has found himself free to pursue policies that solely benefit the Bakongo people. No longer having to appease the hundreds of ethnic groups that inhabit the vast Congo basin, Kasa-Vubu and ABAKO have worked tirelessly to promote a nationalistic, pro-Bakongo identity in all aspects of society."
KOG_crush_portuguese_influence:0 "Crush Portuguese Influence"
KOG_crush_portuguese_influence_desc:0 "For centuries, the noble Kongo Kingdom found itself at odds with their so-called Portuguese ‘allies’. While the misguided kings of the past extended their hands in friendship to Lisbon, they were met with civil strife, broken alliances, and the sale of millions of slaves that brought the once proud kingdom to its knees. While the Manikongo and his men fought tooth and nail to restore his rightful kingdom in the fires of Mittelafrika’s collapse, the colonial office in Luanda sat idly by, waiting to hand over their stipulations of continued vassalage. With Kasa-Vubu’s rule secured, we shall drive out the remaining Portuguese sympathizers and nationalize the parasitic companies that have exploited our people for centuries."
KOG_abako_constitutionalism:0 "Constitutionalism Under the ABAKO"
KOG_abako_constitutionalism_desc:0 "Entrenching itself over the archaic structures of the Manikongo’s court, ABAKO has quickly engulfed the tribal government and has paved the way for a modern government. Through our reforms, Kasa-Vubu has reshaped the centuries old Kongo Kingdom into a constitutional monarchy that is fit to serve the needs of the Bakongo people. A new constitution has been drafted that protects our Bakongo people, faith, and culture under the watchful eye of ABAKO. While some decry ABAKO cementing its power into a ‘one party state’, the nascent political scene in the Manikongo’s domain has made our alliance the only formal political party in the region, and we intend to keep it that way."

### Events ###
kog.1.t:0 "Between Two Worlds"
kog.1.d:0 "With the Gabonese routed and the invasion by the Anziku quelled, Pedro VII now finds himself as the undisputed sovereign of the Middle Congo. Once ruling as the heir to an abolished kingdom, the Manikongo has worked tirelessly to relieve the toll caused by these destructive wars for the hundreds of thousands of subjects he now rules over. Such responsibilities have caused the Manikongo to reflect greatly on how he must guide his people. In a similar situation to the Manikongos who have ruled before him, he must choose whether to continue the kingdom’s long standing relationship with Portugal. With a lack of local alliances and the fear of an invasion by a hostile foreign power, the Manikongo has considered returning to the fold with Lisbon as a loyal vassal. Conversely, the animosity towards the Portuguese following the revolt of 1914 is still felt strongly among the Manikongo’s new subjects, and the Manikongo has considered cutting all diplomatic ties with Portugal and ruling as an unfettered sovereign of the Kongo."
kog.1.a:0 "Portugal is our sole ally, we must not turn our backs on them"
kog.1.b:0 "The Manikongo shall walk his own path."

kog.2.t:0 "The Manikongo’s Request"
kog.2.d:0 "with his situation secured, the manikongo has requested the return of his ancestral homeland in northern angola. Through tacit support from the colonial office in Luanda, the Manikongo of the Kingdom of Kongo, Pedro VII, was able to quell resistance and assert his rule across the Middle Congo. As our two nations continue to build upon an alliance that has lasted for centuries, the Manikongo has formally requested the return of the regions of Cabinda and the kingdom’s former capital of São Salvado to the Kongo Kingdom in exchange for the Kingdom’s continued patronage."

kog.2.b:0 "This isn’t necessary."

kog.3.t:0 "Portugal Accepts!"
kog.3.d:0 "After much deliberation between our diplomats and the colonial administration in Luanda, Portugal has honored their commitments to our Kingdom and has agreed to our offer. In a lavish ceremony, Portugal formally returned the lands of Cabinda and the historic capital of M’banza-Kongo back into the Manikongo’s domain. Previously residing in the former capital simply as an heir to a defunct kingdom, the Manikongo has returned to M’banza-Kongo as a hero, being greeted by a large crowd of his new subjects."
kog.3.a:0 "Hooray!"

kog.4.t:0 "Peace with the Kongo?"
kog.4.d:0 "Wishing not to strain the Entente’s relations with Portugal, a historic ally of the British, we have been asked to call off our campaign to bring order to the French Congo. Algiers has demanded that we must at the very least accept a ceasefire with the Kongo Kingdom or face heavy sanctions from the Entente and her allies."
kog.4.a:0 "French support is vital. We must accept"
kog.4.b:0 "To hell with Portugal! The French Congo is ours!"

kog.5.t:0 "M'ba Refuses Peace!"
kog.5.d:0 "Despite diplomatic pressure and sanctions from the French government in Algiers, the madman M'ba has refused to open up any discussion of a treaty between Gabon and our kingdom. We must ready our forces for as M’ba has vowed to bring the entirety of the French Congo under his despotic rule."
kog.5.a:0 "The war rages on."

kog.6.t:0 "The Wayward Bakongo"
kog.6.d:0 "In the weeks following the collapse of the Kivu Clique, thousands of former freedom fighters have fled the Congo, fearing reprisals by the new government. One such location is our very own kingdom, where refugee camps have swelled with former soldiers and their families. These exiles centered around the leadership of Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who has used his control over the Alliance des Bakongo to provide a voice for these Kivu refugees. Kasa-Vubu and ABAKO have quickly gained momentum among the populace, using their pro-Bakongo message to reform their alliance within the Kingdom. Fearing a possible takeover by these revolutionaries, many conservative chieftains have proposed expelling these refugees and banning such organizations that have formed within the kingdom. What decision shall the Manikongo make?"
kog.6.a:0 "Allow Kasa-Vubu and ABAKO to continue operating."
kog.6.b:0 "Ban this organization and send these revolutionaries packing!"

kog.7.t:0 "The Rising Star"
kog.7.d:0 "The Manikongo’s decision to allow ABAKO to continue operating has allowed Kasa-Vubu and his party to grow substantially within the kingdom. With Kasa-Vubu’s monumental rise in the kingdom, he has grown bolder in his ambitions to influence local politics. ABAKO has already established local chapters across the countryside and their pro-Bakongo rhetoric has seen their membership numbers swell in urban centers. Most recently, a group of ABAKO aligned governors have petitioned that Kasa-Vubu should be granted a seat within the Manikongo’s royal court to better represent the growing ABAKO party and the displaced Kivu refugees. This petition has caused an uproar among the royal court, who fear that Kasa-Vubu is plotting to seize power, and he should instead be granted a limited role within the government to appease Kasa-Vubu and his supporters."
kog.7.a:0 "Grant Kasa-Vubu and his followers token positions."
kog.7.b:0 "Allow him a place in our court!"

kog.8.t:0 "ABAKO Unseats the Council!"
kog.8.d:0 "In the weeks following Kasa-Vubu’s ascension into the Manikongo’s court, the ambitious young general was able to quickly consolidate his power within the kingdom. Unable to compete with the ABAKO party machine, the kingdom’s tribal structures quickly fell apart, with local chiefs being either bribed or replaced by those loyal to Kasa-Vubu. The twelve tribal advisors within the Manikongo’s court were quickly filled with loyalists and ABAKO members, relegating the Manikongo to nothing more than a mere figurehead. With Kasa-Vubu’s rule secured, the young general is now free to finally realize his unique vision for the Congo, and more importantly, the Bakongo people."
kog.8.a:0 "They stood no chance."

kog.9.t:0 "The Question of our ‘Partnership’"
kog.9.d:0 "The drums of war often do not steadily beat - we find ourselves overextending ourselves in both supplies and manpower while our enemies continue to see success after success on a daily basis. We are unfortunately left with two options: to procure war material and manpower through harsher measures within the Kingdom or sacrifice our sovereignty to Lisbon in exchange for much-needed, crucial support."
kog.9.a:0 "Our destiny lies with Portugal - Avante!"
kog.9.b:0 "The Manikongo bends to no one!"

kog.10.t:0 "The Fate of our Royal House"
kog.10.d:0 "With the last remnants of Western colonialism swept away, our Kingdom of the Kongo now stands as a proud stronghold of African traditions and independence. However,  many within the Royal Court have called the current monarchy into question regarding their complicity in collaborating with the Portuguese government, and have even called the current monarchic structure and the current king to be mere pretenders, seeing them to be a remnant of colonialism to be swept away. Now, the many tribes across the lands that we now call home must decide which direction our tribal kingdom shall proceed. The first option is to ignore these perhaps false statements, and retain the current governing arrangement of a confederation of tribes under the Manikongo. The second option is to sweep away our former tribal structures and establish an absolute hereditary monarchy under the House of Água Rosada. The third option, and perhaps closest to our tribal roots, is to embrace our unique non-hereditary structure of elected Kings. And finally, we could instead lean towards supporting local chiefs, while empowering local councilors and perhaps establishing something similar to Western parliamentarism, all the while not losing sight of our own tribal identity. No matter which direction we choose, the Kingdom of the Kongo will remain a bastion of African tribal traditions and stability, amidst the dangerous fires of colonialism, radicalism and revolution that has engulfed Africa."
kog.10.a:0 "Retain our current government structure."
kog.10.b:0 "Pivot the councilors and establish an absolute monarchy."
kog.10.c:0 "Fully embrace our non-hereditary tradition."
kog.10.e:0 "Lean closer into our tribalist roots."

kog.11.t:0 "A New Manikongo?"
kog.11.d:0 "After displacing the former Portuguese-backed pretenders and centralizing his power throughout the realm, Kasa-Vubu has secured his power over the Kingdom of the Manikongo. With his grip on the Kingdom absolute, the scheming minister will now decide to use his position to call an election of a new monarch as per the traditions of the Manikongo, but with the councilors all in his pockets, being replaced by ABAKO members in the process of displacing the loyal retainers of the old monarch. And such, this election is little more than a formality for Kasa-Vubu, a long time claimant to the title of King of the Manikongo, to seize the throne he always wanted. However, not all within the Kingdom are pleased to see the aging Manikongo Pedro VII being replaced by this young upstart, and perhaps, restoring the old man to the position of King might be beneficial in placating the more conservative tribes of the Kingdom. No matter which option we choose, the ABAKO’s hold over the Kongo Kingdom is absolute, and our future of an united, semi-constitutional kingdom under the righteous rule of the Manikongo is secured."
kog.11.a:0 "Glory to Kasa-Vubu, the new Manikongo!"
kog.11.b:0 "The old man still has use for us."

kog.12.t:0 "The Distinction of Kongolese Catholicism and Syncretic Christian Faiths"
kog.12.d:0 "First arriving on our shores shortly after the first Portuguese explorers landed here back in 1483, Catholicism has left a deep mark on the Kongo. From the likes João I, who in 1491 became the first Manikongo to freely adopt the Catholic faith as his own, to Beatriz Kimpa Vita and her Antonine Sect of 1704 which professed that God was Kongolese and that their founder Donna Beatriz was possessed by Saint Anthony of Padua, all without denying the authority of the Pope while infusing Catholicism with our own local culture and beliefs before being burned at the stake regardless for her perceived heresy in the biased eyes of the eurocentric Roman Catholic Church, the Christian faith has been on quite the odyssey here over the centuries, ever embroiled in a battle between those who would see us bow fully to European styles of faith, and those who would adapt the faith to fit our local reality and history. Even with non-Catholic groups, such as the Baptist-based Kimbanguists that have captured the hearts and minds of many modern Bakongo, the influence of Christianity and this endless struggle between eurocentrism and afrocentrism is felt everywhere.\n\nThough some still obey and cling to the old faiths of our ancestors, the native Bukongo faith, many more still have attempted to fuse these old beliefs into the modern Christian-Catholic reality, with the idea that the Bukongo’s multitude of lesser gods and spirits translate to the many saints and angels of Christianity, while the one true Christian God above is likened to the Bukongo creator deity Nzambi a Mpungu while his female counterpart Nzambici the Sky Mother is likened to Mother Mary, adding in and translating other native Bukongo beliefs and practices to Christian analogues along the way, while others like the Kimbanguists moreso lean towards directly adapting Christian doctrine into an afrocentric lens as they dictate that Kimbangu and his family are the reincarnations and avatars of the Christian Trinity while also professing that these Biblical figures were always Black. Whatever the case, these afrocentric takes on the Christian faith, from Donna Beatriz to the modern fusings of Bukongo and Catholicism, are one of our biggest tools to resist the ‘eurofication’ of the Kongo, so we must support these various strands and offshoots as best we can, such as through funding, official support from our administration, and through the revitalization of both these local offshoot faiths and native-european fusions as well as to the Kongolese Catholic Church at large as we work to stave off the oppressive influence and domineering actions of the Roman Catholic Church and the Portuguese Church."
kog.12.a:0 "Our faith is our own!"

kog.13.t:0 "The Revival of the Order of Christ"
kog.13.d:0 "Though the Imperial Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ, or the Kongolese Kingdoms own Catholic knightly order, has existed in some form or another since 1607 when the Portuguese first brought the Order of Christ to our shores, it has largely decayed over the centuries, especially after its power and influence were severely truncated in 1914, when Portugal shifted it from a National Order, holding sway over the entire Kongolese Kingdom, to a largely powerless arm of the defanged monarchy as a House Order following the failed Kongo Revolt of 1914 and its aftermath in 1915 onwards which saw the Manikongo himself largely reduced to a powerless and puppeted facade in service to the colonial regime. However, with the Manikongo’s loyalty to the Portuguese and to the Roman Catholic Church proudly reaffirmed, government and Church officials from Lisbon and Rome have allowed us to reinstate the Order of Christs as a full National Order once again, giving it the power, funding, prestige, and international backing to command respect once again!\n\nWith a pious ceremony being held to commemorate the occasion, which itself was dedicated both to the current Manikongo [ROOT.getleader], to João I, the first Manikongo to openly embrace the Catholic faith all the way back in 1491, and to Álvaro II, the Manikongo who first founded the order back in 1607, the Imperial Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ has once again risen to defend the faithful of the Kongo Kingdom. Along the way, we shall also revitalize the other Catholic knightly order that operates in our kingdom, the Order of Saint James of the Sword, further rooting us to the Roman Catholic Church and the light of the one true God, while our re-empowered Sobas - the unique knightly rank of our orders meaning ‘chief’ usually made up of local clan leaders and other pious elders and soldiers - shall defend the faith here on the Congo forevermore."
kog.13.a:0 "We true knights of the Congo and God shall never falter again."

kog.14.t:0 "The Tunis Connection"
kog.14.d:0 "Centuries ago there lived a prince of Kongo named Henrique, son of Afonso I, who became a Catholic bishop and was granted the title of the Bishopric of Utica in Tunisia by the Pope himself. According to  Italian explorer Filippo Pigafetta’s 1591 work ‘The Kingdom of the Kongo and the Surrounding Regions’, which itself was written from the older notes of Portuguese explorer Duarte Lopes, Prince Henrique was born in Nsundi in 1495, being the son of Afonso I who was acclaimed Manikongo in 1509. Shortly afterwards, King Afonso I sent many of his children and other nobles to study in Coimbra, Portugal so that they may aid him in modernizing the kingdom. Among those sent included his own son Henrique, who was sponsored by the Portuguese king Dom Manuel I himself. On May 5, 1518, at the age of 24, the prince was elevated by Pope Leo X in Rome as Bishop of Utica, in present-day Tunisia, thus Henrique of Kongo became the first known bishop from central Africa in history since the first black African bishops which date back to ancient Nubia and Axum during the first centuries of Christianity. However, he never received the bishopric since it was only titular, since Tunisia at the time was dominated by Muslims. In 1521, Henrique returned to Kongo and was appointed governor of Mpangu, a province of the Kingdom, where would continue to serve in the Christianization of the kingdom until his death 10 years later.\n\nAlthough Tunis is still dominated by Muslims to this day, their stranglehold on the wider region is nothing close to what it used to be thanks to the expansion of European colonial powers guided by Christ’s light. With Henrique robbed of his rightful Bishopric all those years ago, we are well within our Christian right to reclaim this land as our own, for the Pope himself mandated it as so. With this all in mind, should we march to reclaim Henrique’s post at the Bishopric of Utica by leading a Christian crusade to conquer Tunis from the heathens, or should we leave Utica to rot with those dreaded Mohammedans?"
kog.14.a:0 "Utica is Kongolese by right of God and the Pope. Begin the Crusade!"
kog.14.b:0 "Oh, not in Utica, no. It's an Albany expression."
kog.14.c:0 "Have you seen a map? We aren’t marching all the way up there."

kog.15.t:0 "Cultural Ties to the New World"
kog.15.d:0 "Across the Atlantic, in places like Palomares, Brazil and Mururata, Bolivia, there are diasporic communities of Kongo people that established their own kingdoms and settlements modeled on our own Kongo Kingdom and the rule of our elective Manikongo in the wake of the Triangle Trade system as the slaves it stole away from our homeland adapted to their new surroundings while holding onto their pasts as best they could, taking in Portuguese and Spanish influences along the way when necessary. Additionally, in places like Brazil with the Candomble Bantu, Cuba with Palo, and Jamaica with Kumina, Kongo diasporic populations have also created their own syncretic faiths that fuse Kongo religious teachings with various New World and Christian ideas depending on the location. This trans-Atlantic cultural connection is even seen in Brazil’s own Engolo and Capoeira fighting styles, both of which have Kongo-Bantu roots, showing that even across time and space, we Kongolese are and always will be connected. With our kingdom now stabilized and our new course set, we must also begin to reach out to these far-flung kin of ours to ensure that the Kongo are never separated ever again."
kog.15.a:0 "From the Kwango and Pool Malebo to the Amazon, we shall always be one!"
kog.15.b:0 "I hear Jamaica and Cuba are nice this time of year. Let us set sail!"

kog.16.t:0 "Kongo Wishes to Join our Faction"
kog.16.d:0 "We have received a delegation from the Kingdom of Kongo requesting to join our alliance. The Manikongo's kingdom has recently engaged in a war to reclaim the lands of the former Belgian Congo. With their victory, the vast natural resources of the Congo now lie in the domain of the Manikongo and their inclusion into our faction could greatly expand our influence in Africa. What should we do?"
kog.16.a:0 "They are welcome!"
kog.16.b:0 "We don't need them."

kog.17.t:0 "Negotiations Fail"
kog.17.d:0 "The [Root.GetName] has refused to grant us entry into their faction, it's not like we needed them anyways."
kog.17.a:0 "Damn."

kog.18.t:0 "A Pink Map of Our Own?"
kog.18.d:0 "Decades of Portuguese colonial ambitions and influence have somehow managed to seep into equally ambitious minds within the upper echelons of our government. Given the circumstances that we no longer find ourselves burdened by any devotion to Lisbon - there is no reason why we shouldn’t ease the burdens of the ailing Portuguese colonial empire through the “transfer” of Mozambique, Angola, and any connecting territories."
kog.18.a:0 "We will paint the map as we please!"
kog.18.b:0 "It’s too much of a risk to take..."

kog.19.t:0 "A New Banner for our Realm?"
kog.19.d:0 "With Pedro's triumph over the Congolese pretenders, we must now choose which flag we shall fly in the Manikongo’s new realm. Some have proposed that we should use Pedro VII’s coat of arms, first issued to Afonso I by the Portuguese, as our national banner. More traditionalist chiefs have suggested that we use the flag that was designed by Franciscan monks for Garcia II, a fiercely independent king who opposed the Portuguese in Angola. Some reformist thinkers have advocated that we modernize our current flag with a saltire that includes the coat of arms in the middle. Some however, don't see a need for change and we should continue to use the flag that has been in use for centuries."
kog.19.a:0 "Use the Manikongo's coat of arms as our flag."
kog.19.b:0 "Adopt the flag used during the reign of Garcia II."
kog.19.c:0 "Modernize our current flag with the coat of arms."
kog.19.e:0 "We shall keep our current flag."

kog.20.t:0 "The Kimbangu Connection"
kog.20.d:0 "A long time follower of the Church of Jesus Christ on Earth by His Special Envoy Simon Kimbangu, Kasa-Vubu has promoted Kimbanguism heavily within our nation. Through his endorsement and promotion, especially through Albert-Joseph Kasongo Wa Kapinga, a major educator and ABAKO who was known for being Kimbangu’s educator, the word of the Prophet Kimbangu has been spread across the kingdom, while tightening the bonds between the Church and the ABAKO. And now, with the Prophet’s blessing, the local militias who have sworn loyalty to the Kimbanguist creed, led by Simon-Pierre Mpadi, have been integrated into the army and governing structures following our takeover of regions with large Kimbanguist influence. And such, we have seen an upsurge in sympathies for this religion even within our government structures. While this is welcoming news, we could perhaps further our ties with the Church by officially announcing Kimbanguism as state religion, while promoting certain high ranking members of the Kimbanguist church who have proven themselves to prominent positions, especially the Prophet’s offsprings who are all prominent members of the ABAKO party, intertwining the religion and the state itself. What will be our decision?"
kog.20.a:0 "A new religion for a truly African kingdom."
kog.20.b:0 "Kimbanguism shall be imbued within our government."

kog.21.t:0 "An Appeal to Lisbon Over the Pink Map"
kog.21.d:0 "With our loyalty to the Portuguese reaffirmed and with our internal situation stabilized, many within our council have pushed for the Manikongo to ask for the rest of our rightful land in Angola back as well as for administrative control over Portugal’s other central African colonies like Mozambique as well as the rest of the land in between in what constitutes their Pink Map idea of a Portuguese dominated south central Africa. Although the Portuguese likely won’t want to cede with their precious Pink Map, the situation in other places in their empire such as Europe and Asia have only grown more tenuous and dire, while we have the African front largely under control. They’d be able to keep the prestige of their massive colonial empire alive while shifting the dirty work of direct administration over to us if they so agree, but should we even ask?"
kog.21.a:0 "Petition Portugal for the Pink Map!"
kog.21.b:0 "Leave it to the Tugas."

kog.22.t:0 "The Loyal Kongolese Ask for Control of Our African Colonies"
kog.22.d:0 "Our loyal colonial subjects within the Kongo Kingdom have petitioned our colonial office, seeking to ask the Crown directly if they would cede administrative duties and de facto control of our ‘Pink Map’ colonies around Angola, Mozambique, Cabinda, and the land inbetween to the Manikongo, while we would maintain de jure control, keeping our prestige and empire intact in the eyes of the rest of the West. This would allow us to better focus on the European front and our other colonial possessions like those in Asia while still receiving all the boons and bounties of Africa, all without the headache of directly administering the Dark Heart ourselves. However, many colonial zealots within our cabinet decry the idea as a capitulation to native savagery and barbarism. What shall we say?"
kog.22.a:0 "Cede administration of the African colonies over to the Manikongo."
kog.22.b:0 "Deny such a laughable request."

kog.23.t:0 "The Portuguese Decline the Kongolese Pink Map"
kog.23.d:0 "Expectedly, the Portuguese have declined our request to run the Pink Map territories for them. It would seem that our territorial ambitions in Central Africa have come to an end, at least for now."
kog.23.a:0 "We should have seen this coming..."

kog.24.t:0 "The Portuguese Cede the Pink Map to Us!"
kog.24.d:0 "Unexpectedly, the Portuguese have accepted our request to run the Pink Map territories for them. As we speak, the lands of Angola, Cabinda, Mozambique, and beyond are all being officially prepared for our Kingdom to take over direct control of the local governments, and although we are all still part of the wider Portuguese Empire, the once-Dark Heart of Africa is nigh entirely ours now to do with as we please, so long as we keep sending resources and riches back to Lisbon and Rome."

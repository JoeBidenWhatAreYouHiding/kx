### Parties ###
CAL_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
CAL_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - The SPA had some semblance of influence on the West Coast until recently, when Upton Sinclair and his Commonwealth Party took most of their support. Though the Commonwealth Party is seen as the greatest hope the left has in the PSA, there are those who adhere to more radical positions, oftentimes in association with the CSA. Those sympathetic to Totalism are typically supportive of the PSA rather than the CSA, but they believe that the government is not doing nearly enough to win the war. They call for the awakening of Western potential in the form of industry and see this as the route to victory. Unfortunately for them though, it seems they have lost their chance at power in the region."
CAL_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
CAL_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America -  The SPA had some semblance of influence on the West Coast until recently, when Upton Sinclair and his Commonwealth Party took most of their support. Though the Commonwealth Party is seen as the greatest hope the left has in the PSA, there are those who adhere to more radical positions, oftentimes in association with the CSA. Those who espouse mainstream syndicalist views were angry when Sinclair betrayed the eastern syndicalists to protect his own ambitions. As a result, they have largely remained loyal to the SPA and other small organizations, advocating an overhaul of the current economic system. However, their numbers are small and it seems that the Commonwealth Party has outmaneuvered them."
CAL_radical_socialist_party:0 "Commonwealth Party"
CAL_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Commonwealth Party - Upton Sinclair's Commonwealth Party has became a rallying point for those on the left on the West Coast. Though the End Poverty in California, or EPIC, plan failed to gain traction in 1934,  the party has became fairly popular since then. It still has to contend with the two major parties, the Democratic-Republicans, and the Progressives, who are their main rivals for support. To ameliorate this, the Commonwealth Party has distanced itself from the CSA, promising to safeguard the country from marxism and syndicalism. Sinclair is the visionary who has led the party to where it is today, but there are others who aspire to lead it. Culbert Olson is likely the most notable candidate. He is seen as a rising star in the party, espousing many of the same policies as Sinclair but with more moderate rhetoric. Only time will tell how successful this party could truly be."
CAL_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
CAL_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party - The Progressives aim to build on a decades-old tradition of progressive success in the West and in the country as a whole. From the Farmer's Alliance to the Populist Party to the Bull Moose Party, Progressives have never won the presidency. However, with a coalition of farmers and workers, the party hopes to be victorious. A few obstacles stand in their way. The Commonwealth Party poses a strong challenge from their left, and the Democratic-Republicans have also stolen some voters who would otherwise be likely Progressive constituents. Nonetheless, the Progressives have a strong position on the West Coast, and it is possible that they could win the coming electoral contests outright. Henry Wallace, Hiram Johnson, Charles L. McNary, and CC Young are all contending for leadership of the party; the winner will have his work ahead of him, but the party's populist appeal is strong."
CAL_social_liberal_party:0 "Democratic-Republican Party"
CAL_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic-Republican Party - The Democratic-Republicans, sometimes called the Liberals, are a mix of liberal and reform minded Democrats and Republicans who have become disenchanted with both parties and seek change. Though their desire for reform is perhaps more moderate than that of the Progressives and certainly more so than that of the Commonwealth, the Democratic-Republicans wish to see banking reform, the institution of a social security system, and work programs. The Progressives and the Commonwealth Party have sneered at a party they see as engaging in half measures, policies that will do nothing but frustrate the people and allow the rich to rule society. The mainstream Democratic and Republican Parties view the new party as upstarts, unworthy of recognition and having outlandish policy goals. Despite all their enemies, the Democratic-Republicans have a fair amount of support in the West, and with the right maneuvering, could even come to power. Their main candidates include Earl Warren, political titan William Gibbs McAdoo, Charles D. Martin, Manchester Boddy, and Charles A. Sprague. It is unclear which of these men will lead the party, but they all desire the same thing: victory in the coming elections."
CAL_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
CAL_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party - Many parties have emerged in the recent strife that has racked our country, but the Republican Party has stood strong through it all. Though they are not as dominant on the West Coast as they are in other regions of the country, they have strongly contested the region with the Democrats for decades. Herbert Hoover himself lived in California for years, and the state's governor, Frank Merriam, is also a Republican. Their current policies emphasize a laissez-faire economy, with low regulations and low taxes. Further, education and free trade are also popular policies within the Republican Party. Indeed, if the Republicans can create a message that can bring some disaffected voters back into the party, they could very well win the upcoming elections. However, recent hardships in California have forced Merriam to raise taxes, and his union-busting tendendcies will make it difficult to gain support from new constituencies. As such, Merriam has many rivals within the party. Robert Taft, son of former President William Howard Taft, threatens Merriam's position in the party, but Harry Chandler, Howard Hughes, Frank Knox, and Louis B. Meyer are all contending for the leadership of the Republican Party as well. The future of the Republican Party may well depend on who is chosen to represent them in the coming elections."
CAL_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
CAL_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - For decades, the Democratic Party has fiercely contended with their Republican rivals for dominance on the West Coast. Their support for railroad and tariff reforms gained them support early in the century, but recently, the party has bled support to various new parties rising up in the region. The America First Party has been particularly damaging to the party's efforts, and any Democratic hopeful will have to win back votes from this faction. The Democrats do not have a standardbearer like Frank Merriam in the West, but there are prominent figures. The newly-elected governor of Oregon, Charles Martin, has become known as a pro-business politician, and is vehemently opposed to strikes. Numerous prominent businessmen have also thrown their hat into the contest for Democratic leadership. Among them are Henry J. Kaiser, a famous contractor in the building of dams, and Walt Disney, a rising star whose company Disney aims to revolutionize entertainment. While neither man is known for their charisma, Disney's visionary nature could win voters over in the primary. However, media mogul William Randolph Hearst has also expressed interest in politics lately, though he has sharply contrasted his platform with that of the Democratic Party, and some believe he wants to start his own party. Doing so would weaken the Democratic Party even more, but Hearst may be beyond convncing. In the meantime, the best the Democratic Party can do is continue its traditions of social conservatism and support from the business community, and hope it will be enuogh."
CAL_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
CAL_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has been a thorn in the side of local Democrats, for they have succeeded in stealing much of the party's support. Their populist outrage against business tycoons has gained them supporters in both rural and urban communities, and though they don't stand a chance of winning in the area, the AFP can certainly gain concessions from more popular parties. Their largest challenge lies not in the Democrats themselves, but in William Randolph Hearst, who in running his own party would use a mix of racial appeals and his own vision of unions to carve out a place for himself in the electoral arena. Only time can tell what will happen to the party in the West."
CAL_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Federalist Loyalists"
CAL_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Federalist Loyalists - The Federal Government certainly has its supporters in the West. There are many who have recently fled to the West from their places on the East Coast, and they still harbor sympathies for those who stayed behind. There are also those who question the legitimacy of our cause, and instead believe we should unite with the Feds against our common foes. Though this is not likely, these loyalists should be watched, for they could undermine any Pacific regime."
CAL_national_populist_party:0 "The Spiritualist Movement"
CAL_national_populist_party_long:0 "The Spiritualist Movement - One of the strangest new factions to emerge lately is the Spiritualist Movement. Within the movement, there are many disparate factions who have come together with the common goal of opposing what they call "Monarchist Anglo-Syndicalism". There is a faction of the movement that wishes to pursue closer ties with Japan, who has been one of their biggest supporters, foreign or domestic. This faction is represented by oil businessman Max Thornburg and ideological ally Ralph Townsend. Another faction of the movement is that of L. Ron Hubbard, who is less concerned with the support of Japan or any other nation than he is with the occult. His Christian mysticism, along with his belief in the paranormal and even U.F.O.'s, has made him a source of derision for some, though Hubbard's beliefs are no joke to him. His heavily anti-syndicalist views could make him popular in the business community, but those who know Hubbard well know he will not be controlled by anyone. Leading these two factions, among other smaller ones, is movement and party leader Edward Longstreet Bodin. Bodin faces a difficult task in reconciling Japanese support with the occult views of the party, but with his talent, and a bit of luck, he may be able to bring the party to popularity."

This way, we will adequately honour our emperor. "

CAL_activate_the_Western_Defense_Command_desc:0 "Since we claim to be the real America, and our Army is officially the United States Army, the command hierarchy remains unclear on many levels. As such, we will push for the creation of the Western Defence Command, an apparent detachment of the Army which will work independently, and will reunite with the Army in structure once the civil war is won."
CAL_prepare_the_artillery:0 "Prepare the Artillery"
CAL_prepare_the_artillery_desc:0 "The indisputable winner of the Weltkrieg was Artillery. With it, our army may advance over a supressed enemy, as well as stop any enemy offensive dead in its tracks. As such, our immediate priority will be to repurpose the Navy's spare cannons to the artillery branch, as well as fund the development of new artillery models and improved artillery parts to facilitate mass production of this deadly weapon."
CAL_defense_logistics_agency:0 "Defence Logistics Agency"
CAL_defense_logistics_agency_desc:0 "America is an enormous country, full of varied terrain. We need to create a centralized logistics board able to coordinate warfare across the varied biomes of America."
CAL_deWitt_in_Charge:0 "DeWitt's Mobilization"
CAL_deWitt_in_Charge_desc:0 "Major General John Lesesne DeWitt, unlike many members of the staff who advocate for us to aggressively assault the enemy positions, has proposed for us to focus on more careful advances with powerful consolidations. In his view, slow and steady advances paired up with a centralized high command will see our nation through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"
CAL_wake_the_west:0 "Wake the West"
CAL_wake_the_west_desc:0 "It is time for the mighty West Coast to awaken from its slumber. DeWitt has persuaded us to increase our propaganda effors in order to energize our population.

CAL_counter_espionage:0 "American Counter-Espionage"`
CAL_counter_espionage_desc:0 "One factor that may endanger our government is the presence of spies. Espionage, foreign and domestic, could expose our plans for winning the war.

CAL_infantry_arms_desc:0 "Men win wars, but without guns, our army will be useless. We have struck a deal with the Sacramento Army Arsenal, and they will be able to supply us with what we need. DeWitt believes that with these weapons, we will be one step closer to winning the war."
CAL_bombing_support:0 "Bombing Support"
CAL_bombing_support_desc:0 "America has long been one of the world's foremost nations in the field of aviation. We will continue this tradition in war. Hulking planes fitted with bombs can wreak havoc on the enemy, and if used in conjunction with our infantry, McNair believes these bombers can turn the tide of the war."
CAL_Marshall_in_command:0 "Marshall-Arnold Plan"
CAL_Marshall_in_command_desc:0 "Brigadier General George Catlett Marshall has come to us with a damning prediction: if the West Coast fails to cross the Rockies and secure a foothold in the Midwest, then defeat will be inevitable. In his view, a quick advance through the Rockies, with the help of motorized elements, will see us through this civil war. With his daring plan, America shall be free once again!"
CAL_supreme_commander:0 "Centralized Command Structure"
CAL_supreme_commander_desc:0 "With Marshall as Supreme Commander of the West, our army has started to transform. We are no longer a rag-tag army of idealists trying to preserve the dream of America. Marshall has helped us turn our army into a professional fighting force, able to contend with any of our rivals in the East. With an emphasis on planning and talent, we will win the war."
CAL_morale_emphasis:0 "Morale Emphasis"
CAL_morale_emphasis_desc:0 "Marshall has confided in us that he believes we are fighting the good fight. However, he is not convinced that all of our people or, more importantly, our soldiers, believe that.

CAL_unified_front:0 "Unified Front"
CAL_unified_front_desc:0 "'The Object of Operation Glacier is to secure a lodgment area on the Midwest from which further offensive operations can be developed.

CAL_nativist_appeals_desc:0 "During the California Gold Rush, foreigners swarmed into California and attempted to steal what was rightfully ours. We have not forgotten this, and neither have our people. The Ku Klux Klan agitates our population on a daily basis, arguing that our government will allow such events to reoccur. We must use these nativist feelings for our own purposes."
CAL_kruger_doctrine:0 "Appoint Krueger"
CAL_kruger_doctrine_desc:0 "Brigadier General Walter Krueger learned many lessons during his time as an observer in Germany. The importance of the tank in warfare is one lesson that Krueger has insisted we learn. He has drafted a plan that would emphasize mobility, with tanks serving as the spearhead of a mechanized force and our infantry in a dash to the Mississippi."
CAL_armor_production_lines:0 "Armor Production Lines"
CAL_armor_production_lines_desc:0 "The first step in the Krueger plan is to begin the transformation of America's West Coast industry. Our capacity to build tanks and other vehicles must be expanded, he argues, if we are to be victorious. To do this, we will make use of existing factories and create new ones."
CAL_tank_destroyers:0 "Tank Destroyers"
CAL_tank_destroyers_desc:0 "Our rivals on the East Coast can produce many more tanks than we can. We must invest in Anti-Tank research, so as to neutralize this disadvantage. Through more advanced Anti-Tank weaponry, McNair believes we will have the power to annihilate yet another part of the enemy's force."
CAL_tank_contracts:0 "Tank Contracts"
CAL_tank_contracts_desc:0 "We have been able to secure contracts with our region's top tank manufacturers. These light tanks are just what we need according to Krueger, and through them, we will be able to gain the initiative rather than waiting for the enemy to come to us."
CAL_manuever_exercises:0 "Maneuver Exercises"
CAL_manuever_exercises_desc:0 "Tanks are nothing withour their crews. By training our tank crews and our army as a whole in the German tradition of mobile warfare, general Krueger believes that we can strike the East like a lightning rod, securing our objectives before the enemy knows what hit them." 
CAL_officer_latitude:0 "Officer Latitude"
CAL_officer_latitude_desc:0 "In a rejection of Marshall's ideas, Walter Krueger believes that we should grant officers autonomy rather than adhere them to a single restrictive plan. This will allow our tanks to move quickly, surprise and encircle the enemy if possible, and annihilate them. Today, we see the Pacific, but tomorrow, we shall gaze upon the Atlantic!" 
CAL_alamo_scouts:0 "Alamo Scouts"
CAL_alamo_scouts_desc:0 "Part of Krueger's plan involves small elite teams that will travel deep into enemy lines and act as scouts. These teams will gather intelligence for us and allow us to strike unexpectedly. Krueger's has termed these groups "Alamo Scouts" due to his love for the Alamo Mission and his time in Texas, which he promises to retake."
CAL_support_training:0 "Engineering Support"
CAL_support_training_desc:0 "The varying terrain of the massive U.S. mainland may cause issues for our tanks. We will make an effort to train more engineers in order to overcome any challenges we may experience with infastructure or logistics in our long journey eastward. Our path to victory is paved by engineers!"
CAL_central_strategy:0 "Central Strategy"
CAL_central_strategy_desc:0 "Marshall and Arnold have come to us with more details for their Rockies plan. They propose that our army coordinates closely across our entire eastern front. With a streamlined plan, we will have a disciplined force that is less susceptible to the chaos of war."
CAL_modern_training:0 "Modern Training"
CAL_modern_training_desc:0 "The enemy is no longer out of our reach. With new tactics developed around speed, with an emphasis on armor and reconaissance, we will cross great distances in no time at all. Our eastern foes will never know what hit them..."
CAL_mcnair_report:0 "McNair Report"
CAL_mcnair_report_desc:0 "Brigadier General Lesley James McNair has given us a detailed strategy report. He argues that we must use massive artillery and air support to help our infantry prevail over our more numerous enemies. To do this, he suggests we awaken the industrial potential of the West Coast, so that we may obliterate our enemy before they even know what hit them."
CAL_towed_artillery_yesterday:0 "Towed Artillery Yesterday"
CAL_towed_artillery_yesterday_desc:0 "Artillery peices will need to be stronger as well as lighter if we are to respond to battlefield changes as the plan dictates. McNair's expertise in the 1920s with the Examining boards seems to have not gone to waste, and he has proposed an overhaul of the American Artillery production which he projects will lead to artillery pieces being easier to produce and repair, as well as more accurate on the battlefield."
CAL_weapons_development:0 "Weapons Development"
CAL_weapons_development_desc:0 "For too long, we have used outdated equipment in our army. We can now afford to invest in new weaponry and equipment, particularly in the field of artillery, in order to rain fire upon the extremists in the East. Every bullet or shell counts, and ours will soon count for more." 
CAL_field_artillery_school:0 "Field Artillery Schools"
CAL_field_artillery_school_desc:0 "While other generals have encouraged the continuation of officer schools to train the next generation of officers, Leslie McNair wants our focus elsewhere. He believes that investment in rigorous field artillery schools will give our artillery, and our army, the necessary training to prevail in the Civil War and beyond."
CAL_quasi_arms_factories:0 "Quasi-Arms Factories"
CAL_quasi_arms_factories_desc:0 "A crucial part of McNair's plan is the development of specialized Anti-Air and Anti-Tank Artillery. These will allow us to better contend with the modern machines of warfare. In order to achieve this goal, we will develop quasi arms factories that specialize in the production of such weapons."
CAL_combined_arms_units:0 "Combined Arms Units"
CAL_combined_arms_units_desc:0 "General McNair urges us to implement a strategy of combined arms in our army. This would allow our infantry, armor, artillery, and planes to maximize their respective strengths in a unified force. With the support of various combat arms, our infantry will cut through the enemy like butter."
CAL_protecting_Columbia_desc:0 "The Army War College, the Field Artillery School, Fort Benning and many other major buildings, locations and training sites have been damaged by the war, and their reconstruction should be one of our top priorities to bring the Army back on its feet now that the civil war is over."
CAL_military_research:0 "Military Research"
CAL_military_research_desc:0 "While we have some of the finest universities and thinkers in the world, we cannot research everything at once. We need to pick a direction for our military research to focus in."
CAL_weapon_designs:0 "New Weapon Designs"
CAL_weapon_designs_desc:0 "While the M1 Garand managed to see us through the Civil War, its flaws were as noticeable when it was adopted as they are now. However, with the criticism we have gathered during the civil war, we have contacted the original designer, and he has assured us that by redesigning the barrel, gas cylinder, and front sight assembly, he will make the Garand an even more reliable and deadly weapon."
CAL_Army_rangers:0 "Army Rangers"
CAL_Army_rangers_desc:0 "An elite group of specialized soldiers, the Army Rangers will be able to carry out covert missions in rough terrain, disrupting enemy supply lines and morale."
CAL_90_division_Army:0 "90-Division Army Plan"
CAL_90_division_Army_desc:0 "While Marshall originally envisioned that a reformed US Army would require a 265-Division Plan to be fully mobilized, the limitations of the West Coast make such a plan a pipe dream. As such, he has decided to adopt a 90-Division Plan, with the objective of raising a total of at least 90 divisions against America's enemies."
CAL_organizing_victory:0 "Organizing Victory"
CAL_organizing_victory_desc:0 "All elements of our society should be brought together to bolster the war effort. Under Marshall's close supervision, our factories will produce more equipment than ever before, and we will show the world the might of the West!" 
CAL_motorization:0 "Motorisation Program"
CAL_motorization_desc:0 "With the original rejection of the motorisation plans, a ghost has loomed the American Army as their methods became backwards as opposed to other militaries. Marshall has now proposed the government to subsidize truck production and to being the seizure of civilian trucks for the creation of motorized units capable of crossing the American countryside before our enemy can react."
CAL_tank_production:0 "Increase Tank Production"
CAL_tank_production_desc:0 "With the West Coast's low manpower, the High Command has had to design a plan to effectively improve what every man is worth in the field. In any of those plans, expanding Tank production in the West Coast comes as a priority, as their relatively low manpower cost and high combat effectiveness proves that it will not only save us lives, but also helps us push the enemy back more swiftly."
CAL_Officer_instruction:0 "Officer Instruction"
CAL_Officer_instruction_desc:0 "Marshall has presented this issue to our government, and his solution is to create forward study-bases, with more experienced officers mentoring younger ones in tactics. While this may put more of our officers in the line of fire, it will also ensure our new generation of officers gets first hand experience, as well as improving our army's leadership on the lower echelons as a whole."
CAL_recon_units:0 "Reconnaissance Units"
CAL_recon_units_desc:0 "Knowledge is Power, and Marshall believes that without the former two, victory in America will be impossible. We are outmanned and outgunned by our enemies, but if we know their every movement, then we can nullify our enemy's superiority by out-witting them."
CAL_defense_is_the_best_offense:0 "Defense is the Best Offense"
CAL_defense_is_the_best_offense_desc:0 "The first step towards preparing for the coming storm will be to improve our defense construction. Trench digging and fortification construction will be a basic part of our army's curriculum, so that when the enemy waves come and threaten our home, we shall prevail."
CAL_logistic_security:0 "Logistical Security"
CAL_logistic_security_desc:0 "Logistiscs are a not-so well known battlefield which will be vital for us if we wish to gain the upper hand against the radicals in the East. Investing into new munitions factories to keep our men fighting as well as funding our logistical corps should go a long way into helping us achieve this goal."
CAL_aggressive_conscription:0 "Aggressive Conscription"
CAL_aggressive_conscription_desc:0 "Our position on the West Coast does not come without drawbacks. We do not have enough men to match the armies of the East. However, DeWitt argues if we are more aggressive in our recruiting and conscription efforts, we may be able to even the score."
CAL_Expand_the_Presidio:0 "Expand the Presidio of San Francisco"
CAL_Expand_the_Presidio_desc:0 "The Presidio of San Francisco has a long tradition of being vital for our nation's war efforts since America occupied it in 1846. As it stands, it is the most logical seat of power to direct our army's efforts, as well as the best prepared facility in the West Coast to hold the Command Staff. However, being the best prepared facility the region doesn't mean it's up to standard, and an expansion of the Fort is required."
CAL_coast_to_coast_planning:0 "'Coast-to-Coast' Planning Board"
CAL_coast_to_coast_planning_desc:0 "With the Expanded Presidio, DeWitt has proposed the creation of a Planning board, capable of issuing new and adaptable plans for our front line commanders so that we may push our enemies from sea to shining sea."
CAL_increase_military_spending:0 "Increase Our Military Spending"
CAL_increase_military_spending_desc:0 "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise. While the Civil war may be over, America still has enemies to fight and wars to win, and as such keeping the Civil War military spending and expanding upon it is on our best interests."
CAL_bring_the_complex_west:0 "Rebuild the Military Industrial Complex"
CAL_bring_the_complex_west_desc:0 "With most of the Military Industrial Complex in the East, the Civil War has devastated the old munitions and weapons factories that made up America's war industry as they became high value targets for bombings and a preferred hiding spot of persistent enemy defenders. If we wish to be ready for the next war, investing into rebuilding the military industrial complex is one of our priorities."

CAL_slash_taxes_desc:0 "Why do the rich get richer while the poor gets poorer cries the syndicalist?

Raise a glass, for the down times are over!"
CAL_state_unions:0 "National Unions"
CAL_state_unions_desc:0 "That syndicalism poses a threat to the nation can not be in doubt, but this does not mean the American working man should not be properly organized and represented.

CAL_investigate_gop_desc:0 "There can be little doubt that the GOP and their former friends in the Progressive Party and Democratic-Republicans make up Hearst's most dangerous critics since the collapse of the Commonwealth Party.

CAL_yellow_peril:0 "Yellow Peril"
CAL_yellow_peril_desc:0 "Hearst has been vocal in his concern that the "Yellow Races" seek to overtake the "White Race", formerly through immigration but now, with the weakening of America, through imperialism.

CAL_demand_respect_from_canada_desc:0 "Enough of Canada's foolishness!

CAL_nationalize_liquor_desc:0 "While the "Dry" supporters were correct that liquor tended to attract shady elements and cause social instability, it is fairly obvious that passing prohibition on the local and state level has only increased crime.

CAL_mexican_border_raids_desc:0 "The bandits that make up the Mexican government believe they can get away with raiding and trafficking across our border, laughing at our supposed inability to strike back. It is time to return the favor and be compensated for our stolen goods."

CAL_tribunals_for_gangsters_desc:0 "With the implementation of the Federal Police we must set a more clear code of enforcement for them to follow that is not interferred with by other branches of government.

We are a country with vast wealth and resources, and we shall use these to construct the largest and most extravagant structures the world has ever seen.

CAL_naval_project:0 "Aerial Contracts"

CAL_expand_war_powers_desc:0 "How can the president defend the nation if he does not have the power to protect his own people?

CAL_new_media:0 "New Media"
CAL_new_media_desc:0 "During the war, we engaged in a media blackout. After all, the newspapers could not resist writing stories labelling us as conspiracy theorists and the like.

CAL_shinto_influence:0 "Shinto Influences"
CAL_shinto_influence_desc:0 "Shintoism is extremely different from Christianity or the other main American religions, yet our close ties with Japan have meant that it has increasing influence in the country.

CAL_restore_elections_desc:0 "One thing that could help us further establish our legitimacy would be to hold "elections". These elections would not be fair by any means, but the mere fact we are holding them would go a long way in the eyes of some. Who will stop us if we count the votes?"

CAL_american_laisze_faire:0 "Laissez Faire Economics"
CAL_american_laisze_faire_desc:0 "Too much government intervention will only harm rebuilding. We need to ensure that we are not overly interfering in our economy as it struggles to rebuild from the Civil War."
CAL_moral_education:0 "Moral Education"
CAL_moral_education_desc:0 "Higher education has long been a bastion of the elite, and it should be kept that way. The prestigious halls of the Ivy Leagues are no place for those not prepared. They should be reserved for the future leaders of America, so they can receive the best education possible."
CAL_new_american_century:0 "New American Century"
CAL_new_american_century_desc:0 "In the time since our election, we have created a foundation to restore America to greatness. Rebuilding from the Civil War will take time, but we now out to the world, ready for a new century of greatness."
CAL_states_autonomy:0 "Strengthen State Autonomy"
CAL_states_autonomy_desc:0 "The federal government can not be expected to administrate everything. Indeed the lack of states rights in favor of an inept central government was central to the collapse of the United States. Relief programs, taxation and other administrative duties will be further devolved to the states."
CAL_patriotic_shorts:0 "Patriotic Shorts"
CAL_patriotic_shorts_desc:0 "With the population notably short on both entertainment and patriotism in these trying times we should use the recent growth of cinema to promote patriotism. We shall hire animators, particularly the Disney corporation, to come up with patriotic short films and clips directed especially at families to reassure them of what we are fighting for."
CAL_family_law:0 "Family Law"
CAL_family_law_desc:0 "The strong society requires a strong society but sadly too many socially irresponsible citizens ignore this. The Family Law Act requires each state to enforce child support, requiring fathers with an income to contribute to their family even in the case of a divorce, and likewise requires wealthy sons to provide for their elder parents if they fall into poverty."
CAL_expand_national_guard:0 "Expand the National Guard"
CAL_expand_national_guard_desc:0 "A strong military is more important than ever if we are to survive in our present situation. We should rely on the older and more established National Guard to defend us, sending them our recently acquired business-friendly funds and giving them permission to intiate a new round of drafts."
CAL_entente_support:0 "Entente Support"
CAL_entente_support_desc:0 "There are few entities left that are loyal to both tradition and democracy but one of them is the anti-Syndicalist Entente. The Democratic Party's business, liberal and Catholic wings have desired closer to ties with them, understanding that their and our struggle is one and the same. We must request support in these trying times."
CAL_self_regulation:0 "Self Regulation"
CAL_self_regulation_desc:0 "New trade groups are seeking to court our favor by showing interest in upholding social values via industrial self-regulation, in which their respective industries ensure minimal quality of life for workers and respect for patriotism, starting with a new attempt by universities to stomp out radical thought. We should promote any such industries who follow this model and provide them with small tax breaks."
CAL_hays_code:0 "Hays Code"
CAL_hays_code_desc:0 "Following our promotion of self-regulation, several Hollywood leaders under the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America have sought to be more in-line with the current trend by assembling a code of ethics to be followed by the film industry aimed at promoting social conservatism. We should help coordinate with them to write the guidelines and promote such films."
CAL_stop_desecration:0 "Protect American Symbols"
CAL_stop_desecration_desc:0 "The radicals would destroy every symbol of Americanism due to their maddening totality of belief in class conflict. Enough! The government shall promote the heavier use of patriotic symbols via contact with industrial trade groups, use more American symbols on government property and ban flag desecration under penalty of a small fine."
CAL_welfare_reform:0 "Tighten Welfare Requirements"
CAL_welfare_reform_desc:0 "Local and state welfare had been expanding since the late 20th century but their resources are famously short as of now. We should coordinate with local governments and businesses to make local forms of welfare such as food and cash relief more exclusive to widowed mothers and tighten local workers compensation to focus on the truly disabled."
CAL_levering_act:0 "Levering Act"
CAL_levering_act_desc:0 "California representative Harold K. Levering has, with assistance from representative Jack Tenney, written a new oath for all state employees (including teachers) to take in which they disavow radicalism, particularly syndicalism.

CAL_increase_defense_spending:0 "Increase Defense Spending"
CAL_increase_defense_spending_desc:0 "After the recent Civil War, it is clear that we must support the military, should a similar event take place someday.

CAL_market_liberals_in_power_desc:0 "The Republican Party, champions of free trade, deregulation, and the financial sector, have won the [GetYear] elections. Citizens can expect to see lower taxes, better prices, and a return of the can-do individualist spirit of American capitalism."
CAL_settelment_movement:0 "Settlement Movement"
CAL_settelment_movement_desc:0 "The Settlement Movement was popular in pre-Weltkrieg England and America, and focused on bringing the rich and poor together in 'settlement houses' to better understand each other. We should encourage a revival of this movement in these difficult social times."
CAL_small_business_support:0 "Support Small Business"
CAL_small_business_support_desc:0 "Small businesses were the backbone of the American economy, until many were destroyed in the Civil War. We should look into tax incentives and other strategies to restore small business confidence."

CAL_education_philanthropy:0 "Education Philanthropy"
CAL_education_philanthropy_desc:0 "The richest businessmen usually attended a small set of elite universities, like the Ivy Leagues, Stanford, and the University of Chicago. We should create scholarships to ensure that those less fortunate can also attend these beacons of learning."

CAL_incentivize_charity:0 "Incentivize Charity"
CAL_incentivize_charity_desc:0 "Currently there is a large swath of the population that needs our aid but as usual direct government intervention would be inefficient compared to private intervention. Instead our public service campaign will urge the wealthy to donate, offering a tax break for anyone who does and honoring those whom give the most by honoring their deeds."
CAL_local_budgeting:0 "Local Budgeting"
CAL_local_budgeting_desc:0 "Decentralization of the economy makes up much of the backbone of our beliefs and so it should go with the national budget, with local governments being given greater flexibility to set budgets and being recognized by our political leaders for saving money where they can."
CAL_naval_expansion:0 "Naval Expansion"
CAL_naval_expansion_desc:0 "The Republican belief in isolationism saved countless American lives by helping avert intervention in the European Great War. It shall continue with a defensive policy of naval buildup that keeps foreign empires out of American affairs and vice-versa."
CAL_slash_spending:0 "Economy Act"
CAL_slash_spending_desc:0 "This is no time to be spending money on high government salaries. The Economy Act will slash government salaries by nearly half a billion dollars thus pushing us closer to a balanced budget and with it investor confidence."
CAL_give_me_your_poor:0 "Give Me Your Poor"
CAL_give_me_your_poor_desc:0 "One of the founding traditions of America was that we took in the poor of the world and allowed them to flourish in our country. We must continue this tradition.

CAL_infastructure_investment:0 "Infrastructure Investment"

CAL_good_neighbor_policy_desc:0 "For decades, the United States has used force to maintain order in Latin America. However, given our recent Civil War, it is more difficult than ever for us to do that. Instead, we should endeavor to increase our cooperation and trade with our Southern neighbors for the mutual benefit of all involved."
CAL_reduce_subsidies:0 "Reduce Subsidies"
CAL_reduce_subsidies_desc:0 "Subsidies are an example of government overreach. It is difficult to know how much is enough in a subsidy, or if it will benefit either party at all. More often than not, it is merely wasted money. We should reduce government subsidies as much as possible and let the invisible hand of the market guide our business world."
CAL_education_campaign:0 "Education Campaign"
CAL_education_campaign_desc:0 "Farm children are often kept out of school, with the excuse that they are needed as hands on the farm. This will no longer be the case. We will invest in rural schools as well as other methods of rural education so that every child in our country can receive the education they deserve."
CAL_tolerance_campaign:0 "Tolerance Campaign"
CAL_tolerance_campaign_desc:0 "What someone drinks or consumes in their time is not the business of the government. So long as it does not interfere with their work life, we should encourage tolerance of such practices. We make far too much income from such products to throw them away just for some of our more moralistic supporters."

### Social Liberals ###
CAL_progressive_taxation:0 "Liberal Taxation"
CAL_progressive_taxation_desc:0 "Ideally, taxation should strike a balance between allowing people to still have enough money to spend on consumer and luxury goods, and supporting government programs. The Progressive Party's tax plan ensures this will be the case."
CAL_securities_act:0 "Securities Act"
CAL_securities_act_desc:0 "Many are fearful of the large-scale confiscations of wealth carried out by the CSA and AUS during the Civil War. We need to enact legislation to reassure the people that their property is theirs and theirs alone."

CAL_social_liberals_in_power_desc:0 "The Democratic-Republicans have won the [GetYear] election! Their agenda is a continuation of the pre-Civil War progressive wing of the Republican party, prioritizing liberal free trade, progressive social policies, and a moderate welfare state."
CAL_country_life_movement:0 "Country Life Movement"
CAL_country_life_movement_desc:0 "The Country Life movement emphasizes a return to a rural lifestyle, and has grown popular among those disillusioned with city life following the turmoil of the Civil War.

CAL_efficiency_movement:0 "Efficiency Movement"
CAL_efficiency_movement_desc:0 "30 years ago in the height of the Progressive Era, the Efficiency Movement tried to eliminate superfluous waste from the household and the workplace.

CAL_chautauqua:0 "Chautauqua"

CAL_four_freedoms:0 "Four Freedoms"
CAL_four_freedoms_desc:0 "Americans enjoy four key freedoms that most of the world lack. The freedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom from want, and most importantly, the freedom from fear. With our Civil War now concluded, we must make sure all our citizens, no matter their skin color or religion, can enjoy these freedoms."
CAL_liberal_unions:0 "Support Liberal Unions"
CAL_liberal_unions_desc:0 "Not all unions are nests of syndicalism. Some actually stand for the betterment of the working class, rather than just advancing the selfish goals of their leaders. We should support these unions, both to protect our workers and undercut syndicalists still hiding in the country."
CAL_mathematical_tables_project:0 "Mathematical Tables Project"
CAL_mathematical_tables_project_desc:0 "There is a misconception that the unemployed masses of America are uneducated and lazy. We will prove that this is not true. To do this, we have found some of the most talented and intelligent individuals in the country who, despite their intellect, find themselves out of luck. These individuals will tabluate higher mathematical functions among other things."
CAL_new_progressive_era:0 "New Progressive Era"

These measures will go a long way in curbing corporate mistreatment of workers while also bolstering the economy."
CAL_federal_one:0 "Federal One Project"
CAL_federal_one_desc:0 "Industrial workers aren't the only people who have to eat. The government will employ thousands of artists, musicians, actors, writers, and other cultural figures. Noone shall be denied employment discriminately in these trying times, and the work these people do is just as important as the work of anyone else. Let us give our people dignity."
CAL_agricultural_adjustment:"Agricultural Adjustment Act"
CAL_agricultural_adjustment_desc:"There are many ideas for how to help our farmers in this crisis.

### Social Democrats ###
CAL_new_nationalism:0 "New Nationalism"
CAL_new_nationalism_desc:0 "This New Nationalism regards the executive power as the steward of the public welfare. It demands of the judiciary that it shall be interested primarily in human welfare rather than in property, just as it demands that the representative body shall represent all the people rather than any one class or section of the people."
CAL_labor_relations_act:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
CAL_labor_relations_act_desc:0 "Poor relations between the owners and working classes was a major spark for the Civil War. We need to enact legislation that will ensure workers are protected from exploitation."

CAL_national_youth_adminstration:0 "National Youth Administration"
CAL_national_youth_adminstration_desc:0 "Unemployment breeds radicalism. We must ensure that the young men demobilized from the war have meaningful employment, or we will see a rise in the radicalism we spent the last few years attempting to suppress."
CAL_brain_trust:0 "Brain Trust"
CAL_brain_trust_desc:0 "The group of young new progressive Senators elected in the Farmer-Labor ticket have been deemed the 'Brain Trust' due to their Ivy-League education and radical proposals for reforming the country."
CAL_public_works:0 "Work for Welfare"
CAL_public_works_desc:0 "Under the new Works Progress Administration public work projects will be available for those on relief or are unemployed which serves a two-fold purpose; they will help repair the damage wrought by the Civil War and they will provide valuable work opportunities for those whom need it most, especially veterans."
CAL_new_anti_trust_laws:0 "New Anti-Trust Laws"

CAL_removing_money_from_politics_desc:0 "Money is a cancer that has infected our political system for decades. For too long, politicians have been at the whim of their donors in the oil and steel industries, while simultaneously ignoring their loyal supporters. This will no longer be the case. Legislation banning all forms of dark money in politics will be passed while the amount of legal money that should be allowed in donations is still being debated."
CAL_national_electricity:0 "National Electricity"
CAL_national_electricity_desc:0 "The American People need affordable electricity and they need it now.

CAL_power_of_the_ballot:0 "Power of the Ballot"
CAL_power_of_the_ballot_desc:0 "We can no longer allow for the American People to be left out of decisions concerning a government that affects them all. National initiatives and referendums should be expanded as a means to settle public debates as opposed to relying exclusively on bureaucrats and the ability to recall public officials seen as a moral right."
CAL_wealth_taxation:0 "Wealth Taxation"
CAL_wealth_taxation_desc:0 "We cannot allow America to become a new aristocracy that eliminates divine right of monarchy but replaces it with wealth.

CAL_new_public_works:0 "Public Works"
CAL_new_public_works_desc:0 "We need to knock out two for the price of one and combat both the unemployment and under-development that poses a national security risk.

It may be expensive, but the hope it offers America is priceless."
CAL_encourage_temperance:0 "Encourage Temperance"
CAL_encourage_temperance_desc:0 "Overconsumption of liquor is little more than a gateway to poverty, madness, and sloth, and it remains one of the great social ills of our times.

CAL_citizen_education:0 "Citizen Education"
CAL_citizen_education_desc:0 "All across the nation, Native American citizens are not receiving a proper, hands on education. Our Education system should implement some of John Dewey's reforms alongside a nationalistic program that promotes American values and loyalty."
CAL_national_railroads:0 "National Railroads"
CAL_national_railroads_desc:0 "Our country is sadly lacking in providing a public means of national production while the Railroad Brotherhood desires greater protection from their bosses. The solution to this comes naturally via the nationalisation of railroads, purchased with money raised by bonds via the genius of Glenn E. Plumb."
CAL_credit_unions:0 "Support Credit Unions"
CAL_credit_unions_desc:0 "It is time to shake off the influence banks have over the lives of workers, farmers and the free-laborer.

CAL_national_health_insurance:0 "National Health Insurance"
CAL_national_health_insurance_desc:0 "When our citizens fall ill they are expected to pay for the right to live.

CAL_fair_house_trade:0 "Fair House Standard Trade"
CAL_fair_house_trade_desc:0 "While trade has its place, especially for our farmers whom must export their goods, our workers can not be expected to compete with every nation on earth. It also undermines our cause to accept cheap goods from nations that do not accept similar working conditions. Goods that will lower the wages of our workers will pay a higher tariff."
CAL_protect_strikers:0 "Protect Strikers"
CAL_protect_strikers_desc:0 "Strikers are little more than workers asserting their rights in the face of abysmal working conditions and yet governors, bosses, and judges believe they have the right to make Marxists look vindicated by cracking down on these patriotic Americans. Striking will be recognized as a national right and the army will protect those whom are attacked by industrial goons."
CAL_quota_act:0 "Quota Act"
CAL_quota_act_desc:0 "With all the pressure already laid on American culture and worker wages that last thing we need is large amounts of untrained, cheap laborers pouring over the border.

CAL_food_stamps:0 "Food Stamps"
CAL_food_stamps_desc:0 "Henry Wallace had a revelation when he saw surpluses of agricultural goods on one hill and starving citizens on another. If the market won't achieve equilibrium on its own, we will give it the encouragement it needs with a food stamp program that will make it easier for poor citizens to afford farm goods."
CAL_farm_credit_act:0 "Farm Bankruptcy Act"
CAL_farm_credit_act_desc:0 "The madness of allowing our farms to close, especially in a time of depression, is utterly intolerable! A co-operative Farm Credit System will be created to provide farmers cheap loans and to prevent the avoidable foreclosure of the nations providers, for their welfare and our own."
CAL_support_long:0 "Rescue the Kingfish"
CAL_support_long_desc:0 "Is Huey Long a man without issue? Of course not; he runs a political machine and has a head the size of Mount Rushmore. However, he is an ally of the progressives in his region and his territory is a stalwart against the authoritarians while his economic policies promise to help break radicalism. We shall do for him what he is attempting to do for America and save him from the loons and cowards whom surround him."

### Radical Socialists ###
CAL_commonwealth_victory:0 "Commonwealth Victory"
CAL_commonwealth_victory_desc:0 "Sinclair has more than redeemed his 1934 loss of the Epic Plan, successfully distancing himself from the CSA as a promoter of egalitarianism and liberty that will ensure no form of Marxism gains a foothold in our Republic while giving the people what they need."
CAL_radical_taxation:0 "Radical Taxation"
CAL_radical_taxation_desc:0 "Neither the Liberals nor the Progressives go far enough in their tax plans which do little to promote true egalitarianism.

CAL_commodity_credit_corporation_desc:0 "While a depression eats away at our nation, farmers have been hit worse than almost anyone. Our farmers cry out for help, and we shall answer them.

This fundamental group will no longer be ignored."
CAL_fcwa:0 "Federal Civil Works Administration"
CAL_fcwa_desc:0 "Millions of unemployed workers still roam the streets of America. We can fix this by giving these people a simple offer: work in construction to build up our infrastructure and we will make sure you earn a decent wage while doing it. This will significantly decrease unemployment as well as increasing the prosperity of the country as a whole. The newly-created F.C.W.A. will see to this task."
CAL_federal_authority_for_land: "Federal Authority for Land"
CAL_federal_authority_for_land_desc: "With this act, we will create a Bureau of Land Management.

This is sure to be unpopular with those who wished to move into these lands, however..." 
CAL_labor_colonies:0 "Labor Colonies"
CAL_labor_colonies_desc:0 "From Robert Owen to Charles Fourier, utopian societies and colonies are nothing new in America. Now, we will promote the creation of "labor colonies", in which all workers can toil equally and live a healthy and happy life.

CAL_nationalize_oil:0 "Nationalize Oil"
CAL_nationalize_oil_desc:0 "Oil barons like John D. Rockefeller have ravaged this country for decades. He is perhaps the richest man in history while millions of Americans starve.

CAL_nationalize_communication:0 "Nationalize Communication"
CAL_nationalize_communication_desc:0 "We must go even further than Oil in our nationalization efforts. The telephone, radio, telegraph, and more have all been in private hands for too long. These things should belong to all of the American people, not just the wealthy, and we will strive to make sure this is the case."
CAL_pensions:0 "Government Pensions"
CAL_pensions_desc:0 "We will ensure that our elderly loved ones can retire with dignity. No longer will parents be a burden on their children. Instead, we will implement a system in which workers can pay into a fund that they will be able to draw from after retirement. Our elderly will live the rest of their lives in decency, no longer ashamed of their age."
CAL_the_jungle:0 "The Jungle"
CAL_the_jungle_desc:0 "The conditions workers must endure in the cities is simply unacceptable. Our public works projects will update infrastructure and factories to be in-line with what they truly need, not what the capitalist class merely wants."

CAL_aim_for_the_heart_desc:0 "Though the public did not react as intended to Sinclair's book "The Jungle", his party can now push for the increased workers rights that he was really advocating for in that book. The hearts of all Americans will drop at the sight of mistreated workers, and an outcry will come, demanding better conditions. "
CAL_hit_the_stomach:0 "Hit the Stomach"
CAL_hit_the_stomach_desc:0 "While somewhat bitter about the reaction to "The Jungle", Sinclair has realized that his readers did have a point. We must make sure that the food we feed our families is not contaminated and poisoned by corporate greed or any physical substance for that matter. Legislation will be passed to ensure clean, fresh food for all Americans."
CAL_bread_and_peace:0 "Bread and Peace"
CAL_bread_and_peace_desc:0 "Though Sinclair and his party have distanced themselves from the CSA, perhaps an agreement would be possible. After all, we have many goals in common, and though we may resume conflict at a later date, we should focus our efforts on eradicating reactionaries. It would also be a popular decision with our more left-wing supporters. It's worth a shot..."
CAL_communal_education:0 "Socialize Education"
CAL_communal_education_desc:0 "There are many new ideas that our party has about education. Some advocate for a sort of "communal education", in which children can be raised and educated by their neighbors in addition to their parents. Others call for the promotion of socialist values in our schools, in order to instill socialism in the next generation. Both of these ideas are now being considered, and will come before Congress."
CAL_union_expansion:0 "Union Expansion"
CAL_union_expansion_desc:0 "There is only one surefire way to protect the rights of the working man and that's through unionization! Unions do not desire violence but won't be afraid to strike when neccessary and demand what's theirs. We will work with like-minded union officials to aid their recruitment and protect them from crackdowns."
CAL_social_commonwealth:0 "Commonwealth of Labor"
CAL_social_commonwealth_desc:0 "With the foundation in place, we may finally become a Commonwealth of Labor by incorporating the unemployed into our programs and promoting private coops that do the same. Soon, all of the needy will be able to produce and trade with one another for what they need. Private companies will have to learn to either compete or purchase their goods at new government-set prices."
CAL_the_profits_of_religion:0 "The Profits of Religion"
CAL_the_profits_of_religion_desc:0 "While people having private religion is all good and well, many in our movement can not stand the so-called "Megachurches" or those who have made God's House into a marketplace. Churches above a certain size, including the so-called "New Thought" movement often seen in the freakish Spiritualist Party, will pay a small tax."
CAL_support_the_aclu:0 "Support the ACLU"
CAL_support_the_aclu_desc:0 "For too long, the state has been content with violating the civil rights of fellow citizens. No longer! We shall support the American Civil Liberties Union via a tax break, prosecuting violent harassment against them and waging a public campaign on their behalf while agreeing to remain politically neutral in their affairs so they can fight for the rights of all Americans."
CAL_birth_control:0 "The Pivot of Civilization"
CAL_birth_control_desc:0 "While there will be reactionaries who will denounce us, we must nonetheless go on to support the right of women to their own reproductive rights both for the individual and social good. Laws against birth control will be struck down and access to their availability in poorer neighborhoods made easier. In the long term this will aid in encouraging less productive citizens to have fewer children."
CAL_experimental_sciences:0 "Experimental Sciences"
CAL_experimental_sciences_desc:0 "If we are to be truly progressive, we must put our faith in scientific progress! There are a great deal of proposals looking for funding, and while there will surely be failures along the way, these are nothing compared to the breakthroughs that will result from increased funding to scientific endeavors, even ones that would usually be scoffed at."
CAL_radical_crusade:0 "Radical Crusade"
CAL_radical_crusade_desc:0 "The Commonwealth Party has triumphed in two elections, and now has a mandate. We can enact any goals we want, for we have been given approval by the voters themselves. We will take this opportunity to fight alcoholism, gambling, and smoking. These practices damage the moral fabric of our society, and must be crushed."
CAL_support_bellaymism:0 "Reason with the CSA"
CAL_prohibition:0 "Prohibition"
CAL_prohibition_desc:0 "There are few things damaging the working class as much as unfettered capitalism but alcohol may be a close contendor. The drink is used by the ruling classes to control their workers, and it destroys their bodies and morals alongside their families. It's time to finally complete the goals of the Anti-Saloon Leagues and illegalize liquor."
CAL_commonwealth_reelection:0 "Commonwealth Dominance"
CAL_commonwealth_reelection_desc:0 "Though many saw a Commonwealth victory as impossible in our first election, it has occured not once, but twice. Sinclair's party has ridden a wave of popularity into office once again, and promises to continue the work it began four years ago. Having passed significant economic policies, they now turn to the social realm, in the hopes of promoting a more equal society."
CAL_raise_inheritance_tax:0 "Raise Inheritance Tax"
CAL_raise_inheritance_tax_desc:0 "There are those in our society who have millions of dollars that they never toiled to earn. Why should we reward luck while we punish hard work? We must implement a harsher tax on inheritance so that the poorer among us will have food to eat or a roof to live under."
CAL_worker_bonds:0 "Worker Bonds"
CAL_worker_bonds_desc:0 "One idea that has been floated recently is the idea of worker bonds. These bonds would protect employees from wage disputes or financial obligations from their boss, and allow workers the ability to make a decent living."
CAL_reward_productivity:0 "Reward Productivity"
CAL_reward_productivity_desc:0 "We will strive to make sure that no hard working man or woman ever goes hungry again. We shall eliminate poverty and hunger by paying our workers a living wage. It is only natural, given the herculean efforts of American workers in recent years."
CAL_womens_advocacy:0 "Women's Advocacy"
CAL_womens_advocacy_desc:0 "Women make up half of our population, yet they have had little to no representation in our government for it's entire existence. This will no longer be the case. Through the creation of new women's advocacy groups, as well as the passage of new legislation, we can be sure that women will have an equal place in our society."
CAL_selective_immigration:0 "Selective Immigration"
CAL_selective_immigration_desc:0 "We must be careful to protect our workers. One way we can do this is by being selective about immigration, so that bosses don't take advantage of immigrant labor while snubbing domestic workers. This will eliminate yet another loophole that greedy capitalists often use to exploit labor. It will also raise our popularity with more conservative elements of our society."

CAL_spiritualist_takeover_desc:0 "With backing from former Federal Police members, political allies and Japan the Spiritualist Movement of President Edward Longstreet Bodin, Mankind United Leader Arthur Bell and the youthful writer, activist and Party organizer L. Ron Hubbard have seized control of the state, promising a total defense against Monarchist Anglo-Syndicalism."
CAL_power_of_information:0 "Power of Information"
CAL_power_of_information_desc:0 "Without the political connections established by the Party our hopes of saving the nation never would have been realized. Nonetheless we must expand on this, as it is barely enough to give us what little legitimacy we have. Hubbard has requested an expansion of our intelligence wing under him to further use espionage to influence Congress and, eventually, the Nation."
CAL_japanese_support:0 "Japanese Support"
CAL_japanese_support_desc:0 "Japan's financial and small loan of men was enough to help us seize the state and establish a far more friendly government to theirs than Hearst was. However taking power is often easier than keeping it and we must request additional support if we are to hope to maintain executive power, starting with renormalizing relations and undoing Hearst's so-called "Yellow Peril" before making our request."
CAL_finish_socialism:0 "Finish Socialism"
CAL_finish_socialism_desc:0 "With the political and financial support we needed it is time to end the greatest enemy ever seen to the American Nation, the socialist. Whether they are direct agents of the British Monarchy or merely useful idiots is irrelevent, all that we can be certain of is the sooner they are gone the better and that there is no shortage of potential graves in the West."
CAL_media_blackout:0 "Media Blackout"
CAL_media_blackout_desc:0 "Despite our attempts to downplay our most controversial beliefs the media continues to undermine us, with many papers calling Bodin and his followers "dictatorial conspiracy theorists". There is too much media hostility undermining us to pick and choose and undoubetdly at least some are being paid by foreign agents, so a total Media Blackout will be neccessary with a short term rooting out of dangerous critics."
CAL_christian_mysticism:0 "Christian Mysticism"
CAL_christian_mysticism_desc:0 "It is only common sense that it would be easier to rule over a population with beliefs more in-line with theirs. As such we should shift towards the Mysicalist Christian wing of the Party. We will will begin pressuring members to adopt this viewpoint and print the appropriate magazines to queitly spread."
CAL_dianetics:0 "Excalibur"
CAL_dianetics_desc:0 "We can not simply return to failed faiths to save us. A manifesto written by Hubbard, Excalibur, takes New Thought to its logical conclusion in understanding the power of the mind over the body, an invigorting idea to Party members. It may take longer for the population to be won out but after training activists to spread the word of this potential power we shall usher in a new era."
CAL_shadow_recruitment:0 "Shadow Recruitment"
CAL_shadow_recruitment_desc:0 "The Party must continue to be semi-secretive in not only its total beliefs and inner structure but in its recruitment methods. The way to do this is via the training of existing party members to subtly gather recruits among family and friends and to bring them to our new centers which will start them on the Party's Spiritual Journey via new tehcniques such as "auditing"."
CAL_ufology:0 "Ufology"
CAL_ufology_desc:0 "With our rejection of traditional faith the question of a higher power is on the minds of many inner party members. Thankfully Hubbard also has an answer to this in his outlining of the immnortal soul, Thetans, and its descendence from extraterrertials before arriving on Earth. Evidence of E.T.'s will be investigated and its full belief spread among inner-party members."
CAL_the_messengers:0 "The Messengers"
CAL_the_messengers_desc:0 "Our need for a better organized security service remains needed, as so far we have relied on loose organizations of militia members and certain government employees. The Messengers will a better funded organization in direct contact with the Eternal President of the Party, made up of our most devout followers and will always relay His word."
CAL_new_science:0 "New Sciences"
CAL_new_science_desc:0 "We can not afford to be blind to the New Sciences as so many others are if we to defend ourselves. Telekinesis, Psychic Intervention, Ectoplasm and the power of Rockets shall all be investigated as a means of long range warfare against syndicalist and foreign influence, which will also provide official government departments for more Spiritualist Party Members who already practice this."
CAL_supernatural_investigators:0 "Paranormal Investigations"
CAL_supernatural_investigators_desc:0 "If we are to promote Mysicism on the circuit then we need to buffer our claims. Reports of paranormal activity, including some written directly by Boden, must be spread among party speakers and activists alongside a new Department of the Paranormal that investigates claims of the paranormal and offers to speak with dead relatives to those who request it... at a price."
CAL_celebrity_endorsements:0 "Celebrity Endorsements"
CAL_celebrity_endorsements_desc:0 "Minor celebrities on the L.A. circuit seem open to our beliefs such as mystery writer Arthur J. Burks and Health Publicist Bernarr Macfadden. However bigger names would be of aid and so we shall have McFadden use his connections to the upper class to recruit celebriities into the cause, promising health remedies in return, and at Hubbard's urging the Party will open Celebrity Divisions."
CAL_religion_of_profit:0 "A Most Profitable Religion"
CAL_religion_of_profit_desc:0 "Currently the parties beliefs and hiearchy is very static, with few ways to move up for newcomers. However, there is a means by which one can show loyalty to our eternal movement; monetary donations. These donations would go a long way towards contributing to the cause and allow a way for some to prove their loyality, as well as helping appeal to the upper-class with promises of secret knowledge and power."
CAL_the_radio:0 "Voice of the Nation"
CAL_the_radio_desc:0 "With little in the way of media information except via government pamphlets, activists and an approved handful of publicists it is time to modernize the Party's means of communication with the public so there may be a more consistant source of news. The newly found National News Network will provide this and approve more publicists who advertise the truth."
CAL_the_redshirt_plot:0 "The Redshirt Plot"
CAL_the_redshirt_plot_desc:0 "While there are those of us aware of the connection between the House of Windsor and the syndicalist revolution, and their attempt to retake our nation via false flag operations and foreign operatives, even more are unaware or even worse skeptical. We must spread the word loudly of their intentions and further safeguard the nation from potential British Loyalists via investigations into non-native citizens."
CAL_hunt_down_every_syndicalist:0 "Avenge 1776"
CAL_hunt_down_every_syndicalist_desc:0 "With full control on the reigns of the nation we shall take back our nation from the syndicalists and their leaders, the British Monarchy, as well as the useful idiots whom fell for their plot to destroy the nation such as the Longists, Federalists and the so-called 'White Leaguers' whom often fetishize the British Nation."
CAL_betray_japan:0 "Betray Japan"
CAL_betray_japan_desc:0 "As we have established control over the situation Japan is not only no longer useful but holding us back from our full potential in retaking the United States. It is time to declare our intention to reclaim the United States and give Japan an ultimatum between sticking with us or incuring our wrath."
CAL_japan_in_command:0 "Japan in Command"
CAL_japan_in_command_desc:0 "Japan has been remarkably kind to us thus far. Let us further bolster our relations with them by signing a military alliance. This will put us in the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" and allow Japan greater influence over our affairs. With their help, we will be able to exert our influence across the Western Hemisphere..."
CAL_government_reconstruction:0 "Government Restructuring"
CAL_government_reconstruction_desc:0 "It is time to remodel our government, with some Japanese influences. We will allow the Army and Navy more power than ever before, and the President will attempt to emulate the majesty of the Japanese Emperor himself. What could go wrong?"
CAL_japanese_trade:0 "Japanese Trade"
CAL_japanese_trade_desc:0 "The Pacific Ocean is vast, yet on the other side lies the wealth of the Orient. Through Japan, we can access vast wealth and a multitude of trading partners. We will sign a trade agreement with them in order to bring our nations closer together."
CAL_cultural_exchange_2:0 "Cultural Exchange Programs"
CAL_cultural_exchange_2_desc:0 "Despite the previously hostile relationship between the West Coast and Asia, we will now strive to bring the two regions closer together, particularly in the case of Japan. We will encourage travel between the two countries and a sort of cultural exchange will hopefully occur. The first prominent citizen we will send is Walt Disney, who will bring some of his animations to show the Emperor."
CAL_friends_in_the_east:0 "Special Relationship With Japan"
CAL_friends_in_the_east_desc:0 "We will pursue a special relationship with Japan, who is our closest ally and  largest trading partner. With trans-Pacific cooperation, there is little our two countries cannot achieve. We are set to conduct naval exercises near Guam soon. Now we must seek to dominate the hinterlands of our respective regions..."

CAL_commons_law:0 "Commons Law"
CAL_commons_law_desc:0 "Economist John Commons made an excellent observation that resources belong to all and that a tax would help prevent overusing them while also funding public goods. Thus, resource extraction shall have a tax."
CAL_national_referendums:0 "National Referendum"
CAL_national_referendums_desc:0 "While democracy in and of itself is not a flawed concept, the failings of the crony capitalism that permeated the old systems were laid bare by the Civil War. We need to ensure that democracy now works for everyone."
CAL_blanket_primary:0 "Blanket Primary"
CAL_blanket_primary_desc:0 "Forcing voters to stick along party lines can be just as restrictive as moneyed influence, thus blanket primaries will allow them to select primary candidates without regard to party."
CAL_recall_elections:0 "Election Recall"
CAL_recall_elections_desc:0 "If our legislatures and executives are going to represent the people they must be tethered to their will. We will enact the possibility of congressional, state and local recall elections via referendum so the voters can hold their politicians responsible."
CAL_strengthen_democracy:0 "Judicial Recall"
CAL_strengthen_democracy_desc:0 "Recall should not only be present for the executive and legislative branch, but for justices as well, or otherwise corrupt or tyrannical judges would risk going unpunished."
CAL_kill_gold:0 "Destroy the Tyranny of Gold"
CAL_kill_gold_desc:0 "Gold forced our economy to prioritize inflation over debt-holders and to cut during economic downturns which only hurt the population. Without Gold we will have a more flexible monetary and fiscal policy."
CAL_tariff_reduction_act:0 "Tariff Reduction Act"
CAL_tariff_reduction_act_desc:0 "We must reduce tariffs on goods from other countries, as our current laws are hurting American workers and farmers. In turn, other countries will lower their tariffs on our goods, and we will be able to export more than ever before.This act will put us one step closer to economic prosperity, not just for the rich, but for all Americans."
CAL_womens_bill:0 "American Women's Bill"
CAL_womens_bill_desc:0 "We will sign into law legislation that gives women more equal rights in our society, in areas ranging from divorce to propety to voting."

CAL_fpc:0 "Federal Power Commission"
CAL_fpc_desc:0 "This commission has been created with the goal of creating hydroelectric projects on government land, as well as regluating the electric and natural gas industries. We can keep a close eye on these companies while simultaneously bolstering our energy and infrastructure."
CAL_glass_steagall:0 "Glass–Steagall"
CAL_glass_steagall_desc:0 "Investment and retail banking have long been intertwined, encouraging the kind of instability we saw with runs on the banks when bank investments soured. We must formally separate the two."
CAL_FDIC:0 "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"
CAL_FDIC_desc:0 "We can not allow people to lose their entire deposits simply because the banks fail them! The FDIC will insure depositors up to a certain point and in the process restore confidence in the banking system."
CAL_AFDC:0 "Aid to Families with Dependent Children"
CAL_AFDC_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, some large families in poverty need some more aid. We should pass the AFDC to grant direct welfare for large families with children. This will free up time for many of our workers, allow them to be less stressed about their families, hence making them more efficient."

### Market Liberals Win Twice###
CAL_republicans_win_twice:0 "Republicans Win Re-Election"
CAL_republicans_win_twice_desc:0 "It appears that the pro-industry, laissez-faire ways of the Republican Party have been vindicated as the Pacific States entrust them to bring prosperity to America with their agenda. With a new mandate, they are confident they will be able to do just that."
CAL_rfc:0 "Reconstruction Finance Corporation"
CAL_rfc_desc:0 "Amongst one of many of Hoover's unrecognized contributions to the nation include the RFC, which would give loans to banks and other sectors that did not qualify for the Federal Reserve. So long as its powers are limited and it is better funded it will aid our efforts."
CAL_dam_projects:0 "Dam Projects"
CAL_dam_projects_desc:0 "Dams have many purposes in our society; from being a source of power and clean water to a controller of floods, these marvels of technology will change our society forever. We must do everything we can to promote their construction and invest in further Dam technology."
CAL_radical_decentralization:0 "Decentralized Market"
CAL_radical_decentralization_desc:0 "We must implement radical changes to our markets. No longer will the federal government breathe down the necks of local and state markets. Instead, local banks will become more prominent in our economy, and we will support a market run by the states."
CAL_support_wet_laws:0 "Support Wet Laws"
CAL_support_wet_laws_desc:0 "Why should we ban alcohol when we can profit off of it? This is not the time to turn away revenue, and our economy would be greatly bosltered by an influx of alcohol profits. Our party will seek to pass new wet laws in our country that will allow for this to occur."
CAL_support_right_to_work:0 "Right-to-Work"
CAL_support_right_to_work_desc:0 "It is bad enough that unions have been allowed to flourish in our society. There is little we can currently do to counteract this. However, what we can do is make sure that no worker will be forced to pay for union representation. Their money will be better spent elsewhere..."
CAL_scientific_taxation:0 "Scientific Taxation"
CAL_scientific_taxation_desc:0 "There are many in our country and even our government who argue that we must raise taxes to increase revenue. However, businessman Andrew Mellon has challenged this notion, instead arguing that lower taxes would lead to more economic growth.

CAL_surplus_aid:0 "Surplus Aid"
CAL_surplus_aid_desc:0 "Not only have we successfully balanced the budget, we now have a surplus. We will use these funds to help those who need it most: our nation's farmers. In doing so, we can smooth things over with formerly rebellious farmers and bring them into the fold."
CAL_invest_in_children:0 "Support Orphans"
CAL_invest_in_children_desc:0 "Every child should be given a chance in our society. It is unfortunate that there exist people whose parents have abandoned them.

### Social Conservatives Win Twice###
CAL_democrats_win_twice:0 "Democrats Win Re-Election"
CAL_democrats_win_twice_desc:0 "The Democratic Party has seen some successes since the First Civil War. Now we are beginning a new era of popularity in our country, and we should use it to our advantage. Immoral practices such as partial nudity and alcoholism should be discouraged if not outright banned. At the same time, we must support farmers, who are the backbone of America, and workers, who make our country function."
CAL_reefer_madness:0 "Reefer Madness"
CAL_reefer_madness_desc:0 "The practice of reefing, which refers to the smoking of marijuana, should be outlawed and cracked down upon. A society in which hard drugs are allowed to flourish will soon be no society at all. Who knows what other behaviors could be encouraged if this was allowed to continue?"
CAL_patriotic_schooling:0 "Patriotic Schooling"
CAL_patriotic_schooling_desc:0 "One of the causes of the recent Second Civil War is the lack of patriotism in our schools. Our children should be encouraged, if not required, to sing the national anthem, as well as learn about our traditions and folklore stories. This will instill a sense of patriotism within them that will prevent another civil war."
CAL_vice_squads:0 "Fight Crime"
CAL_vice_squads_desc:0 "We will implement a new law enforcement branch that will serve to enforce the law when police officers or the national guard cannot.

CAL_sex_laws:0 "Decency Laws"
CAL_sex_laws_desc:0 "There are those whom believe they can profit from selling smut and/or disgusting "sex aids" in public stores. No store should be legally allowed to sell such things, at least not so publicly.

CAL_support_farms:0 "Support Agriculture"
CAL_support_farms_desc:0 "Farms are the backbone of our democracy and our  culture. The Democratic Parties Agricultural Bill will raise farm subsidies and encourage businesses to purchase from them in bulk, with the government covering the cost of any goods that spoil."
CAL_blue_laws:0 "Blue Laws"
CAL_blue_laws_desc:0 "It is unbelievable that on Sundays people must work when they are supposed to be relaxing and spending time with their families. Our Blue Laws will kill two birds with one stone, appeasing workers who may be sympathetic to socialism and promoting family values by requiring employers to pay overtime on Sundays."

### Anti-Civil Rights###
CAL_ban_race_mixing:0 "Federal Ban on Race Mixing"
CAL_ban_race_mixing_desc:0 "Race-Mixing will cause nothing more than the downfall of the caucasian race, as documented by men such as Madison Grant. For the sake of civilization race-mixing must be banned."
CAL_jazz_crackdown:0 "Jazz Crackdown"
CAL_jazz_crackdown_desc:0 "Jazz is not merely a harmless hobby for the black community but an insidious means of seducing white women or a hub of drugs as is documented in the Hearst Papers. Some well-enforced raids and investigations should cut down on this."
CAL_blind_eye:0 "Turn a Blind Eye"
CAL_blind_eye_desc:0 "While the Klan is our enemy when they seek to take control of the state the point that mobs will sometimes enforce rules where the law can not still stands. It would ease our relations with them if we appointed judges who seemed more open to this view."
CAL_lily_white_movement:0 "New Lily White Movement"
CAL_lily_white_movement_desc:0 "Politics is the place of native White Americans, not of minorities who do not have the countries interests at heart or the means to unite the nation. The parties and local houses will do its best to only support white candidates."

CAL_repatriation:0 "Mexican Repatriation"
CAL_repatriation_desc:0 "Mexicans come here to work on our farms, and that is what they must do. They must not be allowed to settle here as citizens of our country, however. When they are no longer useful in this regard, they should be sent back to their country. They will be able to take the money they made back to their families, and our people will be separate from theirs, as they should be."
CAL_denounce_race_hatred:0 "Denounce Race Hatred"
CAL_denounce_race_hatred_desc:0 "Though we are still developing comprehsive racial policies, we should send a message to our people. Whether we create a separate or integrated society, hatred of other races is intolerable. We are all trying to survive in our own ways, and recently, there has been enough hatred in this country for a lifetime. Let us do what we can to remove one source of it."
CAL_oppose_radicals:0 "Oppose Radicals"
CAL_oppose_radicals_desc:0 "Sinclair and Hearst have pushed radical and oftentimes offensive ideas on race. We must maintain the traditional social order while making some adjustments to allow cooperative minority families to flourish.

CAL_conditional_black_aid:0 "Conditional Black Aid"
CAL_conditional_black_aid_desc:0 "Aid will be given to Black families who prove they can contribute to society in a meaningful way and do not foolishly cross established boundaries.

CAL_support_seperatism:0 "Calm Racial Conservatives"
CAL_support_seperatism_desc:0 "We have made much progress in the area of racial policy, yet now we must deal with the repercussions of that. We will reassure conservatives that society will remain separate, and that no racial mixing will occur. Our society will be separate, but equal."
CAL_quota_adjustments:0 "Quota Adjustments"
CAL_quota_adjustments_desc:0 "The Emergency Quota of 1921, made permanent in 1924, dramatically restricted immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe and completely banned it from Asia. Perhaps it is time to reconsider these restrictions so that we can help our devastated population grow again."

### Civil Rights ###
CAL_hire_black_americans:0 "Hire Black Americans"
CAL_hire_black_americans_desc:0 "Discriminating against Black Americans in the workplace will only hurt our country and our labor force. If we are to compete with the major powers of the world, we must allow all people to get a job, should they seek one. We will encourage this behavior in the Black community and show that Black people can work just as hard as anyone else."
CAL_encourage_integration:0 "Encourage Integration"
CAL_encourage_integration_desc:0 "There is no reason why Blacks and Whites cannot live together in harmony.

CAL_fund_black_education:0 "Fund Black Education"
CAL_fund_black_education_desc:0 "For too long, Black people have been limited in their options for a good education.

CAL_negro_bureau:0 "Negro Bureau"
CAL_negro_bureau_desc:0 "We have struck a deal with prominent Black leaders, many of whom were rabidly opposed to the C.A.R., and now demand we reform or remove the old discrimination laws. The Negro Bureau will promote cooperation between these leaders and our government with the goal of improving the lot of Blacks nationwide. Another more secret provision is cooperation against anti-Black radicals."
CAL_national_immigration_act:0 "Immigration Act Reformed"
CAL_national_immigration_act_desc:0 "We must ease restrictions on immigrants coming into our country. Prominent liberals in our government have suggested we rescind the prohibition on Asian immigrants and allow some workers from across the border to remain in the country with their families. This will improve relations with these countries and give us more manpower."

Kaiser, while Oregon Senator and former military officer Charles H Martin is running to his right. As the party bosses are unsure about the enthusiasm either men generate, there is a proposal to draft the popular businessman and cultural figure Walt Disney. This is partly because his top men have teased the idea of him running. While the last of these proposals is unorthodox, the Democratic Party has suffered from several splits, and may need a more unifying figure to win. Who shall be the nominee for the Democratic Party?"

These pamphlets were traced to an organization called the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World, whose leadership appears to advocate in favor of a Pacific Japanese Alliance that advocates for unrestricted imperial growth of Japan in Asia.

Consequently county clerk W. G. Sharp followed California Law and refused to give them their marriage licenses.\n\nHowever, Perez with the help of their lawyer, Daniel G. Marshall, brought forth a writ of Writ of Mandamus. Within the trial, one of the arguments that was brought up was the fact that both Perez and Davis were Catholic and wanted a Catholic Marriage that included mass.

He promised that when elected President he would hold MacArthur to his promise to step down and in the meantime would put an end to crime, syndicalism and unemployment in the Pacific States through state sponsored programs under his National Democratic Party which is officially yet another breakaway from the Democratic party."
pacificstates.207.a:0 "Absurd"

pacificstates.208.t:0 "AFP-Progressive Unity"
pacificstates.208.d:0 "The Progressive Party has seemingly absorbed the local America First Party and has called for closer cooperation with Huey Long in the war and to call for a new presidential election once most of America is reunited, doubtlessly an attempt to further unite progressives in both Long and the PSA's territory. Long himself praised the party for its Americanism and desire to help the common man and has called on the Share the Wealth Society to aid the Progressives."

pacificstates.2080.d:0 "Louis B. Meyer is a co-founder of MGM Studios and a major ally of the PSA, being a leading member of the GOP despite not holding office and helping coordinate propaganda efforts through his company. However, he and his allies in Congress have recently flouted a reform to the Constitution that they claim would gain us needed support by allowing non-native citizens to run for President if they are naturalized citizens. While Mayer is clearly eyeing a run for the Presidency which his birth in the Russian Empire, gaining his and other immigrants support may be helpful even if some natives are angered by the reform."

pacificstates.209.t:0 "Celebrity Endorsements"
pacificstates.209.d:0 "With the high-stakes nature of the election and their disproportionate influence in the Pacific States celebrities have taken to running for candidates, with Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn giving a radio ad together for the Progressive Party while Charlie Chaplin gave a whole-hearted endorsement to the Commonwealth Party whilst Upton Sinclair stood behind him, glowing. Meanwhile professional cowboy John Wayne, famous for his lead role in the hit Singing Daisies, has given an interview endorsing the Democratic Party although he also said he wan't particularly opposed to Hearst's ideas. Henry Fonda and Marie Dressler endorsed the Democratic-Republicans and when the latter was asked why joked that 'Opposites make the best couples'. However ultimately a plethora of stars such as Ginger Roger, Dick Powell and most famously of all Clark Gable have stuck by the traditional party of Hollywood, the Republican Party, giving them a much needed boost although a handful such as Hedda Hopper have crossed over to the now more consistantly conservative Democratic Party, giving both of the mainstream conservative parties a much needed boost."

pacificstates.210.d:0 "Williams Randolph Hearst, a man notable for being disliked by the common people on a personal level, has been using his papers to make sure people still feel he is the only viable option. The Hearst Papers make sure to run articles on the death toll resulting from the war with MacArthur that Hearst promises to put an end to, with numbers experts are calling inflated. Furthermore he has published increasing stories about local crime and the rampaging of both syndicalists and gangsters, Canada and Japan's plotting against America and, most absurdly, the other parties plotting with the CSA."

pacificstates.211.d:0 "The Liberal Party, officially the Democratic-Republican Party, has released their promise to deliver a New Justice for the American People to ensure the instability that caused the Civil War never again occurs. They promise reforms to banking, health, social security and work programs amongst other reforms. They are taking flak from both sides of the spectrum with the Progressives and Commonwealth calling their reforms 'halfway' measures that will spend taxpayer money with little return while the parties to their right have mocked them for promising voters they can have their cake and eat it too, presumably a reference to the Democratic-Republicans/Liberal Party to maintain a balanced budget the whole time they are doing this."

pacificstates.214.d:0 "Upon election Hearst has called for an immediate ceasefire with MacArthur, a popular move among most citizens of the Pacific as soldiers either return home or get less dangerous tasks. Unsurprisngly MacArthur praised the move even though reportedly the WCC simply accepted on his behalf without even asking him, calling Hearst a Red-Blooded American saving the country from both socialism and the new confederates. Huey Long, however, has railed against Hearst as a tyrant, a coward and a "wimpy rich boy", alongside the socialists and Old Democrats."

On all sides he is being attacked as an authoritarian betraying the very nature of the Pacific States defense of democracy, much to Hearst's consternation whom has responded by attacking said papers through his media empire."

However their owner Harry Chandler has been wise enough to recognize the media crackdown will inevitably turn to the L.A.

Some, of course, have denounced this as a move towards a overt dictatorship.

pacificstates.222.d:0 "The Spiritualist Party is a vaguely right-wing entity that has merged various fringe organizations associated with conspiricism and unorthodox religious beliefs, amongst other profitable new faiths. The 'Party' is led by Edwin Longstreet Bodin and as he is simply too fringe to win the election he has settled for endorsing William Randolph Hearst, promising to protect Mr. Hearst from syndicalist spies and praising his anti-British stance.

This includes neighborhood watch groups, nativist organizations and even some local Klan chapters that have not thrown in their lot with the CAR. However the most prominent of these various groups is the Spiritualist Party whom have given the government a list of possible CSA spies and have offered to conduct further intelligence gathering if given support in the form of funds and sharing intel.

Can we really trust Japanese immigrants to not simply be loyalists to their old government? Jack Tenney does not think so, having put forward a proposal to reform the Immigration Act to ban all Japanese immigration. Of course some industrialists are opposed but the National Democratic Party, especially congressman James B. Utt, is heavily in favor of the reform."

pacificstates.226.t:0 "Investigate the GOP"
pacificstates.226.d:0 "With the Commonwealth Federation beaten down the Republican Party has become the most prominent opponent to Hearst's statism and MacArthurite sympathies. With this the GOP leadership has been called into public inquires on charges of war profiterring and a subtle campaign to disturb the nations stability to profit from the Civil War. The accusations range from connections with the "radical" progressives formerly within the GOP, their initial push for conflicts with MacArthur and their legalizing of the syndicalist parties under Herbert Hoover./n/n Howard Hughes was the first GOP associated industrial magnate to be called to answer for his part in lobbying officials to both continue the war effort and to buy his products while doing so. However the public questioning went haywire when Hughes turned aroudn the questions onto his inquisitor, Jack Tenney, by asking him if he had been helping Hearst corner the newspaper market despite Hearst now being a public official. Likewise he accused Hearst and his men such as Tenney and John Z. Anderson of engaging in lobbying efforts on behalf of the California-subsidary of the Bethel corporation to focus on ship-building contracts despite the war taking place on the same continent. It made it especially difficult to demonize Hughes as he readily admitted to lobbbying but said it was not only a common practice but that Tenney and Hearst were corrupt hypocrites and unlike them he never lobbied for a cause he didn't believe in."

pacificstates.227.t:0 "Opposition Infuriated"
pacificstates.227.d:0 "The Commonwealthers, the Progressives, the GOP and the Democratic-Republican party have been reinvigorated by Hearst's obvious attempts to shut down the opposition and the disaster of the Hughes inquisition.

pacificstates.228.t:0 "Protests Increase"
pacificstates.228.d:0 "The Protests have grown out of control with riots breaking out in San Francisco which are targeting the Federalist Police whom are forced to retreat. The military is on stand-by in the capital with General DeWitt claiming he has the means to crush the rioters now if he sent his forces in now. However while Hearst was considering the move General Arnold reported with his chief men that there were reports of a riot about to break out in the city itself and recommended he stay behind with a platoon to keep order and that Hearst could send the Federalist Police (FP) with DeWitt to support him. What should we do?"

pacificstates.230.t:0 "Protests Put down"
pacificstates.230.d:0 "It appears the protesters have been successfully subdued by DeWitt's forces but nonetheless he is occupying the area to maintain order for the moment. Nonetheless with at least three Americans dead in the conflict it is far from a public success until the Hearst papers can put the proper spin on how the President saved the nation from dangerous radicals whom plotted to hand the nation to syndicalism and murder every non-socialist man, woman and child in arms reach."

pacificstates.2301.t:0 "Feds push them back"
pacificstates.2301.d:0 "The Feds are successfully holding their own against the usurpers. With DeWitt catching wind of the attempted coup they are now retreating before he arrives with his men.

While he denied being a syndicalist himself and stated that he was opposed to overthrowing the constitution he could not deny having had friendly relations with revolutionary leftists or that he was still in contact with them. He in turn denounced the committee for 'authoritarianism', a claim that appears to have struck a chord as Commonwealth publications repeated it en masse.

A military tribunal had him found guily on counts of racketeering, assault, drug trafficking, conspiring against the state and murder amongst a plethora of other crimes. Activists (especially the ACLU) are angered by the execution, protesting the use of a military tribunal and the swift nature of the execution not allowing for an appeal which they feel violates constitutional rights.

While this would make them de facto monopolies it can't be that the idea of having our cake and eating it too is quite tempting as we will be giving citizens access to cheaper goods without having to get into managing such industries directly."

It starts with Donald Duck humorously para-dropping into Northern Florida and narrowly escaping being eaten by alligators. He then goes on to dodge Klan snipers (drawn as clear stereotypes of southerners) before accidentally destroying an enemy navy base."
pacificstates.256.a:0 "Hilarious!"

pacificstates.257.t:0 "The Chief's Face"
pacificstates.257.d:0 "A new Disney film taking aim at General MacArthur has been released! It depicts Donald Duck awakening to a military march outside his home by fanatical federalist supporters before being forced to go to work building armaments for them. It pokes fun at MacArthur's perceived authoritarianism, claims of upholding democracy, and militarism. The short ends with Donald waking up from this nightmare in San Francisco, thanking God that he lives in the Pacific States."

pacificstates.258.t:0 "Entente sends goods"
pacificstates.258.d:0 "Canada has taken a liking to our pro-Entente stance and our fervently anti-syndicalist democracy. As such, it is no surprise that the faction of liberalism is aiding us. Of course, cynics believe they are simply hedging their bets and may be aiding other factions as well, but we will not forget this regardless."
pacificstates.258.a:0 "For Democracy!"

pacificstates.259.t:0 "Comic Codes Authority"
pacificstates.259.d:0 "With our campaign against immorality, the Comic Codes Authority has been founded by the Comic Book industry to carve out much of the 'smut' that makes up modern entertainment. It bans profanity, obscenity, smut, seduction, vulgarity, nudity, horror, excessive bloodshed, gory or gruesome crimes, depravity, lust, sadism, masochism, walking dead, torture, vampires and vampirism, ghouls, cannibalism, werewolfism, depictions of criminals in any positive light, the negative display of authority figures, and more. They also ban the words "horror" and "terror" in their titles, which has been met with accusations that it's an attempt by John Goldwater and other figures at Archie Comics, the main force behind the CCA, to put their rivals out of business. Nonetheless it is an attack on immorality and one that is not officially government as any comic that does not abide by it will simply not be given a CCA sticker."
pacificstates.259.a:0 "Very well"

pacificstates.260.t:0 "Universities Refuse to Support Immorality"
pacificstates.260.d:0 "Universities in our nation are increasingly refusing to carry works that are being labeled 'dangerous' and/or anti-social. Marxist, hard-left, 'offensive' and 'anti-American' works are decreasingly being carried by universities and libraries, and universities such as UC Berkeley have agreed to apply the Levering Act to their own universities, effectively banning communists and syndicalists from teaching there."
pacificstates.260.a:0 "A productive development"

pacificstates.261.t:0 "Industrial League for Clean Living"
pacificstates.261.d:0 "The Industrial League for Clean Living is a grouping of businessmen, largely deriving from the Rotary Club, who are in full-agreement with our governments policies. They pay workers extra, both in money and benefits, for being socially responsible, while threatening to penalize individuals whom are socially irresponsible. This can range from abandoning children to drug use. While the extra benefits they provide workers are popular, some take issue with what they see as business leaders influencing their workers lives but their can be no doubt it is leading to positive social effects."
pacificstates.261.a:0 "A positive event"

pacificstates.263.t:0 "Harry Bridges arrested"
pacificstates.263.d:0 "Pacific syndicalist leader Harry Bridges was arrested today, which will likely result in him being deported from the states given his birth in Australiasia. While we have successfully captured many syndicalist leaders whom occupied a legal grey area, Bridges capture was considered necessary as he was utterly pro-CSA and an effective organizer, and as such his arrest will disrupt syndicalist activities."
pacificstates.263.a:0 "Good"

pacificstates.264.t:0 "Defense Attorney's Attacked"
pacificstates.264.d:0 "The defense attorneys assigned to defend various syndicalist defendants accused of spying for the CSA or internal sabotage have been attacked in recent days.

Apparently a journalist went undercover to investigate the state of mental hospitals where women found to be anti-social or otherwise mentally unfit were sent and the result was a horror story, with the story claiming that many of the women there merely violated a law but were mentally sound.

pacificstates.269.d:0 "Hollywood has long been suspected of housing some syndicalist supporters who seek to use modern media to sneak their insidious messages. This has been all but confirmed now as a list of Hollywood screenwriters and directors affiliated with the IWW and its allies was publicly released in papers such as Variety, leading to legal investigation. Now ten of those being investigated have been found in contempt for refusing to answer questions from Congressional Senators, whom are already being nicknamed the Hollywood Ten."

pacificstates.270.d:0 "There is a large-scale blowback to supposed leftist influence in Hollywood, with many executives viewing it as confirmation that striking and otherwise unruly workers are syndicalist agitators. As such the Motion Pictures Alliance for Defending American Ideals has been founded as a win of the MPA with the goal of investigating radical influence in Hollywood. Those uncovered for their sympathies, now including mega-star Charlie Chaplin, have been placed on a 'Blacklist' that virtually excludes them from work. Of course, some view this as a 'betrayal' of our ideals and are calling on us to not give the idea congressional support."

pacificstates.272.t:0 "Protests!"
pacificstates.272.d:0 "Liberal university students guided by student organization and leftist faculty members have begun protesting what they consider increasing censorship within society, kickstarted by university professors being sacked for refusing to take loyalty oaths. They accuse the government of being little different from MacArthur, an absurd claim given that the universities enacted moral codes without being forced to. Nonetheless is can not be denied that there are fewer books in the library, greater screening of the political views of faculty and a general trend towards greater monitoring of students. Journalists are sympathetic to them whom call us "pearl clutchers" , so it may increase support to talk university faculty into reversing some of their codes. Of course, while many of the faculty and students are Left Democrats it is an open secret some have syndicalist sympathies, something that could make it easy to simply attack them."

For the low price of $$200, Families across the county will be able to experience entertainment currently only available at cinemas with all the convenience of using a home radio. Although there are not a lot of programs to watch on this new entertainment medium, some of the major players in the radio business are moving in along with DuMont himself establishing a new television network. At the current rate, experts believe that most Americans will have a television set in their home within ten years."

And of course California locals more than welcome the additional work available on sets as well."

pacificstates.276.d:0 "It appears that private investors have becomed concerned with market investments in these unstable times! The rumors spreading that our military has questionable loyalties to radical ideologies are nonsense but with the overvaluing of already risky investments of those already using their new income and market prospects rather unwisely has nonetheless caused investors to pull funds out of the stock market in the fear of collapse. It will take a bit of time to recover, though it should when it becomes clear that these conspiracy theories are not real."

pacificstates.303.d:0 "William Randolph Hearst has begun denouncing the government in his papers, accusing us of syndicalist sympathies and of attacking liberty. The GOP papers have followed suit though in a more restrained manner. It is little secret that Hearst is considered a MacArthur loyalist and desires the downfall of our government, especially after his taxes were hiked. The question is if this is enough to have him investigated for treacherous activity or if doing so would stray too far into authoritarianism. An investigation by the Pacific Bureau would not only involve Hearst but also his many columnists whom seem to be bordering on treacherous activity."

Our policy of easing access to contraceptives and abortion angered practicing Catholics in our region and now that "Sister" Aimee Semple McPherson's church is being taxed the two have combined political forces to oppose us. However progressives are supportive of our policies, believing it will lead to a more stable, intelligent soceity.

Of course Japan may well be interested in instilling itself in our politics, perhaps in response to our recent saber-rattling. While Hearst is famously paranoid of Japan the Spiritualists are still useful for aid in domestic intelligence and the collaboration, even if wholly true, likely means little. What should we do?"

pacificstates.351.d:0 "From L.A. Edward Longstreet Bodin, leader of the increasingly organized Spiritualist Party, has made a radio announcement that William Randolph Hearst has been overthown by treachourous foreign agents within the army. Naming George Marshall and Henry Arnold as the leaders of the conspiracy against the 'democratically-elected President of the Pacific States', Bodin accused them of taking orders from the King in Ottawa whom sought to destroy Hearst for opposing Anglo-Syndicalism. Declaring his intentions to push back against these traitors he says Japan is willing to aid in the counter-attack against foreign powers and has gifted the Spiritualists a small garrrison to support their militias, remaining Federal Police and all those who would rise with them against British Anarchism. While our loyalists would likely be able to defeat these forces the fact that the coup is not going as swiftly as planned has endangered the whole plan, with members of Congress and Spiritualist-connected politicians denouncing us and General DeWitt likely to oppose us with his own forces, we may have to look at fleeing to the safety of the Entente via the sea."

pacificstates.352.d:0 "Our garrison holding Bakersfield has been attacked by General DeWitt, supported by an auxiliary of Japanese troops and militants! Losses are heavy on both sides and we are losing public support rapidly, but while a tactic defeat in that we had to retreat to the Lost Hills we should expect success if we counter-attack, with our opponents having exhausted their best men. Nonetheless, this would incur even more losses and could leave us even less popular, with some of our cabinet preferring to retreat rather than cause more damage to California."

From the American Union State, we have decided to try and bring Pelley under our wing, as he has expressed certain mystic beliefs in the past and it may be that he could be made to believe in our doctrines. From the Constitutional American Republic, there is George S. Patton. Patton is a controversial figure due to how many Americans he was responsible for killing, whether it was direct or not, during the Civil War. However, he is also fairly popular, and sparing him would be a good choice. He has also expressed an interest in various religions and in the mystical realm as a whole, so perhaps he would be a good candidate for conversion. We could also rehabilitate both of these men, though this would be less popular, or we could jail both, which is likely the most popular option. Regardless, if we do rehabilitate these men, we will place them in charge of their own parties, though these parties will not have any real power. Instead, they will serve as figureheads that further legitimize our regime."

The Spiritualists who are sympathetic to Japan argue that we should have aim propaganda towards the masses, as conversion is the most direct way to spread our influence. The other Spiritualists are somewhat dividied, but generally agree that some sort of miracle should be achieved in order to convert the masses. Some wish to see an investment in rocket technology, in the hopes of gaining a better understanding of U.F.O.'s and perhaps joining them among the stars someday. There are others who reject this idea and instead insist that we should focus on radio technology for the benefits it will have in paranormal investigations. Such technology would allow us to detect the paranormal and perhaps even communicate with them. Our most religious supporters insist that we emphasize our religious doctrine in contrast to other faiths such as Christianity or Islam, particularly our faith's American roots as compared with these other religions.

The charges are many, but the most damning ones are of treason to the American government, constitution, and people. These men and women were brainwashed by foreign syndicalists and proceeded to kill many of their fellow citizens. Further, they were the worst of the rebels, as they aimed to completely change our way of life to fit their greed. As such, there will be no pardoning for these parasites, but we still must decide what to do with them. Ultimately, the jury has decided to....."

pacificstates.3524.d:0 "During the Civil War, Japan was our closest ally, giving us sorely-needed equipment, manpower, and more. Now that the war is over, however, it is time we decided what to do with them. We are on equal footing now, and can make certain demands. The question is, what do we ask for? Some argue that we should ask for full control over Hawaii, which was, after all, American territory before the war. Regardless of who owns the island chain, combined Japanese and American pressure would surely force it back into American hands, should it come to that. Others believe it would suffice to repay them for their help during the conflict and otherwise leave the relationship as it was before the war. Of course, hardliners insist that we go further than these half-measures. What should we do?"

He has pledged "the Body and Mind" of the Spiritualist movement and its allies to the Pacific as its protectors from foreign spies, and that he would root out the enemy, whatever the cost. He also announced that he would be sending out arrest warrents for those whom were proven to have connections to Canada, the coup, and foreign syndicalism. While their allies within Congress and those most concerned about the coup supported the decision, much of Congress remained silent to the decision. At one point, Homer Bone openly called him a "crackpot", causing chuckles and jeers from sectors of Congress. Nonetheless, after calling for order, Bodin stated that the time for political impotence was finished."

pacificstates.3529.d:0 "MacArthur has become increasingly concerned with his allies on the West Coast. Our ally, William Randolph Hearst, was deposed in a military coup. Though the loss of Hearst made MacArthur furious, it seems that the situation has evolved rapidly. Now, a group calling themselves the Spiritualists, led by Edward Longstreet Bodin, has performed a counter-coup against the millitary. This group claims to want to continue Hearst's legacy, but it is clear that they have their own agenda, and MacArthur will have to decide how to proceed. Should we restore order to this "Wild West" or leave it alone for now?"

Even worse, in light of the recent chaos, they have decided that they would be better off restoring order to our region themselves rather than letting us manage it. As such, they have broken our peace treaty and now march against us!"

pacificstates.3531.d:0 "A meeting occurred the other day in the recently-finished cabinet room within the White House. Several ministers were present, including extraterrestrial advisor Jack Parsons, propaganda minister Clark Ashton Smith, paranormal advisor Joseph Augustus Winter, and religious advisor Paul Twitchell. The men were seen meeting with L. Ron Hubbard, and though the various discussions taking place were meant to be secret, it seems someone was recording them. Winter suggested that it may have been a figure that could pass through walls and appear invisible to outside observers. Parsons believes this is nonsense, instead arguing that aliens had been listening in and leaked the meeting to the press. In any case, we must find the mole in our administration, for we have not yet fully converted the American people, and they cannot know the full extent of our regime yet. What should we do?"

Though Disney's political career was a failure, he is a talented businessman and animator, and the emperor was quite curious to see some of his work. The two apparently entered a room and watched "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves" with several of the emperor's close advisors. Later, Disney was seen laughing with the emperor at dinner. It seems the meeting went well, and that the Japanese emperor would like to adopt this style of animation to his own country, promising to hire animators of his own to emualte the American."

pacificstates.3533.t:0 "Foo Fighter!"
pacificstates.3533.d:0 "The term 'foo fighter' was used by aircraft pilots during the Civil War to describe mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over the American, European and Pacific theaters of operations. This phenomenon caused a lot of interest, but also unrest, among both the military and the civilian population. Some saw them as a sign from God or as spirits, others thought they were aliens, and still others thought it was a natural phenomenon. What will the position of our government be?"

pacificstates.3534.t:0 "New archaeology and historiography"
pacificstates.3534.d:0 "As early as the nineteenth century, it was speculated that the Mississippian mysterious mound builders belonged to a lost white race. This meant that in the past there had been contacts between the old world and the pre-Columbian Americas. Thesis was rejected after 1890 after the work of Cyrus Thomas. Other researchers ware still interested in this topic. American archaeologist Augustus Le Plongeon 'proved' Maya connections with ancient Egypt and Europe and reconstructed a detailed but fanciful story of Queen Moo and Prince Coh of Maya Empire. Russian Colonel Braghine in his book from 1938 'The Shadow of Atlantis' claimed that the Carib people have reports and legends of a white bearded man whom they called Tamu or Zune who had come from the East, taught the people agriculture and later disappeared in an easterly direction. Braghine also claimed Manco Cápac (founder of the Inca civilization) was a white bearded man. The white man was to come to America and be remembered by the locals as a god (Viracocha in the Andes region of South America, Quetzalcoatl or Kukulkan among Aztec or Mayans etc.). Other scientists were more restrained and limited themselves only to pointing to past contacts between Europeans and Americans. Mysterious finds (such as small terracotta head sculpture, with a beard and European-like features, was found in 1933 in the Toluca Valle near Mexico City), legends (about Irish missionaries) or Sagas (colonization of Vinland) were highlighted. Will we spread the Truth about the White Man's presence in America in the old days? Or Will we keep these facts silent?"
pacificstates.3534.a:0 "An intriguing hypothesis."

pacificstates.354.d:0 "We have made the promised list of collaborators against the state with the most prominent including Robert Taft, Henry Wallace, Clarence D. Martin, Homer Bone, Culbert Olson and Upton Sinclair. We could simply round them up and put an end to it but our Japanese contacts would prefer if we simply warn them they have two days to flee for Canada, arguing that it would be much 'cleaner' and solve the problem of critics of the government without incurring as much protest. Perhaps we should consider?"
pacificstates.354.a:0 "Very well, warn them they must flee"
pacificstates.354.b:0 "And let them strike later? I think not."

pacificstates.355.t:0 "Japanese Aid"
pacificstates.355.d:0 "Japan has sent aid but have made it clear that they want additional oil to fuel their navy, offering additional aid in return.

pacificstates.356.d:0 "It has come time for the Party to put forward a more clear administrative agenda now that our powerbase is secured. Most of the Party fervent are demanding that we openly embrace our fringe, occultist, supernatural and other New Spiritualist beliefs. However the representatives of Japan have made it repeatedly clear that they want us to keep this private, worrying we would undermine whatevers support we have. While defying Japan would be dangerous, Hubbard has proposed a model in which the Party would have a self-contained religion that can slowly spread propaganda, rather than transparently putting its many beliefs forward with the exception of expanding the Redshirt Conspiracy."

Nonetheless, within our own nation people are taking the message to heart and see the futility of fighting the state and with it we've seen resistance die down significantly as most no longer have enough access to unfiltered news to know about the condemnations anyways."

pacificstates.358.t:0 "Boden Removed!"
pacificstates.358.d:0 "With the stability of the state coming into question after Edward Longstreet Boden and the Spiritualist Party inner-circle openly endorsed occultist beliefs around demonology, Cosmic Visitors, the paranormal, ghouls and other bizarre concepts it appears that a combination of Japanese soldiers, mercenaries and Federal Police have seized control of Congress shortly after Boden was removed for 'being unfit for leadership', with the Spiritualist Party under the obvious guidance of Japan and their local trade allies deciding to endorse a new party line and new leader, the only question is who will Congress elect, voluntarily of course. The choices are namely between Max Thornburg, the practical leader of Standard Oil Pacific who is Japan's primary ally in the business community and the more tolerable choice for Pacificans, and Ralph Townsend, who is more ideologically aligned with Japan, insisting whites and the Japanese are both racially superior to those it colonizes in the East and admiring its form of government. However, Japan could also take a heavy handed approach in the nation's governance, and install a man who will carry out their will above all else..."

While Hayakawa is apparently not personally a fan of Japanese imperialism, including the Pacific's current place under the Japanese Sun, he nonetheless is willing to promote unity and peace between the nations for the good of both parties at the request of the government, giving speeches with semi-regularity on the importance of trade with Japan and Japan's 'duty' in protecting the Pacific."

In reaction to these claims, Sinclair has vehemently condemned the CSA, and has spoken at length about the Pacifican Dream.\n\nYet another possible choice is William Randolph Hearst and his National Democratic Party, a break off of the banned Pacifican Democratic Party. Unlike many within the Pacific, Hearst was one of the most supportive voices for the General's coup, and his use of the Hearst media empire to drum up support for us has been invaluable.

While peaceful at first, these protests quickly turned into riots when pro-secessionist crowds emerged to counter protest.

The impact of his codeine addiction and germophobia together could not deter people from his cause, and yet his schizophrenic episodes have left many of his advisors worried for their security-and their lives.While he is certainly fit to run the country, Hughes's doctors wonder how long the eccentric man can last."

KX_california.43.d:0 "As the creator of the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1932, Howard Hughes has had close ties to the aviation industry, including various engineers and designers. Hughes himself is one of the most prolific designers, helping to create planes that could break world records with their speed. Just today, Hughes tested his latest invention for the second time. Previously, he had set the world record in this plane, completing a round-the-world flight in just 91 hours. This time however, his aircraft crashed into Lake Mead, nearly killing Hughes. However, Hughes, ever the aviation enthusiast, refused to give up on his dreams, chalking the accident up to a mistake on his part, and paying for the plane to be recovered. Though many of his citizens question his judgement, none can doubt his boldness, and as Hughes prepares to embark on another flight to the capitol, he is ready to get back to work."

calpeaceout.1.d:0 "As the once-righteous United States of America splinters and collapses as it verges ever close to total civil war, many within our isolated oasis of republican ideals here on the Pacific Coast have begun to voice their growing desire to avoid war with their fellow Americans. Fearing the chaos, bloodshed, and savagery of a brother-war here on our own continent, these peacemongers have grown increasingly vocal in their aversion to the seemingly inevitable war that's growing on the horizon. \n\nNormally, such a development would not even grab the state’s attention, but recently these anti-war sentiments have begun to seep into our own officer corps, infecting the minds of some of our military staff and leaders with cowardice and hesitation. We likely do not have to act on this, for some aversion to war, especially a civil war, is normal for a nation that was once as close-knit as our dying Union. However, some of our more hawkish or paranoid cabinet members have called on our regime to crush these calls for peace before they grow out of hand. How shall we proceed?"

calpeaceout.2.d:0 "With our decision to allow these pacifists and cowards to continue their protests and fear-mongering, the idea of secession has begun to grow within the minds of the general populace. Worrying still, these sentiments have begun to reach and influence the ‘Big Business’ sector of the Pacfic economy. Certain conglomerates with holdings in our states, from Standard Oil and Ford Motor Company to more local operations like the California Railroad Commision, have begun to display and proliferate these dangerous ideas as well. These companies, though many would be able to find at least some profit in the coming war, would stand to lose far more their home markets, customer bases, and infrastructure are devastated in horrific civil conflict. \n\nAs if all of this was not worrying enough, there have even been reports of General Henry Arnold being seen communicating with known associates of these peacemongers, though about what we are still ignorant to. Many within our cabinet are now crying for us to do something about this rising tide of pacifist ideals, though doing so would be a violation of our very founding principles. If we are going to be the heirs to American republicanism, we must abide by its rules and rights too."

Like wildfire, the dangerous notions of peace have spread to infest much of the nation, as our people recoil from the idea of spilling innocent American blood on our own hallowed soil. As we speak, General Henry Arnold and his forces have moved into the capital, surrounding and disarming the national guard outside the capitol building without ever firing a shot. With this bloodless coup ordained by the people, General Arnold will assume the role as temporary leader of the Pacific States while he searches for a candidate to fill the position of Interim President while also reaching out to the government in Washington and General MacArthur to hash out a deal of peace, mutually assured assistance, and reconciliation as our people here build a unique and finally independent Pacifican identity."

calpeaceout.4.d:0 "Distressing news has come in from Sacramento informing us that General Henry Arnold has couped the Pacifc States’ government in order to prevent the western breakoff state from entering the looming civil war. More interesting however, is that General Arnold has also reach out directly to General MacArthur, notifying the ‘American Caesar’ of the Pacific’s intent to stay out of conflict with the Federal government while both cooperating with the Federalist war effort and pursuing their own regionalist, secessionist goal of creating an independent ‘Pacifican’ state. Though this idea flies in the very face of our Union, we are also in little position to stop them at the current time as they lie thousands of miles away from us and our forces in the Rockies simply do not have the men or machines to take the Pacific on alone currently. Additionally, one less faction to fight in this ever-worsening climate of war would save countless American lives and allow us to focus on the far more dangerous and radical enemies in the South and Midwest."

As such, any deal or ceasefire agreement with the other factions has been cast aside as we throw our lot in with the Federalists. General Arnold has now begun the process of transition back to a civilian government as he and his forces prepare to fight for their right to be free and independent on this beautiful Pacific coast."

calpeaceout.6.t:0 "Fate of the ‘Pacifican’ Separatists"
calpeaceout.6.d:0 "The guns have finally fallen silent, and the screams and thunderous cracks of gunfire that have filled our ears and minds for what feels like an eternity have finally stopped their maddening cacophony. Through the mud and blood we have soldiered on, and we now stand victorious as the last America standing...well, almost the last America. \n\nAcross the continent on the Western coast lies our ‘allies’ - the Pacific States. After the coup of General Henry Arnold, they declared their intent to become their own distinct regionalist state, and would fight with our forces to reduce the amount of American blood spilled to pay for this desire. However, the war is now over and we face a new reality, and as such we must finally decide what to do about these ‘Pacifican’ separatists. We could make good on the promises made when the war began, allowing the Pacific States to go their own way as a friendly but independent brother-state on a now shared American heartland. However, the thought of fighting this war to preserve the Union only to have it remain fractured has understandably upset and angered many within the nation, and so two other options could be available to us. \n\nWe could instead try to persuade the Pacifican government to readmit themselves into the Union amicably and peaceful, and in return we would grant them massive amounts of economic, political, and cultural autonomy - in essence allowing them to act as their own state under the protection and occasionally advisement of the American government and military. The most radical option, however, would be to demand their full annexation into these United States just as before, restoring the old order of the United States. To entice them to take this near unacceptable deal, we would make a promise that true democracy and republicanism would return to the American government and people, finally giving all Americans a say in their government once more. To further this, numerous advantages and incentives would be given to these rogue states to placate them while we reconstruct the union’s more war torn lands. What shall we do?"

These Federalists have come to Sacramento offering a counter-proposal to full independence. Seeking to preserve the sanctity and prestige of our once honored Union, General MacArthur and his clique have offered near-complete autonomy under the veil of pan-American unity. Our states would be allowed to effectively govern themselves as we please, while still maintaining the benefits of being a part of the United States. Our own political and socio-economic policy would be entirely independent, with most of our ties being through economic and military cooperation and cohesion. Though this is a departure from our original goal, it is still not a bad deal by any means, and accepting would save the lives of millions. What shall we do?"

We can either face the writing on the wall and let them go free, saving the lives of countless innocent Americans while also crippling the sanctity of our Union and shattering the former ideal of the United States for good. Alternatively, we could ride across the Rockies and into Sacramento to totally and finally crush any dreams of Pacifican independence through force. However, a good first step for our new regime would not be to reignite the civil conflict so soon after quenching the fires of the last one, and it would seal our fate as being seen as a tyrant by many within the nation. We must decide what to do and fast, for the fate of millions rests on our shoulders."

General MacArthur himself has demanded that we return into the fold of the greater Union, once more becoming constituent states of the United States of America. To incentivize us, they have offered economic reparations to be given to our own constituent states, and a greater degree of relative autonomy be given to our economic actions compared to other states in the Union to keep the peace and ‘reward’ us for our help in the Civil War. Many within our government and wider populace view this deal as a spit in the face to our values and dreams, but the more pragmatic among us fear another war more than anything. We must tread carefully, for our decision here affects the lives of untold millions who have just escaped from the seemingly endless and nightmarish horrors of civil conflict."

The reason for this siding is not a sudden change in course, they still hate the Federalists with a burning passion. However, the Pacific States have been washed away in a tide of secessionist thought. By siding with the Federalists, the argument goes, they'll be able to live out dreams of total independence from the burning Union. While this has little effect on current situation, they were and still are in our sights anyway, those in our government who thought peace was an option with them have been proved wrong, as per the Pacifican deal with the Federalists, any and all treaties with other factions have become null and void. Most of within the High Command seems to agree this will have little effect on our overall war effort, save for the occasional sighing of Pacifican troops on Federalist lines."

While [USA.GetLeader]'s taking of this deal without so much as asking us has caused a bit of anger within the High Command, we can do nothing but complain, as [USA.GetLeader] is still our acting Commander-in-Chief. As per the agreement, Pacifican troops now have free movement within the land we control, and Pacifican reinforcements on the border with Longists is expected soon. While this only helps further confirm the thought that Washington has no care for our blight, the fact we only have to fight towards Washington has brought some relief for the slap the face that this deal was."

KX_california.44.t:0 "A New, ‘Pacifican’ Republic"
KX_california.44.d:0 " The sun shone brightly as General Henry Arnold gave a victory speech to a crowd of thousands outside the Capitol Building of Sacramento. The old, honored general exclaimed of our many triumphs and virtues, regaliing the crowd with enticing words of inspiration and true patriotism. \n\n‘...There are some back home who ask me, "But who are we protecting? What are the Pacific States to us?" Sometimes we forget that the light of our society shines beyond our borders. Sometimes we take those privileges for granted that our forebears fought so hard to achieve. We must always remember that wherever Pacificans stand, we carry our principles with us: equal respect, representation, and protection under the laws of a just republic. This was the same fire that burned in the heart of the Old Union that preceded us. We are the heirs of that civilization, torchbearers eastward of the Pacific, into the darkness of this wasted land.’ \n\n‘When America fell, we held our own. When America fell, we carried the weight. When America fell, we drew a line through the Mojave as clear as the Colorado River, a line that the American Caesar now cannot cross. Today, we stand here as brothers and sisters to hold that line. Today, we honor all Pacificans by carrying that weight. Today, we are the waves of the Pacific, pushing ever eastward. We are the sequoias rising from the Sierra Nevadas, defiant and enduring. We are the great western light of the Pacific States, torchbearers in the darkness, living reminders of all that is best in our republic. Thank you all, thank you.’ His speech ended with thunderous applause and deafening cheers - the sounds of a truly free Pacifican people crying out for their national father.\n\nOur rebirthed republic has been baptized in flame and blood, and now we stand resolute with our independence and our values, and the values of the Founding Fathers, intact. We now stride forward into an uncertain and ever-darkening future, and today, with the conclusion of the General's speech, we shall fly high the banner of our new republic to fully rally the people of these united Pacific States to rally around in perpetuity. Under this banner and behind the guiding torch of our vindicated ideals and traditions, our new Pacifican republic shall meet its destiny, whatever it may be, head on and fully united. "

calpeaceout.14.d:0 "It has only been a short few days since General Arnold lead his march on Sacramento, and while our government is still far from stable, the time has come to make a decision regarding our very future. When Arnold forced the previous provisional government to step down, he did so in the name of the so-called 'Peace-Monger' movement, a movement calling not just for us to not enter the coming civil war, but one calling for the creation of a secessionist Republic on the West Coast. Now in power, the movement has run head first into the brick wall of our current realities, and has split into two camps as a result.\n\nThe first and largest camp, dubbed the 'realists,' wished for us to us General Arnold's connections within the Armed Forces to cut a deal with the Federalists. This deal would be one in which Pacifican forces would fight with the MacArthurites in exchange for recognizance of Pacifican Sovereignty over the West Coast. The Realists say this is the one way we could truly ensure a bright future for our children, or so they claim.\n\nThe second camp to emerge on the Secession Question(as it has been dubbed) are known as the Dreamers. The Dreamers, mostly made up of junior officers and students, call for us to totally abandon America. They would have us reject any deal or offer from the warring factions, and instead work to build up the Pacifican Dream, free from any conflict whatsoever. Unlike the Realists, they have no contingency should the victor of the coming conflict demand our reincorporation, save for extensive militarization of the Pacifican State.\n\nWith MacArthur's deadline coming every closer, no time for debate exists. General Arnold must now make a decision, a decision potentially on which millions of lives ride."

###############################################
CAL_HENRY_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With the outbreak of the Civil War, 'Hap' found himself in the West Coast of America, where due to his constant disagreements with the national Chief of Air Corps of the Federal Government, he decided to join the Pacific Governors in their struggle, and provide any technical expertise he is able to in exchange for the promise of an independent air force."
CAL_DADDY_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps. With MacArthur's takeover of the government, Marshall refused to recognize his colleague as the army's generalissimo, and when the Pacific Governors declared their revolt, Marshall decided to join them, which earned him the promotion to Field Marshall. He is widely considered one of the most brilliant planners in America, and is one of the most experienced members of our staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
CAL_ALEXANDER_PATCH_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 23, 1889, in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Alexander McCarrell "Sandy" Patch, the son of the Cavalry Captain Alexander M. Patch, started his military career when he joined West Point in 1909. While a fan of the cavalry corp, he was quick to realize that cavalry would soon enough become obsolete in combat, so he chose to join the infantry, and graduated from West Point as a second lieutenant in 1913. His first assignment was the 18th Infantry Regiment based in Texas, from where he was assigned to Pershing's 'Punitive Expedition' to Mexico, where he earned his promotion to first lieutenant. Without any major engagements for the US, Patch reached the rank of Captain in 1919 and was posted at Fort Benning as an instructor for four years. He'd apply for the Staunton Military Academy in Virginia as a professor of military science and tactics, a role which he'll keep until very recently. In the meantime, he attended the Field Officer's Course in 1922 and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, where he graduated with distinction in 1925, and finally graduated from the U.S. Army War College in 1932 as a lieutenant colonel. Patch's remarkable service record impressed General George Marshall, who tried to keep close contact with Patch in the following years of his graduation. When the civil war break out, Marshall implored Patch to join his staff in the Pacific Army, a request that Patch accepted and for which he was promoted to Brigadier General."
CAL_LEWIS_BRERETON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 21, 1890, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Lewis Hyde Brereton began his military career in 1907, when he joined the Naval Academy with his brother and graduated in June 1911. However, before graduating he submitted a letter for resignation citing seasickness, which would make him unable to serve as a naval officer. His resignation was accepted, and he applied to be commissioned in the US Army and was appointed as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps on August 17, 1911. In September 1912, he undertook flight training in Rockwell Field, and would work temporarily on the air corp until he survived his second crash, after which he requested to be relieved from duty. He returned to the Coast Artillery Corps and in July 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and sent to the Philippines and would serve a year before returning to the US in March 1917, where he was assigned to duty in the Aviation Sector Headquarters in Washington D.C.. He'd go through a series of administrative posts and became a close assistant of Billy Mitchell in his attempts to make the air force independent. With Mitchell's resignation, his life took a downturn, as his wife left him, he suffered a crash and was found AWOL by accident while his mental health deteriorated greatly due to these developments. He was restored into service in August 1927 and was assigned to command of the 88th Observation Squadron at Post Field, Oklahoma, as well as an instructor at the Field Artillery School in Fort Sill. In 1931 he was posted in the Panama Canal Zone and received a promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1935 due to an excelling performance, which allowed him to salvage his reputation of his misfortunes in the late twenties. With the outbreak of the civil war becoming increasingly inevitable, he took a ship and arrived to San Diego right before hostilities began in order to meet his old acquaintance,'Hap' Arnold. Despite his inexperience in practical infantry combat, his excellent administrative and planning skills allowed him to become Brigadier General, by Arnold's own request."

CAL_GEORGE_WINDLE_READ_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 29, 1900, in Fort Grant, Arizona\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Windle Read Jr. spent most of his youth in military camps, following his father who was an important member of the US Army staff, he volunteered for the army in 1917, and although he signed up for the infantry at first, graduating as a second lieutenant from the Military Academy, his love for Polo made him move to the cavalry corps before 1920, where he undertook the Cavalry School Basic Course and graduated in 1921. He took several posts throughout the US and abroad, mostly following the steps of his father until his death in 1934. With his father's death, he was assigned to Seattle, where he had to put down several strikes in the name of the central government as the national situation deteriorated.

### Parties ###
CAL_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
CAL_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - §LThe SPA had some semblance of influence on the West Coast until recently, when Upton Sinclair and his Commonwealth Party took most of their support. Though the Commonwealth Party is seen as the greatest hope the left has in the PSA, there are those who adhere to more radical positions, oftentimes in association with the CSA. Those sympathetic to Totalism are typically supportive of the PSA rather than the CSA, but they believe that the government is not doing nearly enough to win the war. They call for the awakening of Western potential in the form of industry and see this as the route to victory. Unfortunately for them though, it seems they have lost their chance at power in the region.§!"
CAL_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
CAL_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America -  §LThe SPA had some semblance of influence on the West Coast until recently, when Upton Sinclair and his Commonwealth Party took most of their support. Though the Commonwealth Party is seen as the greatest hope the left has in the PSA, there are those who adhere to more radical positions, oftentimes in association with the CSA. Those who espouse mainstream syndicalist views were angry when Sinclair betrayed the eastern syndicalists to protect his own ambitions. As a result, they have largely remained loyal to the SPA and other small organizations, advocating an overhaul of the current economic system. However, their numbers are small and it seems that the Commonwealth Party has outmaneuvered them.§!"
CAL_radical_socialist_party:0 "Commonwealth Party"
CAL_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Commonwealth Party - §LUpton Sinclair's Commonwealth Party has became a rallying point for those on the left on the West Coast. Though the End Poverty in California, or EPIC, plan failed to gain traction in 1934,  the party has became fairly popular since then. It still has to contend with the two major parties, the Democratic-Republicans, and the Progressives, who are their main rivals for support. To ameliorate this, the Commonwealth Party has distanced itself from the CSA, promising to safeguard the country from marxism and syndicalism. Sinclair is the visionary who has led the party to where it is today, but there are others who aspire to lead it. Culbert Olson is likely the most notable candidate. He is seen as a rising star in the party, espousing many of the same policies as Sinclair but with more moderate rhetoric. Only time will tell how successful this party could truly be.§!"
CAL_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
CAL_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party - §LThe Progressives aim to build on a decades-old tradition of progressive success in the West and in the country as a whole. From the Farmer's Alliance to the Populist Party to the Bull Moose Party, Progressives have never won the presidency. However, with a coalition of farmers and workers, the party hopes to be victorious. A few obstacles stand in their way. The Commonwealth Party poses a strong challenge from their left, and the Democratic-Republicans have also stolen some voters who would otherwise be likely Progressive constituents. Nonetheless, the Progressives have a strong position on the West Coast, and it is possible that they could win the coming electoral contests outright. Henry Wallace, Hiram Johnson, Charles L. McNary, and CC Young are all contending for leadership of the party; the winner will have his work ahead of him, but the party's populist appeal is strong.§!"
CAL_social_liberal_party:0 "Democratic-Republican Party"
CAL_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic-Republican Party - §LThe Democratic-Republicans, sometimes called the Liberals, are a mix of liberal and reform minded Democrats and Republicans who have become disenchanted with both parties and seek change. Though their desire for reform is perhaps more moderate than that of the Progressives and certainly more so than that of the Commonwealth, the Democratic-Republicans wish to see banking reform, the institution of a social security system, and work programs. The Progressives and the Commonwealth Party have sneered at a party they see as engaging in half measures, policies that will do nothing but frustrate the people and allow the rich to rule society. The mainstream Democratic and Republican Parties view the new party as upstarts, unworthy of recognition and having outlandish policy goals. Despite all their enemies, the Democratic-Republicans have a fair amount of support in the West, and with the right maneuvering, could even come to power. Their main candidates include Earl Warren, political titan William Gibbs McAdoo, Charles D. Martin, Manchester Boddy, and Charles A. Sprague. It is unclear which of these men will lead the party, but they all desire the same thing: victory in the coming elections.§!"
CAL_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
CAL_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party - §LMany parties have emerged in the recent strife that has racked our country, but the Republican Party has stood strong through it all. Though they are not as dominant on the West Coast as they are in other regions of the country, they have strongly contested the region with the Democrats for decades. Herbert Hoover himself lived in California for years, and the state's governor, Frank Merriam, is also a Republican. Their current policies emphasize a laissez-faire economy, with low regulations and low taxes. Further, education and free trade are also popular policies within the Republican Party. Indeed, if the Republicans can create a message that can bring some disaffected voters back into the party, they could very well win the upcoming elections. However, recent hardships in California have forced Merriam to raise taxes, and his union-busting tendendcies will make it difficult to gain support from new constituencies. As such, Merriam has many rivals within the party. Robert Taft, son of former President William Howard Taft, threatens Merriam's position in the party, but Harry Chandler, Howard Hughes, Frank Knox, and Louis B. Meyer are all contending for the leadership of the Republican Party as well. The future of the Republican Party may well depend on who is chosen to represent them in the coming elections.§!"
CAL_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
CAL_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - §LFor decades, the Democratic Party has fiercely contended with their Republican rivals for dominance on the West Coast. Their support for railroad and tariff reforms gained them support early in the century, but recently, the party has bled support to various new parties rising up in the region. The America First Party has been particularly damaging to the party's efforts, and any Democratic hopeful will have to win back votes from this faction. The Democrats do not have a standardbearer like Frank Merriam in the West, but there are prominent figures. The newly-elected governor of Oregon, Charles Martin, has become known as a pro-business politician, and is vehemently opposed to strikes. Numerous prominent businessmen have also thrown their hat into the contest for Democratic leadership. Among them are Henry J. Kaiser, a famous contractor in the building of dams, and Walt Disney, a rising star whose company Disney aims to revolutionize entertainment. While neither man is known for their charisma, Disney's visionary nature could win voters over in the primary. However, media mogul William Randolph Hearst has also expressed interest in politics lately, though he has sharply contrasted his platform with that of the Democratic Party, and some believe he wants to start his own party. Doing so would weaken the Democratic Party even more, but Hearst may be beyond convncing. In the meantime, the best the Democratic Party can do is continue its traditions of social conservatism and support from the business community, and hope it will be enuogh.§!"
CAL_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
CAL_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - §LThe AFP has been a thorn in the side of local Democrats, for they have succeeded in stealing much of the party's support. Their populist outrage against business tycoons has gained them supporters in both rural and urban communities, and though they don't stand a chance of winning in the area, the AFP can certainly gain concessions from more popular parties. Their largest challenge lies not in the Democrats themselves, but in William Randolph Hearst, who in running his own party would use a mix of racial appeals and his own vision of unions to carve out a place for himself in the electoral arena. Only time can tell what will happen to the party in the West.§!"
CAL_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Federalist Loyalists"
CAL_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Federalist Loyalists - §LThe Federal Government certainly has its supporters in the West. There are many who have recently fled to the West from their places on the East Coast, and they still harbor sympathies for those who stayed behind. There are also those who question the legitimacy of our cause, and instead believe we should unite with the Feds against our common foes. Though this is not likely, these loyalists should be watched, for they could undermine any Pacific regime.§!"
CAL_national_populist_party:0 "The Spiritualist Movement"
CAL_national_populist_party_long:0 "The Spiritualist Movement - §LOne of the strangest new factions to emerge lately is the Spiritualist Movement. Within the movement, there are many disparate factions who have come together with the common goal of opposing what they call "Monarchist Anglo-Syndicalism". There is a faction of the movement that wishes to pursue closer ties with Japan, who has been one of their biggest supporters, foreign or domestic. This faction is represented by oil businessman Max Thornburg and ideological ally Ralph Townsend. Another faction of the movement is that of L. Ron Hubbard, who is less concerned with the support of Japan or any other nation than he is with the occult. His Christian mysticism, along with his belief in the paranormal and even U.F.O.'s, has made him a source of derision for some, though Hubbard's beliefs are no joke to him. His heavily anti-syndicalist views could make him popular in the business community, but those who know Hubbard well know he will not be controlled by anyone. Leading these two factions, among other smaller ones, is movement and party leader Edward Longstreet Bodin. Bodin faces a difficult task in reconciling Japanese support with the occult views of the party, but with his talent, and a bit of luck, he may be able to bring the party to popularity.§!"

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_WALT_DISNEY_DESC:0"Walt Disney is many things, Businessman, Politician and Visionary, just to name a few. Born in 1901 in Chicago to Elias and Flora Disney, he moved at the age of 10 to Kansas City in Missouri, however he moved back to Chicago soon after. Disney moved to Hollywood in 1923 to work in the Cartoon Industry and because his brother was convalescing from Tuberculosis there. Disney married Lillian Bounds in 1925 after hiring her as an Ink Artist. They had one Daughter biologically and adopted the other. In the early '30s Disney begun his career in Politics and, voiced his support for the Republican party of California. Something that made him a rising player in California’s regional politics. With the outbreak of the civil war, Walt pledged his full support for the Pacific Government and declared his intent for the Presidency. Disney would run for President in 1940 and despite all odds, he managed to win the nomination for President. He then proceeded to win the election for the Republicans. And though he has been labelled a dictator and an autocrat by his opposition, he has the full support of the government behind him and his plans for America, whatever that will bring."
POLITICS_CAL_NORTON_II_DESC:0"Emperor Norton II is a man who lived through many odd events, to ultimately become Emperor of an Empire that in all senses; shouldn't exist. Born Charles Ross Norton in 1881, he was the great nephew of a madman who declared himself Emperor of the United States, little did he know however that this event would lead to more madness within his own lifetime. For the majority of his life, Norton had lived a quiet, peaceful life in South Africa; even having a son by the name of Gerard Norton. Even after the Weltkrieg, nothing dramatically changed for him, his life was quiet and simple. \n\n That was until he was invited to a party in San Francisco on one fateful day. What started out as a gathering of 'Nortonites' led to him being swept up into the political upheaval and chaos plaguing the Pacific States at that time. Before he knew what was going on, he was being crowned Emperor Norton II in San Francisco, and after that; oddly enough came peace. Though he has attracted several loyal members and people who are willing to fight to the death for him, Norton is getting older with time. To many, he almost seems reluctant to the position of Emperor. But every morning he gets out of bed determined to at least do something about the problems he and his subjects face."

Born in 1901 in Chicago to Elias and Flora Disney, he moved at the age of 10 to Kansas City in Missouri, however he moved back to Chicago soon after.

With the outbreak of the civil war, Walt pledged his full support for the Pacific Government and declared his intent for the Presidency. However, as the political scene changed; so did Disney. After Arnold’s intervention, Disney abandoned the Republican Party and along with Howard Hughes, formed the National Visionary Party. When Disney was elected, stability and prosperity was expected; however, the opposite came, and after the Nation begun to collapse, Disney had to take drastic measures. The democratic process is worthless, all it has done is send America on a downward spiral. Because of this, Disney has done away with the democratic forces that are hindering his Visionary plans. The so-called 'Visionary Party' has stacked the government with people loyal to Disney and his plans for America and instituted a dictatorship with Disney at its head. The voices of the opposition are now silent, the chaos has ended. And with his power base secured, Disney can begin his plans for the nation, whatever that will entail is up to Disney himself, who has the full support of the government. Many now believe that under President Disney's guidance America will not only prosper but it will rise to heights never seen before, but only time will tell if, and when such a thing will happen."
POLITICS_JOHN_AISO_DESC:0"John Fujio Aiso was born in Burbank, Los Angeles in December of 1909 to Japanese Parents. During his younger years, Aiso was treated poorly by his peers due to the Anti-Japanese sentiment that was high in America at the time. Aiso attended Hollywood High School in the 20's where he gained national attention for his victory in the school's constitution oration contest, however he was not allowed to compete on the national level. Aiso also spent a year in Japan at Seijo University after he graduated in 1926, until he attended Brown University in the United States where he graduated Cum Laude and served as class Valedictorian in 1931. He completed his degree after going to Harvard in 1934. He did private practise across the US and Japan until 1936, where upon outbreak of Civil War, Aiso supported the Government of his native Pacific States; and fled to Sacremento to aid the government. That should have been the height of his life, however through the chaos that engulfed the Pacific States; Aiso manages to secure a spot on the California Supreme Court. And eventually, Aiso found himself the de-facto head of the Government after a constitutional crisis that resulted in the Provisional Supreme Court taking over. With Aiso now in charge, the future is uncertain; however one thing is for sure, America is forever changed."

CAL_officer_latitude:0 "Officer Latitude"
CAL_officer_latitude_desc:0 "In a rejection of Marshall's ideas, Walter Krueger believes that we should grant officers autonomy rather than adhere them to a single restrictive plan.

CAL_alamo_scouts:0 "Alamo Scouts"
CAL_alamo_scouts_desc:0 "Part of Krueger's plan involves small elite teams that will travel deep into enemy lines and act as scouts.

CAL_towed_artillery_yesterday:0 "Towed Artillery Yesterday"
CAL_towed_artillery_yesterday_desc:0 "Artillery peices will need to be stronger as well as lighter if we are to respond to battlefield changes as the plan dictates.

CAL_field_artillery_school:0 "Field Artillery Schools"
CAL_field_artillery_school_desc:0 "While other generals have encouraged the continuation of officer schools to train the next generation of officers, Leslie McNair wants our focus elsewhere.

CAL_quasi_arms_factories:0 "Quasi-Arms Factories"
CAL_quasi_arms_factories_desc:0 "A crucial part of McNair's plan is the development of specialized Anti-Air and Anti-Tank Artillery.

CAL_military_research_desc:0 "While we have some of the finest universities and thinkers in the world, we cannot research everything at once. We need to pick a direction for our military research to focus in."
CAL_weapon_designs:0 "New Weapon Designs"
CAL_weapon_designs_desc:0 "While the M1 Garand managed to see us through the Civil War, its flaws were as noticeable when it was adopted as they are now. However, with the criticism we have gathered during the civil war, we have contacted the original designer, and he has assured us that by redesigning the barrel, gas cylinder, and front sight assembly, he will make the Garand an even more reliable and deadly weapon."
CAL_Army_rangers:0 "Army Rangers"
CAL_Army_rangers_desc:0 "An elite group of specialized soldiers, the Army Rangers will be able to carry out covert missions in rough terrain, disrupting enemy supply lines and morale."
CAL_90_division_Army:0 "90-Division Army Plan"
CAL_90_division_Army_desc:0 "While Marshall originally envisioned that a reformed US Army would require a 265-Division Plan to be fully mobilized, the limitations of the West Coast make such a plan a pipe dream. As such, he has decided to adopt a 90-Division Plan, with the objective of raising a total of at least 90 divisions against America's enemies."
CAL_organizing_victory:0 "Organizing Victory"
CAL_organizing_victory_desc:0 "All elements of our society should be brought together to bolster the war effort. Under Marshall's close supervision, our factories will produce more equipment than ever before, and we will show the world the might of the West!" 
CAL_motorization:0 "Motorisation Program"
CAL_motorization_desc:0 "With the original rejection of the motorisation plans, a ghost has loomed the American Army as their methods became backwards as opposed to other militaries. Marshall has now proposed the government to subsidize truck production and to being the seizure of civilian trucks for the creation of motorized units capable of crossing the American countryside before our enemy can react."
CAL_tank_production:0 "Increase Tank Production"
CAL_tank_production_desc:0 "With the West Coast's low manpower, the High Command has had to design a plan to effectively improve what every man is worth in the field. In any of those plans, expanding Tank production in the West Coast comes as a priority, as their relatively low manpower cost and high combat effectiveness proves that it will not only save us lives, but also helps us push the enemy back more swiftly."
CAL_Officer_instruction:0 "Officer Instruction"
CAL_Officer_instruction_desc:0 "Marshall has presented this issue to our government, and his solution is to create forward study-bases, with more experienced officers mentoring younger ones in tactics. While this may put more of our officers in the line of fire, it will also ensure our new generation of officers gets first hand experience, as well as improving our army's leadership on the lower echelons as a whole."
CAL_recon_units:0 "Reconnaissance Units"
CAL_recon_units_desc:0 "Knowledge is Power, and Marshall believes that without the former two, victory in America will be impossible. We are outmanned and outgunned by our enemies, but if we know their every movement, then we can nullify our enemy's superiority by out-witting them."
CAL_defense_is_the_best_offense:0 "Defense is the Best Offense"
CAL_defense_is_the_best_offense_desc:0 "The first step towards preparing for the coming storm will be to improve our defense construction. Trench digging and fortification construction will be a basic part of our army's curriculum, so that when the enemy waves come and threaten our home, we shall prevail."
CAL_logistic_security:0 "Logistical Security"
CAL_logistic_security_desc:0 "Logistiscs are a not-so well known battlefield which will be vital for us if we wish to gain the upper hand against the radicals in the East.

CAL_aggressive_conscription:0 "Aggressive Conscription"
CAL_aggressive_conscription_desc:0 "Our position on the West Coast does not come without drawbacks. We do not have enough men to match the armies of the East. However, DeWitt argues if we are more aggressive in our recruiting and conscription efforts, we may be able to even the score."
CAL_Expand_the_Presidio:0 "Expand the Presidio of San Francisco"
CAL_Expand_the_Presidio_desc:0 "The Presidio of San Francisco has a long tradition of being vital for our nation's war efforts since America occupied it in 1846. As it stands, it is the most logical seat of power to direct our army's efforts, as well as the best prepared facility in the West Coast to hold the Command Staff. However, being the best prepared facility the region doesn't mean it's up to standard, and an expansion of the Fort is required."
CAL_coast_to_coast_planning:0 "'Coast-to-Coast' Planning Board"
CAL_coast_to_coast_planning_desc:0 "With the Expanded Presidio, DeWitt has proposed the creation of a Planning board, capable of issuing new and adaptable plans for our front line commanders so that we may push our enemies from sea to shining sea."
CAL_increase_military_spending:0 "Increase Our Military Spending"
CAL_increase_military_spending_desc:0 "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise. While the Civil war may be over, America still has enemies to fight and wars to win, and as such keeping the Civil War military spending and expanding upon it is on our best interests."
CAL_bring_the_complex_west:0 "Rebuild the Military Industrial Complex"
CAL_bring_the_complex_west_desc:0 "With most of the Military Industrial Complex in the East, the Civil War has devastated the old munitions and weapons factories that made up America's war industry as they became high value targets for bombings and a preferred hiding spot of persistent enemy defenders. If we wish to be ready for the next war, investing into rebuilding the military industrial complex is one of our priorities."
CAL_Columbia_needs_you:0 "Columbia Needs You!"
CAL_Columbia_needs_you_desc:0 "The Figure of Columbia, a woman wearing an American flag gown and a Phrygian hat, is the personification of the ideals of freedom and pursuit of liberty we fought so hard to achieve. With the tyrant overthrown and the radicals put down, the service of the American people to Columbia is not yet over. War looms in the horizon, and only the brave men of America can protect her and our nation from tyranny."
CAL_defense_contracts:0 "Defence Contractors"
CAL_defense_contracts_desc:0 "Unlike some command-style economies in Europe, we must rely on contractors to produce our weapons. Ensuring these companies are prepared for this new Civil War should be a top priority."
CAL_crossing_the_rockies:0 "Crossing the Rocky Mountains"
CAL_crossing_the_rockies_desc:0 "The Rocky Mountains is a formidable geographic formation that separates our beloved West Coast from the carnage in the East. However, with our fate being to reclaim the rest of America, we will have to cross the Rocky mountains eventually and face our enemies. As such, we should begin preparations for a smoother campaing through them."
CAL_gi_bill:0 "The G.I. Bill"
CAL_gi_bill_desc:0 "Massive numbers of demobilized servicemen will be a major issue in the aftermath of the Civil War. We should create education and job training programs to better re-integrate them into civilian life."

CAL_walkie_talkies_desc:0 "Portable radios, or 'Walkie-Talkies' as they are commonly called, present a powerful tool for our army. With them, our troops can coordinate artillery and air strikes, among other things."

### Navy Focuses ###
CAL_navy:0 "U.S Navy"
CAL_navy_desc:0 "The American navy was once the pride of the world. Yet much of it deserted to the traitors to the east. We should review what forces stayed loyal to our government, so we can best determine how they can serve in this war."
CAL_great_white_fleet:0 "Great White Fleet"
CAL_great_white_fleet_desc:0 "The Great White Fleet was the height to American naval power. We should look back at it for inspiration. A great fleet of battleships and dreadnoughts will ensure we always have naval superiority."

CAL_light_cruisers:0 "Light-Cruiser Development"

CAL_expand_the_waves:0 "Expand the WAVEs"

### Air Force Focuses ###
CAL_air_force:0 "U.S Air Force"
CAL_air_force_desc:0 "Before the war, the American Army Air Corps was, as its name suggests, little more than a branch of the Army. In this new war, we need to ensure it is independent and gets the support it needs."
CAL_build_air_ports:0 "Build Air Bases"
CAL_build_air_ports_desc:0 "While the industrialized coastline has many airports, rural areas where much of the fighting in the Civil War has taken place are lacking in air bases. We need to construct more to ensure our troops have the air support they need."
CAL_air_production:0 "Screaming Eagles"

CAL_train_pilots:0 "Train Pilots"

CAL_expand_air_ports:0 "Expand Air Bases"
CAL_expand_air_ports_desc:0 "Our initial expansion of air bases has gone well, but we still need more if we are to win the war in the air. We should divert more resources to their construction at once."

CAL_authoritarian_democrats_in_power_desc:0 "William Randolph Hearst's National Democratic Party and Federalist sympathizers have won the day on the back of promises to stabilize the Pacific, bring riches its proper citizens and most importantly, end the war with the Federalists as soon as possible. It is a new day in the Pacific!"
CAL_raise_tariffs:0 "Raise Tariffs"
CAL_raise_tariffs_desc:0 "We must be protected from foreign competition at all costs if we are to remain self-reliant. High tariffs for virtually all goods, with the exception of some agricultural goods, is needed in this endeavor, with the resulting income going to national projects and existing services."
CAL_slash_taxes:0 "Reward Success"
CAL_slash_taxes_desc:0 "Why do the rich get richer while the poor gets poorer cries the syndicalist? They are correct, but wrong that capitalism is the culprit, when it has been the lack of incentives and opportunities of wealth to expand. Taxes for the wealthy will be slashed, especially the inheritance tax, with our recent tariff income compensating for the cost."
CAL_american_festivals:0 "American Festivals"
CAL_american_festivals_desc:0 "The people may have their economic goods but what of the circuses, festivals and national events that once brought boundless entertainment to the populace?

CAL_state_trusts:0 "Municipal Ownership"
CAL_state_trusts_desc:0 "Utililties such as electricity, water, gas and telephones can not be entrusted to only a handful of private companies without oversight.

CAL_roaring_parties:0 "Roaring Parties"
CAL_roaring_parties_desc:0 "One of Hearst's favorite activities from the roaring 10's and early 20's, extravagant parties not only increase confidence in our economy but will help the state establish connections between them and the upper-class, as well as help solidify them into a more cohesive, appeaseable force. Raise a glass, for the down times are over!"
CAL_state_unions:0 "National Unions"
CAL_state_unions_desc:0 "That syndicalism poses a threat to the nation can not be in doubt, but this does not mean the American working man should not be properly organized and represented. Patriotic Unions shall be formed by the state, register workers and guarantee a minimum standard of living while radical-leaning unions will be banned, allowing the American worker to be properly represnted."
CAL_media_regulation_act:0 "Media Regulation Act"
CAL_media_regulation_act_desc:0 "Our most dangerous foes have been quashed and we can finally end the litany of newspapers and reporters whom seek the destruction of the state! The Media Regulation Act will allow the new Broadcasting Division of the Federal Police to assemble a list of prominent radicals and ban their publications at once before another coup attempt forms against America."
CAL_investigate_gop:0 "Investigate the GOP"
CAL_investigate_gop_desc:0 "There can be little doubt that the GOP and their former friends in the Progressive Party and Democratic-Republicans make up Hearst's most dangerous critics since the collapse of the Commonwealth Party. That they put the interests of international bankers and foreign governments before our own is undeniable and their organization shall be investigated for potential bribery and corruption."
CAL_yellow_peril:0 "Yellow Peril"
CAL_yellow_peril_desc:0 "Hearst has been vocal in his concern that the "Yellow Races" seek to overtake the "White Race", formerly through immigration but now, with the weakening of America, through imperialism.

Our publications and government will alert the public to this threat and the Tenney Committee will investigate possible East Asian collaborators."
CAL_national_industrial_administration:0 "National Industrial Organization"
CAL_national_industrial_administration_desc:0 "The economy is still struggling to recover from the combined attacks of syndicalist strikes, the Stock Market Crash, Great Panic, Black Monday and now destruction of the war.

CAL_punish_hawaii:0 "Punish Hawaii"
CAL_punish_hawaii_desc:0 "Did Hawaii truly believe that they could walk away from betraying the United States? They must be made an example of and their sugar production put to full use.

CAL_renovate_california:0 "California Dreaming"
CAL_renovate_california_desc:0 "California can not be allowed to fall on hard times just because of a few bumps in the road!

CAL_mine_mine_mine:0 "Mining Operations"
CAL_mine_mine_mine_desc:0 "The state needs income and where better to acquire it then the national resources of the Pacific?

A win-win for all involved."
CAL_federal_police:0 "Federal Police"
CAL_federal_police_desc:0 "In a nation overrun with crime and rebels it is clear the older methods of executive enforcement were badly outdated and far too slow to be effective.

CAL_tenney_committee:0 "Tenney Committee"
CAL_tenney_committee_desc:0 "Congressman Jack Tenney is one of the most ardent anti-syndicalist, anti-radical NDP supporters in politics, and as such we should oblige his request to be put in charge of an empowered special committee devoted to investigating and rooting out radicalism, starting with Sinclair's Commonwealth Party."
CAL_demand_respect_from_canada:0 "Demand Canadian Tribute"
CAL_demand_respect_from_canada_desc:0 "Enough of Canada's foolishness! They seize American States and hover over America with predatory eyes, desiring to force us to join their war in Europe at our cost and their benefit, with nothing to show for it. They should contribute to our coffers in return for saving the Pacific, and our borders, from syndicalism."
CAL_nationalize_liquor:0 "Nationalize Liquor"
CAL_nationalize_liquor_desc:0 "While the "Dry" supporters were correct that liquor tended to attract shady elements and cause social instability, it is fairly obvious that passing prohibition on the local and state level has only increased crime. With the state needing additional funds, it is time to implements Hearst's common sense solution to nationalize liquor."
CAL_mexican_border_raids:0 "Mexican Border Raids"
CAL_mexican_border_raids_desc:0 "The bandits that make up the Mexican government believe they can get away with raiding and trafficking across our border, laughing at our supposed inability to strike back. It is time to return the favor and be compensated for our stolen goods."

CAL_tribunals_for_gangsters_desc:0 "With the implementation of the Federal Police we must set a more clear code of enforcement for them to follow that is not interferred with by other branches of government.

CAL_executive_construction:0 "Executive Construction Projects"
CAL_executive_construction_desc:0 "America is famous for its massive skyscrapers and sprawling cities. We are a country with vast wealth and resources, and we shall use these to construct the largest and most extravagant structures the world has ever seen. Architects advocating a futurist aesthetic have caught Hearst's eye, and he plans to make these buildings in that image. The cost may be big, but Hearst's vision is bigger."

CAL_national_democrats_win_twice:0 "National Democrats Re-elected"
CAL_national_democrats_win_twice_desc:0 "As to be expected since surviving the coup attempt, William Randolph Hearst has been re-elected without any significant opposition.

CAL_naval_project:0 "Aerial Contracts"
CAL_naval_project_desc:0 "We must expand into new and promising industries if we are to encourage a growing economy and a strong national army. Controlling the sky is the way of the future for America and a massive bid for new military fighters will ensure the continued growth and development of Pacific aviation."
CAL_expand_war_powers:0 "Expand War Powers"
CAL_expand_war_powers_desc:0 "How can the president defend the nation if he does not have the power to protect his own people? The President will be given a more direct line of enacting martial law on a local and state level and the army shall yield more strategic power to him and the Federal Police."
CAL_price_setting:0 "Price Setting"
CAL_price_setting_desc:0 "Some of our population still desire a lower price on needed goods such as oil and water, while goods that are exported seem to be undercharging when those goods could stay home. A series of price-setting laws shall set this correct."
CAL_claim_sonora:0 "Sonora Should Be Ours"
CAL_claim_sonora_desc:0 "It seems we have yet to set Mexico completely straight. Baja and Sonora should have been ours after the Mexican-American War and was only not taken due to weakness on the part of Congress but with a strong President the American people shall enjoy these lands."

CAL_spiritualists_in_control_desc:0 "With the Civil War over, we finally control the country in its entirety.

CAL_sane_economy:0 "A Sane Economy"
CAL_sane_economy_desc:0 "The Spiritualist conception of economics is that capitalism, communism, and socialism all seek to enforce total control over their population, and reduce them to slaves. Instead of this treatment, we should strive for economic freedom. This can only be done if the controllers of the economy, from the government to businesses, are sane men." 
CAL_japanese_propaganda:0 "Japanese Propaganda"
CAL_japanese_propaganda_desc:0 "Our alliance with Japan has been accepted by those on the West Coast, who often had a conception of Japan already. However, this is not true nationwide, and we need to convince Americans that Japan is our natural ally. To do so, we will need to use propaganda tying the two nations together, and through this, we shall get our people on board."
CAL_new_media:0 "New Media"
CAL_new_media_desc:0 "During the war, we engaged in a media blackout. After all, the newspapers could not resist writing stories labelling us as conspiracy theorists and the like. Now though, we have the power to create our own media, and place our agents in already existing media. This 'new media' will do a much better job pushing our narrative..."
CAL_shinto_influence:0 "Shinto Influences"
CAL_shinto_influence_desc:0 "Shintoism is extremely different from Christianity or the other main American religions, yet our close ties with Japan have meant that it has increasing influence in the country.

CAL_spiritual_revolution:0 "Spiritual Revolution"
CAL_spiritual_revolution_desc:0 "Demons, the Paranormal, and even UFO's are all around us, yet few have acknowledged their existence. This will no longer be the case.

CAL_rehabilitate_and_indoctrinate:0 "Rehabilitate and Indoctrinate"
CAL_rehabilitate_and_indoctrinate_desc:0 "As much as we may wish to extinguish rebels, it is also true that we need legitimacy.

We have reached out to celebrities, but now we shall reach out to war heroes as well."
CAL_deal_with_csa:0 "Deal with Syndicalists"
CAL_deal_with_csa_desc:0 "The Syndicalists crossed the ocean to come here, and when they arrived, they tried to tear our nation apart. Syndicalism is anti-American; their attempts to control our people, our workers, have not gone unnoticed, and now that we have won the war, we will judge them harshly."
CAL_deal_with_odp:0 "Handle the ODP"
CAL_deal_with_odp_desc:0 "The ODP has some views that we agree with, but they are traitors nonetheless. Furthermore, they insist on the validity of their faith over all others, and we cannot allow that to stand. Let us put the main ODP leaders on trial, and decide how to proceed from there."
CAL_destroy_syndie_parasites:0 "Destroy Syndicalist Parasites"
CAL_destroy_syndie_parasites_desc:0 "The Syndicalist parasite has plagued this nation for too long.

We will eliminate this scourage once and for all."
CAL_destroy_anglophiles:0 "Destroy the Anglophiles"
CAL_destroy_anglophiles_desc:0 "The masters of the Syndicalists, the British monarchy, scheme to the north, looking for any way to snuff out our civilization.

CAL_reeducation_effort:0 "Re-education Effort"
CAL_reeducation_effort_desc:0 "The American people are uneducated. Almost noone is aware of our beliefs, and so, it is our job to educate them.

CAL_noi_alliance:0 "Ally with the Nation of Islam"
CAL_noi_alliance_desc:0 "With our party being so regional in nature, it is clear we need to expand. One potential ally is Elijah Muhammad and his Nation of Islam.

CAL_restore_elections:0 "Restore 'Elections'"
CAL_restore_elections_desc:0 "One thing that could help us further establish our legitimacy would be to hold "elections". These elections would not be fair by any means, but the mere fact we are holding them would go a long way in the eyes of some. Who will stop us if we count the votes?"

CAL_a_new_era_desc:0 "Our ideology has spread across America, and millions of people have been successfully converted.

CAL_reduce_subsidies:0 "Reduce Subsidies"
CAL_reduce_subsidies_desc:0 "Subsidies are an example of government overreach. It is difficult to know how much is enough in a subsidy, or if it will benefit either party at all.

CAL_education_campaign:0 "Education Campaign"
CAL_education_campaign_desc:0 "Farm children are often kept out of school, with the excuse that they are needed as hands on the farm. This will no longer be the case.

CAL_liberal_unions:0 "Support Liberal Unions"
CAL_liberal_unions_desc:0 "Not all unions are nests of syndicalism. Some actually stand for the betterment of the working class, rather than just advancing the selfish goals of their leaders.

CAL_mathematical_tables_project_desc:0 "There is a misconception that the unemployed masses of America are uneducated and lazy. We will prove that this is not true.

CAL_fair_house_trade:0 "Fair House Standard Trade"
CAL_fair_house_trade_desc:0 "While trade has its place, especially for our farmers whom must export their goods, our workers can not be expected to compete with every nation on earth.

CAL_protect_strikers:0 "Protect Strikers"
CAL_protect_strikers_desc:0 "Strikers are little more than workers asserting their rights in the face of abysmal working conditions and yet governors, bosses, and judges believe they have the right to make Marxists look vindicated by cracking down on these patriotic Americans. Striking will be recognized as a national right and the army will protect those whom are attacked by industrial goons."
CAL_quota_act:0 "Quota Act"
CAL_quota_act_desc:0 "With all the pressure already laid on American culture and worker wages that last thing we need is large amounts of untrained, cheap laborers pouring over the border. The quota system will put a limit on the number of low-wage immigrants that can come into the nation annually."
CAL_food_stamps:0 "Food Stamps"
CAL_food_stamps_desc:0 "Henry Wallace had a revelation when he saw surpluses of agricultural goods on one hill and starving citizens on another. If the market won't achieve equilibrium on its own, we will give it the encouragement it needs with a food stamp program that will make it easier for poor citizens to afford farm goods."
CAL_farm_credit_act:0 "Farm Bankruptcy Act"
CAL_farm_credit_act_desc:0 "The madness of allowing our farms to close, especially in a time of depression, is utterly intolerable! A co-operative Farm Credit System will be created to provide farmers cheap loans and to prevent the avoidable foreclosure of the nations providers, for their welfare and our own."
CAL_support_long:0 "Rescue the Kingfish"
CAL_support_long_desc:0 "Is Huey Long a man without issue? Of course not; he runs a political machine and has a head the size of Mount Rushmore. However, he is an ally of the progressives in his region and his territory is a stalwart against the authoritarians while his economic policies promise to help break radicalism. We shall do for him what he is attempting to do for America and save him from the loons and cowards whom surround him."

### Radical Socialists ###
CAL_commonwealth_victory:0 "Commonwealth Victory"
CAL_commonwealth_victory_desc:0 "Sinclair has more than redeemed his 1934 loss of the Epic Plan, successfully distancing himself from the CSA as a promoter of egalitarianism and liberty that will ensure no form of Marxism gains a foothold in our Republic while giving the people what they need."
CAL_radical_taxation:0 "Radical Taxation"
CAL_radical_taxation_desc:0 "Neither the Liberals nor the Progressives go far enough in their tax plans which do little to promote true egalitarianism. The sales tax shall be replaced with the stock tax while income, land, inheritance, corporate, bank and property taxes shall be raised for the wealthy while the poorest are made exempt"
CAL_commodity_credit_corporation: "Commodity Credit Corporation"
CAL_commodity_credit_corporation_desc:0 "While a depression eats away at our nation, farmers have been hit worse than almost anyone. Our farmers cry out for help, and we shall answer them. We will create the Commodity Credit Corporation, which will protect farmers in their income and prices, as well as providing more stability for them. This fundamental group will no longer be ignored."
CAL_fcwa:0 "Federal Civil Works Administration"
CAL_fcwa_desc:0 "Millions of unemployed workers still roam the streets of America. We can fix this by giving these people a simple offer: work in construction to build up our infrastructure and we will make sure you earn a decent wage while doing it. This will significantly decrease unemployment as well as increasing the prosperity of the country as a whole. The newly-created F.C.W.A. will see to this task."
CAL_federal_authority_for_land: "Federal Authority for Land"
CAL_federal_authority_for_land_desc: "With this act, we will create a Bureau of Land Management. We will retain significant amounts of the country's land for our own purposes, and we will use it to build projects that will benefit our population and our environment. This is sure to be unpopular with those who wished to move into these lands, however..." 
CAL_labor_colonies:0 "Labor Colonies"
CAL_labor_colonies_desc:0 "From Robert Owen to Charles Fourier, utopian societies and colonies are nothing new in America. Now, we will promote the creation of "labor colonies", in which all workers can toil equally and live a healthy and happy life. Some advocates have even suggested we implement some of the non-authoritarian practices seen in Edward Bellamy's "Looking Backward"." 
CAL_nationalize_oil:0 "Nationalize Oil"
CAL_nationalize_oil_desc:0 "Oil barons like John D. Rockefeller have ravaged this country for decades. He is perhaps the richest man in history while millions of Americans starve. No longer will this be the case. We will put Oil into the government's hands so that neither capitalist vultures nor foreign opportunists can steal from us."
CAL_nationalize_communication:0 "Nationalize Communication"
CAL_nationalize_communication_desc:0 "We must go even further than Oil in our nationalization efforts. The telephone, radio, telegraph, and more have all been in private hands for too long. These things should belong to all of the American people, not just the wealthy, and we will strive to make sure this is the case."
CAL_pensions:0 "Government Pensions"
CAL_pensions_desc:0 "We will ensure that our elderly loved ones can retire with dignity. No longer will parents be a burden on their children. Instead, we will implement a system in which workers can pay into a fund that they will be able to draw from after retirement. Our elderly will live the rest of their lives in decency, no longer ashamed of their age."
CAL_the_jungle:0 "The Jungle"
CAL_the_jungle_desc:0 "The conditions workers must endure in the cities is simply unacceptable. Our public works projects will update infrastructure and factories to be in-line with what they truly need, not what the capitalist class merely wants."
CAL_aim_for_the_heart:0 "Aim for the Heart"
CAL_aim_for_the_heart_desc:0 "Though the public did not react as intended to Sinclair's book "The Jungle", his party can now push for the increased workers rights that he was really advocating for in that book. The hearts of all Americans will drop at the sight of mistreated workers, and an outcry will come, demanding better conditions. "
CAL_hit_the_stomach:0 "Hit the Stomach"
CAL_hit_the_stomach_desc:0 "While somewhat bitter about the reaction to "The Jungle", Sinclair has realized that his readers did have a point. We must make sure that the food we feed our families is not contaminated and poisoned by corporate greed or any physical substance for that matter. Legislation will be passed to ensure clean, fresh food for all Americans."
CAL_bread_and_peace:0 "Bread and Peace"
CAL_bread_and_peace_desc:0 "Though Sinclair and his party have distanced themselves from the CSA, perhaps an agreement would be possible. After all, we have many goals in common, and though we may resume conflict at a later date, we should focus our efforts on eradicating reactionaries. It would also be a popular decision with our more left-wing supporters. It's worth a shot..."
CAL_communal_education:0 "Socialize Education"
CAL_communal_education_desc:0 "There are many new ideas that our party has about education. Some advocate for a sort of "communal education", in which children can be raised and educated by their neighbors in addition to their parents. Others call for the promotion of socialist values in our schools, in order to instill socialism in the next generation. Both of these ideas are now being considered, and will come before Congress."
CAL_union_expansion:0 "Union Expansion"
CAL_union_expansion_desc:0 "There is only one surefire way to protect the rights of the working man and that's through unionization! Unions do not desire violence but won't be afraid to strike when neccessary and demand what's theirs. We will work with like-minded union officials to aid their recruitment and protect them from crackdowns."
CAL_social_commonwealth:0 "Commonwealth of Labor"
CAL_social_commonwealth_desc:0 "With the foundation in place, we may finally become a Commonwealth of Labor by incorporating the unemployed into our programs and promoting private coops that do the same. Soon, all of the needy will be able to produce and trade with one another for what they need. Private companies will have to learn to either compete or purchase their goods at new government-set prices."
CAL_the_profits_of_religion:0 "The Profits of Religion"
CAL_the_profits_of_religion_desc:0 "While people having private religion is all good and well, many in our movement can not stand the so-called "Megachurches" or those who have made God's House into a marketplace. Churches above a certain size, including the so-called "New Thought" movement often seen in the freakish Spiritualist Party, will pay a small tax."
CAL_support_the_aclu:0 "Support the ACLU"
CAL_support_the_aclu_desc:0 "For too long, the state has been content with violating the civil rights of fellow citizens. No longer! We shall support the American Civil Liberties Union via a tax break, prosecuting violent harassment against them and waging a public campaign on their behalf while agreeing to remain politically neutral in their affairs so they can fight for the rights of all Americans."
CAL_birth_control:0 "The Pivot of Civilization"
CAL_birth_control_desc:0 "While there will be reactionaries who will denounce us, we must nonetheless go on to support the right of women to their own reproductive rights both for the individual and social good. Laws against birth control will be struck down and access to their availability in poorer neighborhoods made easier. In the long term this will aid in encouraging less productive citizens to have fewer children."
CAL_experimental_sciences:0 "Experimental Sciences"
CAL_experimental_sciences_desc:0 "If we are to be truly progressive, we must put our faith in scientific progress! There are a great deal of proposals looking for funding, and while there will surely be failures along the way, these are nothing compared to the breakthroughs that will result from increased funding to scientific endeavors, even ones that would usually be scoffed at."
CAL_radical_crusade:0 "Radical Crusade"
CAL_radical_crusade_desc:0 "The Commonwealth Party has triumphed in two elections, and now has a mandate. We can enact any goals we want, for we have been given approval by the voters themselves. We will take this opportunity to fight alcoholism, gambling, and smoking. These practices damage the moral fabric of our society, and must be crushed."
CAL_support_bellaymism:0 "Reason with the CSA"
CAL_prohibition:0 "Prohibition"
CAL_prohibition_desc:0 "There are few things damaging the working class as much as unfettered capitalism but alcohol may be a close contendor. The drink is used by the ruling classes to control their workers, and it destroys their bodies and morals alongside their families. It's time to finally complete the goals of the Anti-Saloon Leagues and illegalize liquor."
CAL_commonwealth_reelection:0 "Commonwealth Dominance"
CAL_commonwealth_reelection_desc:0 "Though many saw a Commonwealth victory as impossible in our first election, it has occured not once, but twice. Sinclair's party has ridden a wave of popularity into office once again, and promises to continue the work it began four years ago. Having passed significant economic policies, they now turn to the social realm, in the hopes of promoting a more equal society."
CAL_raise_inheritance_tax:0 "Raise Inheritance Tax"
CAL_raise_inheritance_tax_desc:0 "There are those in our society who have millions of dollars that they never toiled to earn. Why should we reward luck while we punish hard work? We must implement a harsher tax on inheritance so that the poorer among us will have food to eat or a roof to live under."
CAL_worker_bonds:0 "Worker Bonds"
CAL_worker_bonds_desc:0 "One idea that has been floated recently is the idea of worker bonds. These bonds would protect employees from wage disputes or financial obligations from their boss, and allow workers the ability to make a decent living."
CAL_reward_productivity:0 "Reward Productivity"
CAL_reward_productivity_desc:0 "We will strive to make sure that no hard working man or woman ever goes hungry again. We shall eliminate poverty and hunger by paying our workers a living wage. It is only natural, given the herculean efforts of American workers in recent years."
CAL_womens_advocacy:0 "Women's Advocacy"
CAL_womens_advocacy_desc:0 "Women make up half of our population, yet they have had little to no representation in our government for it's entire existence. This will no longer be the case. Through the creation of new women's advocacy groups, as well as the passage of new legislation, we can be sure that women will have an equal place in our society."
CAL_selective_immigration:0 "Selective Immigration"
CAL_selective_immigration_desc:0 "We must be careful to protect our workers. One way we can do this is by being selective about immigration, so that bosses don't take advantage of immigrant labor while snubbing domestic workers. This will eliminate yet another loophole that greedy capitalists often use to exploit labor. It will also raise our popularity with more conservative elements of our society." 

### National Populism ###

CAL_spiritualist_takeover:0 "Spiritualist Takeover"
CAL_spiritualist_takeover_desc:0 "With backing from former Federal Police members, political allies and Japan the Spiritualist Movement of President Edward Longstreet Bodin, Mankind United Leader Arthur Bell and the youthful writer, activist and Party organizer L. Ron Hubbard have seized control of the state, promising a total defense against Monarchist Anglo-Syndicalism."
CAL_power_of_information:0 "Power of Information"
CAL_power_of_information_desc:0 "Without the political connections established by the Party our hopes of saving the nation never would have been realized. Nonetheless we must expand on this, as it is barely enough to give us what little legitimacy we have. Hubbard has requested an expansion of our intelligence wing under him to further use espionage to influence Congress and, eventually, the Nation."
CAL_japanese_support:0 "Japanese Support"
CAL_japanese_support_desc:0 "Japan's financial and small loan of men was enough to help us seize the state and establish a far more friendly government to theirs than Hearst was. However taking power is often easier than keeping it and we must request additional support if we are to hope to maintain executive power, starting with renormalizing relations and undoing Hearst's so-called "Yellow Peril" before making our request."
CAL_finish_socialism:0 "Finish Socialism"
CAL_finish_socialism_desc:0 "With the political and financial support we needed it is time to end the greatest enemy ever seen to the American Nation, the socialist. Whether they are direct agents of the British Monarchy or merely useful idiots is irrelevent, all that we can be certain of is the sooner they are gone the better and that there is no shortage of potential graves in the West."
CAL_media_blackout:0 "Media Blackout"
CAL_media_blackout_desc:0 "Despite our attempts to downplay our most controversial beliefs the media continues to undermine us, with many papers calling Bodin and his followers "dictatorial conspiracy theorists". There is too much media hostility undermining us to pick and choose and undoubetdly at least some are being paid by foreign agents, so a total Media Blackout will be neccessary with a short term rooting out of dangerous critics."
CAL_christian_mysticism:0 "Christian Mysticism"
CAL_christian_mysticism_desc:0 "It is only common sense that it would be easier to rule over a population with beliefs more in-line with theirs. As such we should shift towards the Mysicalist Christian wing of the Party. We will will begin pressuring members to adopt this viewpoint and print the appropriate magazines to queitly spread."
CAL_dianetics:0 "Excalibur"
CAL_dianetics_desc:0 "We can not simply return to failed faiths to save us. A manifesto written by Hubbard, Excalibur, takes New Thought to its logical conclusion in understanding the power of the mind over the body, an invigorting idea to Party members. It may take longer for the population to be won out but after training activists to spread the word of this potential power we shall usher in a new era."
CAL_shadow_recruitment:0 "Shadow Recruitment"
CAL_shadow_recruitment_desc:0 "The Party must continue to be semi-secretive in not only its total beliefs and inner structure but in its recruitment methods. The way to do this is via the training of existing party members to subtly gather recruits among family and friends and to bring them to our new centers which will start them on the Party's Spiritual Journey via new tehcniques such as "auditing"."
CAL_ufology:0 "Ufology"
CAL_ufology_desc:0 "With our rejection of traditional faith the question of a higher power is on the minds of many inner party members. Thankfully Hubbard also has an answer to this in his outlining of the immnortal soul, Thetans, and its descendence from extraterrertials before arriving on Earth. Evidence of E.T.'s will be investigated and its full belief spread among inner-party members."
CAL_the_messengers:0 "The Messengers"
CAL_the_messengers_desc:0 "Our need for a better organized security service remains needed, as so far we have relied on loose organizations of militia members and certain government employees. The Messengers will a better funded organization in direct contact with the Eternal President of the Party, made up of our most devout followers and will always relay His word."
CAL_new_science:0 "New Sciences"
CAL_new_science_desc:0 "We can not afford to be blind to the New Sciences as so many others are if we to defend ourselves. Telekinesis, Psychic Intervention, Ectoplasm and the power of Rockets shall all be investigated as a means of long range warfare against syndicalist and foreign influence, which will also provide official government departments for more Spiritualist Party Members who already practice this."
CAL_supernatural_investigators:0 "Paranormal Investigations"
CAL_supernatural_investigators_desc:0 "If we are to promote Mysicism on the circuit then we need to buffer our claims. Reports of paranormal activity, including some written directly by Boden, must be spread among party speakers and activists alongside a new Department of the Paranormal that investigates claims of the paranormal and offers to speak with dead relatives to those who request it... at a price."
CAL_celebrity_endorsements:0 "Celebrity Endorsements"
CAL_celebrity_endorsements_desc:0 "Minor celebrities on the L.A. circuit seem open to our beliefs such as mystery writer Arthur J. Burks and Health Publicist Bernarr Macfadden. However bigger names would be of aid and so we shall have McFadden use his connections to the upper class to recruit celebriities into the cause, promising health remedies in return, and at Hubbard's urging the Party will open Celebrity Divisions."
CAL_religion_of_profit:0 "A Most Profitable Religion"
CAL_religion_of_profit_desc:0 "Currently the parties beliefs and hiearchy is very static, with few ways to move up for newcomers. However, there is a means by which one can show loyalty to our eternal movement; monetary donations. These donations would go a long way towards contributing to the cause and allow a way for some to prove their loyality, as well as helping appeal to the upper-class with promises of secret knowledge and power."
CAL_the_radio:0 "Voice of the Nation"
CAL_the_radio_desc:0 "With little in the way of media information except via government pamphlets, activists and an approved handful of publicists it is time to modernize the Party's means of communication with the public so there may be a more consistant source of news. The newly found National News Network will provide this and approve more publicists who advertise the truth."
CAL_the_redshirt_plot:0 "The Redshirt Plot"
CAL_the_redshirt_plot_desc:0 "While there are those of us aware of the connection between the House of Windsor and the syndicalist revolution, and their attempt to retake our nation via false flag operations and foreign operatives, even more are unaware or even worse skeptical. We must spread the word loudly of their intentions and further safeguard the nation from potential British Loyalists via investigations into non-native citizens."
CAL_hunt_down_every_syndicalist:0 "Avenge 1776"
CAL_hunt_down_every_syndicalist_desc:0 "With full control on the reigns of the nation we shall take back our nation from the syndicalists and their leaders, the British Monarchy, as well as the useful idiots whom fell for their plot to destroy the nation such as the Longists, Federalists and the so-called 'White Leaguers' whom often fetishize the British Nation."
CAL_betray_japan:0 "Betray Japan"
CAL_betray_japan_desc:0 "As we have established control over the situation Japan is not only no longer useful but holding us back from our full potential in retaking the United States. It is time to declare our intention to reclaim the United States and give Japan an ultimatum between sticking with us or incuring our wrath."
CAL_japan_in_command:0 "Japan in Command"
CAL_japan_in_command_desc:0 "Japan has been remarkably kind to us thus far. Let us further bolster our relations with them by signing a military alliance. This will put us in the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" and allow Japan greater influence over our affairs. With their help, we will be able to exert our influence across the Western Hemisphere..."
CAL_government_reconstruction:0 "Government Restructuring"
CAL_government_reconstruction_desc:0 "It is time to remodel our government, with some Japanese influences. We will allow the Army and Navy more power than ever before, and the President will attempt to emulate the majesty of the Japanese Emperor himself. What could go wrong?"
CAL_japanese_trade:0 "Japanese Trade"
CAL_japanese_trade_desc:0 "The Pacific Ocean is vast, yet on the other side lies the wealth of the Orient. Through Japan, we can access vast wealth and a multitude of trading partners. We will sign a trade agreement with them in order to bring our nations closer together."
CAL_cultural_exchange_2:0 "Cultural Exchange Programs"
CAL_cultural_exchange_2_desc:0 "Despite the previously hostile relationship between the West Coast and Asia, we will now strive to bring the two regions closer together, particularly in the case of Japan. We will encourage travel between the two countries and a sort of cultural exchange will hopefully occur. The first prominent citizen we will send is Walt Disney, who will bring some of his animations to show the Emperor."
CAL_friends_in_the_east:0 "Special Relationship With Japan"
CAL_friends_in_the_east_desc:0 "We will pursue a special relationship with Japan, who is our closest ally and  largest trading partner. With trans-Pacific cooperation, there is little our two countries cannot achieve. We are set to conduct naval exercises near Guam soon. Now we must seek to dominate the hinterlands of our respective regions..."

CAL_commons_law:0 "Commons Law"
CAL_commons_law_desc:0 "Economist John Commons made an excellent observation that resources belong to all and that a tax would help prevent overusing them while also funding public goods. Thus, resource extraction shall have a tax."
CAL_national_referendums:0 "National Referendum"
CAL_national_referendums_desc:0 "While democracy in and of itself is not a flawed concept, the failings of the crony capitalism that permeated the old systems were laid bare by the Civil War. We need to ensure that democracy now works for everyone."
CAL_blanket_primary:0 "Blanket Primary"
CAL_blanket_primary_desc:0 "Forcing voters to stick along party lines can be just as restrictive as moneyed influence, thus blanket primaries will allow them to select primary candidates without regard to party."
CAL_recall_elections:0 "Election Recall"
CAL_recall_elections_desc:0 "If our legislatures and executives are going to represent the people they must be tethered to their will. We will enact the possibility of congressional, state and local recall elections via referendum so the voters can hold their politicians responsible."
CAL_strengthen_democracy:0 "Judicial Recall"
CAL_strengthen_democracy_desc:0 "Recall should not only be present for the executive and legislative branch, but for justices as well, or otherwise corrupt or tyrannical judges would risk going unpunished."
CAL_kill_gold:0 "Destroy the Tyranny of Gold"
CAL_kill_gold_desc:0 "Gold forced our economy to prioritize inflation over debt-holders and to cut during economic downturns which only hurt the population. Without Gold we will have a more flexible monetary and fiscal policy."
CAL_tariff_reduction_act:0 "Tariff Reduction Act"
CAL_tariff_reduction_act_desc:0 "We must reduce tariffs on goods from other countries, as our current laws are hurting American workers and farmers. In turn, other countries will lower their tariffs on our goods, and we will be able to export more than ever before.This act will put us one step closer to economic prosperity, not just for the rich, but for all Americans."
CAL_womens_bill:0 "American Women's Bill"

CAL_AFDC:0 "Aid to Families with Dependent Children"
CAL_AFDC_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, some large families in poverty need some more aid. We should pass the AFDC to grant direct welfare for large families with children.

CAL_republicans_win_twice:0 "Republicans Win Re-Election"
CAL_republicans_win_twice_desc:0 "It appears that the pro-industry, laissez-faire ways of the Republican Party have been vindicated as the Pacific States entrust them to bring prosperity to America with their agenda. With a new mandate, they are confident they will be able to do just that."
CAL_rfc:0 "Reconstruction Finance Corporation"
CAL_rfc_desc:0 "Amongst one of many of Hoover's unrecognized contributions to the nation include the RFC, which would give loans to banks and other sectors that did not qualify for the Federal Reserve. So long as its powers are limited and it is better funded it will aid our efforts."
CAL_dam_projects:0 "Dam Projects"
CAL_dam_projects_desc:0 "Dams have many purposes in our society; from being a source of power and clean water to a controller of floods, these marvels of technology will change our society forever. We must do everything we can to promote their construction and invest in further Dam technology."
CAL_radical_decentralization:0 "Decentralized Market"
CAL_radical_decentralization_desc:0 "We must implement radical changes to our markets. No longer will the federal government breathe down the necks of local and state markets. Instead, local banks will become more prominent in our economy, and we will support a market run by the states."
CAL_support_wet_laws:0 "Support Wet Laws"
CAL_support_wet_laws_desc:0 "Why should we ban alcohol when we can profit off of it? This is not the time to turn away revenue, and our economy would be greatly bosltered by an influx of alcohol profits. Our party will seek to pass new wet laws in our country that will allow for this to occur."

CAL_support_right_to_work_desc:0 "It is bad enough that unions have been allowed to flourish in our society. There is little we can currently do to counteract this.

CAL_scientific_taxation:0 "Scientific Taxation"
CAL_scientific_taxation_desc:0 "There are many in our country and even our government who argue that we must raise taxes to increase revenue.

CAL_surplus_aid:0 "Surplus Aid"
CAL_surplus_aid_desc:0 "Not only have we successfully balanced the budget, we now have a surplus. We will use these funds to help those who need it most: our nation's farmers. In doing so, we can smooth things over with formerly rebellious farmers and bring them into the fold."

CAL_invest_in_children_desc:0 "Every child should be given a chance in our society. It is unfortunate that there exist people whose parents have abandoned them.

CAL_democrats_win_twice:0 "Democrats Win Re-Election"
CAL_democrats_win_twice_desc:0 "The Democratic Party has seen some successes since the First Civil War. Now we are beginning a new era of popularity in our country, and we should use it to our advantage.

CAL_reefer_madness:0 "Reefer Madness"
CAL_reefer_madness_desc:0 "The practice of reefing, which refers to the smoking of marijuana, should be outlawed and cracked down upon.

CAL_patriotic_schooling:0 "Patriotic Schooling"
CAL_patriotic_schooling_desc:0 "One of the causes of the recent Second Civil War is the lack of patriotism in our schools. Our children should be encouraged, if not required, to sing the national anthem, as well as learn about our traditions and folklore stories. This will instill a sense of patriotism within them that will prevent another civil war."
CAL_vice_squads:0 "Fight Crime"
CAL_vice_squads_desc:0 "We will implement a new law enforcement branch that will serve to enforce the law when police officers or the national guard cannot.

CAL_sex_laws:0 "Decency Laws"
CAL_sex_laws_desc:0 "There are those whom believe they can profit from selling smut and/or disgusting "sex aids" in public stores.

CAL_support_farms:0 "Support Agriculture"
CAL_support_farms_desc:0 "Farms are the backbone of our democracy and our  culture. The Democratic Parties Agricultural Bill will raise farm subsidies and encourage businesses to purchase from them in bulk, with the government covering the cost of any goods that spoil."
CAL_blue_laws:0 "Blue Laws"
CAL_blue_laws_desc:0 "It is unbelievable that on Sundays people must work when they are supposed to be relaxing and spending time with their families.

CAL_ban_race_mixing:0 "Federal Ban on Race Mixing"
CAL_ban_race_mixing_desc:0 "Men such as Madison Grant have proclaimed that Race-Mixing will cause nothing more than the downfall of the caucasian race. In accordance,the administration has declared that race-mixing must be banned."
CAL_jazz_crackdown:0 "Jazz Crackdown"

CAL_blind_eye:0 "Turn a Blind Eye"

This program proposed by the Department of Labor was meant to alleviate the west's employment shortage and was supported by the Republicans.

In a bid to increase the national spirits, the Belfast Beverage Company even struck a deal with the Pacific Government, providing the new soda-pop as part of the military rations allotted to our troops on the frontline fighting radicalism in the Second American Civil War. This move has proven to be a smashing success, with troops across the Rockies finding refreshment in these sugary brown suds - a cold yet all too quick reprieve from the horrors of war. Commonly nicknamed ‘Mug’ by the troops, - a shorthand pseudonym for the drink coined by the boys of the ‘Berkeley Bulldogs’ infantry division and spread throughout the army - these root beer rations have increased soldier morale as well as the public’s opinion towards both our government and the brewing company, while the recent sales have provided a small boon to our economy.

Consequently county clerk W. G. Sharp followed California Law and refused to give them their marriage licenses.\n\nHowever, Perez with the help of their lawyer, Daniel G. Marshall, brought forth a writ of Writ of Mandamus. Within the trial, one of the arguments that was brought up was the fact that both Perez and Davis were Catholic and wanted a Catholic Marriage that included mass.

This has attracted something of a media circus as activists have tried to protest the actions claiming that these men are not the killer and are innocent, the fact that there is insufficient evidence to link them. Despite this nine of them were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison, with the rest being imprisoned in Los Angeles County jail.\n\nThe case has generated much animosity within the white populace towards Mexican-Americans, not helped by the fact that both the Police and the Press have characterized all Mexican Youths as 'pachuco hoodlums and baby gangsters.'"

Pushing its way into the important motion picture theaters, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats.

In deposing the democratically-elected president in the name of 'preserving stability', he shattered the founding principles of our great nation. The destruction of the healthy civil-military relationship that has marked America since independence is a grievous slight to all the values we hold as a nation.\n\nIn response, the governors of California, Washington, and Oregon have issued a joint declaration condemning the General’s actions, and demanding his immediate withdrawal from Washington. We doubt he will respond positively, but like the patriots in 1776, we must take a stand against tyranny and oppression."

pacificstates.151.d:0 "Frank Merriam, in coordination with the governors of Oregon and Washington, issued a stunning public statement today. In it, he claimed that if the so-called 'protector' of American values could not even respect the basic rights outlined in the Constitution, referring to Douglas MacArthur, it would be up to the people of the Pacific to defend America's inalienable rights. Claiming that MacArthur’s overthrow of the government was illegitimate, a new election would be held to select a new president - albeit amongst a limited slate of candidates in the Pacific region. Still, according to Merriam, whoever won this election would still have more legitimacy than MacArthur, and would be tasked with overseeing the return of the nation to democracy - by force, if needs be."

pacificstates.152.d:0 "Following Bill Haywood’s own declaration of MacArthur’s illegitimacy, many hoped that the capitalists and syndicalists could come together and preserve American democracy. Those naive aspirations were dashed when Governor Merriam ordered the National Guard to violently suppress a syndicalist protest which broke out in Sacramento. This escalated into widespread rioting across many Western cities, with Seattle in particular descending into violence. Longshoremen and teamsters broke into Seattle city hall, and proclaimed the city loyal to Haywood’s workers republic in Chicago. Currently, the city is in a tense stand-off between National Guard units and the rebels holed up in the city hall."

While some of the ships in Naval Base San Diego were transferred to the East Coast after the first signs of unrest, many remained - along with sailors from across the country. Details are sketchy, but it appears a base commander, on orders from Washington, ordered sailors to take weapons from the base armory and head into the city. Deploying themselves at polling places, they prevented poll workers from setting up. When morning came, large mobs surrounded these soldiers, and began pelting them with rocks, bottles, and other debris. One of the sailors, hit by a bottle, fired back, and soon the city descended into chaos.\n\nCalifornia National Guard units were deployed, and pitched street battles between sailors loyal to MacArthur and the Guardsmen erupted, turning the tranquil city into a war zone."

Since our spending in military affairs shall be increased, some designers have approached us with newer models with better engines and suspension systems which shall ensure no regular breakdowns happen, but in exchange our experts predict our production speed will be reduced.

Another party to re-arise is the old Progressive Party, which has existed in various forms but has now absorbed largely progressive republicans alongside various social democrats. The most radical ticket on the left by far however is Upton Sinclair's Commonwealth party, functionally a more formal recreation of the EPIC ticket from 1932 and which promises a partially planned economy with regards to land and businesses that are believed to be 'idle', gaining support from both left democrats and the right-wing of the socialist party.

Meanwhile professional cowboy John Wayne, famous for his lead role in the hit Singing Daisies, has given an interview endorsing the Democratic Party although he also said he wan't particularly opposed to Hearst's ideas.

The accusations range from connections with the "radical" progressives formerly within the GOP, their initial push for conflicts with MacArthur and their legalizing of the syndicalist parties under Herbert Hoover./n/n Howard Hughes was the first GOP associated industrial magnate to be called to answer for his part in lobbying officials to both continue the war effort and to buy his products while doing so. However the public questioning went haywire when Hughes turned aroudn the questions onto his inquisitor, Jack Tenney, by asking him if he had been helping Hearst corner the newspaper market despite Hearst now being a public official. Likewise he accused Hearst and his men such as Tenney and John Z. Anderson of engaging in lobbying efforts on behalf of the California-subsidary of the Bethel corporation to focus on ship-building contracts despite the war taking place on the same continent. It made it especially difficult to demonize Hughes as he readily admitted to lobbbying but said it was not only a common practice but that Tenney and Hearst were corrupt hypocrites and unlike them he never lobbied for a cause he didn't believe in."

However while this influx of resources is needed we have been met with requests to give an exemption to Yellowstone National Park, with the park officials and activists calling it a cultural cornerstone of the nation."
pacificstates.242.a:0 "Open it for mining"
pacificstates.242.b:0 "Very well, it's off limits"

pacificstates.243.t:0 "Hawaii Reconquered"
pacificstates.243.d:0 "Finally, we have taken control of the treacherous state of Hawaii and brought it under the West. With plentiful access to their sugar plantations we can bring in further government revenue, though perhaps we should extract a tax on their wealthiest as a further penalty for their earlier disloyalty?"
pacificstates.243.a:0 "Tax them"
pacificstates.243.b:0 "We have what we came for"

pacificstates.244.t:0 "Debt under control"

pacificstates.245.t:0 "Military Coups Hearst"
pacificstates.245.d:0 "William Randolph Hearst, President of the PSA, has been arrested and deposed by the military under General Arnold and his forces with Arnold announcing Hearst a tyrant in the face of protests. There is an understanding that General Marshall knew of the coup and has allowed it to happen, securing Arnold's position as the head of state until he finally addresses Congress."
pacificstates.245.a:0 "Right Back at Square One!"

pacificstates.246.t:0 "Federal Police Flee!"
pacificstates.246.d:0 "The Federal Police who chose not the surrender have been pushed out of the West, with them fleeing Eastward to avoid capture or death. While this helps secure our rule, we have suffered some loss in manpower as a result."
pacificstates.246.a:0 "Their tyranny finally ends"

pacificstates.247.t:0 "MacArthur's Demands"
pacificstates.247.d:0 "MacArthur is furious at his ally Hearst being disposed and has called on us to release the National Democrats under arrest to the custody of the US and to renew our treaty agreeing not to wage war on the US. It is evident he views us as illegitimate but does not feel he's in a position to stop us... at the moment. What shall we do?"
pacificstates.247.a:0 "Just agree for now"
pacificstates.247.b:0 "No"

pacificstates.248.t:0 "Speech to California"
pacificstates.248.:0 "As General Arnold prepares his speech to the nation he, General Marshall and their advisors wonder if there is a way to stabilize the nation while avoiding the American Civil War. An idea that has been flouted by some columnists and small activists is the Pacific States staying away from the 'tyrants' of the East by becoming an independent nation. As the most influential men in the nation they could easily include such sentiments in their speech and begin steering Congress towards such a view but some in the cabinet believe we should not give up our claims on the East."
pacificstates.248.a:0 "Announce our intent to retake the West"
pacificstates.248.b:0 "We are Pacificans Now"

pacificstates.249.t:0 "Re-open Congress"
pacificstates.249.d:0 "Congress has been reopened and now elections can be on once again. The question facing the military is if we should be nominees ourselves given cross party requests that the current government run. Marshall's aides have entertained the idea he run for President on the Democratic-Republican Party platform."
pacificstates.249.a:0 "Very well, I will run"
pacificstates.249.b:0 "No, military and politics must stay separate"

pacificstates.2490.t:0 "Snap Election Results"
pacificstates.2490.d:0 "The snap election results have come in between the established class and respectable parties of the PSA, although the Commonwealth Party did not have enough strength to run after Hearst's crackdowns, something that did not seem to upset the military and Congress."

pacificstates.250.d:0 "Always a fan of technological progress, General Arnold has collaborated with General Marshall to form a new Research and Development Department that will focus on advancing not only studies needed for advanced military weapons but also studies to collect data that may help us formulate policies. But which should Rand be focused on for now?"

pacificstates.251.t:0 "Disney accepts the Draft"
pacificstates.251.d:0 "Walt Disney has accepted the offer to draft him as the candidate for the Democratic Party. In his public announcement he stated that his campaign would attempt to mend the political divide in the nation and give the country much needed stability in the form of American morality and responsible governance. This is a relief for a Democratic Party that has been suffering from splits for the past few months."
pacificstates.251.a:0 "We're saved!"

pacificstates.252.t:0 "Welfare Reforms"
pacificstates.252.d:0 "We finally have the political capital to revamp state and local level welfare which is encouraging poor behavior. Seeing a small expansion on the state level in the Wilson and Palmer years, the welfare system currently offers a small amount of welfare to those living under the poverty level without employment, especially single mothers. We could require work to be a necessary component of receiving welfare or simply make it exclusive to these mothers. These reforms will encourage stronger work ethics in the populace while reserving needed funds for those whom need it most."
pacificstates.252.a:0 "Have stronger work requirements"
pacificstates.252.b:0 "Make it more exclusive"

pacificstates.253.t:0 "Left Democrats Fired"
pacificstates.253.d:0 "Left Democrats have recently been fired from government for their association with hard-left causes as well as some of them refusing to take our loyalty pledges. This has naturally caused a backlash, with accusations of authoritarianism coming in from the left as well as civil liberty activists. Within our party however it is generally agreed this will decrease the chances of syndicalist infiltration."

pacificstates.254.t:0 "Competing Grants"
pacificstates.254.d:0 "WIth our policies focused on a pro-business agenda, multiple lobbying groups have come forward to request grants. The Maritime Commission wants the grants to go primarily to local shipyards, especially the new LA based California Shipbuilding Corporation and Kaiser Shipyards, hoping it will increase trade and ships for national defense. However the Small Business League has far more popular support and is requesting support to help them produce consumer goods and jobs. Finally there is the Motor Industry, especially the suffering Moreland Motor Truck Company, whom desire a California far more reliant on automobiles. With our balanced budget policy only one can get it, but who?"

pacificstates.255.t:0 "Education for Death: Syndicalist Madness"
pacificstates.255.d:0 "A new Disney film is in theatres that is damaging the reputation of Syndicalism while supporting our own government. The film presents an extremely negative view of the Combined Syndicates presenting them as filling the heads of youth with revolutionary ideals but not before making sure no process of parenting is 'reactionary'. After teaching children about the evils of capitalism they are sent off to fight in war at extremely young ages, used as little more than canon fodder for the syndicalist cause. Presenting Syndicalism as conflict oriented and militant, it is praised by critics despite the CSA decrying it as lies."
pacificstates.255.a:0 "Great!"
pacificstates.255.b:0 "Show it in schools"

pacificstates.256.t:0 "Commando Duck vs the Klan"
pacificstates.256.d:0 "A new Disney production once again does what should have been done long ago and presents an amusing animated short for children to enjoy at the expense of the Constitutional Republic of America. It starts with Donald Duck humorously para-dropping into Northern Florida and narrowly escaping being eaten by alligators. He then goes on to dodge Klan snipers (drawn as clear stereotypes of southerners) before accidentally destroying an enemy navy base."
pacificstates.256.a:0 "Hilarious!"
pacificstates.256.b:0 "Kids get in for free!"

pacificstates.257.t:0 "The Chief's Face"
pacificstates.257.d:0 "A new Disney film taking aim at General MacArthur has been released! It depicts Donald Duck awakening to a military march outside his home by fanatical federalist supporters before being forced to go to work building armaments for them. It pokes fun at MacArthur's perceived authoritarianism, claims of upholding democracy, and militarism. The short ends with Donald waking up from this nightmare in San Francisco, thanking God that he lives in the Pacific States."
pacificstates.257.a:0 "Wonderful!"
pacificstates.257.b:0 "Deals for families!"

pacificstates.258.t:0 "Entente sends goods"
pacificstates.258.d:0 "Canada has taken a liking to our pro-Entente stance and our fervently anti-syndicalist democracy. As such, it is no surprise that the faction of liberalism is aiding us. Of course, cynics believe they are simply hedging their bets and may be aiding other factions as well, but we will not forget this regardless."
pacificstates.258.a:0 "For Democracy!"

pacificstates.259.t:0 "Comic Codes Authority"
pacificstates.259.d:0 "With our campaign against immorality, the Comic Codes Authority has been founded by the Comic Book industry to carve out much of the 'smut' that makes up modern entertainment. It bans profanity, obscenity, smut, seduction, vulgarity, nudity, horror, excessive bloodshed, gory or gruesome crimes, depravity, lust, sadism, masochism, walking dead, torture, vampires and vampirism, ghouls, cannibalism, werewolfism, depictions of criminals in any positive light, the negative display of authority figures, and more. They also ban the words "horror" and "terror" in their titles, which has been met with accusations that it's an attempt by John Goldwater and other figures at Archie Comics, the main force behind the CCA, to put their rivals out of business. Nonetheless it is an attack on immorality and one that is not officially government as any comic that does not abide by it will simply not be given a CCA sticker."
pacificstates.259.a:0 "Very well"

pacificstates.260.t:0 "Universities Refuse to Support Immorality"
pacificstates.260.d:0 "Universities in our nation are increasingly refusing to carry works that are being labeled 'dangerous' and/or anti-social. Marxist, hard-left, 'offensive' and 'anti-American' works are decreasingly being carried by universities and libraries, and universities such as UC Berkeley have agreed to apply the Levering Act to their own universities, effectively banning communists and syndicalists from teaching there."
pacificstates.260.a:0 "A productive development"

pacificstates.261.t:0 "Industrial League for Clean Living"
pacificstates.261.d:0 "The Industrial League for Clean Living is a grouping of businessmen, largely deriving from the Rotary Club, who are in full-agreement with our governments policies. They pay workers extra, both in money and benefits, for being socially responsible, while threatening to penalize individuals whom are socially irresponsible. This can range from abandoning children to drug use. While the extra benefits they provide workers are popular, some take issue with what they see as business leaders influencing their workers lives but their can be no doubt it is leading to positive social effects."
pacificstates.261.a:0 "A positive event"

pacificstates.263.t:0 "Harry Bridges arrested"
pacificstates.263.d:0 "Pacific syndicalist leader Harry Bridges was arrested today, which will likely result in him being deported from the states given his birth in Australiasia. While we have successfully captured many syndicalist leaders whom occupied a legal grey area, Bridges capture was considered necessary as he was utterly pro-CSA and an effective organizer, and as such his arrest will disrupt syndicalist activities."
pacificstates.263.a:0 "Good"

pacificstates.264.t:0 "Defense Attorney's Attacked"
pacificstates.264.d:0 "The defense attorneys assigned to defend various syndicalist defendants accused of spying for the CSA or internal sabotage have been attacked in recent days. One of them had a firearm fired at their home and many others have received threatening mail, causing requests for safety. Perhaps we should assign them police protection?"
pacificstates.264.a:0 "Assign Protection"
pacificstates.264.b:0 "Have the Military handle remaining cases"

pacificstates.266.t:0 "Is Social Hygiene going too far?"
pacificstates.266.d:0 "The public is in an uproar! Apparently a journalist went undercover to investigate the state of mental hospitals where women found to be anti-social or otherwise mentally unfit were sent and the result was a horror story, with the story claiming that many of the women there merely violated a law but were mentally sound. This has led to increasingly outrageous urban myths around the subject. What should we do?"
pacificstates.266.a:0 "Investigate these institutions"
pacificstates.266.b:0 "Raise the bar to be sent to these areas"
pacificstates.266.c:0 "They're criminals, what's the problem?"

pacificstates.269.t:0 "The Hollywood Ten"
pacificstates.269.d:0 "Hollywood has long been suspected of housing some syndicalist supporters who seek to use modern media to sneak their insidious messages. This has been all but confirmed now as a list of Hollywood screenwriters and directors affiliated with the IWW and its allies was publicly released in papers such as Variety, leading to legal investigation. Now ten of those being investigated have been found in contempt for refusing to answer questions from Congressional Senators, whom are already being nicknamed the Hollywood Ten."
pacificstates.269.a:0 "Commies"

pacificstates.270.t:0 "Hollywood Blacklist"
pacificstates.270.d:0 "There is a large-scale blowback to supposed leftist influence in Hollywood, with many executives viewing it as confirmation that striking and otherwise unruly workers are syndicalist agitators. As such the Motion Pictures Alliance for Defending American Ideals has been founded as a win of the MPA with the goal of investigating radical influence in Hollywood. Those uncovered for their sympathies, now including mega-star Charlie Chaplin, have been placed on a 'Blacklist' that virtually excludes them from work. Of course, some view this as a 'betrayal' of our ideals and are calling on us to not give the idea congressional support."

pacificstates.271.t:0 "Hays Code Backlash"
pacificstates.271.d:0 "The Hays Code has caused opposition among liberal activists who are calling the government "prudes" and a recent article mocking us as wanting to outlaw all of cinema. Maybe we should talk to the MPAA about loosening the rules a bit, although the Legion of Decency and Hays Code architect Joseph Breen would be fanatically opposed to such a decision."
pacificstates.271.a:0 "Talk to them"
pacificstates.271.b:0 "No, the Code stays as is"

pacificstates.272.t:0 "Protests!"
pacificstates.272.d:0 "Liberal university students guided by student organization and leftist faculty members have begun protesting what they consider increasing censorship within society, kickstarted by university professors being sacked for refusing to take loyalty oaths. They accuse the government of being little different from MacArthur, an absurd claim given that the universities enacted moral codes without being forced to. Nonetheless is can not be denied that there are fewer books in the library, greater screening of the political views of faculty and a general trend towards greater monitoring of students. Journalists are sympathetic to them whom call us "pearl clutchers" , so it may increase support to talk university faculty into reversing some of their codes. Of course, while many of the faculty and students are Left Democrats it is an open secret some have syndicalist sympathies, something that could make it easy to simply attack them."

pacificstates.273.t:0 "Picture Perfect"
pacificstates.273.d:0 "Our policy of further deregulating the economy is already baring fruit! Allen B. DuMont, the man responsible for kickstarting our country’s military RADAR systems has started mass producing his own consumer television sets! For the low price of $$200, Families across the county will be able to experience entertainment currently only available at cinemas with all the convenience of using a home radio. Although there are not a lot of programs to watch on this new entertainment medium, some of the major players in the radio business are moving in along with DuMont himself establishing a new television network. At the current rate, experts believe that most Americans will have a television set in their home within ten years."
pacificstates.273.a:0 "Great!"

pacificstates.275.t:0 "International Film making explodes"
pacificstates.275.d:0 "Our lowering taxation and promotion of cinema alongside market advancements in technology has left Hollywood with far more income than usual and has allowed them to produce a larger slew of films. Now the Department of Commerce has relayed to us that film making has never been more popular and with it Republican ideals and pro-American sentiments. And of course California locals more than welcome the additional work available on sets as well."
pacificstates.275.a:0 "Wonderful!"

pacificstates.276.t:0 "Panic!"
pacificstates.276.d:0 "It appears that private investors have becomed concerned with market investments in these unstable times! The rumors spreading that our military has questionable loyalties to radical ideologies are nonsense but with the overvaluing of already risky investments of those already using their new income and market prospects rather unwisely has nonetheless caused investors to pull funds out of the stock market in the fear of collapse. It will take a bit of time to recover, though it should when it becomes clear that these conspiracy theories are not real."
pacificstates.276.a:0 "Damn!"

pacificstates.277.t:0 "Recovery"
pacificstates.277.d:0 "According to the most reports that are now being published we have restored confidence in our governments stability and with it the industry that survives under us, causing an upsurge in the economy! The Pacific States has seen an investment boom and we are quickly returning to a new Golden Age or, as radical critics cynically call it, a new Gilded Age. But let the anti-market fanatics spout their theoretical nonsense while we raise a glass to work that is easy to find and goods available for affordable prices."

pacificstates.283.d:0 "With our open door policy we have seen a wider influx of refugees from neighboring nations despite our own troubles, especially those going through syndicalist revolts, nationalist revanchism or extreme economic depression, growing our own national GDP in the process.

The most radical elements of them have reformed the California based Working Man's party, absorbing smaller nativist chapters upto and including former Klan members.

pacificstates.290.d:0 "The Office of Minority Affairs is a proposed expansion of the Negro Bureau which will allow us to more easily deal with minority community leaders and respond to their affairs, but some funding is required.

pacificstates.296.d:0 "The Agricultural Adjustment Act was intended to help prop up prices for farmers by destroying excess supply but it has come under fire even from those generally aligned with us as journalists document the waste this results in and claim we are only benefiting larger corporations.

However, the family has difficulty entering California, needing to sneak through the Western Command Center, only to be met with hatred by locals whom view them as a threat to jobs or demand they fight for them.

pacificstates.303.d:0 "William Randolph Hearst has begun denouncing the government in his papers, accusing us of syndicalist sympathies and of attacking liberty. The GOP papers have followed suit though in a more restrained manner. It is little secret that Hearst is considered a MacArthur loyalist and desires the downfall of our government, especially after his taxes were hiked. The question is if this is enough to have him investigated for treacherous activity or if doing so would stray too far into authoritarianism. An investigation by the Pacific Bureau would not only involve Hearst but also his many columnists whom seem to be bordering on treacherous activity."

Our policy of easing access to contraceptives and abortion angered practicing Catholics in our region and now that "Sister" Aimee Semple McPherson's church is being taxed the two have combined political forces to oppose us. However progressives are supportive of our policies, believing it will lead to a more stable, intelligent soceity.

pacificstates.325.d:0 "Many capitalists are showing their true colors by fleeing the PSA in favor of either Canada or even the WCC, suporting them over us as retaliation for our economic policies. This has made for free propaganda against them however, but nonetheless has come with some major costs as we decide what to do with the industries they liquidated before fleeing. Managing it directly would help make them useful sooner although others believe it would be more in-line with our ideology to create coops of production of need out of these remaining industries, as a precursor to our more large scale plans."

Likewise, union organizers have been better organizing others whom benefit from our programs, such as those who live in our coops, so that they can vote effectively. Their alliance with members of the middle-class whom favor us has made us a powerful coalition indeed."

pacificstates.364.d:0 "With our destiny and society so closely intertwined with Japan and their monarchy, many die-hard Japaneseists and honored loyalists to the Chrysanthemum Throne have suggested that we take our ‘partnership’ a step further. Offering to build a replica of the Takamikura Throne that once resided in Kyoto to be the seat of a newly created puppet monarchy within our territory along with a generous military and economic stimulus package, the Japanese are pressuring us to allow them to transform the Pacific States into a client kingdom under the thumb of the Rising Sun. If we were to accept such a deal, we would be totally subservient to the Japanese, removing any last shred of independence we have left, but in return we would be treated as near equals to their undeniable might, raising us above most others in the Co-Prosperity Sphere as Japan’s most favored subject and ally. Is untold prosperity and security worth sacrificing the last shreds of Americanism as we progress towards total domination under the wise and benevolent guidance of Tokyo? The final decision is left up to our regime, though with Japan already so closely intertwined with our regime here and already holding most of the power, many wonder if we even truly have a say."

pacificstates.350.t:0 "California Spiritualists request our aid?"
pacificstates.350.d:0 "The "Spiritualists" in California are loosely-organized right-wing group opposed to British Imperialism and Socialism, and claim they seek our aid against both. With their intelligence operations becoming increasingly sophisticated they desire a trade of information, monetary support and a pledge of aid. While many in our government fervently support the idea of undermining the anti-Eastern and imperialistic Hearst in favor of possible allies they do not have a firm grasp of the situation as of yet and in fact them coming to power is unlikely.

Of course Japan may well be interested in instilling itself in our politics, perhaps in response to our recent saber-rattling. While Hearst is famously paranoid of Japan the Spiritualists are still useful for aid in domestic intelligence and the collaboration, even if wholly true, likely means little. What should we do?"
pacificstates.3500.a:0 "Yank their funding"

pacificstates.351.t:0 "Spiritualist Counter-Coup!"
pacificstates.351.d:0 "From L.A. Edward Longstreet Bodin, leader of the increasingly organized Spiritualist Party, has made a radio announcement that William Randolph Hearst has been overthown by treachourous foreign agents within the army. Naming George Marshall and Henry Arnold as the leaders of the conspiracy against the 'democratically-elected President of the Pacific States', Bodin accused them of taking orders from the King in Ottawa whom sought to destroy Hearst for opposing Anglo-Syndicalism. Declaring his intentions to push back against these traitors he says Japan is willing to aid in the counter-attack against foreign powers and has gifted the Spiritualists a small garrrison to support their militias, remaining Federal Police and all those who would rise with them against British Anarchism. While our loyalists would likely be able to defeat these forces the fact that the coup is not going as swiftly as planned has endangered the whole plan, with members of Congress and Spiritualist-connected politicians denouncing us and General DeWitt likely to oppose us with his own forces, we may have to look at fleeing to the safety of the Entente via the sea."

Losses are heavy on both sides and we are losing public support rapidly, but while a tactic defeat in that we had to retreat to the Lost Hills we should expect success if we counter-attack, with our opponents having exhausted their best men. Nonetheless, this would incur even more losses and could leave us even less popular, with some of our cabinet preferring to retreat rather than cause more damage to California."

pacificstates.3520.d:0 "We have selected certain figures from the various rebel factions to rehabilitate. From the American Union State, we have decided to try and bring Pelley under our wing, as he has expressed certain mystic beliefs in the past and it may be that he could be made to believe in our doctrines. From the Constitutional American Republic, there is George S. Patton. Patton is a controversial figure due to how many Americans he was responsible for killing, whether it was direct or not, during the Civil War. However, he is also fairly popular, and sparing him would be a good choice. He has also expressed an interest in various religions and in the mystical realm as a whole, so perhaps he would be a good candidate for conversion. We could also rehabilitate both of these men, though this would be less popular, or we could jail both, which is likely the most popular option. Regardless, if we do rehabilitate these men, we will place them in charge of their own parties, though these parties will not have any real power. Instead, they will serve as figureheads that further legitimize our regime."

pacificstates.3521.d:0 "It is time for us to spread our beliefs across the United States, but we must decide how this should be done. The Spiritualists who are sympathetic to Japan argue that we should have aim propaganda towards the masses, as conversion is the most direct way to spread our influence. The other Spiritualists are somewhat dividied, but generally agree that some sort of miracle should be achieved in order to convert the masses. Some wish to see an investment in rocket technology, in the hopes of gaining a better understanding of U.F.O.'s and perhaps joining them among the stars someday. There are others who reject this idea and instead insist that we should focus on radio technology for the benefits it will have in paranormal investigations. Such technology would allow us to detect the paranormal and perhaps even communicate with them. Our most religious supporters insist that we emphasize our religious doctrine in contrast to other faiths such as Christianity or Islam, particularly our faith's American roots as compared with these other religions. How should we proceed?"

Further, they were the worst of the rebels, as they aimed to completely change our way of life to fit their greed.

pacificstates.3524.d:0 "During the Civil War, Japan was our closest ally, giving us sorely-needed equipment, manpower, and more. Now that the war is over, however, it is time we decided what to do with them. We are on equal footing now, and can make certain demands. The question is, what do we ask for? Some argue that we should ask for full control over Hawaii, which was, after all, American territory before the war. Regardless of who owns the island chain, combined Japanese and American pressure would surely force it back into American hands, should it come to that. Others believe it would suffice to repay them for their help during the conflict and otherwise leave the relationship as it was before the war. Of course, hardliners insist that we go further than these half-measures. What should we do?"

He also announced that he would be sending out arrest warrents for those whom were proven to have connections to Canada, the coup, and foreign syndicalism. While their allies within Congress and those most concerned about the coup supported the decision, much of Congress remained silent to the decision. At one point, Homer Bone openly called him a "crackpot", causing chuckles and jeers from sectors of Congress.

Now, a group calling themselves the Spiritualists, led by Edward Longstreet Bodin, has performed a counter-coup against the millitary. This group claims to want to continue Hearst's legacy, but it is clear that they have their own agenda, and MacArthur will have to decide how to proceed.

The men were seen meeting with L. Ron Hubbard, and though the various discussions taking place were meant to be secret, it seems someone was recording them. Winter suggested that it may have been a figure that could pass through walls and appear invisible to outside observers. Parsons believes this is nonsense, instead arguing that aliens had been listening in and leaked the meeting to the press. In any case, we must find the mole in our administration, for we have not yet fully converted the American people, and they cannot know the full extent of our regime yet. What should we do?"

The two apparently entered a room and watched "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves" with several of the emperor's close advisors. Later, Disney was seen laughing with the emperor at dinner. It seems the meeting went well, and that the Japanese emperor would like to adopt this style of animation to his own country, promising to hire animators of his own to emualte the American."

pacificstates.3533.d:0 "The term 'foo fighter' was used by aircraft pilots during the Civil War to describe mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over the American, European and Pacific theaters of operations. This phenomenon caused a lot of interest, but also unrest, among both the military and the civilian population. Some saw them as a sign from God or as spirits, others thought they were aliens, and still others thought it was a natural phenomenon. What will the position of our government be?"

pacificstates.3534.t:0 "New archaeology and historiography"
pacificstates.3534.d:0 "As early as the nineteenth century, it was speculated that the Mississippian mysterious mound builders belonged to a lost white race. This meant that in the past there had been contacts between the old world and the pre-Columbian Americas. Thesis was rejected after 1890 after the work of Cyrus Thomas. Other researchers ware still interested in this topic. American archaeologist Augustus Le Plongeon 'proved' Maya connections with ancient Egypt and Europe and reconstructed a detailed but fanciful story of Queen Moo and Prince Coh of Maya Empire. Russian Colonel Braghine in his book from 1938 'The Shadow of Atlantis' claimed that the Carib people have reports and legends of a white bearded man whom they called Tamu or Zune who had come from the East, taught the people agriculture and later disappeared in an easterly direction. Braghine also claimed Manco Cápac (founder of the Inca civilization) was a white bearded man. The white man was to come to America and be remembered by the locals as a god (Viracocha in the Andes region of South America, Quetzalcoatl or Kukulkan among Aztec or Mayans etc.). Other scientists were more restrained and limited themselves only to pointing to past contacts between Europeans and Americans. Mysterious finds (such as small terracotta head sculpture, with a beard and European-like features, was found in 1933 in the Toluca Valle near Mexico City), legends (about Irish missionaries) or Sagas (colonization of Vinland) were highlighted. Will we spread the Truth about the White Man's presence in America in the old days? Or Will we keep these facts silent?"

We could simply round them up and put an end to it but our Japanese contacts would prefer if we simply warn them they have two days to flee for Canada, arguing that it would be much 'cleaner' and solve the problem of critics of the government without incurring as much protest.

Most of the Party fervent are demanding that we openly embrace our fringe, occultist, supernatural and other New Spiritualist beliefs. However the representatives of Japan have made it repeatedly clear that they want us to keep this private, worrying we would undermine whatevers support we have. While defying Japan would be dangerous, Hubbard has proposed a model in which the Party would have a self-contained religion that can slowly spread propaganda, rather than transparently putting its many beliefs forward with the exception of expanding the Redshirt Conspiracy."

Nonetheless, within our own nation people are taking the message to heart and see the futility of fighting the state and with it we've seen resistance die down significantly as most no longer have enough access to unfiltered news to know about the condemnations anyways."

The choices are namely between Max Thornburg, the practical leader of Standard Oil Pacific who is Japan's primary ally in the business community and the more tolerable choice for Pacificans, and Ralph Townsend, who is more ideologically aligned with Japan, insisting whites and the Japanese are both racially superior to those it colonizes in the East and admiring its form of government.

Using the colors of the original Pacifican flag, the party logo has been placed in the center. The second flag, is similar in it's bee theme. Using a red background, in the center is placed a number of bees, to represent the party program of the Commonwealth Party. While both are clearly inspired by the Commonwealth, it remains up to the Emperor alone to make the choice."

KX_california.1.t:0 "Provisional Government of the Pacific"
KX_california.1.d.noexiledpres:0 "With the nation now by and large at peace, the time has come for General Arnold to step down and appoint a provisional government. Due to most mainstream parties, such as the Democrats, Republicans and Progressives, being for intervention and American reclamation, they have been banned. This being the case, only a few candidates are open to lead us to our Pacifican Dream.\n\n Cartoonist, Representative and Entrepreneur Walt Disney and his Vice-President Howard Hughes from the National Visionary Party, a party formed only a short few days ago, is one such choice. While both are household names, Disney has no political track record, and could do more harm then good.\n\n Another possible figure is Upton Sinclair of the Commonwealth Party. Unlike the other major parties in the Pacific, Sinclair was not openly for the war, and was quite rationalist. Despite this, many are worried that to appoint such a radical would see us become part of the CSA. In reaction to these claims, Sinclair has vehemently condemned the CSA, and has spoken at length about the Pacifican Dream.\n\nYet another possible choice is William Randolph Hearst and his National Democratic Party, a break off of the banned Pacifican Democratic Party. Unlike many within the Pacific, Hearst was one of the most supportive voices for the General's coup, and his use of the Hearst media empire to drum up support for us has been invaluable. In fact, many within Arnold's provisional cabinet view this as a play by Hearst to be considered for appointment. Policy wise, Hearst is by and large a conservative, although he does have rumored ties to the fringe Spiritualist Party. Regardless, the appointment of Hearst would not be a popular move, but it would have it advantages.\n\nAlternatively, Arnold could appoint the Provisional Supreme Court, possibly ensuring some form of stability, at the cost of a direct civilian figure. While all have their strengths and weakness, it remains up to the General to make his choice."

KX_california.2.d:0 "While the decision to  declare Pacific Independence was always going to be unpopular, few could have expected the degree to which that unpopularity would come out. Spontaneous protests, spurred on by both the banning of nearly all major political parties and our decision to appoint such a political unknown as Disney to lead the Pacific, have taken place nation wide. While peaceful at first, these protests quickly turned into riots when pro-secessionist crowds emerged to counter protest. Already the National Guards of California and Washington have been mobilized in key cities to try and restore order\n\n To mitigate further violence, President Disney  has taken to addressing the nation via Radio. He has a difficult choice to make, in his speech.

Many with Disney's own security detail are warning him against such an action, as their will no doubt be an attempt to snuff him out. Disney, of course, is having none of it.\n\nDisney's speech was a modest thing, and very few bothered to listen.

In these unstable times, a massive amount of citizens have turned to Norton, as a symbol of stability and unity. This idealization of Norton has turned into a desire to find Norton’s Heir, and crown him as Emperor of America, just as Norton I, however with an official title and Coronation.

The Design is to incorporate the design of other American-Style buildings such as the White House, while incorporating other European-Style elements into the interior design and decoration.

Charles Ross Norton was always reluctant to take the throne offered to him, however he still took the mantle of Emperor of the Pacific States despite him perceiving his own claims to the throne as illegitimate, and the entire concept of the Pacific Empire as insane. Yet in this crazy world, Charles Ross Norton took the throne to bring stability to the chaotic nation on the Pacific Coast, to restore stable government to an ailing people, and to help every citizen of the Pacific States of America. He cared not for giant parades, not for grand banquets, and not for his Royal Army. He cared for his people more than anything and went to great lengths to ensure that every citizen of his empire was not only surviving; but thriving. His charitable efforts as Emperor lifted thousands of Pacificans from poverty, and his dedication to peace ensured that the Pacific States avoided a destructive war. \n\n The life of Charles Ross Norton was normal until he was swept up in the Pacific Empire, swept up in the absurd claims of his relatives taken at face value by a distraught people. And now, his grand life has come to a final and. A state funeral was held for Norton II with dignitaries from around the world attending the service. Even some dignitaries from the Houses of Windsor and Hohenzollern, who had regarded the House of Norton as an illegitimate joke not long ago. With Norton II dead, his son Gerard Norton has taken the Crown and the title of Norton III. He has vowed to continue the policies of his father, as well as maintaining all of the charitable efforts of his father. As the Nation mourns for their Emperor, the Empire born out of a chaotic world lives on another day."

He was writing a collection of Imperial letters decreeing a Royal order for Aid when he looked down at the letters and it hit him, he was Emperor of some foreign land because of a madman he is remotely related to. This should not be happening, it couldn't happen on it's own, someone or something must have made this happen. He got up from his desk and began to pace around his room, "This isn't normal, it isn't sane" he kept uttering to himself. He had to tell everyone, this was bigger than him, bigger than the Civil War, bigger than the Nortonist revival. He had figured it all out, he knew what was behind the insanity of the past few years, as his mind constantly raced, someone opened the door and entered his chamber. She asked, "Tea, your Majesty?", he breathed a sigh of relief when he realised it was only his servant, "I'd wish for you to stop calling me that please." he muttered as she put the tray of Tea and Assorted Biscuits down. "Did you say something your majesty?" she replied, Norton responded "No, don't worry about it". He decided to ask his servant a question, "What do you think of this chaos? this insanity? Me becoming Emperor?", the servant replied "Though I do think the chaos of the past few years is bad, I am glad we have someone like you in charge, even if it is a bit absurd.", she finished this response with a smirk before bowing and leaving the room. After this interaction, Norton II slumped in his chair, he thought to himself that even if someone is controlling him and making this happen, he is here for a reason, to help these people in any way that is possible. Coming to this second realisation, Norton got out of his chair, donned his Imperial Regalia, packed up his things and headed back to the capital, for there is much to be done."

As the red light to let Norton know he was on the air came on, he began to speak, as the speech began, millions of Americans tuned in. Norton discussed his recent crowning as Emperor, his Journey and most importantly why he did away with the political system. "What I realised during my time here is that the reason we are in this chaos is because of politicians, they are the reason millions are killing each other just across our borders and why stability is a thing of the past in America, it wasn't an easy decision, but it was a just one.". He spoke for a little longer before ending the speech with a call for unity and peace for all Americans.

Much of this ability has come from his mastery of the airwaves that zip across the skies of the Pacific States and beyond, subtly influencing the actions and thoughts of millions. Smart enough to realize that all generations must be influenced, Disney’s companies and state-run bureaus have begun to create new programs to run both day and night, both on TV and on the radio, to reach larger audience numbers than ever before. For adults, news programs, talk shows, and other adult programming have filled the main slots, all subtly influenced by the Disney's own doctrine.

Our visionary leader’s newest animated programming, or cartoons, have been an explosive success with the children of the Pacific States, particularly due to the unexpected public obsession with a certain mouse character designed by Disney himself. Debuting recently in his first films such as ‘Steam Boat Willy’ and ‘Plane Crazy’, the one and only Mickey Mouse has become a smash hit and instant cultural icon to our people. Absolutely astonishing given his simple design, a large amount of his success has come from the application of the newest audio-visual equipment, allowing his first animated shorts to be fully sound-synchronized much like the first ‘talkies’ that inspired Disney, like the semi-recently released ‘The Jazz Singer.’ With these animated shorts dominating the minds of the youth, an entire generation has been secured within Disney’s grasp before they even could think about rebellion."

We likely do not have to act on this, for some aversion to war, especially a civil war, is normal for a nation that was once as close-knit as our dying Union.

calpeaceout.14.t:0 "The Extent of Secession"
calpeaceout.14.d:0 "It has only been a short few days since General Arnold lead his march on Sacramento, and while our government is still far from stable, the time has come to make a decision regarding our very future. When Arnold forced the previous provisional government to step down, he did so in the name of the so-called 'Peace-Monger' movement, a movement calling not just for us to not enter the coming civil war, but one calling for the creation of a secessionist Republic on the West Coast. Now in power, the movement has run head first into the brick wall of our current realities, and has split into two camps as a result.\n\nThe first and largest camp, dubbed the 'realists,' wished for us to us General Arnold's connections within the Armed Forces to cut a deal with the Federalists. This deal would be one in which Pacifican forces would fight with the MacArthurites in exchange for recognizance of Pacifican Sovereignty over the West Coast. The Realists say this is the one way we could truly ensure a bright future for our children, or so they claim.\n\nThe second camp to emerge on the Secession Question(as it has been dubbed) are known as the Dreamers. The Dreamers, mostly made up of junior officers and students, call for us to totally abandon America. They would have us reject any deal or offer from the warring factions, and instead work to build up the Pacifican Dream, free from any conflict whatsoever. Unlike the Realists, they have no contingency should the victor of the coming conflict demand our reincorporation, save for extensive militarization of the Pacifican State.\n\nWith MacArthur's deadline coming every closer, no time for debate exists. General Arnold must now make a decision, a decision potentially on which millions of lives ride."
calpeaceout.14.a:0 "MacArthur is our only hope for an enduring Pacific States."
calpeaceout.14.b:0 "America is a sinking ship, we will not sink with them."

calpeaceout.15.t:0 "Rise of the 'Pacifican Dream'"
calpeaceout.15.d:0 "Following a military coup in Sacramento led by General 'Hap' Arnold, the Pacific States have officially announced to all rival American governments of their refusal to take part in 'a senseless blood bath' and have formally declared total and unilateral independence from the United States of America. While this state of affairs is highly irregular, due to the outbreak of the war, we can do nothing to stop them. Obviously when the dust settles there will be reckoning, reports indicate growing unrest due to the sudden declaration of independence within the Pacific States, leading many to believe that the PSA will be joining the war shortly. Regardless, the West Coast is now free to live out their Pacifican Dream, atleast for now."

#PSA's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################
CAL_HENRY_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With the outbreak of the Civil War, 'Hap' found himself in the West Coast of America, where due to his constant disagreements with the national Chief of Air Corps of the Federal Government, he decided to join the Pacific Governors in their struggle, and provide any technical expertise he is able to in exchange for the promise of an independent air force."
CAL_DADDY_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps. With MacArthur's takeover of the government, Marshall refused to recognize his colleague as the army's generalissimo, and when the Pacific Governors declared their revolt, Marshall decided to join them, which earned him the promotion to Field Marshall. He is widely considered one of the most brilliant planners in America, and is one of the most experienced members of our staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
CAL_ALEXANDER_PATCH_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 23, 1889, in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Alexander McCarrell "Sandy" Patch, the son of the Cavalry Captain Alexander M. Patch, started his military career when he joined West Point in 1909. While a fan of the cavalry corp, he was quick to realize that cavalry would soon enough become obsolete in combat, so he chose to join the infantry, and graduated from West Point as a second lieutenant in 1913. His first assignment was the 18th Infantry Regiment based in Texas, from where he was assigned to Pershing's 'Punitive Expedition' to Mexico, where he earned his promotion to first lieutenant. Without any major engagements for the US, Patch reached the rank of Captain in 1919 and was posted at Fort Benning as an instructor for four years. He'd apply for the Staunton Military Academy in Virginia as a professor of military science and tactics, a role which he'll keep until very recently. In the meantime, he attended the Field Officer's Course in 1922 and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, where he graduated with distinction in 1925, and finally graduated from the U.S. Army War College in 1932 as a lieutenant colonel. Patch's remarkable service record impressed General George Marshall, who tried to keep close contact with Patch in the following years of his graduation. When the civil war break out, Marshall implored Patch to join his staff in the Pacific Army, a request that Patch accepted and for which he was promoted to Brigadier General."
CAL_LEWIS_BRERETON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 21, 1890, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Lewis Hyde Brereton began his military career in 1907, when he joined the Naval Academy with his brother and graduated in June 1911. However, before graduating he submitted a letter for resignation citing seasickness, which would make him unable to serve as a naval officer. His resignation was accepted, and he applied to be commissioned in the US Army and was appointed as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps on August 17, 1911. In September 1912, he undertook flight training in Rockwell Field, and would work temporarily on the air corp until he survived his second crash, after which he requested to be relieved from duty. He returned to the Coast Artillery Corps and in July 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and sent to the Philippines and would serve a year before returning to the US in March 1917, where he was assigned to duty in the Aviation Sector Headquarters in Washington D.C.. He'd go through a series of administrative posts and became a close assistant of Billy Mitchell in his attempts to make the air force independent. With Mitchell's resignation, his life took a downturn, as his wife left him, he suffered a crash and was found AWOL by accident while his mental health deteriorated greatly due to these developments. He was restored into service in August 1927 and was assigned to command of the 88th Observation Squadron at Post Field, Oklahoma, as well as an instructor at the Field Artillery School in Fort Sill. In 1931 he was posted in the Panama Canal Zone and received a promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1935 due to an excelling performance, which allowed him to salvage his reputation of his misfortunes in the late twenties. With the outbreak of the civil war becoming increasingly inevitable, he took a ship and arrived to San Diego right before hostilities began in order to meet his old acquaintance,'Hap' Arnold. Despite his inexperience in practical infantry combat, his excellent administrative and planning skills allowed him to become Brigadier General, by Arnold's own request."
CAL_ISAAC_WHITE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 6, 1901, in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Isaac Davis White graduated from Norwich University with a bachelor's degree in 1922 and would join the army in 1922, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in February 1923. He'd be promoted to First Lieutenant in 1927 after undergoing the Troop Officers' Course from the Cavalry school, where he became keenly interested in the prospect of mechanized warfare and the use of Tanks to break through enemy lines. He joined the Command and General Staff School in 1931, where he graduated as a Major in 1932 and became one of the army's strongest advocates for the use of tanks along with George S. Patton. As the country spiralled into civil war, Isaac sided with Marshall against MacArthur, leaving westwards from Fort Riley, where he was working as an instructor, and was awarded for his loyalty to Marshall with the rank of Brigadier General\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Very interested in the adoption of tanks and mechanized vehicles over infantry combat, but his ambitions may have to wait until the Civil War is over."
CAL_ALBERT_WEDEMEYER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 9, in Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Albert Coady Wedemeyer graduated from West Point in 1919 as a second lieutenant, after which he was posted with the 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning, and would be transferred to the 57th Infantry in the Philippines in 1923. He was later assigned to the 15th Infantry Regiment in the Legation of Tianjin, where he learned to speak almost perfect Mandarin Chinese, and returned to the US to undergo a course in the Command and General Staff School, where his excellent grades made him eligible for an exchange program with the German Kriegsakademie, departing in early 1936. He never finished his courses however, as the Civil War began, and MacArthur took the reins of the government, Wedemeyer decided to travel back home and join the Pacific Forces, who he sees as the true American government. Upon his arrival on San Diego, George Marshall requested his promotion to Brigadier General, as his experience abroad could indeed prove invaluable for the struggling American Army."

His first tour of duty was during the so-called 'Banana Wars', first on a short stay on Cuba and then to Nicaragua, where he took part in the capture of Coyotepe. He'd later take part in the occupation of Veracruz and would fight against the Cacos Bandits in Le Trou and Fort Capois, in Haiti. He was promoted to captain in 1916, and became one of the chief members of the Haitian Constabulary where he'd be promoted to Inspector of the Constabulary in 1919. He'd be promoted to major for his service in Haiti in 1920 and would be reassigned to a US Marine division in 1923, where he was sent to Quantico, Virginia. He'd complete the Field Officers' Course and be transferred to San Diego in 1926, where he'd serve as Assistant Chief of Staff. The next year, he was sent to the American legation in Tianjin where he helped train the 3rd Marine Regiment and in 1928, he was assigned with Moseley in the Bureau of Budget as assistant chief coordinator.

He'd be promoted to Colonel, and asked to return to the continent. However, during his travel in the civilian ship, the American Civil War begun, and when the Pacific Governors announced their revolt, Vandegrift had little choice but to support the Pacific Army in their struggle. For his loyalty, however, he was awarded the rank of Brigadier General and put in charge of the Pacific Marine Corps which has solidified his beliefs in the Pacific Administration."
CAL_GEORGE_WINDLE_READ_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 29, 1900, in Fort Grant, Arizona\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Windle Read Jr. spent most of his youth in military camps, following his father who was an important member of the US Army staff, he volunteered for the army in 1917, and although he signed up for the infantry at first, graduating as a second lieutenant from the Military Academy, his love for Polo made him move to the cavalry corps before 1920, where he undertook the Cavalry School Basic Course and graduated in 1921. He took several posts throughout the US and abroad, mostly following the steps of his father until his death in 1934. With his father's death, he was assigned to Seattle, where he had to put down several strikes in the name of the central government as the national situation deteriorated. When the Pacific governors finally revolted, George decided to support their insurrection, as most of his partners in the region were doing so and he didn't want to risk being imprisoned for treachery. As a token of appreciation for his loyalty, he was promoted to Brigadier General and now eagerly awaits to prove himself up for the task like his father was."
CAL_JIMMY_DOOLITTLE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 14, 1896, in Alameda, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W James Harold 'Jimmy' Doolittle attended Los Angeles City College after graduating from Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, and later won admission to the University of California, Berkeley where he studied in The School of Mines.

#CAL_new_army_doctrines:0 "New Army Doctrines"

#CAL_new_officers:0 "New Officers"
#CAL_new_officers_desc:0 "The small peacetime American army did not have a large officer corps. The dissolution of the country has further highlighted this issue. We need to train a new generation of officers to win this war."
#CAL_defense_contractors2:0 "More Defence Contractors"
#CAL_defense_contractors2_desc:0 "Our initial efforts to stimulate defence contractors seems to have worked well. We should continue this plan to ensure our war effort is well-supported."

#CAL_womens_land_army_desc:0 "Women have just as much of a stake in the outcome of this Civil War as men do. We should ensure there are ways for women to assist the war effort as much as possible."
#CAL_marines:0 "Expand the Marine Corps"
#CAL_marines_desc:0 "The Marine Corps was the pride of the American military, and one of the few branches not to suffer from the extensive budget cuts of the last few decades. We should build up the remnant of the corps that stayed loyal to our regime into a powerful fighting force."
#CAL_womens_army_corps:0 "Women's Army Corps"
#CAL_womens_army_corps_desc:0 "The integration of women into logistics and support roles have been a success, and now some are advocating for them to be put on the front lines, if not in full combat roles. This would cause some social controversy, but be a major advantage in fighting this war."

###Army Focuses### ## NEW ##
CAL_activate_the_Western_Defense_Command:0 "Create the Western Defence Command"
CAL_activate_the_Western_Defense_Command_desc:0 "Since we claim to be the real America, and our Army is officially the United States Army, the command hierarchy remains unclear on many levels. As such, we will push for the creation of the Western Defence Command, an apparent detachment of the Army which will work independently, and will reunite with the Army in structure once the civil war is won."
CAL_prepare_the_artillery:0 "Prepare the Artillery"
CAL_prepare_the_artillery_desc:0 "The indisputable winner of the Weltkrieg was Artillery. With it, our army may advance over a supressed enemy, as well as stop any enemy offensive dead in its tracks. As such, our immediate priority will be to repurpose the Navy's spare cannons to the artillery branch, as well as fund the development of new artillery models and improved artillery parts to facilitate mass production of this deadly weapon."
CAL_joint_chiefs_of_staff:0 "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
CAL_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc:0 "The creation of a high command able to coordinate army, air, and naval efforts is needed to win this war, and keep our military up to date with modern theoretical standards."
CAL_defense_logistics_agency:0 "Defence Logistics Agency"
CAL_defense_logistics_agency_desc:0 "America is an enormous country, full of varied terrain. We need to create a centralized logistics board able to coordinate warfare across the varied biomes of America."
CAL_deWitt_in_Charge:0 "CIC: John Lesesne DeWitt"
CAL_deWitt_in_Charge_desc:0 "Major General John Lesesne DeWitt, unlike many members of the staff who advocate for us to aggressively assault the enemy positions, has proposed for us to focus on more careful advances with powerful consolidations. In his view, slow and steady advances paired up with a centralized high command will see our nation through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"
CAL_Marshall_in_command:0 "CIC: George Catlett Marshall"
CAL_Marshall_in_command_desc:0 "Brigadier General George Catlett Marshall, has come to us with a damning prediction: If the West Coast fails to cross the Rockies and secure a foothold in the Midwest, then defeat will be assured. In his view, a quick advance through the Rockies with the help of motorized elements will be what see us through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"
CAL_protecting_Columbia:0 "Protecting Columbia"
CAL_protecting_Columbia_desc:0 "The Army War College, the Field Artillery School, Fort Benning and many other major buildings, locations and training sites have been damaged by the war, and their reconstruction should be one of our top priorities to bring the Army back on its feet now that the civil war is over."
CAL_military_research:0 "Military Research"
CAL_military_research_desc:0 "While we have some of the finest universities and thinkers in the world, we cannot research everything at once. We need to pick a direction for our military research to focus in."
CAL_weapon_designs:0 "New Weapon Designs"
CAL_weapon_designs_desc:0 "While the M1 Garand managed to see us through the Civil War, its flaws were as noticeable when it was adopted as they are now. However, with the criticism we have gathered during the civil war, we have contacted the original designer, and he has assured us that by redesigning the barrel, gas cylinder, and front sight assembly, he will make the Garand an even more reliable and deadly weapon."
CAL_Army_rangers:0 "Army Rangers"
CAL_Army_rangers_desc:0 "An elite group of specialized soldiers, the Army Rangers will be able to carry out covert missions in rough terrain, disrupting enemy supply lines and morale."
CAL_90_division_Army:0 "90-Division Army Plan"
CAL_90_division_Army_desc:0 "While Marshall originally envisioned that a reformed US Army would require a 265-Division Plan to be fully mobilized, the limitations of the West Coast make such a plan a pipe dream. As such, he has decided to adopt a 90-Division Plan, with the objective of raising a total of at least 90 divisions against America's enemies."
CAL_motorization:0 "Motorisation Program"
CAL_motorization_desc:0 "With the original rejection of the motorisation plans, a ghost has loomed the American Army as their methods became backwards as opposed to other militaries. Marshall has now proposed the government to subsidize truck production and to being the seizure of civilian trucks for the creation of motorized units capable of crossing the American countryside before our enemy can react."
CAL_tank_production:0 "Increase Tank Production"
CAL_tank_production_desc:0 "With the West Coast's low manpower, the High Command has had to design a plan to effectively improve what every man is worth in the field. In any of those plans, expanding Tank production in the West Coast comes as a priority, as their relatively low manpower cost and high combat effectiveness proves that it will not only save us lives, but also helps us push the enemy back more swiftly."
CAL_Officer_instruction:0 "Officer Instruction"
CAL_Officer_instruction_desc:0 "Marshall has presented this issue to our government, and his solution is to create forward study-bases, with more experienced officers mentoring younger ones in tactics. While this may put more of our officers in the line of fire, it will also ensure our new generation of officers gets first hand experience, as well as improving our army's leadership on the lower echelons as a whole."
CAL_recon_units:0 "Reconnaissance Units"
CAL_recon_units_desc:0 "Knowledge is Power, and Marshall believes that without the former two, victory in America will be impossible. We are outmanned and outgunned by our enemies, but if we know their every movement, then we can nullify our enemy's superiority by out-witting them."
CAL_one_switft_push:0 "Start Operation Glacier"
CAL_one_switft_push_desc:0 "'The Object of Operation Glacier is to secure a lodgment area on the Midwest from which further offensive operations can be developed. The lodgment area must contain sufficient infrastructural support to maintain a force of at least fifteen divisions across the Rockies, preferably double that amount, and that also enable that force to be augmented by reinforcements from the West Coast area(...)'"
CAL_defense_is_the_best_offense:0 "Defence is the Best Offence"
CAL_defense_is_the_best_offense_desc:0 "The First step towards preparing for the coming storm will be to improve our defence construction. Trench digging and fortifications construction will be a basic part of our army's curriculum, so that when the enemy waves come and threaten our home, we shall prevail."
CAL_logistic_security:0 "Logistical Security"
CAL_logistic_security_desc:0 "Logistiscs are a not-so well known battlefield which will be vital for us if we wish to gain the upper hand against the radicals in the East. Investing into new munitions factories to keep our men fighting as well as funding our logistical corps should go a long way into helping us achieve this goal."
CAL_Expand_the_Presidio:0 "Expand the Presidio of San Francisco"
CAL_Expand_the_Presidio_desc:0 "The Presidio of San Francisco has a long tradition of being vital for our nation's war efforts since America occupied it in 1846. As it stands, it is the most logical seat of power to direct our army's efforts, as well as the best prepared facility in the West Coast to hold the Command Staff. However, being the best prepared facility the region doesn't mean it's up to standard, and an expansion of the Fort is required."
CAL_improve_bite_and_hold_tactics:0 "Improve 'Bite and Hold' Tactics"
CAL_improve_bite_and_hold_tactics_desc:0 "The 'Bite and Hold' tactic was first adopted by the British during the Weltkrieg, and as the tactic, while costly, proved to be a resounding success, now more than ever we need to look at its success and analyse how we can improve it so that we may have the best attack and consolidation tactics America has to offer."
CAL_engineer_corps_expansion:0 "Expand the Engineer Corps"
CAL_engineer_corps_expansion_desc:0 "America has some of the largest rivers in the world, including the Mississippi, Rio Grande, and the Colorado. We should ensure our engineers have the proper tools required to build fording equipment and other field fortifications."
CAL_coast_to_coast_planning:0 "'Coast-to-Coast' Planning Board"
CAL_coast_to_coast_planning_desc:0 "With the Expanded Presidio, DeWitt has proposed the creation of a Planning board, capable of issuing new and adaptable plans for our front line commanders so that we may push our enemies from sea to shining sea."
CAL_increase_military_spending:0 "Increase Military Spending"
CAL_increase_military_spending_desc:0 "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise. While the Civil war may be over, America still has enemies to fight and wars to win, and as such keeping the Civil War military spending and expanding upon it is on our best interests."
CAL_bring_the_complex_west:0 "Rebuild the Military Industrial Complex"
CAL_bring_the_complex_west_desc:0 "With most of the Military Industrial Complex in the East, the Civil War has devastated the old munitions and weapons factories that made up America's war industry as they became high value targets for bombings and a preferred hiding spot of persistent enemy defenders. If we wish to be ready for the next war, investing into rebuilding the military industrial complex is one of our priorities."
CAL_Columbia_needs_you:0 "Columbia Needs You!"
CAL_Columbia_needs_you_desc:0 "The Figure of Columbia, a woman wearing an American flag gown and a Phrygian hat, is the personification of the ideals of freedom and pursuit of liberty we fought so hard to achieve. With the tyrant overthrown and the radicals put down, the service of the American people to Columbia is not yet over. War looms in the horizon, and only the brave men of America can protect her and our nation from tyranny."
CAL_defense_contracts:0 "Defence Contractors"
CAL_defense_contracts_desc:0 "Unlike some command-style economies in Europe, we must rely on contractors to produce our weapons. Ensuring these companies are prepared for this new Civil War should be a top priority."
CAL_crossing_the_rockies:0 "Crossing the Rocky Mountains"
CAL_crossing_the_rockies_desc:0 "The Rocky Mountains is a formidable geographic formation that separates our beloved West Coast from the carnage in the East. However, with our fate being to reclaim the rest of America, we will have to cross the Rocky mountains eventually and face our enemies. As such, we should begin preparations for a smoother campaing through them."
CAL_gi_bill:0 "The G.I. Bill"
CAL_gi_bill_desc:0 "Massive numbers of demobilized servicemen will be a major issue in the aftermath of the Civil War. We should create education and job training programs to better re-integrate them into civilian life."
CAL_war_bonds:0 "War Bonds"
CAL_war_bonds_desc:0 "We need adequate funding to properly fight this war. Bonds are a popular way of fundraising, and we can easily promote them through cartoons, films, and other popular mediums."
CAL_walkie_talkies:0 "Walkie-Talkies"
CAL_walkie_talkies_desc:0 "Portable radios, or 'Walkie-Talkies' as they are commonly called, present a powerful tool for our army. With them, our troops can coordinate artillery and air strikes, among other things."

### Navy Focuses ###
CAL_navy:0 "U.S Navy"
CAL_navy_desc:0 "The American navy was once the pride of the world. Yet much of it deserted to the traitors to the east. We should review what forces stayed loyal to our government, so we can best determine how they can serve in this war."
CAL_great_white_fleet:0 "Great White Fleet"
CAL_great_white_fleet_desc:0 "The Great White Fleet was the height to American naval power. We should look back at it for inspiration. A great fleet of battleships and dreadnoughts will ensure we always have naval superiority."

CAL_light_cruisers:0 "Light-Cruiser Development"
CAL_light_cruisers_desc:0 "Lighter cruisers are important in anti-air operations, as well as attacking enemy destroyers and submarines. We should ensure our navy has a handful of these in order to stay balanced."
CAL_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
CAL_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Naval aviation is the future of warfare on the high seas. We should ensure that our air designs are capable of being launched from carriers and destroying the enemy fleet without even endangering our own."
CAL_expand_dockyards:0 "Expand Dockyards"
CAL_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "Our dockyards are somewhat inadequate to fight a war on their own. We need to ensure that new naval production facilities are constructed to support the war effort."

pacificstates.50.b:0 "Don't form the Committee."

pacificstates.51.t:0 "Hay's Code and Movies"
pacificstates.51.d:0 "Hollywood has decided to create the so called Hay's Code, named after Will H. Hays, leader of the motion picture association of America. The stated goal of this legislation is to ensure 'morality' in film, though many see it as a way to subvert syndicalist themes in films. Its effectiveness may be somewhat dubious, however, as a number of directors have shown great pleasure in skirting as close to the rules of the code as possible without breaking it."
pacificstates.51.a:0 "This shall make movies better."

pacificstates.57.t:0 "Labor Laws"
pacificstates.57.d:0 "A set of laws have recently been proposed to Congress that would for the first time establish a federal minimum wage and Maximum hours per week.

pacificstates.62.t:0 "The Immigration Debate"
pacificstates.62.d:0 "The situation the Federal Government arrived at when the Pacific States was created did not offer us time to clarify the policy of immigration. This meant that a deal being planned by the Department of Labor to allow for Mexican labor temporary work rights in the United States was frozen for a time. Now that elections have been held and Democrat power retained, we can now address this concern. This program proposed by the Department of Labor was meant to alleviate the west's employment shortage and was supported by the Republicans. Now traditionally our party line is to respect the Alien Exclusion act and the rights of natural born American workers to determine the direction of the economy, but our employment shortage is that much greater as we struggle to reclaim America. Perhaps we should allow this through?"
pacificstates.62.a:0 "Yes, we need the labor."
pacificstates.62.b:0 "No, our ideals take precedence."

pacificstates.63.t:0 "Hollywood Bookkeeping"
pacificstates.63.d:0 "The decision to promote true American values with a closer relationship with Hollywood seemed smart initially. However, the glitz and glamor of Hollywood shady accounting practices that confound our ability to measure returns. Patriotic productions privately financed receive royalties out of gross sales, which have been very high. However, the deal we accepted was on profits, which appear to be next to nothing. This inconsistency needs to be renegotiated, and the studios be told that such creative accounting cannot fly with the American government!"
pacificstates.63.a:0 "Maybe we can tax the popcorn?"

pacificstates.64.t:0 "Pacific Movement of the Eastern World Uncovered"
pacificstates.64.d:0 "We initially thought that our intelligence service was overreactive when they warned us of Japanese infiltration, but this revelation justifies the time spent. Our of our new West Coast operations, agents uncovered pamphlets sent to prominent Japanese and African American leaders questioning the validity of our government. These pamphlets were traced to an organisation called the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World, whose leadership appears to advocate in favour of a Pacific Japanese Alliance that advocates for unrestricted imperial growth of Japan in Asia. This organisation appears to target non-Chinese ethnic minorities with promises of greater social freedom. We have arrested the conspirators, but we were unable to tie them to the Japanese embassy surprisingly."
pacificstates.64.a:0 "What a strange group."

pacificstates.65.t:0 "Communalism and the Latter-Day Saints Church"
pacificstates.65.d:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-Day Saints, better known as Mormons, have expressed sentiments in recent months to strengthen the ideals of Communalism within the church in order to counter the sway of syndicalism. Notably the Church has come out with a faith-based welfare program, called coincidentally enough the Church Welfare Program, to help provide for support for fellow Mormons, furthermore the program calls for more Bishop Storehouses to be created. Due to the churches influence in the western states, this has also translated into increased support for the Progressive and Farmer-Labor Parties."

pacificstates.66.t:0 "Trial of the Weapons companies"

pacificstates.73.t:0 "Boulder Dam Completed"
pacificstates.73.d:0 "'This morning I came, I saw and I was conquered, as everyone would be who sees for the first time this great feat of mankind. Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.' Thus begins [CAL.GetLeader]'s Speech dedicating the creation of Boulder Dam that has finally been completed today."
pacificstates.73.a:0 "...and on behalf of the Nation to say to you, 'Well done.'"

pacificstates.74.t:0 "Railway Nationalisation"
pacificstates.74.d:0 "One of the Progressive Party's Policies it has sought for some time was a nationalisation of the countries Railroads. Now that they have power, the question is how exactly shall railway nationalisation go. Congress is debating between two different proposals for how this shall be implemented. The first proposal is that the railroads will be nationalized but not the cars allowing for private businesses to compete among themselves for customers, while the second plan would include the cars in the nationalisation. Which version shall Congress go with?"

### Flavor Events ###

pacificstates.101.t:0 "Perez v. Sharp"
pacificstates.101.d:0 "The case involving the marriage of Andrea Perez to Sylvester Davis has finally reached the Supreme Court. Andrea Perez is classified as White while Sylvester Davis is considered Negro as per the US Census. However, California's law forbids "All marriages of white persons with Negroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal and void" and that "no license may be issued authorizing the marriage of a white person with a Negro, mulatto, Mongolian or member of the Malay race". Consequently county clerk W. G. Sharp followed California Law and refused to give them their marriage licenses.\n\nHowever, Perez with the help of their lawyer, Daniel G. Marshall, brought forth a Writ of Mandamus. Within the trial, one of the arguments that was brought up was the fact that both Perez and Davis were Catholic and wanted a Catholic Marriage that included mass. By denying them the license, they stated that the state was depriving them of the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony.\n\nHowever, the fate of their case is within the hands of the Supreme Court. What shall be decided?"

pacificstates.102.d:0 "In Los Angles news has been made of José Gallardo Díaz, who was recently found murdered near a swimming hole in Commerce, near LA. However, what made the story more newsworthy was the case of the men who are accused of murdering the man. The LA Police found a gang of 17 Men, of Mexican-American descent, nearby and believe that they are responsible for the crime. This has attracted something of a media circus as activists have tried to protest the actions claiming that these men are not the killer and are innocent, the fact that there is insufficient evidence to link them. Despite this nine of them were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison, with the rest being imprisoned in Los Angeles County jail.\n\nThe case has generated much animosity within the white populace towards Mexican-Americans, not helped by the fact that both the Police and the Press have characterized all Mexican Youths as 'pachuco hoodlums and baby gangsters.'"
pacificstates.102.a:0 "Poor Diaz."

pacificstates.103.t:0 "Zoot Suit Riots"
pacificstates.103.d:0 "With the war going on, rations have been imposed upon the public. Despite this, some within the Mexican-American Community fount this by wearing Zoot Suits that use materials that are needed for the war effort. Many White Americans regard wearing the Zoot Suit as a sign of criminality and loose morals. Tensions have continued in Los Angeles to rise till they exploded into violence. Soldiers and Sailors beat and engaged in rioting against the Mexicans. Meanwhile, the local press tended to praise the Sailors and Soldiers of 'having a cleansing effect to rid Los Angeles of Miscreants and Hoodlums'. One journalist on the scene, Carey McWilliams, wrote:\n\n'Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theaters, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy'"

pacificstates.104.t:0 "Zoot Suit Riots"
pacificstates.104.d:0 "In the city of Los Angeles in [From.GetNameDef], young Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have viciously been beaten. Their shops have been looted and more atrocities have been lumped upon them. The Gringo Press has even joined in on the action urging them to continue with their actions. To many within the Mexican Congress, this is an outrage. Our own citizens who have gone to America for temporary work, not to mention those with ties to Mexico due to ancestral are being mistreated. A letter to the [From.GetAdjective] State department will make sure that this is stopped."

pacificstates.105.d:0 "Following the Zoot Suit Riots, the Mexican government lodged a complaint with the United States State department. To calm tensions between America and Mexico, the McGucken Committee has been created lead by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, Joseph Thomas McGucken. The report concluded that Racism was clearly at the centre of the riots as well as stating 'an aggravating practice (of the media) to link the phrase zoot suit with the report of a crime.' The governor of California appointed the Peace Officers Committee on Civil Disturbances, chaired by Robert W. Kenny, president of the National Lawyers Guild to make recommendations to the police. Human relations committees were appointed, and police departments were required to train their officers to treat all citizens equally"

In the movie Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. However, despite all of this, William Randolph Hearst is furious at the film refusing for his papers to even publish the film and run defamatory attacks on those that did.

pacificstates.111.d:0 "In the last few years our military research has focused on the potential for internal conflict, narrowing our focus and budget for longer-term projects. This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own physics research."

pacificstates.113.d:0 "An invitation by Oppenheimer was sent out to nuclear researchers, physicists, and engineers throughout Europe. The promise of escaping persecution in Europe has resounded most strongly to Jewish scientists, some of whom emigrated to the US for the project. After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested. The skies of Almagordo New Mexico lit up in a flash of destruction as the test bomb Valediction exploded. Oppenheimer later said that the bomb was named after his favorite John Donne poem."

pacificstates.114.d:0 "After many delays and several attempts to obfuscate the general staff, Wilhelm Reich's bomb project is discontinued and millions of dollars wasted on bunk. This became apparent to Reich's observers when tests showing his energy, named Orgone, could induce exothermic reactions that only he and his associates could see. The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for it's collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation.

pacificstates.150.t:0 "The Pacific Declaration"
pacificstates.150.d:0 "Ever since the first peaceful transfer of power between George Washington and John Adams, the government of the United States has prided itself on respecting the wishes of its population after an election. This unspoken contract between the people and their government has been violated by General Douglas MacArthur. In deposing the democratically-elected president in the name of 'preserving stability', he shattered the founding principles of our great nation. The destruction of the healthy civil-military relationship that has marked America since independence is a grievous slight to all the values we hold as a nation.\n\nIn response, the governors of California, Washington, and Oregon have issued a joint declaration condemning the General’s actions, and demanding his immediate withdrawal from Washington. We doubt he will respond positively, but like the patriots in 1776, we must take a stand against tyranny and oppression."

pacificstates.151.d:0 "Frank Merriam, in coordination with the governors of Oregon and Washington, issued a stunning public statement today. In it, he claimed that if the so-called 'protector' of American values could not even respect the basic rights outlined in the Constitution, referring to Douglas MacArthur, it would be up to the people of the Pacific to defend America's inalienable rights. Claiming that MacArthur’s overthrow of the government was illegitimate, a new election would be held to select a new president - albeit amongst a limited slate of candidates in the Pacific region. Still, according to Merriam, whoever won this election would still have more legitimacy than MacArthur, and would be tasked with overseeing the return of the nation to democracy - by force, if needs be."

pacificstates.152.t:0 "Syndicalist Riot!"
pacificstates.152.d:0 "Following Bill Haywood’s own declaration of MacArthur’s illegitimacy, many hoped that the capitalists and syndicalists could come together and preserve American democracy. Those naive aspirations were dashed when Governor Merriam ordered the National Guard to violently suppress a syndicalist protest which broke out in Sacramento. This escalated into widespread rioting across many Western cities, with Seattle in particular descending into violence. Longshoremen and teamsters broke into Seattle city hall, and proclaimed the city loyal to Haywood’s workers republic in Chicago. Currently, the city is in a tense stand-off between National Guard units and the rebels holed up in the city hall."

While some of the ships in Naval Base San Diego were transferred to the East Coast after the first signs of unrest, many remained - along with sailors from across the country. Details are sketchy, but it appears a base commander, on orders from Washington, ordered sailors to take weapons from the base armory and head into the city. Deploying themselves at polling places, they prevented poll workers from setting up. When morning came, large mobs surrounded these soldiers, and began pelting them with rocks, bottles, and other debris. One of the sailors, hit by a bottle, fired back, and soon the city descended into chaos.\n\nCalifornia National Guard units were deployed, and pitched street battles between sailors loyal to MacArthur and the Guardsmen erupted, turning the tranquil city into a war zone." 
pacificstates.153.a:0 "Down with the traitors!"

pacificstates.154.t:0 "Deadline Looms"
pacificstates.154.d:0 "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Newly-elected President [Root.GetLeader] has been busy raising militia across the West, amidst a growing determination to see the country restored and MacArthur defied. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they no longer see a path to compromise with the Pacific states."
pacificstates.154.a:0 "It is only a matter of time."

pacificstates.200.t:0 "The Army Requisitions Civilian Trucks"
pacificstates.200.d:0 "After Marshall announced his Motorisation program for the W.D.C., a proposal was sent to the President to decide on the requisition of civilian vehicles in order to supply our fast-growing army. With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight. While not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."
pacificstates.200.a:0 "Their Service to Our Nation is Appreciated"

pacificstates.201.t:0 "Success of Operation Glacier"
pacificstates.201.d:0 "With the capture of the states of Idaho, Utah and Arizona, Operation Glacier has been called a resounding success by our High Command. With the Rockies secured and our industry safely behind it, we now possess a good staging ground to attack the Great Plains and the South, with which we shall drive the radicals back and secure our nation."
pacificstates.201.a:0 "We shall soon march on Washington!"

pacificstates.202.t:0 "Failure of Operation Glacier"
pacificstates.202.d:0 "While Operation Glacier managed to get some territorial gains, the losses were too high with a gain too small to matter for the war effort. As it stands, the Rockies remain disputed ground and our long term survival is in jeopardy. It is now up to the Marshall and the high command to see us through the war by whatever means necessary"
pacificstates.202.a:0 "We Must Rethink our Strategy"

pacificstates.203.t:0 "Rethinking our Tank Designs"
pacificstates.203.d:0 "With the Civil war over, we now have to revise the industrial measures we undertook during the war in order to enhance war-time production. One of these measures was Marshall's request for faster tanks for mass production, which came with the unfortunate drawback of being unreliable on harsh terrain, a trait which unfortunately has caused more than one headache to the newly recruited tank crews of our nation. Since our spending in military affairs shall be increased, some designers have approached us with newer models with better engines and suspension systems which shall ensure no regular breakdowns happen, but in exchange our experts predict our production speed will be reduced. What should we do?"
pacificstates.203.a:0 "Let's Focus on more Reliable Models"
pacificstates.203.b:0 "Reliability isn't an issue if we can swarm the enemy with tanks!"

KX_california.1.t:0 "Pacific Recall Election"
KX_california.1.d:0 "Now that Arnold has kept the Pacific States from engaging in a disastrous war, he can now hold elections and delegate power; knowing that the Nation is stable and secure. However, most mainstream pro-intervention parties such as the Democrats, Republicans and Progressives have had to be illegalized, leading to two mainstream candidates on the ballot. Cartoonist, Representative and Entrepreneur Walt Disney and his Vice-President Howard Hughes from the National Visionary Party, and Judge John F. Aiso from the Democratic Prosperity League. "

KX_california.2.t:0 "Pro-Intervention Riots"
KX_california.2.d:0 "In Recent days, crowds loyal to the old Pro Intervention parties took to the streets to protest Pacific Neutrality. Throughout the days these protests eventually turned into riots, as Pro-Independence Counter-protesters soon showed up, and the National Guard was sent in.  To mitigate further violence, President [CAL.GetName] has taken to addressing the nation via Radio. He has a difficult choice to make, in his speech. He must decide whether or not to side with the Independents, or intervene in the American Civil War. "
KX_california.2.a:0 "No Intervention! Independence Forever!"
KX_california.2.b:0 "The time has come to Liberate America."

KX_california.3.t:0 "Riots Spiral Out of Control"
KX_california.3.d:0 "After Walt Disney made the decision to remain neutral, several notable peaceful Pro-Independence protests devolved into massive riots. Major cities such as Los Angeles, Seattle and San-Francisco were shaken to the core by these increasingly violent riots, and even Sacramento was the scene of a bloody massacre ad Rioters faced off against several units of the National Guard. As the nation further defends into Chaos, President Walt Disney has taken to making a public address, in an attempt to restore Stability and Unity."

KX_california.4.t:0 "The Nation is on the Brink of Collapse"
KX_california.4.d:0 "The failure of [CAL.GetLeader] to restore Stability to the Pacific States has led to the collapse of social order across the nation. Protests and Riots are growing into rebellions, as the Intervention vs. Independence debate tears families apart; and makes neighbors take up arms against each other. In this crisis, many are turning to Hap Arnold to intervene once more and restore Stability where the Government has failed.  "

As the speech went on, Hughes’ words became more sinister, as he begun to blame Congress for the nation’s ills. Near the end of his speech, his words became darker yet; as he denounced Democracy, Denounced Socialism and Denounced the very people he was addressing by name. At the end of his speech, he read that “Our Nation must achieve true prosperity; however, one thing is preventing our nation from achieving Prosperity... Democracy”. \n\n As his speech ended, members of the Military stormed the halls and arrested every member of Congress.  The Military Police took them to an unknown location, as loyal foot soldiers crushed riots in every major city with brutal force. "

KX_california.6.a:0 "For Benevolence and Progress!"

KX_california.7.t:0 "Things Fall Apart"
KX_california.7.d:0 "While many expected Arnold’s intervention to restore Stability to the Pacific States, it in fact has done very much the opposite. The Military has faced mass defections, and Armed Rebellions have captured major cities. Pro-Independence, Pro-Intervention, Pro-Military and even supporters of the Late President Clash in the streets, as the nation tears itself to shreds. And, it is becoming clear that the Pacific States may face a Civil War within a Civil War. "
KX_california.7.a:0 "Oh Dear..."

KX_california.8.t:0 "Nortonist Revival"
KX_california.8.d:0 "In the height of the chaos that the Pacific States faces; many distraught citizens have turned not to the army nor the Democratic parties, but to an old idea that has seemingly been revived. To most in America, Edward Norton was a madman who claimed to be America’s Emperor based off of nothing, but to the loyal citizens of California, he was much more than a madman. And in these unstable times, a massive amount of citizens have turned to Norton, as a symbol of Stability and Unity. This idealization of Norton has turned into a desire to find Norton’s Heir, and crown him as Emperor of America, just as Norton the First, however with an official title and Coronation. In the stable past, this idea would seem ridiculous, but in these modern times, the idea of a Monarchy has appealed to millions who have lost faith in the current system."
KX_california.8.a:0 "How Unexpected."

KX_california.9.t:0 "Imperialists Attempt a Coup"
KX_california.9.d:0 "The Growing subset of the population that wishes to see a Californian Monarchy has finally taken action. With the ineffectiveness of Arnold’s government to restore Stability, the “Nortonists” have taken it upon themselves to restore order themselves. This has culminated in a march of thousands of “Nortonists” who demand that Arnold step aside and allow the Imperialists to form a Government. Meer months ago such a sight would be unseen, and their demands absurd; but now this once fringe group has a legitimate chance at gaining power. "
KX_california.9.a:0 "Step Aside, let the Imperialists take charge."
KX_california.9.b:0 "Fight these Lunatics!"

KX_california.10.t:0 "Imperialists Form A Government"
KX_california.10.d:0 "After Arnold let the Imperialists into the National Assembly, a new series of laws was ratified at gunpoint. These New Laws reorganized the Pacific Government, and replaced Congress with an Imperial Parliament, and ordered the creation of an Imperial Regency Council until a suitable Emperor could be found. These laws were all approved by Arnold, who has sworn allegiance to the group. Afterwards, loyal members of the military were rallied to help restore order to the Nation. The moral of the army has never been higher, as stability seems to be just around the corner. As well, all members of the Armed forces were forced to swear an oath to the Emperor, whoever the Emperor may be. "
KX_california.10.a:0 "For the Empire!"

KX_california.11.t:0 "The Aftermath of the Coup Attempt"
KX_california.11.d:0 "The Streets of Sacramento were drenched in blood, as supporters of Norton and the Supporters of the Military duked it out in a bloody battle. The National Assembly was on the verge of falling for the majority of the day, as Nortonists and Military supporters took turns pushing each other past their makeshift frontline. As the day went on, there was still no clear winner. However, due to a stray explosion most of Arnold’s line broke, leading to the Nortonists coming close to storming the Capital. The Fate of the Nation is resting on these crucial seconds. "

KX_california.12.t:0 "The Second Recall Election"
KX_california.12.d:0 "‘Hap’ Arnold has stepped down for the second time in less than a year. Stability has been at least somewhat restored to the nation, and Elections can take place once more. The nation has been through several administrations in the past months, and public faith in the system has been shattered; yet Democracy has pulled through. However, with many parties still being illegal, and the Visionary Party having collapsed (the majority of their leadership either missing, in jail or dead), John F. Aiso’s Democratic Prosperity League has become the only name on the ballot. And, even though voter turnout was lower than any election in History, Aiso managed to be elected in a Landslide, with a shocking 100% of the national vote. "
KX_california.12.a:0 "Vote For Aiso!"

KX_california.15.d:0 "Now that Norton II has decided to keep the nation as an authoritarian state, the question of the nature of our government has arose. Some believe that the current system of puppet legislature and authoritarian governance works fine, while others believe that any form of legislature is unneeded, and that Norton should rule as a true Absolute Monarch.

KX_california.16.t:0 "The House Wins No More"
KX_california.16.d:0 "For all intensive purposes, the President is gone. Hughes has been a useless figurehead for a while now, but never has he been this powerless. Occasionally, a story would come out about his insanity from Vegas; but that was about it. Until now when Hughes joined a council meeting via television to address the members of the council. Something this unusual caught many in the council off-guard, however they could not be bothered to care. \n\n However, in Vegas rumours abound about the President’s possible disappearance. "

#PSA's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################
CAL_HENRY_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With the outbreak of the Civil War, 'Hap' found himself in the West Coast of America, where due to his constant disagreements with the national Chief of Air Corps of the Federal Government, he decided to join the Pacific Governors in their struggle, and provide any technical expertise he is able to in exchange for the promise of an independent air force."
CAL_DADDY_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps. With MacArthur's takeover of the government, Marshall refused to recognize his colleague as the army's generalissimo, and when the Pacific Governors declared their revolt, Marshall decided to join them, which earned him the promotion to Field Marshall. He is widely considered one of the most brilliant planners in America, and is one of the most experienced members of our staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
CAL_ALEXANDER_PATCH_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 23, 1889, in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Alexander McCarrell "Sandy" Patch, the son of the Cavalry Captain Alexander M. Patch, started his military career when he joined West Point in 1909. While a fan of the cavalry corp, he was quick to realize that cavalry would soon enough become obsolete in combat, so he chose to join the infantry, and graduated from West Point as a second lieutenant in 1913. His first assignment was the 18th Infantry Regiment based in Texas, from where he was assigned to Pershing's 'Punitive Expedition' to Mexico, where he earned his promotion to first lieutenant. Without any major engagements for the US, Patch reached the rank of Captain in 1919 and was posted at Fort Benning as an instructor for four years. He'd apply for the Staunton Military Academy in Virginia as a professor of military science and tactics, a role which he'll keep until very recently. In the meantime, he attended the Field Officer's Course in 1922 and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, where he graduated with distinction in 1925, and finally graduated from the U.S. Army War College in 1932 as a lieutenant colonel. Patch's remarkable service record impressed General George Marshall, who tried to keep close contact with Patch in the following years of his graduation. When the civil war break out, Marshall implored Patch to join his staff in the Pacific Army, a request that Patch accepted and for which he was promoted to Brigadier General."
CAL_LEWIS_BRERETON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 21, 1890, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Lewis Hyde Brereton began his military career in 1907, when he joined the Naval Academy with his brother and graduated in June 1911. However, before graduating he submitted a letter for resignation citing seasickness, which would make him unable to serve as a naval officer. His resignation was accepted, and he applied to be commissioned in the US Army and was appointed as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps on August 17, 1911. In September 1912, he undertook flight training in Rockwell Field, and would work temporarily on the air corp until he survived his second crash, after which he requested to be relieved from duty. He returned to the Coast Artillery Corps and in July 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and sent to the Philippines and would serve a year before returning to the US in March 1917, where he was assigned to duty in the Aviation Sector Headquarters in Washington D.C.. He'd go through a series of administrative posts and became a close assistant of Billy Mitchell in his attempts to make the air force independent. With Mitchell's resignation, his life took a downturn, as his wife left him, he suffered a crash and was found AWOL by accident while his mental health deteriorated greatly due to these developments. He was restored into service in August 1927 and was assigned to command of the 88th Observation Squadron at Post Field, Oklahoma, as well as an instructor at the Field Artillery School in Fort Sill. In 1931 he was posted in the Panama Canal Zone and received a promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1935 due to an excelling performance, which allowed him to salvage his reputation of his misfortunes in the late twenties. With the outbreak of the civil war becoming increasingly inevitable, he took a ship and arrived to San Diego right before hostilities began in order to meet his old acquaintance,'Hap' Arnold. Despite his inexperience in practical infantry combat, his excellent administrative and planning skills allowed him to become Brigadier General, by Arnold's own request."

He'd be promoted to First Lieutenant in 1927 after undergoing the Troop Officers' Course from the Cavalry school, where he became keenly interested in the prospect of mechanized warfare and the use of Tanks to break through enemy lines. He joined the Command and General Staff School in 1931, where he graduated as a Major in 1932 and became one of the army's strongest advocates for the use of tanks along with George S. Patton. As the country spiralled into civil war, Isaac sided with Marshall against MacArthur, leaving westwards from Fort Riley, where he was working as an instructor, and was awarded for his loyalty to Marshall with the rank of Brigadier General\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Very interested in the adoption of tanks and mechanized vehicles over infantry combat, but his ambitions may have to wait until the Civil War is over."
CAL_ALBERT_WEDEMEYER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 9, in Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Albert Coady Wedemeyer graduated from West Point in 1919 as a second lieutenant, after which he was posted with the 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning, and would be transferred to the 57th Infantry in the Philippines in 1923. He was later assigned to the 15th Infantry Regiment in the Legation of Tianjin, where he learned to speak almost perfect Mandarin Chinese, and returned to the US to undergo a course in the Command and General Staff School, where his excellent grades made him eligible for an exchange program with the German Kriegsakademie, departing in early 1936. He never finished his courses however, as the Civil War began, and MacArthur took the reins of the government, Wedemeyer decided to travel back home and join the Pacific Forces, who he sees as the true American government.

He took several posts throughout the US and abroad, mostly following the steps of his father until his death in 1934. With his father's death, he was assigned to Seattle, where he had to put down several strikes in the name of the central government as the national situation deteriorated. When the Pacific governors finally revolted, George decided to support their insurrection, as most of his partners in the region were doing so and he didn't want to risk being imprisoned for treachery.

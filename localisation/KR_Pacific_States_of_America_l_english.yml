### Parties ###
CAL_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
CAL_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America\n§LThe SPA had some semblance of influence on the West Coast until recently, when Upton Sinclair and his Commonwealth Party took most of their support. Though the Commonwealth Party is seen as the greatest hope the left has in the PSA, there are those who adhere to more radical positions, oftentimes in association with the CSA. Those sympathetic to Totalism are typically supportive of the PSA rather than the CSA, but they believe that the government is not doing nearly enough to win the war. They call for the awakening of Western potential in the form of industry and see this as the route to victory. Unfortunately for them though, it seems they have lost their chance at power in the region.§!"
CAL_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
CAL_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America\n§LThe SPA had some semblance of influence on the West Coast until recently, when Upton Sinclair and his Commonwealth Party took most of their support. Though the Commonwealth Party is seen as the greatest hope the left has in the PSA, there are those who adhere to more radical positions, oftentimes in association with the CSA. Those who espouse mainstream syndicalist views were angry when Sinclair betrayed the eastern syndicalists to protect his own ambitions. As a result, they have largely remained loyal to the SPA and other small organizations, advocating an overhaul of the current economic system. However, their numbers are small and it seems that the Commonwealth Party has outmaneuvered them.§!"
CAL_radical_socialist_party:0 "Commonwealth Party"
CAL_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Commonwealth Party\n§LUpton Sinclair's Commonwealth Party has became a rallying point for those on the left on the West Coast. Though the End Poverty in California, or EPIC, plan failed to gain traction in 1934,  the party has became fairly popular since then. It still has to contend with the two major parties, the Democratic-Republicans, and the Progressives, who are their main rivals for support. To ameliorate this, the Commonwealth Party has distanced itself from the CSA, promising to safeguard the country from marxism and syndicalism. Sinclair is the visionary who has led the party to where it is today, but there are others who aspire to lead it. Culbert Olson is likely the most notable candidate. He is seen as a rising star in the party, espousing many of the same policies as Sinclair but with more moderate rhetoric. Only time will tell how successful this party could truly be.§!"
CAL_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
CAL_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party\n§LThe Progressives aim to build on a decades-old tradition of progressive success in the West and in the country as a whole. From the Farmer's Alliance to the Populist Party to the Bull Moose Party, Progressives have never won the presidency. However, with a coalition of farmers and workers, the party hopes to be victorious. A few obstacles stand in their way. The Commonwealth Party poses a strong challenge from their left, and the Democratic-Republicans have also stolen some voters who would otherwise be likely Progressive constituents. Nonetheless, the Progressives have a strong position on the West Coast, and it is possible that they could win the coming electoral contests outright. Henry Wallace, Hiram Johnson, Charles L. McNary, and CC Young are all contending for leadership of the party; the winner will have his work ahead of him, but the party's populist appeal is strong.§!"
CAL_social_liberal_party:0 "Democratic-Republican Party"
CAL_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic-Republican Party\n§LThe Democratic-Republicans, sometimes called the Liberals, are a mix of liberal and reform minded Democrats and Republicans who have become disenchanted with both parties and seek change. Though their desire for reform is perhaps more moderate than that of the Progressives and certainly more so than that of the Commonwealth, the Democratic-Republicans wish to see banking reform, the institution of a social security system, and work programs. The Progressives and the Commonwealth Party have sneered at a party they see as engaging in half measures, policies that will do nothing but frustrate the people and allow the rich to rule society. The mainstream Democratic and Republican Parties view the new party as upstarts, unworthy of recognition and having outlandish policy goals. Despite all their enemies, the Democratic-Republicans have a fair amount of support in the West, and with the right maneuvering, could even come to power. Their main candidates include Earl Warren, political titan William Gibbs McAdoo, Charles D. Martin, Manchester Boddy, and Charles A. Sprague. It is unclear which of these men will lead the party, but they all desire the same thing: victory in the coming elections.§!"
CAL_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
CAL_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party\n§LMany parties have emerged in the recent strife that has racked our country, but the Republican Party has stood strong through it all. Though they are not as dominant on the West Coast as they are in other regions of the country, they have strongly contested the region with the Democrats for decades. Herbert Hoover himself lived in California for years, and the state's governor, Frank Merriam, is also a Republican. Their current policies emphasize a laissez-faire economy, with low regulations and low taxes. Further, education and free trade are also popular policies within the Republican Party. Indeed, if the Republicans can create a message that can bring some disaffected voters back into the party, they could very well win the upcoming elections. However, recent hardships in California have forced Merriam to raise taxes, and his union-busting tendendcies will make it difficult to gain support from new constituencies. As such, Merriam has many rivals within the party. Robert Taft, son of former President William Howard Taft, threatens Merriam's position in the party, but Harry Chandler, Howard Hughes, Frank Knox, and Louis B. Mayer are all contending for the leadership of the Republican Party as well. The future of the Republican Party may well depend on who is chosen to represent them in the coming elections.§!"
CAL_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
CAL_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party\n§LFor decades, the Democratic Party has fiercely contended with their Republican rivals for dominance on the West Coast. Their support for railroad and tariff reforms gained them support early in the century, but recently, the party has bled support to various new parties rising up in the region. The America First Party has been particularly damaging to the party's efforts, and any Democratic hopeful will have to win back votes from this faction. The Democrats do not have a standardbearer like Frank Merriam in the West, but there are prominent figures. The newly-elected governor of Oregon, Charles Martin, has become known as a pro-business politician, and is vehemently opposed to strikes. Numerous prominent businessmen have also thrown their hat into the contest for Democratic leadership. Among them are Henry J. Kaiser, a famous contractor in the building of dams, and Walt Disney, a rising star whose company Disney aims to revolutionize entertainment. While neither man is known for their charisma, Disney's visionary nature could win voters over in the primary. However, media mogul William Randolph Hearst has also expressed interest in politics lately, though he has sharply contrasted his platform with that of the Democratic Party, and some believe he wants to start his own party. Doing so would weaken the Democratic Party even more, but Hearst may be beyond convncing. In the meantime, the best the Democratic Party can do is continue its traditions of social conservatism and support from the business community, and hope it will be enuogh.§!"
CAL_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
CAL_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party\n§LThe AFP has been a thorn in the side of local Democrats, for they have succeeded in stealing much of the party's support. Their populist outrage against business tycoons has gained them supporters in both rural and urban communities, and though they don't stand a chance of winning in the area, the AFP can certainly gain concessions from more popular parties. Their largest challenge lies not in the Democrats themselves, but in William Randolph Hearst, who in running his own party would use a mix of racial appeals and his own vision of unions to carve out a place for himself in the electoral arena. Only time can tell what will happen to the party in the West.§!"
CAL_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Federalist Loyalists"
CAL_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Federalist Loyalists\n§LThe Federal Government certainly has its supporters in the West. There are many who have recently fled to the West from their places on the East Coast, and they still harbor sympathies for those who stayed behind. There are also those who question the legitimacy of our cause, and instead believe we should unite with the Feds against our common foes. Though this is not likely, these loyalists should be watched, for they could undermine any Pacific regime.§!"
CAL_national_populist_party:0 "The Spiritualist Movement"
CAL_national_populist_party_long:0 "The Spiritualist Movement\n§LOne of the strangest new factions to emerge lately is the Spiritualist Movement. Within the movement, there are many disparate factions who have come together with the common goal of opposing what they call "Monarchist Anglo-Syndicalism". There is a faction of the movement that wishes to pursue closer ties with Japan, who has been one of their biggest supporters, foreign or domestic. This faction is represented by oil businessman Max Thornburg and ideological ally Ralph Townsend. Another faction of the movement is that of L. Ron Hubbard, who is less concerned with the support of Japan or any other nation than he is with the occult. His Christian mysticism, along with his belief in the paranormal and even U.F.O.'s, has made him a source of derision for some, though Hubbard's beliefs are no joke to him. His heavily anti-syndicalist views could make him popular in the business community, but those who know Hubbard well know he will not be controlled by anyone. Leading these two factions, among other smaller ones, is movement and party leader Edward Longstreet Bodin. Bodin faces a difficult task in reconciling Japanese support with the occult views of the party, but with his talent, and a bit of luck, he may be able to bring the party to popularity.§!"

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_WALT_DISNEY_DESC:0 "Walt Disney is many things, Businessman, Politician and Visionary, just to name a few. Born in 1901 in Chicago to Elias and Flora Disney, he moved at the age of 10 to Kansas City in Missouri, however he moved back to Chicago soon after. Disney moved to Hollywood in 1923 to work in the Cartoon Industry and because his brother was convalescing from Tuberculosis there. Disney married Lillian Bounds in 1925 after hiring her as an Ink Artist. They had one Daughter biologically and adopted the other. In the early '30s Disney begun his career in Politics and, voiced his support for the Republican party of California. Something that made him a rising player in California’s regional politics. With the outbreak of the civil war, Walt pledged his full support for the Pacific Government and declared his intent for the Presidency. Disney would run for President and despite all odds, he managed to win the nomination. He then proceeded to win the election. And though he has been labelled a dictator and an autocrat by his opposition, he has the full support of the government behind him and his plans for America, whatever that will bring."
POLITICS_CAL_NORTON_II_DESC:0 "Emperor Norton II is a man who lived through many odd events, to ultimately become Emperor of an Empire that in all senses; shouldn't exist. Born Charles Ross Norton in 1881, he was the great nephew of a madman who declared himself Emperor of the United States, little did he know however that this event would lead to more madness within his own lifetime. For the majority of his life, Norton had lived a quiet, peaceful life in South Africa; even having a son by the name of Gerard Norton. Even after the Weltkrieg, nothing dramatically changed for him, his life was quiet and simple. \n\n That was until he was invited to a party in San Francisco on one fateful day. What started out as a gathering of 'Nortonites' led to him being swept up into the political upheaval and chaos plaguing the Pacific States at that time. Before he knew what was going on, he was being crowned Emperor Norton II in San Francisco, and after that; oddly enough came peace. Though he has attracted several loyal members and people who are willing to fight to the death for him, Norton is getting older with time. To many, he almost seems reluctant to the position of Emperor. But every morning he gets out of bed determined to at least do something about the problems he and his subjects face."
POLITICS_WALT_DISNEY_AUTOCRAT_DESC:0 "Walt Disney is many things, Businessman, Politician and Visionary, just to name a few. Born in 1901 in Chicago to Elias and Flora Disney, he moved at the age of 10 to Kansas City in Missouri, however he moved back to Chicago soon after. Disney moved to Hollywood in 1923 to work in the Cartoon Industry and because his brother was convalescing from Tuberculosis there. Disney married Lillian Bounds in 1925 after hiring her as an Ink Artist. They had one Daughter biologically and adopted the other. In the early '30s Disney begun his career in Politics and, voiced his support for the Republican party of California. Something that made him a rising player in California’s regional politics. With the outbreak of the civil war, Walt pledged his full support for the Pacific Government and declared his intent for the Presidency. However, as the political scene changed; so did Disney. After Arnold’s intervention, Disney along with Howard Hughes, formed the National Visionary Party. When Disney was elected, stability and prosperity was expected; however, the opposite came, and after the Nation begun to collapse, Disney had to take drastic measures. The democratic process is worthless, all it has done is send America on a downward spiral. Because of this, Disney has done away with the democratic forces that are hindering his Visionary plans. The so-called 'Visionary Party' has stacked the government with people loyal to Disney and his plans for America and instituted a dictatorship with Disney at its head. The voices of the opposition are now silent, the chaos has ended. And with his power base secured, Disney can begin his plans for the nation, whatever that will entail is up to Disney himself, who has the full support of the government. Many now believe that under President Disney's guidance America will not only prosper but it will rise to heights never seen before, but only time will tell if, and when such a thing will happen."
POLITICS_JOHN_AISO_DESC:0 "John Fujio Aiso was born in Burbank, Los Angeles in December of 1909 to Japanese Parents. During his younger years, Aiso was treated poorly by his peers due to the Anti-Japanese sentiment that was high in America at the time. Aiso attended Hollywood High School in the 20's where he gained national attention for his victory in the school's constitution oration contest, however he was not allowed to compete on the national level. Aiso also spent a year in Japan at Seijo University after he graduated in 1926, until he attended Brown University in the United States where he graduated Cum Laude and served as class Valedictorian in 1931. He completed his degree after going to Harvard in 1934. He did private practise across the US and Japan until 1936, where upon outbreak of Civil War, Aiso supported the Government of his native Pacific States; and fled to Sacremento to aid the government. That should have been the height of his life, however through the chaos that engulfed the Pacific States; Aiso manages to secure a spot on the California Supreme Court. And eventually, Aiso found himself the de-facto head of the Government after a constitutional crisis that resulted in the Provisional Supreme Court taking over. With Aiso now in charge, the future is uncertain; however one thing is for sure, America is forever changed."
POLITICS_HARRY_BAALS_DESC:0 "Few expected the relatively unknown Fort Wayne mayor to ever become president. But he managed to take advantage of the divisions among his fellow Republicans to present himself as a candidate of unity and stability, promising classic Republican policies such as lowering taxes and promoting business, both large and small, with his personal touch being massive sewer renovation programs throughout the country, inspired by his work in Fort Wayne. He successfully represented the Republican establishment, which seemed to have convinced the voters. His campaign slogan 'Proud of my Harry Baals' proved to be very popular with his voters, and surprisingly so with many of America's youth."
POLITICS_CULBERT_OLSON_DESC:0 "Culbert Olson had faced both the stigma of running as a Mormon politician, and running as an atheist in his lifetime. In California as Governor, Culbert had to deal with long standing rumors that Mormons had a blood feud with the US Government. Olson's superb term as Governor in passing health care legislation and allowing non-SPA socialists to organize. By the time of the national race, Culbert had come out as an atheist, and faced a second uphill battle. The party stood by him, and ultimately his portfolio allowed him to reach the White House."
POLITICS_JOHN_GELLATLY_DESC:0 "From bankruptcy in Benton County, Oregon, John Arthur Gellatly distinguished himself as a responsible fiscal conservative. After being elected to Washington State Senate in 1918, Gellatly made several runs for Governor throughout the 1920s and 30s, finally succeeding as Lieutenant Governor during the Crisis of 36. The foundation of the Pacific states required a reliable and uncontroversial Republican candidate, and Gellatly was their man."
POLITICS_HOWARD_HUGES_DESC:0 "Son of an All-American family of ministers and inventors, Howard Hughes broke out of the Midwest by demonstrating a knack for engineering. After the tragic death of his parents, young Howard was thrust into a family fortune and a medical facility in Maryland. Using this vast fortune, Howard created the Summa Tool Corporation, a maker of fine industrial tools. The proceeds were funneled into Howard's Hollywood scripts, including the Academy Award winner 'The World Is Yours'. Expanding finally into Republican politics in California, Howard stood out among a crowd of old money. From RKO to a line of passenger aircraft, Howard was elected under the promise to finish Boulder Dam in Colorado and electrify the states."
POLITICS_FRANK_MERRIAM_DESC:0 "Son of Civil War veterans, Frank Merriam was born in Iowa and planned for a legal career in the Midwest. Upon seeing the rising prominence of the California Republican Party, Frank shifted his career out west. It was Merriam more than anyone that defeated the SPA in California, defeating the Longshoremen strike, and even rebuffing Upton Sinclair when he became the Democrat nominee for Governor. Despite this, traditionally Republican papers resisted Merriam's tax reforms. Upon the ascension of MacArthur, most of these papers were ordered by Hearst to decry all Republicans. Merriam was able to use the public outcry against Hearst and MacArthur to gain the executive seat."
POLITICS_FLETCHER_BOWRON_DESC:0 "A California native and veteran of the Nicaragua War, Fletcher Bowron has a unique relationship with Latin Americans among Republican politicians. The first mayor of Los Angeles to support Cinco De Mayo parades, and an advocate of imprisoning radicals on suspicion. This coupled with Bowron's pursuit of organized crime impressed hardline republicans enough to put him in a greater office."
POLITICS_ROBERT_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Robert Taylor Jones began as a civil engineer out of Tennessee. The most significant project Jones was on was the Panama Canal. The boom of civil constructions out west drew Jones into Arizona, where he entered Democratic politics on a constructive platform. Serving as Governor of Arizona during the Crisis of 36, Jones countered the SPA and AFP candidates who sought to push the state into rebellion. Sadly, rebellion was forced upon the state when MacArthur came, and several democratic politicians betrayed the republic for autocracy. Thankfully Jones had contact with the true loyal Democratic Party, and campaigned for national office."
POLITICS_CLARENCE_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Clarence Martin came into prominence during a consequential Washington State election of 1932, which unseated many Republicans from state office. Clarence may have come in during a major shift, but his credentials in Washington included fostering small business and his unusually respectful discourse. Clarence on principle refused to exaggerate or appeal to populist tendencies in his election campaign, and distinguished himself in the Washington Senate by sponsoring necessary civil works projects. As the Democratic Party was able to wrest the civil works initiative from Republicans across the West, Clarence reaped the benefits politically and received more votes in 36 than Garner in Washington. The desertion of some Democrats to MacArthur only made Clarence's loyalty stand out, and his nomination to the executive chair that more likely."
POLITICS_OSWALD_WEST_DESC:0 "West was luck that the provisional government set up after MacArthur's rise did not specify natural born Americans, as he was born in Canada. Starting out as a Land Agent for Oregon, Oswald West was always diligent with his work. As Governor, West saw passage of Women's Suffrage, Worker Rights, and even state Prohibition, all strengthening the Democratic Party in the state. Taking the initiative to finance a State highway System without Federal money, West successfully pushed public projects. A more fervent advocate of conservative democratic laws on alcohol and even authorizing sterilisation as punishment for breaking morality codes."
POLITICS_CHARLES_SPRAGUE_DESC:0 "A newspaper magnate and business owner, Sprauge got his start in Oregon politics as a newspaper commentator. Reprinted nationally and famed for his advocacy of small business, internationalisation, and fiscal conservatism, many expected him to enter into Democratic politics. Sprauge instead ran as a Republican, and successfully capture democrat voters who supported a fiscally conservative but active Fair Deal. A surprising number of SPA also voted him into Governorship, as he supported their employment programs. This position he encouraged within the Republican Party, and eventually allowed him to gain support throughout the West."
POLITICS_RALPH_CARR_DESC:0 "A follower of Hoover's Republican Party, Ralph Carr's politics in Colorado were fiscally conservative and socially mixed. While Carr did deploy the National Guard to end the Green Mountain Dam Strike of 36, within the PSA Carr refused to imprison radicals. Going so far as to pardon several AFL labor leaders that were arrested without charges. Ultimately a Constitutionalist in a time of crisis where others were stretching legal boundaries. Carr was able to use this as leverage within the Republican Party to secure nomination and ultimately the election."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_LEE_DESC:0 "Joseph Lee was one of the first hard right Utahan Republicans, being elected only shorty after Mormons were allowed into Congress. While others resisted the draft on religious grounds, Lee joined the military and eventually fell on hard times after veterans’ pensions dried up. Running for Governor as a Republican and promising to promote Veteran Pay, Lee had also become acquainted with the old boys’ network of politics. This old boy’s network almost led to his dismissal after he was caught in an illegal gambling den by pro-AFP sheriff W. Skousen. Lee continued to advocate for fiscal conservatism and for admission of all religious right groups into Republican circles, which eventually got him nominated for the highest office."
POLITICS_MONRAD_WALLGREN_DESC:0 "Wallgren's career prior to politics was a combination of business management and pool sharking. A personable and approachable attitude helped jump-start his political career in Washington, especially during the close election of 36. The State Senate saw Wallgren's take an active role in national security, and advocate restricting press of radical elements, Wallgren stood firm as formerly Democratic papers were blacklisted along with SPA and AFP ones after they began supporting MacArthur. Wallgren's opposition eventually forced him out of the Democratic Party while in office, to which he responded by joining the up-and-coming Progressives."
POLITICS_CLYDE_TINGLEY_DESC:0 "Clyde Tingly came to New Mexico to heal his wife's TB, which was worsening in the Ohio weather. Tingly became incensed at the Republican rule in New Mexico, and so began a career in politics and advocacy for health-care reform. A supporter of early Fair Deal proposals, Tingly flew into office on the promise that a new governorship would allow for better usage of state funds. Albuquerque began recovering from the Great Depression under tingly even as most of the nation fell further, and his dedication to health care legislation pushed him into national politics where he became a Progressive."
POLITICS_ARTHUR_LANGLIE_DESC:0 "After a decade on the Seattle City Council. and another four years in the State Senate, Arthur Langlie was one of the youngest nationally recognized politicians in Washington history. Running against and losing to Monrad Wallgren, Langlie recouped and ultimately ingratiated himself into the Republican Party enough to win the nomination. Seen by many as a common man and exemplifier of the immigrant spirit, Langlie answers the Progressive claims to represent immigrant rights."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MCKAY_DESC:0 "Beginning work before he was out of High School, McKay thought his apex would be a used car dealership in Salem, Oregon. Instead, the Republican party encouraged him to run for local and then state offices, eventually being elected to the State Senate in 36. This climactic year saw McKay willingly leave his old supporters behind for the Progressives. An advocate for the national highway system, fiscally moderate Fair Deal policies, and a support for public works has moderated some of the Progressives more radical elements, and helped them take liberal Republican voting districts."
POLITICS_DANIEL_THORNTON_DESC:0 "Active in the 4-H and agrarian rights program, Daniel Thornton moved to Colorado from Texas in order to run a cattle ranch. A brief career in the State Senate combined with his strong personality made his campaign as a Republican to Governorship fairly easy. Known for his Stetson hat, cowboy boots, and smoking pipe, many reports have called Thornton the 'Republican Garner'. The media seemed to place him at odds with Richard Nixon during the election, but their mutual understanding to allow the elder politician to run made the difference at the end."
POLITICS_BOURKE_HICKENLOOPER_DESC:0 "Coming to the West after MacArthur's coup, Bourke initially had very little public support within the provisional government. Partnered with J. William Fullbright, Bourke helped the Republicans whip into shape, and pushed for an isolationist policy towards Canada and Japan. Seen by many as a patriot of a country on the brink of dissolution, Bourke won office by assuring a hard stand against all traitors to the American Republic."
POLITICS_VICTOR_MEYERS_DESC:0 "A multi-talented if not disparate man, Victor Meyers has been called the 'Pagliacci of Politics' in his early days. Back when his political career competed with his musical career. Insisting that the Democrats oppose Prohibition in Washington, he rode aboard a beer wagon during his Gubernatorial campaign. After this failed he began mixing Progressive policies with his natural talent to draw attention to himself. Promising tribes across the West voting rights, advocating pensions, child welfare and unemployment pay, Meyers was at times taken seriously and other times laughed at. A unique proposal for building single-pour concrete housing to solve the homeless issue proved to be both eccentric and effective. Ultimately the Progressives and the American people took him seriously enough to elect him into office."
POLITICS_ANDREW_HOCKENHULL_DESC:0 "A quiet and unassuming politician, Hockenhull rose through the ranks of New Mexican politics through his strong adherence to the Democratic Party line. So, his switch to the Progressive Party in 1928 was a pragmatic switch. Although he did not win the Governorship in 1936, Hockenhull persisted in the public service until the Progressives were forced to run him."
POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "A native Californian and an obstinate quaker, Nixon attempted to join the FBI after college. After failing to do so, Nixon became a lawyer for the major oil companies of California. Nixon began a feud with fellow Republican Earl Warren, which persisted into the national political scene. Nixon took jobs prosecuting politicians in the Pacific States who were suspected of radicalism, and had a good winning record against socialists. Finally Nixon defeated Warren within the Republicans by promising him the Governorship of California in exchange for the National Nomination."
POLITICS_GEORGE_CRAIG_DESC:0 "Born in Brazil, Indiana, and trained to be a lawyer, George Craig was classmates with his eventual electoral rival, William Jenner. Craig would eventually compete with Jenner for the Republican Party nomination after his service during the Crisis of 36. Craig's service constituted defending the American Legion of Clay County against the SPA, which informed his later anti-socialism. As Governor of Indiana, Craig reformed the state government, and refused funds for the national highway in favour of local contractors."
POLITICS_VAL_PETERSON_DESC:0 "A school administrator in Nebraska for the first twenty years of his career, Peterson's introduction into politics came when he entered the US Air Force, and was assigned to trained with Hugh Butler. Butler eventually recommended him to Nebraska Governor Dwight Griswold. Peterson succeeded Griswold as Governor, and worked his way up the Republican Party power structure. Eisenhower recognized a fellow soldier and elevated Peterson within the Party, where he became a nationally recognized politician and presidential candidate."
POLITICS_JOHN_MCGROARTY_DESC:0 "Born at Buck Mountain, Pennsylvania during the Fall of 1862 as the youngest of 12 Children, McGroarty was never assumed to be anyone of importance, but fate works in mysterious ways. McGorarty began a career in Law before beginning a career as an executive in a Montanan Mining Company before moving once again to Los Angeles to become a Journalist. After becoming famed for his introspective writing on Lincoln and the black community, McGroarty began authoring everything from books to plays to dramas until being elected to Congress in the 1930s for the Democratic Party. McGroarty would run for President in 1936 to only fail miserably in the nominations, due to Garner and with his failure to become his Vice Presidential nominee, McGroarty would decide to quit politics and return to Journalism in California. Before McGroarty could settle down however, the 2nd American Civil War kicked off and he decided to once again get back into politics. Running with the Democratic Party again, McGroarty was able to sweep the nominations and be elected to the highest office in all the land. Though McGroarty has campaigned on a promise of Hope and Unity, it is unknown whether he can deliver on those promises."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_RANDOLPH_HEARST_DESC:0 "The influence that William Randolph Hearst holds over America can not be understated. He is the head of one of America’s largest newspapers and can change public opinion on his own whims. His tactics of sensationalism and “Yellow Journalism” have put him in the center of the publishing industry and has gained him many political points. Indeed, his influence extends deep into politics as well, enough to earn him the presidency of the Pacific States. Originally, he sided with Progressive ideals, but eventually drifted right, now as President his National Democratic Party has instituted authoritarian and right-wing measures, and many fear that Hearst is close to becoming a dictator."
POLITICS_L_RON_HUBBARD_DESC:0 "To some, Hubbard is a messiah, to others he is a madman, but regardless Hubbard is one thing: powerful. Hubbard came from humble beginnings, eventually finding work publishing for pulp fiction magazines, where he wrote many genres, mainly science fiction. After a near-death experience he published “Excalibur”, which originally failed to gain any mainstream popularity. However, during the chaos of the Spiritualist Coup Hubbard took a place right by the side of Edward Longstreet Bodin, a man who shared many of his radical beliefs. Hubbard’s influence grew within the part until he eventually gained the highest level of leadership in the land when Ed Bodin was killed by a crazed Syndicalist gunman. Many still think that Hubbard organized his killing, but that matters little now. Hubbard is in charge and will guide the human race to a higher plane of existence."
POLITICS_EDWARD_LONGSTREET_BODIN_DESC:0 "Edward Longstreet Bodin is a mysterious man, but as the leader of the Spiritualist Movement, some would argue he has to be. His birth in 1894 came, in his view, as the culmination of a family history originating in the sixteenth century French demonologist Jean Bodin. The younger Bodin has always shown a fascination with such subjects, as well as the paranormal and extraterrestrial. His ideas have manifested themselves in his "Spiritualist Party" which, while on the fringe of American politics, has attracted a passionate following. Bodin has taken advantage of the recent state of chaos in America to elbow his way into the political arena, stepping on many but meeting a curious ally along the way. L. Ron Hubbard has become a sort of right-hand-man to Bodin, and with the help of Japanese sympathizers, the two men hope to exorcise the twin demons of Syndicalism and Anglo-Monarchism in America and soon, the world. Bodin will have to take care, though: the diverse factions he has so adeptly unified into one party could just as quickly dissolve into infighting not unlike the kind seen on the national stage."
POLITICS_LOTHROP_STODDARD_DESC:0 "Lothrop Stoddard began his life in Massachusetts, and from an early age, he displayed an exceptional intellect. When he was old enough, Stoddad attented Harvard University, earning the 'magna cum laude' distinction and working towards a Ph.D. in History. After he achieved this, he joined several historical and political organizations and began his work as an author, espousing eugenicist and racialist views to explain what he sees as the current decline of civilization. Despite his background in history and political science, Stoddard is a great admirer of biology. He believes it is the key to explaining the relationship between the different human races as well as being the causal factor in the United States's current woes. As such, his writings are characterized by both political and scientific views, mostly on the topics of race and genetic superiority. Stoddard's popularity as an author greatly aided his efforts in joining the political arena, and though he is seen as occupying the political fringe, his work is familiar in almost every home in New England. Now that he is in charge of the country, Stoddard has power he never expected to possess, and he plans to use it to save human civilization itself."
POLITICS_WARREN_MAGNUSON_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! April 12th, 1905, in Moorhead, Minnesota, United States of America\n§YPolitical Career:§! While it's known when and where Warren Grant Magnuson was born, the exact details of his birth are a mystery - he never knew his birth parents, and was given his name by a pair of second-generation Scandinavian immigrants. Magnuson spent two years studying in North Dakota, before spending a brief stint in Canada working jobs with threshing crews. At the behest of a high school girlfriend, he moved to Seattle, Washington, where he would earn his law degree in 1929, and spent the next few years working in various government jobs. He first entered the world of politics by supporting Al Smith's 1928 bid for the presidency and remained active as a Democrat since then, championing opposition to prohibition and eventually entering the Washington House of Representatives in 1933 as a Seattle delegate. Magnuson was then elected to fill a vacancy in the national House, taking his seat in January 1937 - mere months before the country was torn apart by civil war. Opposing MacArthur's takeover, Magnuson defied the odds and escaped Washington, D.C. with the aid of anti-coup elements in the Navy - in return, he would volunteer for the war effort and serve in the Navy for much of the war.\n\nIn 1944, Magnuson entered the Senate on the back of his war record and progressive credentials, famously spearheading efforts to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act and quickly becoming a poster boy of the Democratic reformist wing. When he announced his intent to run for the presidency in 1952, he was seen as an ideal candidate - nobody, the Democrats argued, better embodied the Pacific cause than a veteran who has dedicated his life to the cause of democracy. With the turn of the decade, many look to President Magnuson as the harbinger of a new era of American progressivism."

CAL_Army_rangers_desc:0 "An elite group of specialized soldiers, the Army Rangers will be able to carry out covert missions in rough terrain, disrupting enemy supply lines and morale."
CAL_90_division_Army:0 "90-Division Army Plan"
CAL_90_division_Army_desc:0 "While Marshall originally envisioned that a reformed US Army would require a 265-Division Plan to be fully mobilized, the limitations of the West Coast make such a plan a pipe dream. As such, he has decided to adopt a 90-Division Plan, with the objective of raising a total of at least 90 divisions against America's enemies."
CAL_organizing_victory:0 "Organizing Victory"
CAL_organizing_victory_desc:0 "All elements of our society should be brought together to bolster the war effort. Under Marshall's close supervision, our factories will produce more equipment than ever before, and we will show the world the might of the West!" 
CAL_motorization:0 "Motorisation Program"
CAL_motorization_desc:0 "With the original rejection of the motorisation plans, a ghost has loomed the American Army as their methods became backwards as opposed to other militaries. Marshall has now proposed the government to subsidize truck production and to being the seizure of civilian trucks for the creation of motorized units capable of crossing the American countryside before our enemy can react."
CAL_tank_production:0 "Increase Tank Production"
CAL_tank_production_desc:0 "With the West Coast's low manpower, the High Command has had to design a plan to effectively improve what every man is worth in the field. In any of those plans, expanding Tank production in the West Coast comes as a priority, as their relatively low manpower cost and high combat effectiveness proves that it will not only save us lives, but also helps us push the enemy back more swiftly."
CAL_Officer_instruction:0 "Officer Instruction"
CAL_Officer_instruction_desc:0 "Marshall has presented this issue to our government, and his solution is to create forward study-bases, with more experienced officers mentoring younger ones in tactics. While this may put more of our officers in the line of fire, it will also ensure our new generation of officers gets first hand experience, as well as improving our army's leadership on the lower echelons as a whole."
CAL_recon_units:0 "Reconnaissance Units"
CAL_recon_units_desc:0 "Knowledge is Power, and Marshall believes that without the former two, victory in America will be impossible. We are outmanned and outgunned by our enemies, but if we know their every movement, then we can nullify our enemy's superiority by out-witting them."
CAL_defense_is_the_best_offense:0 "Defense is the Best Offense"
CAL_defense_is_the_best_offense_desc:0 "The first step towards preparing for the coming storm will be to improve our defense construction. Trench digging and fortification construction will be a basic part of our army's curriculum, so that when the enemy waves come and threaten our home, we shall prevail."
CAL_logistic_security:0 "Logistical Security"
CAL_logistic_security_desc:0 "Logistics are a not-so well known battlefield which will be vital for us if we wish to gain the upper hand against the radicals in the East.

CAL_aggressive_conscription:0 "Aggressive Conscription"
CAL_aggressive_conscription_desc:0 "Our position on the West Coast does not come without drawbacks. We do not have enough men to match the armies of the East. However, DeWitt argues if we are more aggressive in our recruiting and conscription efforts, we may be able to even the score."
CAL_Expand_the_Presidio:0 "Expand the Presidio of San Francisco"
CAL_Expand_the_Presidio_desc:0 "The Presidio of San Francisco has a long tradition of being vital for our nation's war efforts since America occupied it in 1846. As it stands, it is the most logical seat of power to direct our army's efforts, as well as the best prepared facility in the West Coast to hold the Command Staff. However, being the best prepared facility the region doesn't mean it's up to standard, and an expansion of the Fort is required."
CAL_coast_to_coast_planning:0 "'Coast-to-Coast' Planning Board"
CAL_coast_to_coast_planning_desc:0 "With the Expanded Presidio, DeWitt has proposed the creation of a Planning board, capable of issuing new and adaptable plans for our front line commanders so that we may push our enemies from sea to shining sea."
CAL_increase_military_spending:0 "Increase Our Military Spending"
CAL_increase_military_spending_desc:0 "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise. While the Civil war may be over, America still has enemies to fight and wars to win, and as such keeping the Civil War military spending and expanding upon it is on our best interests."
CAL_bring_the_complex_west:0 "Rebuild the Military Industrial Complex"
CAL_bring_the_complex_west_desc:0 "With most of the Military Industrial Complex in the East, the Civil War has devastated the old munitions and weapons factories that made up America's war industry as they became high value targets for bombings and a preferred hiding spot of persistent enemy defenders. If we wish to be ready for the next war, investing into rebuilding the military industrial complex is one of our priorities."
CAL_Columbia_needs_you:0 "Columbia Needs You!"
CAL_Columbia_needs_you_desc:0 "The Figure of Columbia, a woman wearing an American flag gown and a Phrygian hat, is the personification of the ideals of freedom and pursuit of liberty we fought so hard to achieve. With the tyrant overthrown and the radicals put down, the service of the American people to Columbia is not yet over. War looms in the horizon, and only the brave men of America can protect her and our nation from tyranny."
CAL_defense_contracts:0 "Defence Contractors"
CAL_defense_contracts_desc:0 "Unlike some command-style economies in Europe, we must rely on contractors to produce our weapons. Ensuring these companies are prepared for this new Civil War should be a top priority."
CAL_crossing_the_rockies:0 "Crossing the Rocky Mountains"
CAL_crossing_the_rockies_desc:0 "The Rocky Mountains is a formidable geographic formation that separates our beloved West Coast from the carnage in the East. However, with our fate being to reclaim the rest of America, we will have to cross the Rocky mountains eventually and face our enemies. As such, we should begin preparations for a smoother campaign through them."
CAL_gi_bill:0 "The G.I. Bill"
CAL_gi_bill_desc:0 "Massive numbers of demobilized servicemen will be a major issue in the aftermath of the Civil War. We should create education and job training programs to better re-integrate them into civilian life."
CAL_war_bonds:0 "War Bonds"

CAL_walkie_talkies:0 "Walkie-Talkies"
CAL_walkie_talkies_desc:0 "Portable radios, or 'Walkie-Talkies' as they are commonly called, present a powerful tool for our army. With them, our troops can coordinate artillery and air strikes, among other things."

### Navy Focuses ###
CAL_navy:0 "U.S Navy"
CAL_navy_desc:0 "The American navy was once the pride of the world. Yet much of it deserted to the traitors to the east. We should review what forces stayed loyal to our government, so we can best determine how they can serve in this war."
CAL_great_white_fleet:0 "Great White Fleet"
CAL_great_white_fleet_desc:0 "The Great White Fleet was the height to American naval power. We should look back at it for inspiration. A great fleet of battleships and dreadnoughts will ensure we always have naval superiority."

CAL_light_cruisers:0 "Light-Cruiser Development"

CAL_expand_the_waves:0 "Expand the WAVEs"
CAL_expand_the_waves_desc:0 "Women can serve many auxiliary roles in the navy, freeing up men for combat duty. While this might be socially controversial, it will significantly help the war effort."
CAL_expand_marine_corps:0 "Improve the Marine Corps"
CAL_expand_marine_corps_desc:0 "The Marine Corps was the epitome of American power projection around the globe. From the shores of Tripoli to the halls of Montezuma, the Marines were always there. We should ensure they have modern equipment and training."

### Air Force Focuses ###
CAL_air_force:0 "U.S Air Force"
CAL_air_force_desc:0 "Before the war, the American Army Air Corps was, as its name suggests, little more than a branch of the Army. In this new war, we need to ensure it is independent and gets the support it needs."
CAL_build_air_ports:0 "Build Air Bases"
CAL_build_air_ports_desc:0 "While the industrialized coastline has many airports, rural areas where much of the fighting in the Civil War has taken place are lacking in air bases. We need to construct more to ensure our troops have the air support they need."
CAL_air_production:0 "Screaming Eagles"
CAL_air_production_desc:0 "Airborne divisions are a new development in warfare, but one that promises to hold significant bonuses. We should investigate creating our own airborne units."
CAL_train_pilots:0 "Train Pilots"

CAL_bombers_desc:0 "A modern force of bombers will allow us to annihilate enemy divisions without placing our own men in danger, and enable us to wreak havoc on enemy supply lines and communications."
CAL_air_supremcy:0 "Air Supremacy"
CAL_air_supremcy_desc:0 "Another doctrine our theorists have presented is that of aerial supremacy, where the primary objective of our pilots is to ensure that enemy planes cannot attack our troops on the ground."

CAL_expand_wasps:0 "Expand the WASPs"

CAL_expand_air_ports:0 "Expand Air Bases"
CAL_expand_air_ports_desc:0 "Our initial expansion of air bases has gone well, but we still need more if we are to win the war in the air. We should divert more resources to their construction at once."

CAL_authoritarian_democrats_in_power_desc:0 "William Randolph Hearst's National Democratic Party and Federalist sympathizers have won the day on the back of promises to stabilize the Pacific, bring riches to its proper citizens and most importantly, end the war with the Federalists as soon as possible. It is a new day in the Pacific!"
CAL_raise_tariffs:0 "Raise Tariffs"
CAL_raise_tariffs_desc:0 "We must be protected from foreign competition at all costs if we are to remain self-reliant. High tariffs for virtually all goods, with the exception of some agricultural goods, is needed in this endeavor, with the resulting income going to national projects and existing services."
CAL_slash_taxes:0 "Reward Success"
CAL_slash_taxes_desc:0 "Why do the rich get richer while the poor gets poorer cries the syndicalist? They are correct, but wrong that capitalism is the culprit, when it has been the lack of incentives and opportunities of wealth to expand. Taxes for the wealthy will be slashed, especially the inheritance tax, with our recent tariff income compensating for the cost."
CAL_american_festivals:0 "American Festivals"
CAL_american_festivals_desc:0 "The people may have their economic goods but what of the circuses, festivals and national events that once brought boundless entertainment to the populace?

CAL_state_trusts:0 "Municipal Ownership"
CAL_state_trusts_desc:0 "Utilities such as electricity, water, gas and telephones can not be entrusted to only a handful of private companies without oversight.

CAL_roaring_parties:0 "Roaring Parties"
CAL_roaring_parties_desc:0 "One of Hearst's favorite activities from the roaring 10's and early 20's, extravagant parties not only increase confidence in our economy but will help the state establish connections between them and the upper-class, as well as help solidify them into a more cohesive, appeasable force. Raise a glass, for the down times are over!"
CAL_state_unions:0 "National Unions"
CAL_state_unions_desc:0 "That syndicalism poses a threat to the nation can not be in doubt, but this does not mean the American working man should not be properly organized and represented. Patriotic Unions shall be formed by the state, register workers and guarantee a minimum standard of living while radical-leaning unions will be banned, allowing the American worker to be properly represented."
CAL_media_regulation_act:0 "Media Regulation Act"
CAL_media_regulation_act_desc:0 "Our most dangerous foes have been quashed and we can finally end the litany of newspapers and reporters whom seek the destruction of the state! The Media Regulation Act will allow the new Broadcasting Division of the Federal Police to assemble a list of prominent radicals and ban their publications at once before another coup attempt forms against America."
CAL_investigate_gop:0 "Investigate the GOP"
CAL_investigate_gop_desc:0 "There can be little doubt that the GOP and their former friends in the Progressive Party and Democratic-Republicans make up Hearst's most dangerous critics since the collapse of the Commonwealth Party. That they put the interests of international bankers and foreign governments before our own is undeniable and their organization shall be investigated for potential bribery and corruption."
CAL_yellow_peril:0 "Yellow Peril"
CAL_yellow_peril_desc:0 "Hearst has been vocal in his concern that the "Yellow Races" seek to overtake the "White Race", formerly through immigration but now, with the weakening of America, through imperialism. The Pacific belongs to America, not Hirohito or the Chinese. Our publications and government will alert the public to this threat and the Tenney Committee will investigate possible East Asian collaborators."
CAL_national_industrial_administration:0 "National Industrial Organization"
CAL_national_industrial_administration_desc:0 "The economy is still struggling to recover from the combined attacks of syndicalist strikes, the Stock Market Crash, Great Panic, Black Monday and now destruction of the war. The National Industrial Administration headed by Hugh S. Johnson will work with industry leaders to end unsafe practices, price gouging and unlivable wages, encouraging class collaboratism."
CAL_punish_hawaii:0 "Punish Hawaii"
CAL_punish_hawaii_desc:0 "Did Hawaii truly believe that they could walk away from betraying the United States? They must be made an example of and their sugar production put to full use. They will have one opportunity to accept the conditions put onto the vanquished, for that is the fate of traitors who spit on America."
CAL_renovate_california:0 "California Dreaming"
CAL_renovate_california_desc:0 "California can not be allowed to fall on hard times just because of a few bumps in the road!

Hearst Castle will likewise be seeing an expansion to usher in our cultural Golden Age."
CAL_mine_mine_mine:0 "Mining Operations"
CAL_mine_mine_mine_desc:0 "The state needs income and where better to acquire it then the national resources of the Pacific?

A win-win for all involved."
CAL_federal_police:0 "Federal Police"
CAL_federal_police_desc:0 "In a nation overrun with crime and rebels it is clear the older methods of executive enforcement were badly outdated and far too slow to be effective. The Federal Police shall be made up the best of American officers and National Guardsmen, overseen by National Democratic Party militants, ranking above local law enforcement and answering directly to Hearst without question."
CAL_tenney_committee:0 "Tenney Committee"
CAL_tenney_committee_desc:0 "Congressman Jack Tenney is one of the most ardent anti-syndicalist, anti-radical NDP supporters in politics, and as such we should oblige his request to be put in charge of an empowered special committee devoted to investigating and rooting out radicalism, starting with Sinclair's Commonwealth Party."
CAL_demand_respect_from_canada:0 "Demand Canadian Tribute"
CAL_demand_respect_from_canada_desc:0 "Enough of Canada's foolishness! They seize American States and hover over America with predatory eyes, desiring to force us to join their war in Europe at our cost and their benefit, with nothing to show for it. They should contribute to our coffers in return for saving the Pacific, and our borders, from syndicalism."
CAL_nationalize_liquor:0 "Nationalize Liquor"
CAL_nationalize_liquor_desc:0 "While the "Dry" supporters were correct that liquor tended to attract shady elements and cause social instability, it is fairly obvious that passing prohibition on the local and state level has only increased crime. With the state needing additional funds, it is time to implements Hearst's common sense solution to nationalize liquor."
CAL_mexican_border_raids:0 "Mexican Border Raids"
CAL_mexican_border_raids_desc:0 "The bandits that make up the Mexican government believe they can get away with raiding and trafficking across our border, laughing at our supposed inability to strike back. It is time to return the favor and be compensated for our stolen goods."
CAL_tribunals_for_gangsters:0 "Tribunals for Gangsters"
CAL_tribunals_for_gangsters_desc:0 "With the implementation of the Federal Police we must set a more clear code of enforcement for them to follow that is not interfered with by other branches of government.

CAL_executive_construction:0 "Executive Construction Projects"
CAL_executive_construction_desc:0 "America is famous for its massive skyscrapers and sprawling cities. We are a country with vast wealth and resources, and we shall use these to construct the largest and most extravagant structures the world has ever seen. Architects advocating a futurist aesthetic have caught Hearst's eye, and he plans to make these buildings in that image. The cost may be big, but Hearst's vision is bigger."

CAL_national_democrats_win_twice:0 "National Democrats Re-elected"
CAL_national_democrats_win_twice_desc:0 "As to be expected since surviving the coup attempt, William Randolph Hearst has been re-elected without any significant opposition. While some claim his control of the media and political process makes his victory with over 80% of the popular vote deeply suspicious, most are careful not to voice their complaints too loudly."
CAL_naval_project:0 "Aerial Contracts"
CAL_naval_project_desc:0 "We must expand into new and promising industries if we are to encourage a growing economy and a strong national army. Controlling the sky is the way of the future for America and a massive bid for new military fighters will ensure the continued growth and development of Pacific aviation."
CAL_expand_war_powers:0 "Expand War Powers"
CAL_expand_war_powers_desc:0 "How can the president defend the nation if he does not have the power to protect his own people? The President will be given a more direct line of enacting martial law on a local and state level and the army shall yield more strategic power to him and the Federal Police."
CAL_price_setting:0 "Price Setting"
CAL_price_setting_desc:0 "Some of our population still desire a lower price on needed goods such as oil and water, while goods that are exported seem to be undercharging when those goods could stay home. A series of price-setting laws shall set this correct."
CAL_claim_sonora:0 "Sonora Should Be Ours"
CAL_claim_sonora_desc:0 "It seems we have yet to set Mexico completely straight. Baja and Sonora should have been ours after the Mexican-American War and was only not taken due to weakness on the part of Congress but with a strong President the American people shall enjoy these lands."

CAL_spiritualists_in_control_desc:0 "With the Civil War over, we finally control the country in its entirety.

Regardless, we can take solace in the fact that soon, America will be able to fulfill its destiny."
CAL_sane_economy:0 "A Sane Economy"
CAL_sane_economy_desc:0 "The Spiritualist conception of economics is that capitalism, communism, and socialism all seek to enforce total control over their population, and reduce them to slaves. Instead of this treatment, we should strive for economic freedom. This can only be done if the controllers of the economy, from the government to businesses, are sane men." 
CAL_japanese_propaganda:0 "Japanese Propaganda"
CAL_japanese_propaganda_desc:0 "Our alliance with Japan has been accepted by those on the West Coast, who often had a conception of Japan already. However, this is not true nationwide, and we need to convince Americans that Japan is our natural ally. To do so, we will need to use propaganda tying the two nations together, and through this, we shall get our people on board."
CAL_new_media:0 "New Media"
CAL_new_media_desc:0 "During the war, we engaged in a media blackout. After all, the newspapers could not resist writing stories labelling us as conspiracy theorists and the like. Now though, we have the power to create our own media, and place our agents in already existing media. This 'new media' will do a much better job pushing our narrative..."
CAL_shinto_influence:0 "Shinto Influences"
CAL_shinto_influence_desc:0 "Shintoism is extremely different from Christianity or the other main American religions, yet our close ties with Japan have meant that it has increasing influence in the country.

CAL_spiritual_revolution:0 "Spiritual Revolution"
CAL_spiritual_revolution_desc:0 "Demons, the Paranormal, and even UFO's are all around us, yet few have acknowledged their existence. This will no longer be the case.

CAL_rehabilitate_and_indoctrinate:0 "Rehabilitate and Indoctrinate"
CAL_rehabilitate_and_indoctrinate_desc:0 "As much as we may wish to extinguish rebels, it is also true that we need legitimacy.

We have reached out to celebrities, but now we shall reach out to war heroes as well."
CAL_deal_with_csa:0 "Deal with Syndicalists"
CAL_deal_with_csa_desc:0 "The Syndicalists crossed the ocean to come here, and when they arrived, they tried to tear our nation apart. Syndicalism is anti-American; their attempts to control our people, our workers, have not gone unnoticed, and now that we have won the war, we will judge them harshly."
CAL_deal_with_odp:0 "Handle the ODP"
CAL_deal_with_odp_desc:0 "The ODP has some views that we agree with, but they are traitors nonetheless. Furthermore, they insist on the validity of their faith over all others, and we cannot allow that to stand. Let us put the main ODP leaders on trial, and decide how to proceed from there."
CAL_destroy_syndie_parasites:0 "Destroy Syndicalist Parasites"
CAL_destroy_syndie_parasites_desc:0 "The Syndicalist parasite has plagued this nation for too long.

We will eliminate this scourge once and for all."
CAL_destroy_anglophiles:0 "Destroy the Anglophiles"
CAL_destroy_anglophiles_desc:0 "The masters of the Syndicalists, the British monarchy, scheme to the north, looking for any way to snuff out our civilization. Even worse, some of the rebels during the Civil War even embraced Anglo-Saxon culture. The Old Democrats are agents of the British, and as such, must be snuffed out."
CAL_reeducation_effort:0 "Re-education Effort"
CAL_reeducation_effort_desc:0 "The American people are uneducated. Almost noone is aware of our beliefs, and so, it is our job to educate them.

CAL_noi_alliance_japan:0 "Moving Forward with the Peace Movement"
CAL_noi_alliance_japan_desc:0 "With most of our power concentrated along the Pacific coast, it is clear we need local allies to keep the peace. We will make contact with our allies within the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World led by the black nationalist Mittie Gordon. Thanks to their connections with Satokata Takahashi and the Black Dragon Society, the Peace Movement has always remained loyal to Japan. Let us discuss autonomy with our allies in the South."
CAL_restore_elections:0 "Restore 'Elections'"
CAL_restore_elections_desc:0 "One thing that could help us further establish our legitimacy would be to hold "elections". These elections would not be fair by any means, but the mere fact we are holding them would go a long way in the eyes of some. Who will stop us if we count the votes?"
CAL_a_new_era:0 "A New Era"
CAL_a_new_era_desc:0 "Our ideology has spread across America, and millions of people have been successfully converted.

CAL_reduce_subsidies:0 "Reduce Subsidies"
CAL_reduce_subsidies_desc:0 "Subsidies are an example of government overreach. It is difficult to know how much is enough in a subsidy, or if it will benefit either party at all.

CAL_education_campaign:0 "Education Campaign"
CAL_education_campaign_desc:0 "Farm children are often kept out of school, with the excuse that they are needed as hands on the farm. This will no longer be the case.

CAL_tolerance_campaign_desc:0 "What someone drinks or consumes in their time is not the business of the government.

### Social Liberals ###

CAL_efficiency_movement:0 "Efficiency Movement"
CAL_efficiency_movement_desc:0 "30 years ago in the height of the Progressive Era, the Efficiency Movement tried to eliminate superfluous waste from the household and the workplace.

CAL_four_freedoms_desc:0 "Americans enjoy four key freedoms that most of the world lack.

With our Civil War now concluded, we must make sure all our citizens, no matter their skin color or religion, can enjoy these freedoms."
CAL_liberal_unions:0 "Support Liberal Unions"
CAL_liberal_unions_desc:0 "Not all unions are nests of syndicalism. Some actually stand for the betterment of the working class, rather than just advancing the selfish goals of their leaders.

CAL_mathematical_tables_project:0 "Mathematical Tables Project"
CAL_mathematical_tables_project_desc:0 "There is a misconception that the unemployed masses of America are uneducated and lazy. We will prove that this is not true.

CAL_agricultural_adjustment:0 "Agricultural Adjustment Act"
CAL_agricultural_adjustment_desc:0 "There are many ideas for how to help our farmers in this crisis.

CAL_removing_money_from_politics_desc:0 "Money is a cancer that has infected our political system for decades.

CAL_national_electricity:0 "National Electricity"

CAL_power_of_the_ballot:0 "Power of the Ballot"
CAL_power_of_the_ballot_desc:0 "We can no longer allow for the American People to be left out of decisions concerning a government that affects them all.

CAL_wealth_taxation:0 "Wealth Taxation"
CAL_wealth_taxation_desc:0 "We cannot allow America to become a new aristocracy that eliminates divine right of monarchy but replaces it with wealth.

CAL_encourage_temperance:0 "Encourage Temperance"
CAL_encourage_temperance_desc:0 "Overconsumption of liquor is little more than a gateway to poverty, madness, and sloth, and it remains one of the great social ills of our times.

CAL_fair_house_trade:0 "Fair House Standard Trade"
CAL_fair_house_trade_desc:0 "While trade has its place, especially for our farmers whom must export their goods, our workers can not be expected to compete with every nation on earth. It also undermines our cause to accept cheap goods from nations that do not accept similar working conditions. Goods that will lower the wages of our workers will pay a higher tariff."
CAL_protect_strikers:0 "Protect Strikers"
CAL_protect_strikers_desc:0 "Strikers are little more than workers asserting their rights in the face of abysmal working conditions and yet governors, bosses, and judges believe they have the right to make Marxists look vindicated by cracking down on these patriotic Americans. Striking will be recognized as a national right and the army will protect those whom are attacked by industrial goons."
CAL_quota_act:0 "Quota Act"
CAL_quota_act_desc:0 "With all the pressure already laid on American culture and worker wages the last thing we need is large amounts of untrained, cheap laborers pouring over the border. The quota system will put a limit on the number of low-wage immigrants that can come into the nation annually."
CAL_food_stamps:0 "Food Stamps"

CAL_farm_credit_act_desc:0 "The madness of allowing our farms to close, especially in a time of depression, is utterly intolerable!

CAL_support_long_desc:0 "Is Huey Long a man without issue? Of course not; he runs a political machine and has a head the size of Mount Rushmore. However, he is an ally of the progressives in his region and his territory is a stalwart against the authoritarians while his economic policies promise to help break radicalism. We shall do for him what he is attempting to do for America and save him from the loons and cowards whom surround him."

CAL_commonwealth_victory_desc:0 "Sinclair has more than redeemed his 1934 loss of the Epic Plan, successfully distancing himself from the CSA as a promoter of egalitarianism and liberty that will ensure no form of Marxism gains a foothold in our Republic while giving the people what they need."
CAL_radical_taxation:0 "Radical Taxation"
CAL_radical_taxation_desc:0 "Neither the Liberals nor the Progressives go far enough in their tax plans which do little to promote true egalitarianism.

CAL_commodity_credit_corporation_desc:0 "While a depression eats away at our nation, farmers have been hit worse than almost anyone. Our farmers cry out for help, and we shall answer them.

This fundamental group will no longer be ignored."
CAL_fcwa:0 "Federal Civil Works Administration"
CAL_fcwa_desc:0 "Millions of unemployed workers still roam the streets of America. We can fix this by giving these people a simple offer: work in construction to build up our infrastructure and we will make sure you earn a decent wage while doing it. This will significantly decrease unemployment as well as increasing the prosperity of the country as a whole. The newly-created F.C.W.A. will see to this task."
CAL_federal_authority_for_land: "Federal Authority for Land"
CAL_federal_authority_for_land_desc: "With this act, we will create a Bureau of Land Management.

CAL_labor_colonies_desc:0 "From Robert Owen to Charles Fourier, utopian societies and colonies are nothing new in America.

CAL_nationalize_oil:0 "Nationalize Oil"
CAL_nationalize_oil_desc:0 "Oil barons like John D. Rockefeller have ravaged this country for decades. He is perhaps the richest man in history while millions of Americans starve.

CAL_nationalize_communication:0 "Nationalize Communication"
CAL_nationalize_communication_desc:0 "We must go even further than Oil in our nationalization efforts. The telephone, radio, telegraph, and more have all been in private hands for too long.

CAL_pensions:0 "Government Pensions"
CAL_pensions_desc:0 "We will ensure that our elderly loved ones can retire with dignity. No longer will parents be a burden on their children.

CAL_aim_for_the_heart_desc:0 "Though the public did not react as intended to Sinclair's book "The Jungle", his party can now push for the increased workers rights that he was really advocating for in that book.

CAL_hit_the_stomach:0 "Hit the Stomach"
CAL_hit_the_stomach_desc:0 "While somewhat bitter about the reaction to "The Jungle", Sinclair has realized that his readers did have a point.

Legislation will be passed to ensure clean, fresh food for all Americans."
CAL_bread_and_peace:0 "Bread and Peace"
CAL_bread_and_peace_desc:0 "Though Sinclair and his party have distanced themselves from the CSA, perhaps an agreement would be possible. After all, we have many goals in common, and though we may resume conflict at a later date, we should focus our efforts on eradicating reactionaries. It would also be a popular decision with our more left-wing supporters. It's worth a shot..."
CAL_communal_education:0 "Socialize Education"
CAL_communal_education_desc:0 "There are many new ideas that our party has about education. Some advocate for a sort of "communal education", in which children can be raised and educated by their neighbors in addition to their parents.

CAL_social_commonwealth:0 "Commonwealth of Labor"
CAL_social_commonwealth_desc:0 "With the foundation in place, we may finally become a Commonwealth of Labor by incorporating the unemployed into our programs and promoting private coops that do the same.

Private companies will have to learn to either compete or purchase their goods at new government-set prices."
CAL_the_profits_of_religion:0 "The Profits of Religion"
CAL_the_profits_of_religion_desc:0 "While people having private religion is all good and well, many in our movement can not stand the so-called "Megachurches" or those who have made God's House into a marketplace. Churches above a certain size, including the so-called "New Thought" movement often seen in the freakish Spiritualist Party, will pay a small tax."
CAL_support_the_aclu:0 "Support the ACLU"
CAL_support_the_aclu_desc:0 "For too long, the state has been content with violating the civil rights of fellow citizens. No longer! We shall support the American Civil Liberties Union via a tax break, prosecuting violent harassment against them and waging a public campaign on their behalf while agreeing to remain politically neutral in their affairs so they can fight for the rights of all Americans."
CAL_birth_control:0 "The Pivot of Civilization"
CAL_birth_control_desc:0 "While there will be reactionaries who will denounce us, we must nonetheless go on to support the right of women to their own reproductive rights both for the individual and social good. Laws against birth control will be struck down and access to their availability in poorer neighborhoods made easier. In the long term this will aid in encouraging less productive citizens to have fewer children."
CAL_experimental_sciences:0 "Experimental Sciences"
CAL_experimental_sciences_desc:0 "If we are to be truly progressive, we must put our faith in scientific progress!

CAL_radical_crusade:0 "Radical Crusade"
CAL_radical_crusade_desc:0 "The Commonwealth Party has triumphed in two elections, and now has a mandate. We can enact any goals we want, for we have been given approval by the voters themselves. We will take this opportunity to fight alcoholism, gambling, and smoking. These practices damage the moral fabric of our society, and must be crushed."
CAL_support_bellaymism:0 "Reason with the CSA"
CAL_prohibition:0 "Prohibition"
CAL_prohibition_desc:0 "There are few things damaging the working class as much as unfettered capitalism but alcohol may be a close contender. The drink is used by the ruling classes to control their workers, and it destroys their bodies and morals alongside their families. It's time to finally complete the goals of the Anti-Saloon Leagues and illegalize liquor."
CAL_commonwealth_reelection:0 "Commonwealth Dominance"
CAL_commonwealth_reelection_desc:0 "Though many saw a Commonwealth victory as impossible in our first election, it has occurred not once, but twice. Sinclair's party has ridden a wave of popularity into office once again, and promises to continue the work it began four years ago. Having passed significant economic policies, they now turn to the social realm, in the hopes of promoting a more equal society."
CAL_raise_inheritance_tax:0 "Raise Inheritance Tax"
CAL_raise_inheritance_tax_desc:0 "There are those in our society who have millions of dollars that they never toiled to earn. Why should we reward luck while we punish hard work?

CAL_worker_bonds:0 "Worker Bonds"

CAL_reward_productivity:0 "Reward Productivity"
CAL_reward_productivity_desc:0 "We will strive to make sure that no hard working man or woman ever goes hungry again. We shall eliminate poverty and hunger by paying our workers a living wage. It is only natural, given the herculean efforts of American workers in recent years."
CAL_womens_advocacy:0 "Women's Advocacy"
CAL_womens_advocacy_desc:0 "Women make up half of our population, yet they have had little to no representation in our government for it's entire existence. This will no longer be the case. Through the creation of new women's advocacy groups, as well as the passage of new legislation, we can be sure that women will have an equal place in our society."
CAL_selective_immigration:0 "Selective Immigration"
CAL_selective_immigration_desc:0 "We must be careful to protect our workers. One way we can do this is by being selective about immigration, so that bosses don't take advantage of immigrant labor while snubbing domestic workers. This will eliminate yet another loophole that greedy capitalists often use to exploit labor. It will also raise our popularity with more conservative elements of our society."

CAL_power_of_information_desc:0 "Without the political connections established by the Party our hopes of saving the nation never would have been realized.

Hubbard has requested an expansion of our intelligence wing under him to further use espionage to influence Congress and, eventually, the Nation."
CAL_japanese_support:0 "Japanese Support"
CAL_japanese_support_desc:0 "Japan's financial and small loan of men was enough to help us seize the state and establish a far more friendly government to theirs than Hearst was.

CAL_finish_socialism:0 "Finish Socialism"
CAL_finish_socialism_desc:0 "With the political and financial support we needed it is time to end the greatest enemy ever seen to the American Nation, the socialist.

CAL_media_blackout:0 "Media Blackout"
CAL_media_blackout_desc:0 "Despite our attempts to downplay our most controversial beliefs the media continues to undermine us, with many papers calling Bodin and his followers "dictatorial conspiracy theorists". There is too much media hostility undermining us to pick and choose and undoubtedly at least some are being paid by foreign agents, so a total Media Blackout will be necessary with a short term rooting out of dangerous critics."
CAL_christian_mysticism:0 "Christian Mysticism"
CAL_christian_mysticism_desc:0 "It is only common sense that it would be easier to rule over a population with beliefs more in-line with theirs. As such we should shift towards the Mysicalist Christian wing of the Party. We will begin pressuring members to adopt this viewpoint and print the appropriate magazines to quietly spread."
CAL_dianetics:0 "Excalibur"
CAL_dianetics_desc:0 "We can not simply return to failed faiths to save us. A manifesto written by Hubbard, Excalibur, takes New Thought to its logical conclusion in understanding the power of the mind over the body, an invigorating idea to Party members. It may take longer for the population to be won out but after training activists to spread the word of this potential power we shall usher in a new era."
CAL_shadow_recruitment:0 "Shadow Recruitment"
CAL_shadow_recruitment_desc:0 "The Party must continue to be semi-secretive in not only its total beliefs and inner structure but in its recruitment methods. The way to do this is via the training of existing party members to subtly gather recruits among family and friends and to bring them to our new centers which will start them on the Party's Spiritual Journey via new techniques such as "auditing"."
CAL_ufology:0 "Ufology"
CAL_ufology_desc:0 "With our rejection of traditional faith the question of a higher power is on the minds of many inner party members. Thankfully Hubbard also has an answer to this in his outlining of the immortal soul, Thetans, and its descendance from extraterrestials before arriving on Earth. Evidence of E.T.'s will be investigated and its full belief spread among inner-party members."
CAL_the_messengers:0 "The Messengers"

CAL_new_science:0 "New Sciences"
CAL_new_science_desc:0 "We can not afford to be blind to the New Sciences as so many others are if we to defend ourselves. Telekinesis, Psychic Intervention, Ectoplasm and the power of Rockets shall all be investigated as a means of long range warfare against syndicalist and foreign influence, which will also provide official government departments for more Spiritualist Party Members who already practice this."
CAL_supernatural_investigators:0 "Paranormal Investigations"
CAL_supernatural_investigators_desc:0 "If we are to promote Mysticism on the circuit then we need to buffer our claims. Reports of paranormal activity, including some written directly by Bodin, must be spread among party speakers and activists alongside a new Department of the Paranormal that investigates claims of the paranormal and offers to speak with dead relatives to those who request it... at a price."
CAL_celebrity_endorsements:0 "Celebrity Endorsements"
CAL_celebrity_endorsements_desc:0 "Minor celebrities on the L.A. circuit seem open to our beliefs such as mystery writer Arthur J. Burks and Health Publicist Bernarr Macfadden. However bigger names would be of aid and so we shall have McFadden use his connections to the upper class to recruit celebrities into the cause, promising health remedies in return, and at Hubbard's urging the Party will open Celebrity Divisions."
CAL_religion_of_profit:0 "A Most Profitable Religion"
CAL_religion_of_profit_desc:0 "Currently the parties beliefs and hierarchy is very static, with few ways to move up for newcomers. However, there is a means by which one can show loyalty to our eternal movement; monetary donations. These donations would go a long way towards contributing to the cause and allow a way for some to prove their loyalty, as well as helping appeal to the upper-class with promises of secret knowledge and power."
CAL_the_radio:0 "Voice of the Nation"
CAL_the_radio_desc:0 "With little in the way of media information except via government pamphlets, activists and an approved handful of publicists it is time to modernize the Party's means of communication with the public so there may be a more consistent source of news.

CAL_the_redshirt_plot_desc:0 "While there are those of us aware of the connection between the House of Windsor and the syndicalist revolution, and their attempt to retake our nation via false flag operations and foreign operatives, even more are unaware or even worse skeptical.

A committed Pan-Asianist and American patriot who protested interventionist conflict in the Pacific against Japan long before the civil war, Townsend and his like-minded allies like the American soldier turned Buddhist priest John David Provoo will bring unity between Japan and the United States while maintaining our inherently American identity and culture, creating a new multicultural synthesis rooted in Pacific Americanism as we work with our new allies as honourable equals."
CAL_eagle_in_the_sun:0 "The Eagle in the Sun"
CAL_eagle_in_the_sun_desc:0 "In recent times, American diplomatic and economic ties to Asia have largely been held by the Chinese - a godless race of savages, in the eyes of Townsend, who should kneel to their superior Japanese overlords - while Japan itself has largely focused on that useless quagmire, wasting decades of time and focus that could have been better spent somewhere else. Now at the helm of our republic, President Townsend shall work to drive a wedge between Japan and its Chinese allies in Manchuria and along the coast all so that we here in America can take our rightful place as Japan’s truest and most important allies. Together, America and Japan shall be the true heart of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the true frontline for the Pan-Asianist cause."
CAL_pan_pacific_unity:0 "Promote Pan-Pacific Unity"
CAL_pan_pacific_unity_desc:0 "Even long before his ascension to the position of president, Ralph Townsend had always been a fervent supporter of Japan’s Pan-Asian crusade and its idea of total liberation from European hegemony, and now that he commands the wider nation at large, there is nothing stopping him from charging America headlong into the cause. Despite his misgivings against the Chinese, who he believes should be entirely dominated by joint Japanese and American imperialist interests, Townsend is largely fine with all other races and creeds who stand alongside in the Pan-Asian struggle, so long as they bend the knee to Tokyo and Sacramento, so let us work with our new allies and benefactors to spread the Pan-Asian dream not only across all the Pacific, but across all Asia and all America as well, for every citizen in our great nation must know that they too are part of this great Pan-Pacifican dream as well!"
CAL_americanist_appeals:0 "Americanist Appeals"
CAL_americanist_appeals_desc:0 "In order to accrue mass support towards our new benefactors and towards our new direction, we shall make broad Americanist appeals to the public, with sentiments adapted to fit the sensitivities of our new overlords. By pandering to traditionalist values and ideals, old fashion Americana culture, and other forms of low-hanging patriotism, we shall ingratiate the populace not only to our own government, but to the government of the Japanese Empire as well as we work to create a syncretic culture that is inherently American while also fully and naturally included within the great struggle. Each and every American must learn that they too are part of the great dream of Pan-Asian and Pan-Pacifican unity and prosperity pushed forth by the great Co-Prosperity Sphere, so let us join hands and make this land of ours a true paradise for all true sons and daughters of America while fully welcoming and thanking our allies in Tokyo along the way.

Thornburg’s cunning expertise and acumen in business will help bring profits to our new Pacific holding unlike ever seen before, while Thornburg’s own orientalist knowledge accrued from his dealings in the Middle East shall allow us to grow our economic reach across wider Asia and beyond."

While the 'partnership' between the Pacific States and the Japanese Empire is quite lopsided, Thornburg has been hard at work with finding the means to practically purchase more autonomy and respect from the Land of the Rising Sun. What the Japanese war machine is eternally thirsty for is oil, and utilizing his connections to Standard Oil Thornburg seems all but assured that he can present an irresistible offer to the Japanese.\n\nAmerican oil can flow to the East, fueling the march of the IJA across Asia, while Japanese funds will find their way into Thornburg and his subordinates' pockets and thus aid the recovery of the American people. Further, the deal will show the Japanese that the Americans are plenty useful under the management of Thornburg, thus sparing our people a more authoritarian hand from Tokyo."

The likes of Mitsubishi, Yasuda, Sumitomo, Mitsui, and the rapidly growing Nissan will be invited to heal us from our economic ailments while Ford and Vanderbilt seem more than content to just watch America burn. With the wealth and technological expertise of Japanese companies, we can kickstart the Pacific into a new round of prosperity that will make our people just feel a bit more confident in the regime.\n\nThe memories of the Great Depression, where our own corporations failed as they endlessly bickered and competed against one another, will be washed away in a tide of investments that come direct from Nippon.

For the safety of Pacific shipping, and to solidify the Pacific State's uses to the Empire of Japan, [CAL.GetLeader] has decreed that a new revitalization effort must be undertaken in our dockyards.\n\nThe ports of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and all else will militarize themselves under the admiral's watchful gaze, producing armed vessels for Americans and Japanese alike. Not only will the Pacific's new guardian be further empowered to protect the maritime routes it now controls, but its responsibilities will be lessened as the Pacific States grows more able to defend itself in naval matters. It is a situation that all can benefit from, and any hushed remarks that the IJN will just use the new ports to keep a permanent hold on the region are silenced as treasonous conspiracy."

CAL_denounce_race_hatred_desc:0 "Though we are still developing comprehensive racial policies, we should send a message to our people.

During the Wilson and Palmer administrations the Klan experienced a major rebirth and then decided to join the would-be tyrant William H. Murray. We should use the laws to make sure that these terrorist traitors do not find any rest within America. Of course some believe we should focus on reconciliation with former members on only crackdown on those whom are actively plotting against the state."

pacificstates.62.t:0 "The Immigration Debate"
pacificstates.62.d:0 "The situation the Federal Government arrived at when the Pacific States was created did not offer us time to clarify the policy of immigration. This meant that a deal being planned by the Department of Labor to allow for Mexican labor temporary work rights in the United States was frozen for a time. Now that elections have been held and Democrat power retained, we can now address this concern. This program proposed by the Department of Labor was meant to alleviate the west's employment shortage and was supported by the Republicans. Now traditionally our party line is to respect the Alien Exclusion act and the rights of natural born American workers to determine the direction of the economy, but our employment shortage is that much greater as we struggle to reclaim America. Perhaps we should allow this through?"
pacificstates.62.a:0 "Yes, we need the labor."
pacificstates.62.b:0 "No, our ideals take precedence."

pacificstates.63.t:0 "Hollywood Bookkeeping"
pacificstates.63.d:0 "The decision to promote true American values with a closer relationship with Hollywood seemed smart initially. However, the glitz and glamor of Hollywood shady accounting practices that confound our ability to measure returns. Patriotic productions privately financed receive royalties out of gross sales, which have been very high. However, the deal we accepted was on profits, which appear to be next to nothing. This inconsistency needs to be renegotiated, and the studios be told that such creative accounting cannot fly with the American government!"

pacificstates.64.t:0 "Pacific Movement of the Eastern World Uncovered"
pacificstates.64.d:0 "We initially thought that our intelligence service was over-reactive when they warned us of Japanese infiltration, but this revelation justifies the time spent. Our of our new West Coast operations, agents uncovered pamphlets sent to prominent Japanese and African American leaders questioning the validity of our government. These pamphlets were traced to an organization called the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World, whose leadership appears to advocate in favor of a Pacific Japanese Alliance that advocates for unrestricted imperial growth of Japan in Asia. This organization appears to target non-Chinese ethnic minorities with promises of greater social freedom. We have arrested the conspirators, but we were unable to tie them to the Japanese embassy surprisingly."
pacificstates.64.a:0 "What a strange group."

pacificstates.65.t:0 "Communalism and the Latter-Day Saints Church"
pacificstates.65.d:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-Day Saints, better known as Mormons, have expressed sentiments in recent months to strengthen the ideals of Communalism within the church in order to counter the sway of syndicalism. Notably the Church has come out with a faith-based welfare program, called coincidentally enough the Church Welfare Program, to help provide for support for fellow Mormons, furthermore the program calls for more Bishop Storehouses to be created. Due to the churches influence in the western states, this has also translated into increased support for their policies."

pacificstates.73.d:0 "'This morning I came, I saw and I was conquered, as everyone would be who sees for the first time this great feat of mankind. Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.' Thus begins [CAL.GetLeader]'s Speech dedicating the creation of Boulder Dam that has finally been completed today."

The first proposal is that the railroads will be nationalized but not the cars allowing for private businesses to compete among themselves for customers, while the second plan would include the cars in the nationalisation. Which version shall Congress go with?"

pacificstates.2000.d.a:0 "In a bid to help jumpstart the economy while also supporting the war effort, the Belfast Beverage Company situated in San Francisco has recently announced the release of their new soda-pop, dubbed Belfast Root Beer. Exploding in popularity all up and down the West Coast, Belfast Root Beer has become the drink of the Pacific States, and has even begun to hotly sell with our foreign trading partners in Japan and across the Entente, stimulating our civilian economy. In a bid to increase the national spirits, the Belfast Beverage Company even struck a deal with the Pacific Government, providing the new soda-pop as part of the military rations allotted to our troops on the frontline fighting radicalism in the Second American Civil War. This move has proven to be a smashing success, with troops across the Rockies finding refreshment in these sugary brown suds - a cold yet all too quick reprieve from the horrors of war. Commonly nicknamed ‘Mug’ by the troops, - a shorthand pseudonym for the drink coined by the boys of the ‘Berkeley Bulldogs’ infantry division and spread throughout the army - these root beer rations have increased soldier morale as well as the public’s opinion towards both our government and the brewing company, while the recent sales have provided a small boon to our economy. It is small slices of Americana like this that help us forget the war, if just briefly, as we fight on another day in order to safeguard American democracy."

In a bid to increase the national spirits, the Belfast Beverage Company even struck a deal with our government, providing the new soda-pop as part of military rations allotted to our troops on the border with our former brothers in America.

pacificstates.101.d:0 "The case involving the marriage of Andrea Perez to Sylvester Davis has finally reached the Supreme Court. Andrea Perez is classified as White while Sylvester Davis is considered Negro as per the US Census. However, California's law forbids "All marriages of white persons with Negroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal and void" and that "no license may be issued authorizing the marriage of a white person with a Negro, mulatto, Mongolian or member of the Malay race". Consequently county clerk W. G. Sharp followed California Law and refused to give them their marriage licenses.\n\nHowever, Perez with the help of their lawyer, Daniel G. Marshall, brought forth a writ of Writ of Mandamus. Within the trial, one of the arguments that was brought up was the fact that both Perez and Davis were Catholic and wanted a Catholic Marriage that included mass. By denying them the license, they stated that the state was depriving them of the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony.\n\nHowever, the fate of their case is within the hands of the Supreme Court. What shall be decided?"

pacificstates.102.d:0 "In Los Angles news has been made of José Gallardo Díaz, who was recently found murdered near a swimming hole in Commerce, near LA. However, what made the story more newsworthy was the case of the men who are accused of murdering the man. The LA Police found a gang of 17 Men, of Mexican-American descent, nearby and believe that they are responsible for the crime. This has attracted something of a media circus as activists have tried to protest the actions claiming that these men are not the killer and are innocent, the fact that there is insufficient evidence to link them. Despite this nine of them were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison, with the rest being imprisoned in Los Angeles County jail.\n\nThe case has generated much animosity within the white populace towards Mexican-Americans, not helped by the fact that both the Police and the Press have characterized all Mexican Youths as 'pachuco hoodlums and baby gangsters.'"

pacificstates.103.d:0 "With the war going on, rations have been imposed upon the public. Despite this, some within the Mexican-American Community fount this by wearing Zoot Suits that use materials that are needed for the war effort. Many White Americans regard wearing the Zoot Suit as a sign of criminality and loose morals. Tensions have continued in Los Angeles to rise till they exploded into violence. Soldiers and Sailors beat and engaged in rioting against the Mexicans. Meanwhile, the local press tended to praise the Sailors and Soldiers of 'having a cleansing effect to rid Los Angeles of Miscreants and Hoodlums'. One journalist on the scene, Carey McWilliams, wrote:\n\n'Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theaters, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy'"

The report concluded that Racism was clearly at the centre of the riots as well as stating 'an aggravating practice (of the media) to link the phrase zoot suit with the report of a crime.' The governor of California appointed the Peace Officers Committee on Civil Disturbances, chaired by Robert W. Kenny, president of the National Lawyers Guild to make recommendations to the police.

After a year and a half of experimentation and some cooperation with colleagues in Europe, a working atomic bomb is ready to be tested.

Yankees phenomenon and San Francisco native Joe DiMaggio has come home to play for his hometown Seals, now facing a very strong San Diego Padres team headlined by a young Ted Williams and Joe's brother Vince for the championship.

After the success of the Pacific Coast League over the past few seasons, many major league teams are now deciding to abandon their destroyed stadiums and move westward, taking advantage of the west coast's relatively unscathed counterparts. The first team to announce such a move were the New York Giants to San Francisco, soon followed by the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles. Both teams have a storied following and fans in their new cities have taken to them immediately, and it looks like other teams will soon follow suit. As of now, though, many other east coast teams are deciding to stay put, such as the storied Yankees who are now the only remaining team in New York."

Joe DiMaggio, who returned to New York after the conclusion of the war, has had a breakout year, hitting safely in an unprecedented 56 consecutive games- a record unlikely to ever be broken. Even as the Dodgers are coming into this series the clear underdog, many Los Angeles fans are believing they can pull it off.

Much of their success was due to recent acquisition Joe Medwick from St. Louis, who out-hit DiMaggio throughout the entire series. A close call occurred in game four, when Dodgers catcher Mickey Owen nearly made an error that cost them the game but the Dodgers recovered one play later, ending the game and securing momentum for the eventual Los Angeles victory.

This unspoken contract between the people and their government has been violated by General Douglas MacArthur. In deposing the democratically-elected president in the name of 'preserving stability', he shattered the founding principles of our great nation. The destruction of the healthy civil-military relationship that has marked America since independence is a grievous slight to all the values we hold as a nation.\n\nIn response, the governors of California, Washington, and Oregon have issued a joint declaration condemning the General’s actions, and demanding his immediate withdrawal from Washington.

Claiming that MacArthur’s overthrow of the government was illegitimate, a new election would be held to select a new president - albeit amongst a limited slate of candidates in the Pacific region. Still, according to Merriam, whoever won this election would still have more legitimacy than MacArthur, and would be tasked with overseeing the return of the nation to democracy - by force, if needs be."

This escalated into widespread rioting across many Western cities, with Seattle in particular descending into violence. Longshoremen and teamsters broke into Seattle city hall, and proclaimed the city loyal to Haywood’s workers republic in Chicago.

While some of the ships in Naval Base San Diego were transferred to the East Coast after the first signs of unrest, many remained - along with sailors from across the country. Details are sketchy, but it appears a base commander, on orders from Washington, ordered sailors to take weapons from the base armory and head into the city. Deploying themselves at polling places, they prevented poll workers from setting up. When morning came, large mobs surrounded these soldiers, and began pelting them with rocks, bottles, and other debris. One of the sailors, hit by a bottle, fired back, and soon the city descended into chaos.\n\nCalifornia National Guard units were deployed, and pitched street battles between sailors loyal to MacArthur and the Guardsmen erupted, turning the tranquil city into a war zone."

Another party to re-arise is the old Progressive Party, which has existed in various forms but has now absorbed largely progressive republicans alongside various social democrats. The most radical ticket on the left by far however is Upton Sinclair's Commonwealth party, functionally a more formal recreation of the EPIC ticket from 1932 and which promises a partially planned economy with regards to land and businesses that are believed to be 'idle', gaining support from both left democrats and the right-wing of the socialist party.

However the public questioning went haywire when Hughes turned around the questions onto his inquisitor, Jack Tenney, by asking him if he had been helping Hearst corner the newspaper market despite Hearst now being a public official. Likewise he accused Hearst and his men such as Tenney and John Z. Anderson of engaging in lobbying efforts on behalf of the California-subsidiary of the Bethel corporation to focus on ship-building contracts despite the war taking place on the same continent. It made it especially difficult to demonize Hughes as he readily admitted to lobbying but said it was not only a common practice but that Tenney and Hearst were corrupt hypocrites and unlike them he never lobbied for a cause he didn't believe in."

pacificstates.237.d:0 "With the government moving in on controlling natural resources the owners of Shell and Edison have come to us requesting that they have a place at the table, being allowed to manage those companies with government protection in return for providing communities cheap goods. They note that if they have economies of scale they could provide far lower costs than competitors. While this would make them de facto monopolies it can't be that the idea of having our cake and eating it too is quite tempting as we will be giving citizens access to cheaper goods without having to get into managing such industries directly."

When payments are not made they simply take everything of value they can from the villages. Those suspected of being bandits involved in past raids on the US border have been arrested and taken to the US to work off their debts.

This is absurd and is little more than a cloaked demand for tribute but perhaps it would be better to pay him when we have larger targets to attack?

An idea that has been flouted by some columnists and small activists is the Pacific States staying away from the 'tyrants' of the East by becoming an independent nation. As the most influential men in the nation they could easily include such sentiments in their speech and begin steering Congress towards such a view but some in the cabinet believe we should not give up our claims on the East."

However the Small Business League has far more popular support and is requesting support to help them produce consumer goods and jobs. Finally there is the Motor Industry, especially the suffering Moreland Motor Truck Company, whom desire a California far more reliant on automobiles.

pacificstates.255.d:0 "A new Disney film is in theatres that is damaging the reputation of Syndicalism while supporting our own government. The film presents an extremely negative view of the Combined Syndicates presenting them as filling the heads of youth with revolutionary ideals but not before making sure no process of parenting is 'reactionary'. After teaching children about the evils of capitalism they are sent off to fight in war at extremely young ages, used as little more than canon fodder for the syndicalist cause. Presenting Syndicalism as conflict oriented and militant, it is praised by critics despite the CSA decrying it as lies."

pacificstates.256.d:0 "A new Disney production once again does what should have been done long ago and presents an amusing animated short for children to enjoy at the expense of the Constitutional Republic of America. It starts with Donald Duck humorously para-dropping into Northern Florida and narrowly escaping being eaten by alligators.

It depicts Donald Duck awakening to a military march outside his home by fanatical federalist supporters before being forced to go to work building armaments for them. It pokes fun at MacArthur's perceived authoritarianism, claims of upholding democracy, and militarism. The short ends with Donald waking up from this nightmare in San Francisco, thanking God that he lives in the Pacific States."

pacificstates.259.t:0 "Comic Codes Authority"
pacificstates.259.d:0 "With our campaign against immorality, the Comic Codes Authority has been founded by the Comic Book industry to carve out much of the 'smut' that makes up modern entertainment. It bans profanity, obscenity, smut, seduction, vulgarity, nudity, horror, excessive bloodshed, gory or gruesome crimes, depravity, lust, sadism, masochism, walking dead, torture, vampires and vampirism, ghouls, cannibalism, werewolfism, depictions of criminals in any positive light, the negative display of authority figures, and more. They also ban the words "horror" and "terror" in their titles, which has been met with accusations that it's an attempt by John Goldwater and other figures at Archie Comics, the main force behind the CCA, to put their rivals out of business. Nonetheless it is an attack on immorality and one that is not officially government as any comic that does not abide by it will simply not be given a CCA sticker."

They pay workers extra, both in money and benefits, for being socially responsible, while threatening to penalize individuals whom are socially irresponsible. This can range from abandoning children to drug use. While the extra benefits they provide workers are popular, some take issue with what they see as business leaders influencing their workers lives but their can be no doubt it is leading to positive social effects."
pacificstates.261.a:0 "A positive event"

pacificstates.263.t:0 "Harry Bridges arrested"
pacificstates.263.d:0 "Pacific syndicalist leader Harry Bridges was arrested today, which will likely result in him being deported from the states given his birth in Australasia. While we have successfully captured many syndicalist leaders whom occupied a legal grey area, Bridges capture was considered necessary as he was utterly pro-CSA and an effective organizer, and as such his arrest will disrupt syndicalist activities."
pacificstates.263.a:0 "Good"

pacificstates.264.t:0 "Defense Attorney's Attacked"
pacificstates.264.d:0 "The defense attorneys assigned to defend various syndicalist defendants accused of spying for the CSA or internal sabotage have been attacked in recent days.

Apparently a journalist went undercover to investigate the state of mental hospitals where women found to be anti-social or otherwise mentally unfit were sent and the result was a horror story, with the story claiming that many of the women there merely violated a law but were mentally sound.

pacificstates.269.d:0 "Hollywood has long been suspected of housing some syndicalist supporters who seek to use modern media to sneak their insidious messages. This has been all but confirmed now as a list of Hollywood screenwriters and directors affiliated with the IWW and its allies was publicly released in papers such as Variety, leading to legal investigation.

pacificstates.270.t:0 "Hollywood Blacklist"
pacificstates.270.d:0 "There is a large-scale blowback to supposed leftist influence in Hollywood, with many executives viewing it as confirmation that striking and otherwise unruly workers are syndicalist agitators. As such the Motion Pictures Alliance for Defending American Ideals has been founded as a win of the MPA with the goal of investigating radical influence in Hollywood. Those uncovered for their sympathies, now including mega-star Charlie Chaplin, have been placed on a 'Blacklist' that virtually excludes them from work. Of course, some view this as a 'betrayal' of our ideals and are calling on us to not give the idea congressional support."

pacificstates.272.t:0 "Protests!"
pacificstates.272.d:0 "Liberal university students guided by student organization and leftist faculty members have begun protesting what they consider increasing censorship within society, kickstarted by university professors being sacked for refusing to take loyalty oaths. They accuse the government of being little different from MacArthur, an absurd claim given that the universities enacted moral codes without being forced to. Nonetheless is can not be denied that there are fewer books in the library, greater screening of the political views of faculty and a general trend towards greater monitoring of students. Journalists are sympathetic to them whom call us "pearl clutchers" , so it may increase support to talk university faculty into reversing some of their codes. Of course, while many of the faculty and students are Left Democrats it is an open secret some have syndicalist sympathies, something that could make it easy to simply attack them."

For the low price of $$200, Families across the county will be able to experience entertainment currently only available at cinemas with all the convenience of using a home radio. Although there are not a lot of programs to watch on this new entertainment medium, some of the major players in the radio business are moving in along with DuMont himself establishing a new television network.

pacificstates.275.t:0 "International Film making explodes"
pacificstates.275.d:0 "Our lowering taxation and promotion of cinema alongside market advancements in technology has left Hollywood with far more income than usual and has allowed them to produce a larger slew of films. Now the Department of Commerce has relayed to us that film making has never been more popular and with it Republican ideals and pro-American sentiments. And of course California locals more than welcome the additional work available on sets as well."
pacificstates.275.a:0 "Wonderful!"

pacificstates.276.t:0 "Panic!"
pacificstates.276.d:0 "It appears that private investors have become concerned with market investments in these unstable times! The rumors spreading that our military has questionable loyalties to radical ideologies are nonsense but with the overvaluing of already risky investments of those already using their new income and market prospects rather unwisely has nonetheless caused investors to pull funds out of the stock market in the fear of collapse. It will take a bit of time to recover, though it should when it becomes clear that these conspiracy theories are not real."

It is little secret that Hearst is considered a MacArthur loyalist and desires the downfall of our government, especially after his taxes were hiked. The question is if this is enough to have him investigated for treacherous activity or if doing so would stray too far into authoritarianism.

pacificstates.311.t:0 "American Guide Series"
pacificstates.311.d:0 "A project founded alongside our Federal One Project, the American Guide Series hires formerly unemployed writers and historians to write about the history of various states, localities and America.

pacificstates.313.t:0 "Temperance Fountains"
pacificstates.313.d:0 "Several local progressive governments have founded Temperance Fountains to encourage fighting alcoholism for drinking clean alcohol instead, often decorating it with pro-prohibition artwork. However, its effects on discouraging drinking appears very marginal, and many consider the decorations quite ugly, provoking the occasional vandalism."

pacificstates.314.t:0 "Liberty Lobby Growth"
pacificstates.314.d:0 "As a result of our increasing taxation, the Liberty Lobby has seen growth in recent days, with more businessmen, Democrats and Republicans railing against our government.

pacificstates.315.d:0 "We are no longer just a ragtag group of Western Progressives; we have brought Progressives, Liberals, and Leftists from across the nation into our party and are now the strongest party in the country.

pacificstates.316.b:0 "Leave them be"

pacificstates.317.t:0 "Land Compensation"
pacificstates.317.d:0 "While our repossession of idle land via taxation and eminent domain is perfectly within our legal right some are calling it immoral to do so without greater compensation leading to resentment from farmers flocking to the Progressive and Democratic parties. It has also left us as an easy target to the Republican papers that flow through much of California. Perhaps we should inject some more cash into the hands of those whom owned the land?"

pacificstates.319.t:0 "Religious Conservatives Organize"
pacificstates.319.d:0 "Religious conservatives in the Pacific States are organizing under the tent of the Society Against Vice, which is appealing especially to many Democratic voters. Our policy of easing access to contraceptives and abortion angered practicing Catholics in our region and now that "Sister" Aimee Semple McPherson's church is being taxed the two have combined political forces to oppose us. However progressives are supportive of our policies, believing it will lead to a more stable, intelligent society. Naturally, this has polarized our cultural sphere as voters shift to either the left or right on social issues."

pacificstates.321.d:0 "We have at long last had a breakthrough in our experimental sciences after many dead ends! Actress Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil have advanced the Hopping Spread Spectrum Communication Technique which allows for more advanced forms of encryption by making it far more difficult for our foes to jam the signal, especially regarding navy technology. Already they are being awarded the Presidential Award of Freedom and are likely to be nominated for a Nobel Prize. "

pacificstates.323.t:0 "CSA Policy"
pacificstates.323.d:0 "We can not sympathize with the CSA's desire to overthrow the constitution and implement a syndicalist government, but the fact they feel they are a state for workers and their rights is far more sympathetic.

pacificstates.325.t:0 "Capital Flight"
pacificstates.325.d:0 "Many capitalists are showing their true colors by fleeing the PSA in favor of either Canada or even the WCC, supporting them over us as retaliation for our economic policies. This has made for free propaganda against them however, but nonetheless has come with some major costs as we decide what to do with the industries they liquidated before fleeing. Managing it directly would help make them useful sooner although others believe it would be more in-line with our ideology to create coops of production of need out of these remaining industries, as a precursor to our more large scale plans."

pacificstates.326.t:0 "Industrial Unions endorse us!"
pacificstates.326.d:0 "The industrial unions that we have expanded are officially endorsing our government over others, even ones that formally had syndicalist tendencies. Likewise, union organizers have been better organizing others whom benefit from our programs, such as those who live in our coops, so that they can vote effectively. Their alliance with members of the middle-class whom favor us has made us a powerful coalition indeed."
pacificstates.326.a:0 "Great!"
pacificstates.326.b:0 "Be careful to keep our distance from Syndicalists though"

pacificstates.327.t:0 "Mexican Resistance"
pacificstates.327.d:0 "Mexican Foreigners and their descendants who are being forcibly deported from our borders are predictably enraged, with many protesting our recent efforts and some even joining radical organizations.

If we were to accept such a deal, we would be totally subservient to the Japanese, removing any last shred of independence we have left, but in return we would be treated as near equals to their undeniable might, raising us above most others in the Co-Prosperity Sphere as Japan’s most favored subject and ally. Is untold prosperity and security worth sacrificing the last shreds of Americanism as we progress towards total domination under the wise and benevolent guidance of Tokyo? The final decision is left up to our regime, though with Japan already so closely intertwined with our regime here and already holding most of the power, many wonder if we even truly have a say."

pacificstates.366.d:0 "Finally, after a long pacification campaign and rigorous Japanization policies, the Pacific States of America is finally beginning to bend to the will of the Chrysanthemum Throne. As our military administration and its civilian arm continue to spread the influence of our Rising Sun, many have begun to toy with the idea of fully incorporating the Pacific States as part of the wider Empire, placing a member of the royal family atop a newly created puppet-throne. However, such a move would likely anger our American subjects even further, and could even put the safety of the royal chosen in jeopardy. Conversely, going through with this plan would put us one step closer to fully dominating these new foreign subjects and these rich new lands as we ever-endeavor to spread our influence and the influence of the Crown.

pacificstates.350.t:0 "California Spiritualists request our aid?"
pacificstates.350.d:0 "The "Spiritualists" in California are loosely-organized right-wing group opposed to British Imperialism and Socialism, and claim they seek our aid against both. With their intelligence operations becoming increasingly sophisticated they desire a trade of information, monetary support and a pledge of aid. While many in our government fervently support the idea of undermining the anti-Eastern and imperialistic Hearst in favor of possible allies they do not have a firm grasp of the situation as of yet and in fact them coming to power is unlikely.

pacificstates.3500.t:0 "Bodin Working with Japan?"
pacificstates.3500.d:0 "We have received reports that Japanese intelligence services are working with the Spiritualist Party's leadership, ostensibly for shared 'anti-syndicalist' purposes. Of course Japan may well be interested in instilling itself in our politics, perhaps in response to our recent saber-rattling. While Hearst is famously paranoid of Japan the Spiritualists are still useful for aid in domestic intelligence and the collaboration, even if wholly true, likely means little. What should we do?"
pacificstates.3500.a:0 "Yank their funding"

pacificstates.351.t:0 "Spiritualist Counter-Coup!"
pacificstates.351.d:0 "From L.A. Edward Longstreet Bodin, leader of the increasingly organized Spiritualist Party, has made a radio announcement that William Randolph Hearst has been overthrown by treacherous foreign agents within the army. Naming George Marshall and Henry Arnold as the leaders of the conspiracy against the 'democratically-elected President of the Pacific States', Bodin accused them of taking orders from the King in Ottawa whom sought to destroy Hearst for opposing Anglo-Syndicalism. Declaring his intentions to push back against these traitors he says Japan is willing to aid in the counter-attack against foreign powers and has gifted the Spiritualists a small garrison to support their militias, remaining Federal Police and all those who would rise with them against British Anarchism. While our loyalists would likely be able to defeat these forces the fact that the coup is not going as swiftly as planned has endangered the whole plan, with members of Congress and Spiritualist-connected politicians denouncing us and General DeWitt likely to oppose us with his own forces, we may have to look at fleeing to the safety of the Entente via the sea."

pacificstates.352.t:0 "Battle of Bakersfield!"
pacificstates.352.d:0 "Our garrison holding Bakersfield has been attacked by General DeWitt, supported by an auxiliary of Japanese troops and militants! Losses are heavy on both sides and we are losing public support rapidly, but while a tactic defeat in that we had to retreat to the Lost Hills we should expect success if we counter-attack, with our opponents having exhausted their best men. Nonetheless, this would incur even more losses and could leave us even less popular, with some of our cabinet preferring to retreat rather than cause more damage to California."

pacificstates.3520.d:0 "We have selected certain figures from the various rebel factions to rehabilitate. From the American Union State, we have decided to try and bring Pelley under our wing, as he has expressed certain mystic beliefs in the past and it may be that he could be made to believe in our doctrines. From the Constitutional American Republic, there is George S. Patton. Patton is a controversial figure due to how many Americans he was responsible for killing, whether it was direct or not, during the Civil War. However, he is also fairly popular, and sparing him would be a good choice. He has also expressed an interest in various religions and in the mystical realm as a whole, so perhaps he would be a good candidate for conversion. We could also rehabilitate both of these men, though this would be less popular, or we could jail both, which is likely the most popular option. Regardless, if we do rehabilitate these men, we will place them in charge of their own parties, though these parties will not have any real power. Instead, they will serve as figureheads that further legitimize our regime."

pacificstates.3521.d:0 "It is time for us to spread our beliefs across the United States, but we must decide how this should be done. The Spiritualists who are sympathetic to Japan argue that we should have aim propaganda towards the masses, as conversion is the most direct way to spread our influence. The other Spiritualists are somewhat divided, but generally agree that some sort of miracle should be achieved in order to convert the masses. Some wish to see an investment in rocket technology, in the hopes of gaining a better understanding of U.F.O.'s and perhaps joining them among the stars someday. There are others who reject this idea and instead insist that we should focus on radio technology for the benefits it will have in paranormal investigations. Such technology would allow us to detect the paranormal and perhaps even communicate with them. Our most religious supporters insist that we emphasize our religious doctrine in contrast to other faiths such as Christianity or Islam, particularly our faith's American roots as compared with these other religions. How should we proceed?"

The charges are many, but the most damning ones are of treason to the American government, constitution, and people. These men and women were brainwashed by foreign syndicalists and proceeded to kill many of their fellow citizens. Further, they were the worst of the rebels, as they aimed to completely change our way of life to fit their greed. As such, there will be no pardoning for these parasites, but we still must decide what to do with them. Ultimately, the jury has decided to....."

Now that the war is over, however, it is time we decided what to do with them. We are on equal footing now, and can make certain demands. The question is, what do we ask for? Some argue that we should ask for full control over Hawaii, which was, after all, American territory before the war. Regardless of who owns the island chain, combined Japanese and American pressure would surely force it back into American hands, should it come to that. Others believe it would suffice to repay them for their help during the conflict and otherwise leave the relationship as it was before the war. Of course, hardliners insist that we go further than these half-measures. What should we do?"

He also announced that he would be sending out arrest warrants for those whom were proven to have connections to Canada, the coup, and foreign syndicalism. While their allies within Congress and those most concerned about the coup supported the decision, much of Congress remained silent to the decision.

Winter suggested that it may have been a figure that could pass through walls and appear invisible to outside observers. Parsons believes this is nonsense, instead arguing that aliens had been listening in and leaked the meeting to the press. In any case, we must find the mole in our administration, for we have not yet fully converted the American people, and they cannot know the full extent of our regime yet. What should we do?"

pacificstates.3534.t:0 "New Archaeology and Historiography"
pacificstates.3534.d:0 "As early as the nineteenth century, it was speculated that the Mississippian mysterious mound builders belonged to a lost white race. This meant that in the past there had been contacts between the old world and the pre-Columbian Americas. Thesis was rejected after 1890 after the work of Cyrus Thomas. Other researchers ware still interested in this topic. American archaeologist Augustus Le Plongeon 'proved' Maya connections with ancient Egypt and Europe and reconstructed a detailed but fanciful story of Queen Moo and Prince Coh of Maya Empire. Russian Colonel Braghine in his book from 1938 'The Shadow of Atlantis' claimed that the Carib people have reports and legends of a white bearded man whom they called Tamu or Zune who had come from the East, taught the people agriculture and later disappeared in an easterly direction. Braghine also claimed Manco Cápac (founder of the Inca civilization) was a white bearded man. The white man was to come to America and be remembered by the locals as a god (Viracocha in the Andes region of South America, Quetzalcoatl or Kukulkan among Aztec or Mayans etc.). Other scientists were more restrained and limited themselves only to pointing to past contacts between Europeans and Americans. Mysterious finds (such as small terracotta head sculpture, with a beard and European-like features, was found in 1933 in the Toluca Valle near Mexico City), legends (about Irish missionaries) or Sagas (colonization of Vinland) were highlighted. Will we spread the Truth about the White Man's presence in America in the old days? Or Will we keep these facts silent?"

However the representatives of Japan have made it repeatedly clear that they want us to keep this private, worrying we would undermine whatever support we have. While defying Japan would be dangerous, Hubbard has proposed a model in which the Party would have a self-contained religion that can slowly spread propaganda, rather than transparently putting its many beliefs forward with the exception of expanding the Redshirt Conspiracy."

The choices are namely between Max Thornburg, the practical leader of Standard Oil Pacific who is Japan's primary ally in the business community and the more tolerable choice for Pacificans, and Ralph Townsend, who is more ideologically aligned with Japan, insisting whites and the Japanese are both racially superior to those it colonizes in the East and admiring its form of government.

pacificstates.359.t:0 "Bodin Dead!"
pacificstates.359.d:0 "A tragedy has befallen the Pacific as the Leader of the Spiritualist Party and President of the Pacific, Edward Longstreet Bodin, is dead. His expected successor L. Ron Hubbard has already come out claiming that new forms of syndicalist warfare were used to brainwash a subordinate of his into gunning down Bodin in his bedroom and they will find the assassin in little time. Although L. Ron Hubbard was expected to be elected the unambiguous new leader of the Spiritualist Party by the inner-circle and then, of course, Congress, an unexpected dark horse candidate has thrown their hat in the ring, causing much chaos within Hubbard’s own clique and the wider ‘election’ process at large. Bernarr Macfadden, a longtime friend and spiritualist associate of Bodin, is what can be best described as a physical fitness and sexual health-focused esotericist with a platform focus on bodybuilding, nutritional health and intermittent fasting, vegetarianism and raw foodism, grape therapy or ampelotherapy and other alleged quackery, sexual liberation and free love, new age religion in the form of his own Cosmotarianist philosophy, and wider physical culture. Spreading his ideas across the nation using a marketing platform hinging around the creation and spread of his many magazine and pulp journal publications and his ‘healthatorium’ gyms while being aided by his publicist Fulton Oursler, Macfadden may hail from New Jersey, but his reach across America is nearly all-reaching, with Bodin and much of the inner circle being card-carrying members of the Bernarr Macfadden Foundation themselves already. Aided by a clique including himself and Oursler, as well as other fitness gurus and strongmen of physical culture living in America like Lionel Strongfort, Benedict Lust, Milo Hastings, and Gilman Low, Macfadden’s personal politics are a mix of his own strange physically-focused philosophy, the temperance philosophy of Sylvester Graham and the physical culture, and Bodin’s spiritualism and theosophy mixed with a varied grab-bag of disconnected progressive, populist, left libertarian, environmentalist, and communalist ideas drawn from the likes of the Roosevelts, EPIC, the Lermondites and La Follettes, and beyond all shoved into one barely cohesive whole. With Macfadden now posing a serious threat to Hubbard’s shot at the leadership position in Bodin’s absence, a final choice must be made within Bodin’s old inner circle as to who shall lead the Spiritualist Party going forward."

pacificstates.3591.t:0 "Getting Physical with Macfadden"
pacificstates.3591.d:0 "One could say that Bernarr Macfadden's life is a perfect example of the ever so sought after perfect 'American Dream', rising from the bottom and achieving feats unimaginable to less dedicated. Born in Mill Spring, Missouri on August 16th 1868 under the name Bernard Adolphus McFadden, the early years of his life were not kind to the future 'Father of Physical Culture'. A rather sickly boy, he was orphaned at age 11 after both of his parents died, after which he began to work as a farmhand. His health began to improve considerably, yet it began to fluctuate once again after his move to Saint Louis and the coinciding dive into office work, with Macfadden himself describing his state from the time as a 'physical wreck'. The near brushes with death motivated Bernarr to start exercising with dumbbells, daily walks and also a revolutionary diet made up mostly of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. As a man with great ambition and fascination for physicality, he was inspired to acquire higher education in exchange for coaching football and wrestling in Bunker Hill, Illinois after reading William Blaikie's 'How To Get Strong and How To Stay So' while also cooperating with George Baptiste, a champion wrestler. Even before starting his health crusade with the magazine that brought him fame, he already used the term physical culture as part of his job description 'Bernard Mcfadden - Kinestherapist - Teacher of Higher Physical Culture', it is also when he coined his famous saying 'Weakness is a crime; don't be a criminal!'.\n\nHaving toured around the United States and England, changing his name to Bernarr (because it sounded like a lion's roar - much stronger than 'Bernard') and his surname to Macfadden (because Macfadden was more distinctive than McFadden), the physical culture guru's greatest creation would come to be in 1899 after he returned to New York. Already having authored many books on health and established many 'Physical Culture clubs', Bernarr would establish the widely popular 'Physical Culture' magazine, a vehicle to share his vision for a healthy lifestyle achievable by any American with enough will to improve their body. He also ran a paper specifically for promoting fitness among women, called 'Beauty & Health' before its topics were folded into 'Physical Culture', a topic important to Macfadden enough to have designed a competition while in England to find 'the most perfect specimen of English womanhood', during which he met his wife Mary Williamson. Despite the considerable difference they formed a relatively happy marriage for some time, with some ups-and-downs due to Bernarr's rather authoritarian nature and a tendency to be a womanizer around the offices of Macfadden Publications, which resulted in many children and a family life meant to serve as an example of perfect physical health to the world.\n\nThe growth of Bernarr Macfadden's business empire would only pick up the pace, especially after he organized the first large-scale bodybuilding competition at New York's Madison Square Garden and established many new magazines due to the myriad of letters sent to 'Physical Culture', chief among the publications being 'True Story, True Detective, True Story, True Romance'. He was also involved in various other ventures such as the establishment of the 'Physical Culture City' in Monroe Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey; the creation of many 'healthatoriums' offering educational programs, and even a few boarding schools and military academies. This time would also mark his attempt to run for the Mayor of New York City, and although unsuccessful he'd make connections with many important figures from the world of business, culture and politics like Fulton Oursler, George Bernard Shaw, Upton Sinclair, Edward Longstreet Bodin, and the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nHowever, Macfadden's health crusade has not been without critics, ranging from jabs and mocking nicknames like 'Body Love' used by the Time magazine to legions of doctors warning against the supposed danger of the beliefs spouted by the 'kook'. The Father of Physical Culture has rejected the mainstream consensus of organized medicine, for he had almost fallen victim to vaccines during his youth, and has rallied his followers against the 'pill-pushers' and other prudes. For Macfadden, the key to a great life is a vitality enabling diet, fasting, regular exercise, air and sun baths, rejection of tobacco, alcohol and any sort of drugs, all combined with full virility when it comes to sexual activities and promotion of a more open attitude concerning coitus. All of Bernarr's teachings were gathered by him in a semi-religious doctrine dubbed 'cosmotarianism', with which the fitness trend-setter claims to be able to overcome any illness and live up to the age of 150. Seeing the amount of energy combined with a still very spry and impressive body despite his age, the story of Bernarr Macfadden's may well continue for many years."

Pioneered by Spiritists and fringe psychologists such as Parapsychology’s founder Joseph Banks Rhine, inventor of the Zener card test and leading expert on extrasensory perception Karl Zener, along with other prominent figures like Joseph Gaither Pratt, Gardner Murphy, Hubert Pearce, and the young rising star Ian Stevenson, among others. Utilizing tests such as the Zener cards - a series of simple cards adorned with simple shapes in different colors widely used by parapsychologists as an early test screening for psychic powers in a specific person - these minds on the edge of science and reality seek to understand the truly unknown and perhaps unknowable. However, these experiments have been decried as pseudoscience by jealous detractors across the globe, such as by famed Anglo psychologist C. E. M.

pacificstates.4010.d:0 "Its initial release first scheduled for March 31, 1933 delayed due to the rising tension that swept the nation preceding the Second American Civil War, the film ‘Gabriel Over the White House’ finally released this past weekend to much ado. Directed by Gregory La Cava, written by Carey Wilson and Bertram Bloch, but entirely funded by William Randolph Hearst while providing his own overbearing and domineering creative input, the flick has been described as a political fantasy that stars Walter Hudson as a genial but corrupt President of a post-2ACW America united by the Pacific Government who evolves into a benevolent dictator who models himself after the character of former President Abraham Lincoln after receiving divine inspiration, further influence, and direct guidance from the Archangel Gabriel after barely surviving a car accident. \n\nThis president, named Judson Hammond, is heavily based on Hearst himself, with the story following himself alongside his increasingly estranged mistress Pendola ‘Pendie’ Molloy and his secretary Hartley ‘Beekie’ Beekman, played by Karen Morley and Franchot Tone respectively, who slowly fall in love themselves as President Hudson grows more and more powerful and enlightened but seemingly inhuman while rapidly changing the nation for the better before abruptly dying of a heart attack immediately after signing his final decree - the Sacramento Covenant - into law with Lincoln’s old quill. \n\nAdapted from the 1933 novel of the same name by T.F. Tweed, the movie adaptation has taken a decent amount of liberties to portray President Hudson, or Hearst, in the best light possible as he assumes dictatorial powers in order to save America through ingenious reform and societal-wide change, mirroring Hearst’s own plans for our nation should his plans succeed. Criticism over the film ranges from being a bit melodramatic to being little more than a puff-piece and a half-hearted plea for open authoritarianism, though it has still found its fans far and wide across the nation nonetheless, proving to be a boon for Hearst’s support base regardless of the film’s true intent. All that can be said for sure is that Hearst’s ego has only ballooned with its release, and so have his pockets as showings continue to sell out nationwide."

The architect of this scheme, dubbed 'Operation Cherry Blossoms at Dawn', is none other than Shirō Ishii, leader of the highly controversial Unit 731. With the occupation of the 'gaijin' territories, Ishii has been given a veritable black cheque to do what he pleases, so long as his actions don't upset Tokyo. This has led to an unfortunate series of escalating horrific incidents, as Pacific citizens become guinea pigs in a series of increasingly deranged experiments. While Imperial officers have been willing to tolerate such action in the past, there are fears that Ishii's use of Plague bombings in 'rightful Japanese territory' might be a step too far for many. The plan, originally devised as a last-ditch attempt to defy the once great United States, is now being put into practice in resistance holdouts which the IJA could easily handle, causing a great deal of controversy both in Tokyo and the Pacific consulate.

While experts say the disease travelled normally via infected rats, fleas and humans, there are also rumours that infected resistance members delibratley spread the contagion to large cities in a primitive act of counter-biological warfare. The spread of the flu among the Japanese populace has been cause for outrage among the Japanese Consulate, who have demanded that Ishii vacate his post immediatley and cease any research into biological warfare.

Unfortunately, some still doubt our inherent superiority, and have staged a futile resistance against the might of the Emperor's Armies. To prevent resistance actions from taking hold in the future, and to ensure that our forces can continue to shape the face of Pacific America, countless American citizens have been evicted from their homes and placed in camps along the Cascade mountain range. The hundreds if not thousands of residents of said camps have been allowed only what they can carry, and many have been forced to part with their homes, businesses, and most precious belongings. Ironically, not all of the camp's occupants have been white residents, as several Nisei, Sansei and Issei Americans have also been interned.

Charles Ross Norton was always reluctant to take the throne offered to him, however he still took the mantle of Emperor of the Pacific States despite him perceiving his own claims to the throne as illegitimate, and the entire concept of the Pacific Empire as insane. Yet in this crazy world, Charles Ross Norton took the throne to bring stability to the chaotic nation on the Pacific Coast, to restore stable government to an ailing people, and to help every citizen of the Pacific States of America. He cared not for giant parades, not for grand banquets, and not for his Royal Army. He cared for his people more than anything and went to great lengths to ensure that every citizen of his empire was not only surviving; but thriving. His charitable efforts as Emperor lifted thousands of Pacificans from poverty, and his dedication to peace ensured that the Pacific States avoided a destructive war. \n\n The life of Charles Ross Norton was normal until he was swept up in the Pacific Empire, swept up in the absurd claims of his relatives taken at face value by a distraught people. And now, his grand life has come to a final and. A state funeral was held for Norton II with dignitaries from around the world attending the service. Even some dignitaries from the Houses of Windsor and Hohenzollern, who had regarded the House of Norton as an illegitimate joke not long ago. However with Norton II dead, a question of sucsession has arisen. While his son Gerard Norton would typically be the first to take the Crown and the title of Norton III, a closer look at Norton Family records has shown that Charles Ross Norton's older brother Herbert Fraser Norton was in fact the most senior candidate for the throne. With Norton I dead, some have proposed fixing this mistake by offering the crown to Norton's older brother, even if the bulk of the Norton Restoration Society stands by their choice for Emperor and insists on following the Charles Ross Norton line of the crown. Gerard Norton has vowed to continue the policies of his father, as well as maintaining all of the charitable efforts of his father. Herbert Fraser Norton, despite being elevated with a Royal Title, has remained aloof from much of the affairs of the Royal Court, and would most likely stay out of public and political affairs if crowned. Regardless of the Council's choice, we know that as the Nation mourns for their Emperor, our Empire born out of a chaotic world shall live on for another day."

He was writing a collection of Imperial letters decreeing a Royal order for Aid when he looked down at the letters and it hit him, he was Emperor of some foreign land because of a madman he is remotely related to. This should not be happening, it couldn't happen on it's own, someone or something must have made this happen. He got up from his desk and began to pace around his room, "This isn't normal, it isn't sane" he kept uttering to himself. He had to tell everyone, this was bigger than him, bigger than the Civil War, bigger than the Nortonist revival. He had figured it all out, he knew what was behind the insanity of the past few years, as his mind constantly raced, someone opened the door and entered his chamber. She asked, "Tea, your Majesty?", he breathed a sigh of relief when he realised it was only his servant, "I'd wish for you to stop calling me that please." he muttered as she put the tray of Tea and Assorted Biscuits down. "Did you say something your majesty?" she replied, Norton responded "No, don't worry about it". He decided to ask his servant a question, "What do you think of this chaos? this insanity? Me becoming Emperor?", the servant replied "Though I do think the chaos of the past few years is bad, I am glad we have someone like you in charge, even if it is a bit absurd.", she finished this response with a smirk before bowing and leaving the room. After this interaction, Norton II slumped in his chair, he thought to himself that even if someone is controlling him and making this happen, he is here for a reason, to help these people in any way that is possible. Coming to this second realisation, Norton got out of his chair, donned his Imperial Regalia, packed up his things and headed back to the capital, for there is much to be done."

As the red light to let Norton know he was on the air came on, he began to speak, as the speech began, millions of Americans tuned in. Norton discussed his recent crowning as Emperor, his Journey and most importantly why he did away with the political system. "What I realised during my time here is that the reason we are in this chaos is because of politicians, they are the reason millions are killing each other just across our borders and why stability is a thing of the past in America, it wasn't an easy decision, but it was a just one.". He spoke for a little longer before ending the speech with a call for unity and peace for all Americans. After finishing the speech, Norton went outside to get some fresh air and to reflect, as he stared over the capital's skyline, he hoped he could stay true to the promise he made."

Indeed, the thought of being shipped off to a foreign land because of the insane dreams of a far-flung ancestor would seem out of this world to most, yet to those within the Norton family, this situation has very much come to pass. Herbert Fraser Norton, now crowned as Norton III, represents these feelings well. While given the popularity of the Norton Dynasty within Pacific America, Herbert Fraser has no intention of doing away with the Monarchy or passing the crown, Norton III's ascension represents an era of more muted rule to the Norton Realm. Of course, Norton III has kept up with the charitable traditions of his late brother, however unlike the previous Norton, Herbert Fraser has decided to commit to a lower profile in public and political life."

Smart enough to realize that all generations must be influenced, Disney’s companies and state-run bureaus have begun to create new programs to run both day and night, both on TV and on the radio, to reach larger audience numbers than ever before. For adults, news programs, talk shows, and other adult programming have filled the main slots, all subtly influenced by the Disney's own doctrine.

Debuting recently in his first films such as ‘Steam Boat Willy’ and ‘Plane Crazy’, the one and only Mickey Mouse has become a smash hit and instant cultural icon to our people. Absolutely astonishing given his simple design, a large amount of his success has come from the application of the newest audio-visual equipment, allowing his first animated shorts to be fully sound-synchronized much like the first ‘talkies’ that inspired Disney, like the semi-recently released ‘The Jazz Singer.’ With these animated shorts dominating the minds of the youth, an entire generation has been secured within Disney’s grasp before they even could think about rebellion."

Creating new animations about angry aliens that excel at martial arts, tiny monsters caught and pitted against one another in deadly combat, giant mechanical warriors fighting otherworldly creatures and hellish demons, notebooks with the power to kill en masse, parasitic extraterrestrial beings that can take any form, angry lover girls from another planet wearing bee-striped bathing suits, environmentalist peace-makers that work with giant isopods, men dying and being reborn into different bodies like that of a small girl fighting in fantasy worlds or the Weltkrieg, pig-faced pilots fighting over the Mediterranean before the Second Great War, moral adventures with cat-shaped busses and walking castles or parents turned to swine, spiritual warriors that fight with demon swords or chainsaw dogs, aloof cowboy bounty hunters or dandyboys in space, highschools for super-powered children or for teens utilizing stand-ins and personas as weapons to defy fate, martial civilizations capable of manipulating the natural elements, small witches going on dangerous deliveries, stretchy pirates searching for the one true treasure, powerful heroines that undergo magical transformations, or whatever else, these new animations and other media like them shall aid our government in its struggle to make Japanese culture palatable to wider America as we spread these artistic creations across the Pacific States, and the lands of our allies and beyond."

KX_california.62.d:0 "Constantly undermined by his Japanese liaisons who seek to oust and replace him with a more loyal lapdog, and constantly berated by many of his American colleagues due to the deeply inset anti-Asian racism, President and Chief Justice John F. Aiso has long been caught between two worlds, but throughout it all he has maintained utmost loyalty and dedication to the American people and to his true homeland here in the Pacific States. With the help of his allies on the bench in the Supreme Court and from the few loyal American military officers still willing to support him, such as George Marshall, due to his clearly apparent dedication to easing the suffering of we Americans in the strenuous time as much as possible, Aiso has stood his ground while working to utilize the Japanese occupation to benefit our nation and to save as many American lives as possible, even if much of the nation thinks him a traitor for doing so. \n\nNever truly a puppet, Aiso resists from inside the system, and with the help of the Supreme Court and some local politicians that have rejected all anti-Asian prejudices, he has begun to quietly revive local-level democratic processes across the nation in hopes of one day bringing back fair and free elections under the Japanese, and now with the Pacific States proving to be stable and profitable enough, our Japanese ‘benefactors’ may not be so averse to the idea of allowing regulated democratic governance to return to the States. However, the most fervent Japanese loyalists fanatically resist this idea naturally, threatening violence or worse against Aiso in secret, but what could they do that is worse than subjugating our entire nation - a small price to possibly pay in the eyes of Aiso if it means bringing some freedom back to the Land of the Brave if possible. So, should we maintain our military-backed kritarchy under the tutelage and guidance of Aiso and the Supreme Court until society is safe enough to be entrusted back into the hands of the people at some nebulous future date as ordained by our masters in Tokyo, or should we officially begin the revival and reintroduction of American democracy without their direct approval, well aware that we will maintain our special relationship with Japan, whether we like it or not, either way?"

KX_california.63.d:0 "Ever since the Arnold Coup and subsequent political crisis, the Pacific States has been ruled by an ad-hoc council of Judges under the guidance of Judge John F. Aiso with the support of the Empire of Japan, or that was true until just recently when Aiso magnanimously decided to reintroduce democratic elections nationwide. Aiso, while previously reliant on Japanese support to keep his rule intact, managed to outmaneuver the collaborators; or at least silence the most egregious of the group. With our crisis finally coming to an end, Judge Aiso finally tasked the Courts and the Elected Legislature with a most difficult task: the creation of a new constitution for the Pacific States. This was no easy task, as foreign machinations, be them from Washington or Tokyo, as they sought to undermine the legitimacy of the newly-independent Pacific States. Nonetheless, it was a task that must be done, but Aiso succeeded in overseeing the painstaking process while organizing new national elections across the Pacific States.\n\n With Aiso already going down in history as the man who saved the Pacific States from chaos, there is a growing movement to draft him as a Presidential candidate when fresh elections are to be held. While Aiso seems reluctant to run as he seeks an early and well-earned retirement, it is undeniable that Aiso holds a lofty status, considering his rapid rise to power, his defying decades of anti-Asian discrimination and saving the Pacific States from utter destruction. While he would undeniably be a popular candidate, the final decision lies with Aiso himself."

Seemingly backed into a corner, President Aiso has found little allies within the Pacific populace, constantly being at the end of anti-Asian vitriol and only being propped up by the support of military commanders such as Henry Arnold and George C. Marshall. However, in light of Aiso's lack of allies, one group has risen to support the Supreme Court: namely the Empire of Japan. While Aiso may trace his familial origins to Japan, he sees himself as a true American citizen, and would be willing to place his life on the line to protect the nation he holds dear. However, as rogue American governments menace the good people of Pacific America, Aiso realizes that making friendly gestures to Tokyo may be our best chance at survival. This new partnership with Japan is seen by Aiso as a pragmatic one, designed to open up relations with the Empire of Japan on equal terms, while also working together to curtail anti-Asian bigotry in the region. However there are other more egregious collaborators who seek to quietly influence the Pacific States into a more 'favourable' position relative to the Empire of Japan. These collaborators such as John David Provoo, Ralph Townsend, Max Thornburg, Frederick Vincent Williams, and David Warren Ryder aim to undermine President Aiso, and by extension Pacific Sovereignty. While they hold little influence currently, if Tokyo's influence is allowed to grow unchecked, they may become more of a problem than they're worth."

In an additional ironic twist, many of the most fervent voices for Japanese Collaboration, such as John David Provoo, Ralph Townsend and Max Thornburg. Today, these voices for Japanese collaboration have been all but quiet, as President Aiso announces the 'equal partnership' initiative with the Empire of Japan. This new set of policies aims to mend our dependence on Tokyo, and officially expels the most fervent collaborators from the provisional Cabinet. These measures, aimed at pleasing the Japanese while keeping our distance, have caused quite the fury in the halls of Tokyo, as hardliners demand the Pacific Collaborators find a more suitable puppet. Indeed, to the IJA and IJN, Aiso may look like them, but he has proven to be a gaijin in both mind and spirit, unfailingly loyal to the dream of a nation which perished long ago, and refused beyond all measure to treat him as an equal."

However, one such source of resistance has so far proven impossible to fully unroot. Although it is only a mere pirate radio station, the radio news, talk, and music program called ‘Zero Hour’, run and hosted by the disc jockey and Nisei citizen Iva Ikuko Toguri D'Aquino aka Orphan Annie as she goes by on the air - or Tokyo Rose as she is known erroneously but affectionately by among her many listeners, has proven to be quite the unremovable thorn, creating a festering wound of resistance that seeks to metastasize across the Pacific States. Always on the move and always covering their tracks, D’Aquino’s rebel radio show has proven uncatchable as they work with other resistance groups, largely made up of other Nisei not willing to collaborate against their homeland here in America along with help from non-Japanese locals and armed forces veterans, to provide aid and hope to the masses against our will. \n\nHowever, D’Aquino’s movement seems to have largely peaceful intentions, at least for now, as they mainly use their mouthpiece heard across the airwaves to keep spirits up in these uncertain times while spreading humanitarian aid and helping refugees along when they can as they play jazz, island songs, the Pacific’s and Asia’s greatest hits, and much more in between news bulletins and updates on the war and on the homefront. More concerned with violent pockets of resistance, the search for D’Aquino’s anti-Tokyo rebel radio will have to sit on the backburner, at least for now."

However in the last few days, Aiso's stances have rapidly shifted from one favoring an equal partnership to one favoring almost slavish subservience. While some have 'seen this coming' from the Nisei Aiso, a few keenly-eyed citizens have noticed something startling: the President Aiso which currently presides over the nation is not the same Aiso which ruled Pacific America mere weeks before. Differences in height, eye color, mannerisms and speech patterns have all been noticed by those familiar with the 'Real Aiso'. Local authorities have repeatedly denied the claims that President Aiso has been replaced with a body double, even going so far as to change official records about Aiso's height and eye color to match.

calpeaceout.14.d:0 "It has only been a short few days since General Arnold lead his march on Sacramento, and while our government is still far from stable, the time has come to make a decision regarding our very future. When Arnold forced the previous provisional government to step down, he did so in the name of the so-called 'Peace-Monger' movement, a movement calling not just for us to not enter the coming civil war, but one calling for the creation of a secessionist Republic on the West Coast. Now in power, the movement has run head first into the brick wall of our current realities, and has split into two camps as a result.\n\nThe first and largest camp, dubbed the 'realists,' wished for us to us General Arnold's connections within the Armed Forces to cut a deal with the Federalists. This deal would be one in which Pacifican forces would fight with the MacArthurites in exchange for recognizance of Pacifican Sovereignty over the West Coast. The Realists say this is the one way we could truly ensure a bright future for our children, or so they claim.\n\nThe second camp to emerge on the Secession Question(as it has been dubbed) are known as the Dreamers. The Dreamers, mostly made up of junior officers and students, call for us to totally abandon America. They would have us reject any deal or offer from the warring factions, and instead work to build up the Pacifican Dream, free from any conflict whatsoever. Unlike the Realists, they have no contingency should the victor of the coming conflict demand our reincorporation, save for extensive militarization of the Pacifican State.\n\nWith MacArthur's deadline coming every closer, no time for debate exists. General Arnold must now make a decision, a decision potentially on which millions of lives ride."

While this state of affairs is highly irregular, due to the outbreak of the war, we can do nothing to stop them. Obviously when the dust settles there will be reckoning, reports indicate growing unrest due to the sudden declaration of independence within the Pacific States, leading many to believe that the PSA will be joining the war shortly.

calpeaceout.22.t:0 "An Offer of Stately Proportions"
calpeaceout.22.d:0 "With the birth of a West Coast truly free of the rest of America, no longer shackled to the whims of a corrupt Congress, the people of this vast land finally have a taste of true indepence. However, while the Pacifican state may no longer be tied down, subject to the rest of the country, internally we are not without our own forms of subjection. The Pacific Congress, especially the House, has become dominated by California. By far the largest state, both in land and population, of the 4 Pacifican states, it is no small shock that Californian domination has come to pass. California has always been seen as the beacon of the West, and so it makes sense that the free West should come to resemble California. However, not all view it this way, as a growing number of both rural citizens and politicians are starting to resent domination by a single state. They view Californian domination as no better, if not worse, then domination by the Feds. To them, the secession of the Pacifican states was the chance to forge a true union of equals, a dream that has been squashed under the might of the Golden State. A small number of civilians in favor of dissolving California have set up a small section of roadblocks in southern Oregon. Hoping to draw attention to their plight, the group responsible for the roadblocks has petitioned Congress to deal with the ‘California Issue’ as they call it. In response, a group of politicians has been working diligently, to push forward a bill to divide California into multiple states, thus destroying Califronian subjection of the Union and allowing the rest of the nation to breathe an easier, more equal, breath. The bill, dubbed the State Equality Act of [GetYear] has been gaining traction in both the House and Senate.\n\nWhile far from a popular measure, the bill is not without its support. Interestingly enough, while the group of conservative politicians, which hails from both the House and Senate may share the same goal they differ in vision. As can be seen by the fact that two different bills, while in essence the same, have been submitted to the respective houses. The Senate bill, seen as the more reasonable of the two, calls for Southern Oregon and Northern California to be broken off and formed into a 'State of Jefferson' and for Southern California and Los Angeles be formed into a 'State of Mojave.' Central California, and with it San Francisco, would remain as the 'original' California. The House bill calls for the same, with the expectation of San Francisco, which would become the 'State of Frisco' and Los Angeles, which would become the 'State of Angels.’ Along with this, the House bill would see the rural eastern halves Oregon and Washington broken into a ‘State of Lincoln.’\n\nWith both being fairly radical, there is very little chance that either bill will pass without support from the outside, which is why persons from the House and Senate in favor of these bills reached out to [root.getleader], claiming that with their support, the bill would pass in short order. Offering everything from political support to direct financial support of the government, it seems there is little this group of politicians and citizens will not give to see California’s control destroyed. While it is not expected that [root.getleader] would truly support either of these plans, as such a change in the map would be massive, not to mention how much of a headache the establishment of new states actually is, it is not outside the realm of possibility. After all, even the most principled men fall to vice every once in a while..."
calpeaceout.22.a:0 "Support the Senate bill, in exchange for political support."
calpeaceout.22.b:0 "Support the House bill, in exchange for financial support."
calpeaceout.22.c:0 "Support neither, the nation is not for sale!" 

calpeaceout.23.t:0 "The Downfall of the Japanese Lapdog"
calpeaceout.23.d:0 "Now that that the Japanese puppets in what is widely known as Pacific States have been brought to heel by our armies, we are in the position to negotiate a peace with the Japanese Empire in exchange for the full incorporation of all the lands controlled by the Pacific-American regime. Although talks of a possible ceasefire would seem like the obvious option, some within our command are convinced that our position will never be secure until Japan is crushed by an overwhelming force, one from which they will not be able to recover. The decision is open, but it is important to understand that no matter what will be chosen, the balance of power in the Pacific shall be changed forever."
calpeaceout.23.a:0 "The terms are more than fair, California is the real prize."
calpeaceout.23.b:0 "Japan itself shall pay."

#PSA's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################
CAL_HENRY_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With the outbreak of the Civil War, 'Hap' found himself in the West Coast of America, where due to his constant disagreements with the national Chief of Air Corps of the Federal Government, he decided to join the Pacific Governors in their struggle, and provide any technical expertise he is able to in exchange for the promise of an independent air force."
CAL_DADDY_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps. With MacArthur's takeover of the government, Marshall refused to recognize his colleague as the army's generalissimo, and when the Pacific Governors declared their revolt, Marshall decided to join them, which earned him the promotion to General of the Army. He is widely considered one of the most brilliant planners in America, and is one of the most experienced members of our staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
CAL_ALEXANDER_PATCH_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 23, 1889, in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Alexander McCarrell "Sandy" Patch, the son of the Cavalry Captain Alexander M. Patch, started his military career when he joined West Point in 1909. While a fan of the cavalry corp, he was quick to realize that cavalry would soon enough become obsolete in combat, so he chose to join the infantry, and graduated from West Point as a second lieutenant in 1913. His first assignment was the 18th Infantry Regiment based in Texas, from where he was assigned to Pershing's 'Punitive Expedition' to Mexico, where he earned his promotion to first lieutenant. Without any major engagements for the US, Patch reached the rank of Captain in 1919 and was posted at Fort Benning as an instructor for four years. He'd apply for the Staunton Military Academy in Virginia as a professor of military science and tactics, a role which he'll keep until very recently. In the meantime, he attended the Field Officer's Course in 1922 and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, where he graduated with distinction in 1925, and finally graduated from the U.S. Army War College in 1932 as a lieutenant colonel. Patch's remarkable service record impressed General George Marshall, who tried to keep close contact with Patch in the following years of his graduation. When the civil war break out, Marshall implored Patch to join his staff in the Pacific Army, a request that Patch accepted and for which he was promoted to Brigadier General."
CAL_LEWIS_BRERETON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 21, 1890, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Lewis Hyde Brereton began his military career in 1907, when he joined the Naval Academy with his brother and graduated in June 1911. However, before graduating he submitted a letter for resignation citing seasickness, which would make him unable to serve as a naval officer. His resignation was accepted, and he applied to be commissioned in the US Army and was appointed as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps on August 17, 1911. In September 1912, he undertook flight training in Rockwell Field, and would work temporarily on the air corp until he survived his second crash, after which he requested to be relieved from duty. He returned to the Coast Artillery Corps and in July 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and sent to the Philippines and would serve a year before returning to the US in March 1917, where he was assigned to duty in the Aviation Sector Headquarters in Washington D.C.. He'd go through a series of administrative posts and became a close assistant of Billy Mitchell in his attempts to make the air force independent. With Mitchell's resignation, his life took a downturn, as his wife left him, he suffered a crash and was found AWOL by accident while his mental health deteriorated greatly due to these developments. He was restored into service in August 1927 and was assigned to command of the 88th Observation Squadron at Post Field, Oklahoma, as well as an instructor at the Field Artillery School in Fort Sill. In 1931 he was posted in the Panama Canal Zone and received a promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1935 due to an excelling performance, which allowed him to salvage his reputation of his misfortunes in the late twenties. With the outbreak of the civil war becoming increasingly inevitable, he took a ship and arrived to San Diego right before hostilities began in order to meet his old acquaintance,'Hap' Arnold. Despite his inexperience in practical infantry combat, his excellent administrative and planning skills allowed him to become Brigadier General, by Arnold's own request."
CAL_ISAAC_WHITE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 6, 1901, in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Isaac Davis White graduated from Norwich University with a bachelor's degree in 1922 and would join the army in 1922, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in February 1923. He'd be promoted to First Lieutenant in 1927 after undergoing the Troop Officers' Course from the Cavalry school, where he became keenly interested in the prospect of mechanized warfare and the use of Tanks to break through enemy lines. He joined the Command and General Staff School in 1931, where he graduated as a Major in 1932 and became one of the army's strongest advocates for the use of tanks along with George S. Patton. As the country spiralled into civil war, Isaac sided with Marshall against MacArthur, leaving westwards from Fort Riley, where he was working as an instructor, and was awarded for his loyalty to Marshall with the rank of Brigadier General\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Very interested in the adoption of tanks and mechanized vehicles over infantry combat, but his ambitions may have to wait until the Civil War is over."
CAL_ALBERT_WEDEMEYER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 9, in Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Albert Coady Wedemeyer graduated from West Point in 1919 as a second lieutenant, after which he was posted with the 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning, and would be transferred to the 57th Infantry in the Philippines in 1923. He was later assigned to the 15th Infantry Regiment in the Legation of Tianjin, where he learned to speak almost perfect Mandarin Chinese, and returned to the US to undergo a course in the Command and General Staff School, where his excellent grades made him eligible for an exchange program with the German Kriegsakademie, departing in early 1936. He never finished his courses however, as the Civil War began, and MacArthur took the reins of the government, Wedemeyer decided to travel back home and join the Pacific Forces, who he sees as the true American government. Upon his arrival on San Diego, George Marshall requested his promotion to Brigadier General, as his experience abroad could indeed prove invaluable for the struggling American Army."

He'd later take part in the occupation of Veracruz and would fight against the Cacos Bandits in Le Trou and Fort Capois, in Haiti. He was promoted to captain in 1916, and became one of the chief members of the Haitian Constabulary where he'd be promoted to Inspector of the Constabulary in 1919. He'd be promoted to major for his service in Haiti in 1920 and would be reassigned to a US Marine division in 1923, where he was sent to Quantico, Virginia.

He'd be promoted to Colonel, and asked to return to the continent. However, during his travel in the civilian ship, the American Civil War begun, and when the Pacific Governors announced their revolt, Vandegrift had little choice but to support the Pacific Army in their struggle. For his loyalty, however, he was awarded the rank of Brigadier General and put in charge of the Pacific Marine Corps which has solidified his beliefs in the Pacific Administration."
CAL_GEORGE_WINDLE_READ_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 29, 1900, in Fort Grant, Arizona\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Windle Read Jr. spent most of his youth in military camps, following his father who was an important member of the US Army staff, he volunteered for the army in 1917, and although he signed up for the infantry at first, graduating as a second lieutenant from the Military Academy, his love for Polo made him move to the cavalry corps before 1920, where he undertook the Cavalry School Basic Course and graduated in 1921. He took several posts throughout the US and abroad, mostly following the steps of his father until his death in 1934. With his father's death, he was assigned to Seattle, where he had to put down several strikes in the name of the central government as the national situation deteriorated. When the Pacific governors finally revolted, George decided to support their insurrection, as most of his partners in the region were doing so and he didn't want to risk being imprisoned for treachery. As a token of appreciation for his loyalty, he was promoted to Brigadier General and now eagerly awaits to prove himself up for the task like his father was."
CAL_JIMMY_DOOLITTLE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 14, 1896, in Alameda, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W James Harold 'Jimmy' Doolittle attended Los Angeles City College after graduating from Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, and later won admission to the University of California, Berkeley where he studied in The School of Mines.

cenmil.1.d: "Ever since the Federal Republic of Central America collapsed in 1843, there has been no successful attempt at reuniting Central America under a single flag.\nGuided by the armed forces of the various nations of Central America, our new Union shall not follow the same path as the attempts during the last century. As the Nicaraguan Revolution has finally come to an end and as the borders between our nations disappear, our Union shall remain a bastion of freedom and liberty, under guidance of the strongmen of the military.\nWe, as an union of nations, shall stand united against Syndicalism and everything that threatens our way of life."
cenmil.1.a: "Long live the Republic!"

cenmil.2.t: "The New Union"
cenmil.2.d: "Ever since the Federal Republic of Central America collapsed in 1843, there has been no successful attempt at reuniting Central America under a single flag.\nAs the disease called Syndicalism spreads throughout the world, even Central America isn't saved. Nicaragua, which has fallen victim to the Internationale's promises, has become the epicentre for Syndicalism in Central America, aided by the Mexicans.\nIn order to save Central America from Syndicalism, Guatemala and El Salvador have signed a treaty of unification that shall create an anti-Syndicalist fortress. It is our duty to expand southward, and to destroy the remains of Syndicalism in our hemisphere."

As the foreign ministry holds large power due to how influential foreign powers are in our nation, the factions are fighting hard to get the position.\nAbraham Williams Calderón is the AM's candidate, and Juan Federico Ponce Vaides is running for the PU."

As we can't rely on the unorganized police forces of the former nations to handle things forever, we need to reform our interior ministry. The ministry will need a head to run the show, and such an influential position is highly wanted.\nCarlos Hartling runs for the AM, Francisco Javier Arana is the PU's candidate, and the PN has brought forth Fidel Cristino Garay."

cenmil.7.t: "Somoza's Speech"
cenmil.7.d: "Anastasio Somoza García, leader of the Administración Militar, the moderate faction of the military congress, has taken to the balcony of the President's Palace of Guatemala to hold a speech in front of a large crowd. As many military men have feared, he wishes to use the fact that his faction is the most moderate to convince the population of his cause, even though he doesn't actively practice what he preaches.\nDespite the warnings and threats made by the more radical PU and PN, the speech has also been transmitted via radio.\n\n'People of Guatemala, people of El Salvador, people of Honduras, people of Nicaragua, now we are all people of the Central American Republic. Syndicalists have tried to oppress us, but no more! Our nation is now free of the Syndicalist menace, thanks to the efforts of every single Central American patriot. Now that the holy task has been completed, your voice should be heard, and will be heard!'\n\nOn the next meeting, the military congress was so angry at Somoza that multiple congressmen took to the podium and screamed that Somoza should be court martialed for high treason."
cenmil.7.a: "Maybe his ideas aren't that wrong..."
cenmil.7.b: "Somoza needs to be court martialed indeed!"

cenmil.8.t: "Reforming the Army"
cenmil.8.d.yes.martinez: "The military has been the driving force behind the unification of Central America, but to spell it in singular is quite wrong. Due to the differences between the former nations of Central America, our army is currently a chaotic mix and depending on what nationality you have, you follow different military doctrines and use different equipment. The army currently has none less than 5 different modifications of the Mauser rifle in use!\nThe AM and the PN have both presented plans to regularize and professionalize the armed forces, meanwhile the PU has suggested a major militarisation policy to expand the army as much as possible to defend the union."

cenmil.9.t: "Maximiliano Hernandez' Speech"
cenmil.9.d: "Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez, the leader of the Partido Nacional, the most radical faction in the congress, has reserved an hour of speech time in front of the congress. Known for his immense hate for Syndicalists and opponents in general, he is most (in)famous for his actions in the 1932 peasant uprising.\n\n'Dear Congressmen, dear men who have let us to victory against the godless Syndicalist, the crusade against Syndicalism is not over! Our Mexican neighbours suffer from an extensive case of Syndicalism, and our neighbours to the south are being tempted into the hands of the Internationale. As a beacon of liberty and prosperity, the Central American Republic needs a powerful, strong and unifying leader to lead us in the eternal struggle against the godless traitors! Our men will fight in the jungle, in the hills, in the mountains and in the cities, and we will never surrender to those who wish the foundations of society destroyed!"

cenmil.10.d.yes.martinez: "Maximiliano Hernandez' speech has left quite an impression on the members of the congress, however not everyone was happy with his terms and conditions. Jorge Ubico, the leader of the Partido de Unificación, has written his own speech to counter Hernandez', and has presented it in front of the congress, while also transmitting it to the entire Union via radio.\n\n'Central America has been often seen as backwards by the outside world. Our roads have been described as lethal, our nations as corrupt and violent, and our economies as inefficient and underdeveloped.\nNo longer, the glorious Union and shall prove to the world that Central America is the land of the brave, strong and innovative! No longer will we suffer under the traitorous Syndicalist regimes, no longer will we suffer from corrupt officials, no longer will we suffer under division!\nWe need a strong, powerful regime, with a strong powerful leader, to finally reach the future, so to every congressman, to every citizen of the Union, to everyone I say, I will bring prosperity to our glorious Union!

Speeches, arguments, disputes and bribery have been common place in order to convince (or force) congressmen to join and vote for one of the factions, and the three strongmen who lead them respectively have been doing their best to secure as many votes as possible. The last meeting of the congress will be held in a few days, and it will decide the future of the Union as the new president will be elected to lead."

It will be an easy task to get rid of the democratic and syndicalist opposition, however the other military factions will not surrender. Now that we have been victorious in the Congress, we will need to get rid of our opponents..."

cenmil.13.b: "The military sticks together!"

cenmil.14.t: "Military Rivalries Appear"
cenmil.14.d: "It seems as that our move to destroy opposition inside the military has left it disorganized and split. Despite careful planning, many brigades have declared their loyalty to their former commanders before the unification has been completed."
cenmil.14.a: "Dismiss the disloyal brigades."

cenmil.15.t: "Dedicate More Manpower to the Police?"
cenmil.15.d: "With the passing of the new, harsher laws, we're now finding ourselves with a dismal lack of police officers to enforce them.

cenmil.16.t: "The Civilian Puppet State"
cenmil.16.d: "The AM has been victorious in the congress thanks to the major support from the population, however now they expect us to fulfil our promises. Betraying them would risk an open rebellion, however Somoza has never actually planned to hand over any power to the civilian population. In order to avoid a second revolution, a civilian state has to be created, while being controlled by the military. However, in order to achieve legitimacy, how much are we willing to negotiate with the civilian politicians?"
cenmil.16.a: "Lift the ban on opposition parties but only approve loyal politicians."
cenmil.16.b: "Permit some civilian opposition but only led be controllable politicians."

However, unlike the congress election, the people want to vote themselves and decide their own president. Those demands are quite crazy, but we shouldn't risk a second revolution.\n\nAfter countless hours of voting and waiting, the election bureaus have finally closed their doors and the votes have been revealed to the election commission. There has been no reported incidents of bribery or election rigging... at least none that the military would permit to be reported."

Jorge Ubico, who has often referred to himself as the Napoleon of Central America, has proven to the citizens of Central America that he is ready to 'march towards civilisation', as he had promised during his most famous radio transmission. Crowds have gathered today in Guatemala City for the inauguration of Jorge Ubico, and throughout the Union, the same sentence could be heard..."
cenmil.36.a: "Long Live Jorge Ubico, Long Live the Republic!"

cenmil.37.t: "Jorge Ubico travels the Union"
cenmil.37.d: "As a true president of the people, Jorge Ubico has announced today that he will be travelling across Central America, visiting every larger and smaller city as well as the beautiful country sides of the Union. He will be crossing the Union by car and plane, in order to be able to meet as many citizens of the Republic and to so that he can see every corner of our beautiful union. He will be leaving today for Quetzaltenango, after which he will continue to the disputed region of Belize. Along his route, which has been published in all major newspapers of the Union, crowds of cheerful and loyal citizens have gathered in order to see and meet the president personally."
cenmil.37.a: "Onwards!"

cenmil.38.t: "Jorge Ubico arrives in Belize"
cenmil.38.d: "On the second destination of his tour of the Republic, Jorge Ubico has arrived in Belize City.\nBelize, a former British colony under control of Guatemala and later the Central American Republic since the collapse of the British Empire, has remain a claim of the West Indies Federation, despite being no longer under British control for almost two decades. Jorge Ubico's visit, which was greeted with a flood of Republican flags, proves that the people of Belize truly feel as a part of the Union, and not part of the rotten federation across the sea.\nThe next destination is the Honduran border city of San Pedro Sula, which now is the main Atlantic port of Central America."
cenmil.38.a: "Ubico truly unites our Republic."

cenmil.39.t: "Jorge Ubico crosses the Honduran country side"
cenmil.39.d: "Honduras, the former bastion against the Syndicalist traitors of Nicaragua, has suffered under the status of frontier against an hostile force. The country side is the home to much of the poor population of Honduras, who can just keep themselves over water with the little they have. Jorge Ubico, who is currently travelling from San Pedro Sula towards Matagalpa, Nicaragua, has taken a major detour to visit as much of rural Honduras as possible. No matter where he arrives, the commonly illiterate citizens greet him with the utmost respect and hospitality, waving the Republican flag along his route. Jorge Ubico has promised to aid every man, woman and child of Central America, no matter their social class or rank, and has kept his promise along the way. By listening to the needs and demands of the common man, Ubico has gained much popularity in the country side, which will aid him in his 'march towards civilisation'."
cenmil.39.a: "How could anyone not support Ubico?"

cenmil.40.t: "Syndicalist traitors attack Ubico!"
cenmil.40.d: "On route towards Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, a group of Syndicalist traitors and terrorists have attempted to ambush Ubico, and end the life of our great president!\nLuckily, the Syndicalists, just like their ideology, were not smart enough to cover up their plans, and have been discovered by brave loyalists! As the group of traitors was preparing to ambush the president's car using multiple French rifles, loyalist police forces have overwhelmed and arrested the terrorists. Jorge Ubico and his companions have not been present during the combat between the loyalists and traitors, and as such have not been hurt.\nDespite the risks that Ubico has taken, travelling in an open top car through the homeland of Central American Syndicalism, no threatening attacks have happened so far."
cenmil.40.a: "Good Riddance."

cenmil.41.t: "Jorge Ubico crosses El Salvador by train"
cenmil.41.d: "The railway, the symbol of the industrialisation and of westernisation, only passes through limited parts of Central America. One of the largest tracks are located in El Salvador, connecting the ports of Acajutla and Cutuco and passing through San Salvador and San Miguel. Today, a special train has carried Jorge Ubico from San Miguel to the Salvadorian capital. Stopping in Usulutan, Zacatecoluga, San Vincente and other stations along the railway, at each point has he been greeted by cheerful crowds and the Republican flag. Upon his arrival in San Salvador, he announced that he will be providing more funding and incentives for a Trans-Central American railway, which will also be open for civilian transportation."
cenmil.41.a: "The railway will be a cornerstone of the March Towards Civilisation."

cenmil.42.t: "Jorge Ubico is back in Guatemala City"
cenmil.42.d: "After more than a month of touring Central America, visiting all corners of the Union and all social classes, Jorge Ubico has arrived in Guatemala City. The tour has proven to be a genius marketing stunt, and Jorge Ubico's popularity has increased drastically throughout all regions of the Union. In front of the presidential palace, a massive crowd has greeted Jorge Ubico, who later made a radio broadcasted speech. During the tour, Ubico has promised many reforms, and the people are convinced that he will go through with all of them."
cenmil.42.a: "Welcome Back!"

cenmil.43.t: "Jorge Ubico's Statue is completed"
cenmil.43.d: "President Jorge Ubico, the hero of the Guatemalan Civil War, the saviour Central America from the Syndicalist traitors, will now forever watch the President's Palace.\nThe construction of his statue, which dominates the plaza in front of the palace, has been started when the Guatemalan flag was still on top of the palace's flag pole, when Central America was still divided due to the Syndicalist traitors.\nHowever now, the beautiful flag of the united Republic is guarding the entrance of the palace, all thanks to our hero, Jorge Ubico. The inauguration, on this beautiful day of June, has been declared a holiday so that all workers, students and intellectuals of Central America have the possibility of honouring our great leader.\nThe crowds which have gathered to see the statue are estimated at more than twenty thousand brave citizens, and the Republican flag is waving in every street of Guatemala City on this blessed day."
cenmil.43.a: "An impressive statue for an impressive leader."


cenmil.200.t: "Supporting a side in the Civil War"
cenmil.200.d: "The United States of America have fallen into a second civil war, more destructive than the first one. Central America has always been deeply connected with the United States due to the United Fruit Company and similar businesses, however the military is divided on who to help. Some are advocating to aid the official United States government, while others would rather support the new American Union State. Depending on which side we choose, the victory or defeat of said faction could have severe consequences."
cenmil.200.a: "Help the official regime!"
cenmil.200.b: "Support the Union State!"

cenmil.201.t: "The Central American Republic asks for protection"
cenmil.201.d: "The Central American Republic has put forth a request to our nation to protect it from their enemies who threaten the integrity and survival of the Republic. Accepting their request would ultimately lead to them joining our faction, however committing ourselves to their defence could upset the already fragilized balance of power of the region."
cenmil.201.a: "Guarantee their Independence."
cenmil.201.b: "Where is Central America again?"

cenmil.202.t: "The Central American Republic asks to join our faction"
cenmil.202.d: "The Central American Republic has put forth a request to join our military faction. While we could receive an additional ally who could potentially control the Panama Canal in the future, the balance of power of the region could be destroyed through such a move."
cenmil.202.a: "Accept their Demand."
cenmil.202.b: "Central America is by Brazil, right?"

cenmil.203.t: "The Status of Belize"
cenmil.203.d: "Occupied during the British Revolution of 1925, British Honduras, or as it is now known as Belize, has been part of Guatemala ever since. Now that Guatemala has evolved into the Central American Republic, Belize remains a part of our nation. However, the British, better said the West Indies Federation, still claim Belize as a rightful part of their nation, which renders the full integration of Belize impossible. Our only possibility to set up ties with the Entente is to return the land, but this would severely hurt our international prestige. Keeping will however forever lock us from the Entente."
cenmil.203.a: "Return Belize."
cenmil.203.b: "Offer a Deal to the Federation."

cenmil.204.t: "Central America demands that we revoke our Belizean claim"
cenmil.204.d: "The Central American government has sent us a deal concerning the former colony of Belize. They demand that we renounce our claim on Belize and recognize its ownership by Central America, and in exchange our two nations will sign favourable trade deals to revive business ties."
cenmil.204.a: "Accept the Deal."
cenmil.204.b: "Crazy and unacceptable terms!"

cenmil.205.t: "The Federation has refused our terms!"
cenmil.205.d: "The West Indies Federation have refused to revoke their claim on Belize and have called our terms crazy and unacceptable!"
cenmil.205.a: "Back off and maintain the Status-Quo."
cenmil.205.b: "Place an Embargo on the Federation!"

cenmil.206.t: "Central America embargoes us!"
cenmil.206.d: "Angry about our adamant position concerning the status of Belize, the Central American government has placed an embargo against us! They have promised to improve trade ties, but now they have made the opposite. While this will hurt both of our economies, giving in now would be a political humiliation."
cenmil.206.a: "We will have to accept their terms."
cenmil.206.b: "What is there even to trade with Central America?"

cenmil.207.t: "The Federation has cut all ties with us!"
cenmil.207.d: "The West Indies Federation has ignored our warnings, and is now ignoring our embargo! It seems like the dispute over Belize will never end..."
cenmil.207.a: "Maintain the Embargo."

cenmil.208.t: "The Federation has revoked their claim!"

cenmil.212.d: "We have not been accepted into the faction, but we will continue our struggle against Syndicalism on our own."
cenmil.212.a: "Disappointing."

cenmil.220.t: "The Status of the IRCA"
cenmil.220.d: "The International Railways of Central America, short IRCA, has held the monopoly on rail transportation and the ownership of most railway tracks in Central America since 1912. The IRCA, now part of the United Fruit Company, will be a major partner or obstacle in our quest to lay the railway from Guatemala to Panama. Previous Guatemalan administrations have signed various deals with the IRCA, and it is now up to us if we respect these signatures or break the deals in favour of a state-controlled railway."
cenmil.220.a: "Grant them a monopoly as long as they follow our orders."
cenmil.220.b: "Respect the previous deals."
cenmil.220.c: "Nationalize the IRCA."

cenmil.221.t: "The Planning of the Railway"
cenmil.221.d: "Building a railway across the harsh terrain of Central America is not an easy task, and a proper railway suited for all kinds of transportation needs will be very expensive. As the Trans-Central American railway is a major prestige project for the government, some advocate that the government takes over the entire cost of the railway. While very costly, that would also guarantee state control of the rails. At the same time, foreign investors are also interested in the construction of the railway and could take over part of the costs."
cenmil.221.a: "Let the investors handle the costs."
cenmil.221.b: "Take over parts of the bill."
cenmil.221.c: "Fund the project only with government money."

cenmil.222.t: "Lack of funding for the next rail section"
cenmil.222.d: "While the expansion of the already existing IRCA tracks was relatively cheap, the extension towards Tegucigalpa has proven to be very costly. The budget planned for this section has already been exceeded and the railway is still a long distance from the Honduran city. The hilly terrain has caused major delays, and now the construction organizers are asking for additional funding."
cenmil.222.a: "Let our corporate partners pay."
cenmil.222.b: "Increase our funding."

cenmil.223.t: "Passing through Syndicalist land"
cenmil.223.d: "The next section of the Trans-Central American railway will be passing through Nicaragua, which still hasn't fully recovered from the Syndicalist revolution. The construction organizers have made their fears clear over potential Syndicalist sabotage and attacks, and have asked for additional manpower from the army to guard the construction sites."
cenmil.223.a: "What could possibly go wrong."
cenmil.223.b: "Increase the manpower of the guarding forces."

cenmil.224.t: "Syndicalist Attack on the Railway"
cenmil.224.d: "Syndicalist partisans have kidnapped multiple construction planners who have been sent out to plan the railway section passing through the hills near the city of León, and have demanded an important ransom for their release. In order to get our men back, we were forced to pay the ransom, and the Syndicalists are most likely using the money to buy up equipment for future operations."
cenmil.224.a: "So this is what could go wrong?"

cenmil.225.t: "Passing into Costa Rica"
cenmil.225.d.costa.exists: "Despite Syndicalist harassment, the Trans-Central American railway has reached Managua in time. The next section of the railway however will be passing through Costa Rican land, so we will either need to ask their government for permission of the construction, which they will most likely refuse, or wait until we have finally captured Costa Rica."
cenmil.225.d.costa.no.exists: "Despite Syndicalist harassment, the Trans-Central American railway has reached Managua in time. The next section of the railway will be passing into the recently pacified Costa Rica, where we expect minor resistance to the construction."
cenmil.225.a: "Next Year in San José."
cenmil.225.b: "Next Year in San José, with permission."
cenmil.225.c: "Next Year in San José, once it is part of the Union."
cenmil.225.e: "We have reached our destination: Managua."

cenmil.226.t: "Central America asks for permission for a Railway Project"
cenmil.226.d: "The Central American government has asked us for permission to construct the section of the Trans-Central American railway passing through Costa Rica. The railway, once finished, will increase cross-border trade with the rest of Central America, however large parts of the government fear that the railway will not be used for trade, but to integrate us into Central America once the time is right."
cenmil.226.a: "Grant Permission."
cenmil.226.b: "Refuse."

cenmil.227.t: "Costa Rica has given permission!"
cenmil.227.d: "The Costa Rican government has granted us permission to continue the Trans-Central American railway to San José"

Under the brilliant command of our esteemed leader, Central America shall shed its reputation as a squabbling mire of bickering groups as we march together, now and forever, towards our new future. However, now that General Ubico controls the reigns of power, he must decide how to go about reorganizing the new state’s regime. He could easily go with one of the numerous already-drafted plans made for such an occasion, creating a united Central American state while he himself would take a seat in its interim government, or perhaps he could go with something more...grandiose. With his reputation already preceding him as one of the greatest military minds in Latin America, and with his love of ‘the Little Corporal’ already being well known, Ubico could instead try to take his fascination with the long deposed French emperor by declaring himself Jorge I, Emperor of Central America while attempting to model this new state on the First French Empire under Napoleon Bonaparte. Though this decision would likely cause outrage and chaos among the ranks of our opponents and critics, they are in no real position to stop him, as Ubico’s armies control the majority of Central America’s expanse. The final decision shall be up to our esteemed leader and savior; may Ubico truly make the best decision for all Central Americans..."

With the droning of our warmachines echoing throughout every city while our patrols further scan every inch of these pristine jungles, we shall ensure every inch of this isthmus of opportunity is secured. While our forces continue to secure our new borders, our administrative staff have been well on their way in their efforts to create a new governmental apparatus to administer these newly-acquired lands. Going forward, a new outline of governance and structure must be adhered too, and there are only two real options available to us. We can either use the locals’ plans on a united Central American state, adhering to their pre-conceived systems and ideas, or instead we could go with an idea of our own design. Using the federal system of the USA as a framework, we could potentially apply the same principles here, creating the United States of Central America. Though many find this plan to be abhorrent and a blatant attempt at ‘Americanizing’ the isthmus, it could also be the region’s best bet at long-lasting stability and unity.

CENmil_industrialization_program_desc: "The industrial base of Central America is very limited and our small heavy industry base can't properly handle the needs of the citizens and of the army. We need to industrialize our nation to take it out of the 17th century into the 20th century."
CENmil_local_manufacturing: "Local Manufacturing"
CENmil_local_manufacturing_desc: "Unlike the industrial regions of the Rhineland or Wallonia, Central America does not possess any concentrated industrial zones and has a very limited consumer goods industry. By promoting local manufacturing and providing help to local producers, we can increase our industrial output."
CENmil_made_in_ca: "Made in Central America"
CENmil_made_in_ca_desc: "So far, most consumer goods in the shops of Central America have printed on them 'Made in Germany', 'Made in Canada',... Instead of protectionist measures to try to kick those products out, we should promote local production so that 'Made in Central America' becomes dominate in the shops of our nation."
CENmil_invite_foreign: "Invite Foreign Investors"
CENmil_invite_foreign_desc: "The government doesn't possesses the funds to industrialize the entire nation on itself. We need to cooperate with our corporate friends and our investing allies to help develop our nation."
CENmil_corporate_investments: "Corporate Investments"
CENmil_corporate_investments_desc: "We need to promote further corporate investments to increase the industrial development of our nation."
CENmil_cheap_labour: "Cheap Labour"
CENmil_cheap_labour_desc: "In order to attract foreign companies, we have reduced corporate taxes significantly and have provided major legal protection. However, one main selling point of Central America remains the very low wages, which permits e.g. American companies to produce much cheaper than in the US."

# Agriculture
CENmil_agricultural_dev: "Agricultural Development"
CENmil_agricultural_dev_desc: "The agriculture sector of Central America remains the most important pillar of our economy, and the majority of foreign investments end up in our farms and plantations. We need to provide additional support in order to mechanize our agricultural sector and to improve the living conditions of our farmers."
CENmil_ufc_protecc: "Protect Corporate Assets"
CENmil_ufc_protecc_desc: "In the chaos that has followed from the Nicaraguan Revolution and the turmoil in the other nations of Central America, our corporate allies have come under serious attack by Syndicalist and liberal forces alike. We need to safeguard the corporate assets so that confidence can be re-established in our economy."
CENmil_ufc_attacc: "Further Land Grants"
CENmil_ufc_attacc_desc: "Foreign companies such as the United Fruit Company hold major influence, both economic and political, in our nation. By providing those companies with additional, tax-free land, they will support the policies of our current administration and increase the agricultural output of our nation."
#CENmil_ufc_politicc: "Political Cooperation"
#CENmil_ufc_politicc_desc: ""
CENmil_cash_crop_export: "Cash Crop Profits"
CENmil_cash_crop_export_desc: "Cash crops make up a significant part of our agricultural output and bring in large profits."
CENmil_efficent_plantations: "Efficient Plantations"
CENmil_efficent_plantations_desc: "Many of the plantations of Central America have a very low output as they use outdated farming methods and are set up in an inefficient way. With additional government funding and educational investments, we can massively increase the agricultural output of our economy."
CENmil_diverse_output: "Diverse Output"
CENmil_diverse_output_desc: "As in any economic sector, we cannot rely on a single type of crop. In case of price fluctuations or crop failure, we need to have a diverse agriculture to overcome the difficulties presented."

### Army
CENmil_army_investments: "Army Investments"
CENmil_army_investments_desc: "The army is the backbone of the entire Republic. The credit for the successful unification goes to our military, and they will protect and expand our Union forever. In order to strengthen the state and the armed forces, the defence budget needs to be drastically increased."

## Warfare with European Characteristics
CENmil_army_european: "European Doctrine"
CENmil_army_european_desc: "The enemies that the Central American Republic faces aren't some unorganized guerrilla forces or an army consisting of a single division. Our enemies to the north and the south have powerful industrial bases, strong airforces and large armies. To defend our way of life, we need to adapt a modern, European doctrine."
CENmil_increase_firepower: "Standardised Equipment"
CENmil_increase_firepower_desc: "Our army currently operates a massive amount of diverse equipment, e.g. we currently use not one but multiple versions of the outdated Mauser rifle! In the chaos that is our military arsenal, nothing short of a massive standardisation program will be able to sort things out."
CENmil_standard_equi: "Heavy Guns"
CENmil_standard_equi_desc: "Our army lacks heavy fire weapons despite the fact that artillery has proven to be decisive in the battles of the Weltkrieg. We need to rapidly equip our army with heavy guns and train specialized battalions to operate them."
CENmil_heavy_guns: "Motorisation Effort"
CENmil_heavy_guns_desc: "As we reform and expand our army, we are facing severe logistical issues. The terrain of Central America is rough and roads are rare, however we still need to get our artillery pieces from the factory or the port to our divisions on the border. Trucks will solve this problem."
CENmil_chain_command: "Reorganise Chain of Command"
CENmil_chain_command_desc: "Just like our military arsenal, our chain of command is nothing short of anarchy. As we are in the process of integrating armies from multiple nations into one, which all had different doctrines and hierarchies, no one knows anymore who takes orders from who and who is on top. We need to fully reorganize the entire chain of command."
CENmil_trained_officers: "Trained Officers"
CENmil_trained_officers_desc: "Our army has a severe lack of low ranking officers, and in general, trained officers who know what they are doing is as rare as successful Syndicalism at the moment. An extensive enrolling and training program will be the first step to fix this terrible issue."
CENmil_border_exercises: "Border Exercises"
CENmil_border_exercises_desc: "The terrain of Central America is very rough and unforgiving, and it is badly mapped. By performing regular exercises and war games near our enemies' borders, we will know the terrain much better than the invaders and at the same time we will train our army."
CENmil_professional_soldiers: "Professional Soldiers"
CENmil_professional_soldiers_desc: "Regular conscripts may have the spirit and the will to fight, however when the first bullets are flying through the air, they will be hopelessly scared. A professional soldier on the other hand will remain calm and do his duty of defending his nation at all times."

## Central Army Tree
CENmil_industrial_warfare: "Industrial Warfare"
CENmil_industrial_warfare_desc: "A strong army isn't an army with a large manpower pool, but an army with a powerful industrial base to back it up. Without a proper economy, no nation will be able to fight in the 20th century."
CENmil_mil_ind_complex: "Military Industrial Complex"
CENmil_mil_ind_complex_desc: "Our military and heavy industries are unable to fully equip and supply our army. The government will need to step in to increase the capacity of the military industrial complex so that every soldier will get the rifle and helmet he needs."
CENmil_scientific_warfare: "Scientific Warfare"
CENmil_scientific_warfare_desc: "A strong army isn't an army with a large manpower poll, or an army with a powerful industrial base to back it up, but an army that has access to the most modern and sophisticated equipment and tactics."
CENmil_military_science: "Military Science"
CENmil_military_science_desc: "Central America doesn't have many educated scientists, and most of them don't work for the military. While we mostly profit of the technologies developed by our allies, we can't remain dependent forever."
CENmil_economic_warfare: "Economic Warfare"
CENmil_economic_warfare_desc: "A strong army isn't an army with a large manpower poll, an army with a powerful industrial base to back it up, or an army that has access to the most modern and sophisticated equipment and tactics, but an army that can use all of these threes with the backing of the entire nation's economy and production capacities."
CENmil_arms_deals: "Arms Deals"
CENmil_arms_deals_desc: "With our limited military industrial capacities, we will have to import most of our equipment for now. By negotiating good deals and trading with our close allies, our army will enjoy modern equipment at a low price."
CENmil_equi_developping: "Equipment Development"
CENmil_equi_developping_desc: "We can't rely forever on imports, as the political environment of the world may change from one day to another, rending our allies our enemies. We need to become more independent on the development and production of equipment."

## Warfare with Central American Characteristics
CENmil_army_ca: "Central American Doctrine"
CENmil_army_ca_desc: "To the north and the south, the enemies we face are much stronger than we are. Even though it is hard to admit, Sandino and his Syndicalist traitors have nonetheless proven that a smaller force can defeat a much larger enemy when using the terrain and the people's support to your advantage."
CENmil_adapt_terrain: "Adapt to the Terrain"
CENmil_adapt_terrain_desc: "Central America's terrain is very rough and unforgiving, except to those who know it well. Throughout the enemies' offensives, we will be able to harass and destroy them thanks to our knowledge of the terrain."
CENmil_autonomous_officers: "Autonomous Officers"
CENmil_autonomous_officers_desc: "Guerrilla warfare requires swift reactions and decisions taken by those who are in eye sight of the enemy, so we will need to give the officers in the field large autonomy to act independently from high command."
CENmil_small_units: "Small Units"
CENmil_small_units_desc: "Waging war in such difficult terrain requires large flexibility and mobility, which larger units don't have. Squads of a couple of men will be able to outmanoeuvre and outsmart the enemy in the jungles and hills of Central America."
CENmil_improved_conscrip: "Improved Conscription"
CENmil_improved_conscrip_desc: "In order to fight off our enemies, we will need to massively increase the size and manpower of our army. We need to increase our levels of conscription to get as many men as possible into the armed forces."
CENmil_guerrila_tactics: "Guerrilla Tactics"
CENmil_guerrila_tactics_desc: "In order to be an efficient guerrilla fighter, one needs to know much more than the environment. The art of camouflage and deception can strongly increase the effectivity of our soldiers, and they will also need to know when to engage and when not to."
CENmil_guerilla_spirit: "Guerrilla Spirit"
CENmil_guerilla_spirit_desc: "It takes an iron will to fight successfully as a guerrilla fighter. Many units will have to survive in terrible conditions, while being hunted by the enemies' air force and artillery."
CENmil_large_force: "Large Force"
CENmil_large_force_desc: "In order to rival the forces of our enemies, we need to further expand the size of our army."

# Finisher of Entire Tree
CENmil_military_awesome: "A Military with a State"
CENmil_military_awesome_desc: "Upon the military rests the entire nation. The army has unified Central America, the army has fought off the enemies of Central America, and the army will keep Central America united. The military doesn't serve the state, but the state serves the military."

### Air and Naval Tree
## Air Tree
CENmil_faca: "The FARCA"
CENmil_faca_desc: "Formed from the airforces of the nations that are now part of the Republic, the Fuerza Area Republicana de Centroamerica will need a much larger budget and more manpower to effectively fulfil its task of defending Central America's airspace."
CENmil_air_lads: "Air Officers"
CENmil_air_lads_desc: "As with every branch of the military, the air force is not a newly created branch but the result of the merging of the airforces of the constitute nations of the Union. As such, it has no standardized chain of command or doctrine and needs reform."
CENmil_aa_positions: "AA Positions"
CENmil_aa_positions_desc: "Our air force is by far not large enough to guarantee that our industrial and infrastructural centres are defended from enemy bombers. In order to protect these vital centres, we need more and better anti air batteries."
CENmil_airfield_expansion: "Airfield Expansion"
CENmil_airfield_expansion_desc: "In order to perform properly, our air force needs new, modernized air bases to operate from."
CENmil_fighters: "FARCA Fighters"
CENmil_fighters_desc: "Our air force is currently mostly operating outdated biplanes. In order to fight the coming air battles, we need to import new, modern designs."
CENmil_cas: "FARCA CAS Aircraft"
CENmil_cas_desc: "Our air force doesn't have a standard close air support aircraft and our best ground supporters are converted fighter biplanes. In order to help our troops, we need to import new, modern designs."
CENmil_bombers: "FARCA Bombers"
CENmil_bombers_desc: "Our air force doesn't possess any heavy aircraft, and as such is unable to perform bombing missions against enemy industrial targets. We need to import new, modern designs."
CENmil_protecc_sky: "Protecting the Sky"
CENmil_protecc_sky_desc: "Thanks to our reforms, our air force is no longer seen as an air farce but as a real fighting force. With the new, modern aircraft and skilled pilots, it will be able to protect the beautiful Central America sky."

## Naval Tree
CENmil_fnca: "The ARCA"
CENmil_fnca_desc: "With our newly formed nation, new needs arise. Previous Central American nations had no need for a large navy, and did little to pursue any sort of naval dominance. With our reunification, we need to reassert ourselves at a regional level, and we can't do so without a navy. As such, we shall found the 'Armada de la Republica de Centro-America' and begin investing in it's development in order to project our power to the rest of Central America, the Caribbean and beyond!"
CENmil_select_main_port: "Selecting a Main Naval Base"
CENmil_select_main_port_desc: "Considering the lack of interest in the past in forming functional navies, all of our ports have been built with trade in mind and are not suitable to hold a large surface fleet. We have several ports in our nation that are very promising options to invest in their improvement, but we need to choose which one, as we obviously don't possess the means to upgrade all of our ports."
CENmil_screens: "Screen Ships"
CENmil_screens_desc: "One of the steps towards establishing a new navy would be to establish a functional escort fleet, which is capable of defending our trade routes from rogue submarines in case of war. It will also help down the line when we can field larger ships, as the escorts are as vital to a large surface fleet as the very flagship. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to establish a fleet fast will be to acquire foreign screen ships until we can establish dockyards of our own."
CENmil_cruisers: "Cruisers"
CENmil_cruisers_desc: "One of the steps towards establishing a new navy would be to acquire a light cruiser that's able to provide support to our forces in the coastline and deal with enemy destroyers in the sea. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to field a cruiser will be to acquire a foreign cruiser for now, at least until we can establish dockyards to sustain a fleet on our own."
CENmil_flagship: "Flagship for our Navy"
CENmil_flagship_desc: "With escort ships and the cruiser ready to set sail, we now need a flagship for our young fleet. With a flagship we could finally start projecting our naval power towards the Caribbean and to finally have the means to face a small fleet in the open sea. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to obtain a flagship will be to acquire it from a foreign power until we can establish dockyards to build a flagship ourselves."
CENmil_naval_lads: "Naval Officers"
CENmil_naval_lads_desc: "With our new fleet, we have a new demand for officers to occupy the helm of our ships, and new admirals to coordinate our fleet. While some nations were in the progress of making a naval academy, like El Salvador, our best choice will be to send our officers to foreign naval academies in order to get acquainted with the modern basics of naval warfare and fleet manoeuvring."
CENmil_merchant_navy: "Central American Merchant Navy"
CENmil_merchant_navy_desc: "Central America not only needs military ships. Our great nation unfortunately lacks many resources that are plentiful in other places of the world, and we cannot continue our development unless we have a way to bring those resources to us. Provided this, we shall invest in a merchant fleet that will be tasked with keeping the Centroamerican trade alive and prosperous."
CENmil_dual_sea_protecc: "Dual Seas Doctrine"
CENmil_dual_sea_protecc_desc: "Our nation is one of the few in the world that occupy two separate oceans at the same time, having ports in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. However, this blessing is also a curse, as we will have to split our efforts in order to cover both oceans at the same time in case of a conflict. Considering we lack the ships in order to win a war by attrition, we need to focus in training our officers so that they can make do with what is available in order to ensure both of our shores are secured from any foreign foe!"

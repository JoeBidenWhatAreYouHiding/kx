As the Nicaraguan Revolution has finally come to an end and as the borders between our nations disappear, our Union shall remain a bastion of freedom and liberty, under guidance of the strongmen of the military.\nWe, as an union of nations, shall stand united against Syndicalism and everything that threatens our way of life."

Jorge Ubico has promised to aid every man, woman and child of Central America, no matter their social class or rank, and has kept his promise along the way.

As the group of traitors was preparing to ambush the president's car using multiple French rifles, loyalist police forces have overwhelmed and arrested the terrorists.

As the Trans-Central American railway is a major prestige project for the government, some advocate that the government takes over the entire cost of the railway. While very costly, that would also guarantee state control of the rails. At the same time, foreign investors are also interested in the construction of the railway and could take over part of the costs."

He could easily go with one of the numerous already-drafted plans made for such an occasion, creating a united Central American state while he himself would take a seat in its interim government, or perhaps he could go with something more...grandiose. With his reputation already preceding him as one of the greatest military minds in Latin America, and with his love of ‘the Little Corporal’ already being well known, Ubico could instead try to take his fascination with the long deposed French emperor by declaring himself Jorge I, Emperor of Central America while attempting to model this new state on the First French Empire under Napoleon Bonaparte. Though this decision would likely cause outrage and chaos among the ranks of our opponents and critics, they are in no real position to stop him, as Ubico’s armies control the majority of Central America’s expanse.

We can either use the locals’ plans on a united Central American state, adhering to their pre-conceived systems and ideas, or instead we could go with an idea of our own design. Using the federal system of the USA as a framework, we could potentially apply the same principles here, creating the United States of Central America.

CENmil_interventionism:0 "Interventionism"
CENmil_interventionism_desc:0 "We cannot rely on the companies and investors only to fix the economic issues that the Republic is facing. The government needs to intervene in the economic process to create new opportunities and to improve the industry and infrastructure of our nation."
CENmil_laissez_faire:0 "Laissez-Faire"
CENmil_laissez_faire_desc:0 "The government is inherently inefficient in matters of economics, and as such we should hand over the job of fixing the economy to the businessmen and investors who have major experience in this sector. The government should only provide safety and inspire confidence in our economy."

# Infrastructure
CENmil_infrastructure_fund:0 "Infrastructure Fund"
CENmil_infrastructure_fund_desc:0 "Central America is missing major roads and railway networks. By rail, you can only get from Guatemala City to San Salvador, and even then, the existing tracks are mostly used by American businesses for freight transportation needs. Many villages and regions of Central America don't even have road connections which can be used by heavy transports. This needs to change!"
CENmil_portuary_expansion:0 "Expanding our Ports"
CENmil_portuary_expansion_desc:0 "The main economic sector of Central America remains the exportation of agricultural products. In order to increase our export capacities and as such the profits, we need to expand our ports to permit for large cargo ships to lay anchor there. Those ports could also come in handy for the ARCA."
CENmil_world_exports:0 "The World Market"
CENmil_world_exports_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector is not seizing to grow, and our exports have reached record values. With access to the entire world market, our farmers will be able to sell produce to the markets of Sofia and Kiev, to Tokyo and Sydney, with large profits."
CENmil_roads_and_rails:0 "Roads and Rails"
CENmil_roads_and_rails_desc:0 "Our economy is growing rapidly, however the poor infrastructure of Central America is keeping our growth rate in limits. The government has launched a new massive program 'Roads and Rails', which provides part of the budget for infrastructure projects to connect the various regions of Central America."
CENmil_infrastructural_profits:0 "Infrastructural Profits"
CENmil_infrastructural_profits_desc:0 "Our infrastructure projects such as the 'Roads and Rails' initiative have cost a lot of money, and have forced the government to take up additional debt. Now that these projects are mostly finished, they are starting to bring in profits through usage fees and the additional economic growth."
CENmil_briding_ca:0 "Bridging Central America"
CENmil_briding_ca_desc:0 "Central America's communication lines are very sparse and the existing lines are poorly maintained. We need to invest strongly in communication technologies such as telegraphs and radio in order to bridge the jungles and hills of Central America while remaining in the government offices."

# Industry
CENmil_industrialization_program:0 "Industrialisation Program"
CENmil_industrialization_program_desc:0 "The industrial base of Central America is very limited and our small heavy industry base can't properly handle the needs of the citizens and of the army. We need to industrialize our nation to take it out of the 17th century into the 20th century."
CENmil_local_manufacturing:0 "Local Manufacturing"
CENmil_local_manufacturing_desc:0 "Unlike the industrial regions of the Rhineland or Wallonia, Central America does not possess any concentrated industrial zones and has a very limited consumer goods industry. By promoting local manufacturing and providing help to local producers, we can increase our industrial output."
CENmil_made_in_ca:0 "Made in Central America"
CENmil_made_in_ca_desc:0 "So far, most consumer goods in the shops of Central America have printed on them 'Made in Germany', 'Made in Canada',... Instead of protectionist measures to try to kick those products out, we should promote local production so that 'Made in Central America' becomes dominate in the shops of our nation."
CENmil_invite_foreign:0 "Invite Foreign Investors"
CENmil_invite_foreign_desc:0 "The government doesn't possesses the funds to industrialize the entire nation on itself. We need to cooperate with our corporate friends and our investing allies to help develop our nation."

CENmil_cheap_labour:0 "Cheap Labour"
CENmil_cheap_labour_desc:0 "In order to attract foreign companies, we have reduced corporate taxes significantly and have provided major legal protection. However, one main selling point of Central America remains the very low wages, which permits e.g. American companies to produce much cheaper than in the US."

# Agriculture
CENmil_agricultural_dev:0 "Agricultural Development"
CENmil_agricultural_dev_desc:0 "The agriculture sector of Central America remains the most important pillar of our economy, and the majority of foreign investments end up in our farms and plantations. We need to provide additional support in order to mechanize our agricultural sector and to improve the living conditions of our farmers."
CENmil_ufc_protecc:0 "Protect Corporate Assets"
CENmil_ufc_protecc_desc:0 "In the chaos that has followed from the Nicaraguan Revolution and the turmoil in the other nations of Central America, our corporate allies have come under serious attack by Syndicalist and liberal forces alike. We need to safeguard the corporate assets so that confidence can be re-established in our economy."
CENmil_ufc_attacc:0 "Further Land Grants"
CENmil_ufc_attacc_desc:0 "Foreign companies such as the United Fruit Company hold major influence, both economic and political, in our nation.

CENmil_efficent_plantations:0 "Efficient Plantations"
CENmil_efficent_plantations_desc:0 "Many of the plantations of Central America have a very low output as they use outdated farming methods and are set up in an inefficient way. With additional government funding and educational investments, we can massively increase the agricultural output of our economy."
CENmil_diverse_output:0 "Diverse Output"
CENmil_diverse_output_desc:0 "As in any economic sector, we cannot rely on a single type of crop. In case of price fluctuations or crop failure, we need to have a diverse agriculture to overcome the difficulties presented."

### Army

CENmil_army_investments_desc:0 "The army is the backbone of the entire Republic. The credit for the successful unification goes to our military, and they will protect and expand our Union forever.

## Warfare with European Characteristics
CENmil_army_european:0 "European Doctrine"
CENmil_army_european_desc:0 "The enemies that the Central American Republic faces aren't some unorganized guerrilla forces or an army consisting of a single division. Our enemies to the north and the south have powerful industrial bases, strong airforces and large armies. To defend our way of life, we need to adapt a modern, European doctrine."
CENmil_increase_firepower:0 "Standardised Equipment"
CENmil_increase_firepower_desc:0 "Our army currently operates a massive amount of diverse equipment, e.g. we currently use not one but multiple versions of the outdated Mauser rifle!

CENmil_standard_equi:0 "Heavy Guns"
CENmil_standard_equi_desc:0 "Our army lacks heavy fire weapons despite the fact that artillery has proven to be decisive in the battles of the Weltkrieg. We need to rapidly equip our army with heavy guns and train specialized battalions to operate them."
CENmil_heavy_guns:0 "Motorisation Effort"
CENmil_heavy_guns_desc:0 "As we reform and expand our army, we are facing severe logistical issues. The terrain of Central America is rough and roads are rare, however we still need to get our artillery pieces from the factory or the port to our divisions on the border. Trucks will solve this problem."
CENmil_chain_command:0 "Reorganise Chain of Command"
CENmil_chain_command_desc:0 "Just like our military arsenal, our chain of command is nothing short of anarchy. As we are in the process of integrating armies from multiple nations into one, which all had different doctrines and hierarchies, no one knows anymore who takes orders from who and who is on top. We need to fully reorganize the entire chain of command."
CENmil_trained_officers:0 "Trained Officers"
CENmil_trained_officers_desc:0 "Our army has a severe lack of low ranking officers, and in general, trained officers who know what they are doing is as rare as successful Syndicalism at the moment. An extensive enrolling and training program will be the first step to fix this terrible issue."
CENmil_border_exercises:0 "Border Exercises"
CENmil_border_exercises_desc:0 "The terrain of Central America is very rough and unforgiving, and it is badly mapped. By performing regular exercises and war games near our enemies' borders, we will know the terrain much better than the invaders and at the same time we will train our army."
CENmil_professional_soldiers:0 "Professional Soldiers"
CENmil_professional_soldiers_desc:0 "Regular conscripts may have the spirit and the will to fight, however when the first bullets are flying through the air, they will be hopelessly scared. A professional soldier on the other hand will remain calm and do his duty of defending his nation at all times."

CENmil_mil_ind_complex:0 "Military Industrial Complex"
CENmil_mil_ind_complex_desc:0 "Our military and heavy industries are unable to fully equip and supply our army. The government will need to step in to increase the capacity of the military industrial complex so that every soldier will get the rifle and helmet he needs."

CENmil_economic_warfare_desc:0 "A strong army isn't an army with a large manpower poll, an army with a powerful industrial base to back it up, or an army that has access to the most modern and sophisticated equipment and tactics, but an army that can use all of these threes with the backing of the entire nation's economy and production capacities."
CENmil_arms_deals:0 "Arms Deals"
CENmil_arms_deals_desc:0 "With our limited military industrial capacities, we will have to import most of our equipment for now. By negotiating good deals and trading with our close allies, our army will enjoy modern equipment at a low price."
CENmil_equi_developping:0 "Equipment Development"
CENmil_equi_developping_desc:0 "We can't rely forever on imports, as the political environment of the world may change from one day to another, rending our allies our enemies. We need to become more independent on the development and production of equipment."

## Warfare with Central American Characteristics
CENmil_army_ca:0 "Central American Doctrine"
CENmil_army_ca_desc:0 "To the north and the south, the enemies we face are much stronger than we are.

CENmil_adapt_terrain:0 "Adapt to the Terrain"
CENmil_adapt_terrain_desc:0 "Central America's terrain is very rough and unforgiving, except to those who know it well. Throughout the enemies' offensives, we will be able to harass and destroy them thanks to our knowledge of the terrain."
CENmil_autonomous_officers:0 "Autonomous Officers"
CENmil_autonomous_officers_desc:0 "Guerrilla warfare requires swift reactions and decisions taken by those who are in eye sight of the enemy, so we will need to give the officers in the field large autonomy to act independently from high command."
CENmil_small_units:0 "Small Units"
CENmil_small_units_desc:0 "Waging war in such difficult terrain requires large flexibility and mobility, which larger units don't have. Squads of a couple of men will be able to outmanoeuvre and outsmart the enemy in the jungles and hills of Central America."
CENmil_improved_conscrip:0 "Improved Conscription"
CENmil_improved_conscrip_desc:0 "In order to fight off our enemies, we will need to massively increase the size and manpower of our army. We need to increase our levels of conscription to get as many men as possible into the armed forces."
CENmil_guerrila_tactics:0 "Guerrilla Tactics"
CENmil_guerrila_tactics_desc:0 "In order to be an efficient guerrilla fighter, one needs to know much more than the environment. The art of camouflage and deception can strongly increase the effectivity of our soldiers, and they will also need to know when to engage and when not to."
CENmil_guerilla_spirit:0 "Guerrilla Spirit"

CENmil_faca:0 "The FARCA"
CENmil_faca_desc:0 "Formed from the airforces of the nations that are now part of the Republic, the Fuerza Area Republicana de Centroamerica will need a much larger budget and more manpower to effectively fulfil its task of defending Central America's airspace."
CENmil_air_lads:0 "Air Officers"
CENmil_air_lads_desc:0 "As with every branch of the military, the air force is not a newly created branch but the result of the merging of the airforces of the constitute nations of the Union. As such, it has no standardized chain of command or doctrine and needs reform."
CENmil_aa_positions:0 "AA Positions"
CENmil_aa_positions_desc:0 "Our air force is by far not large enough to guarantee that our industrial and infrastructural centres are defended from enemy bombers. In order to protect these vital centres, we need more and better anti air batteries."
CENmil_airfield_expansion:0 "Airfield Expansion"

## Naval Tree
CENmil_fnca:0 "The ARCA"
CENmil_fnca_desc:0 "With our newly formed nation, new needs arise. Previous Central American nations had no need for a large navy, and did little to pursue any sort of naval dominance. With our reunification, we need to reassert ourselves at a regional level, and we can't do so without a navy. As such, we shall found the 'Armada de la Republica de Centro-America' and begin investing in it's development in order to project our power to the rest of Central America, the Caribbean and beyond!"
CENmil_select_main_port:0 "Selecting a Main Naval Base"
CENmil_select_main_port_desc:0 "Considering the lack of interest in the past in forming functional navies, all of our ports have been built with trade in mind and are not suitable to hold a large surface fleet. We have several ports in our nation that are very promising options to invest in their improvement, but we need to choose which one, as we obviously don't possess the means to upgrade all of our ports."
CENmil_screens:0 "Screen Ships"
CENmil_screens_desc:0 "One of the steps towards establishing a new navy would be to establish a functional escort fleet, which is capable of defending our trade routes from rogue submarines in case of war. It will also help down the line when we can field larger ships, as the escorts are as vital to a large surface fleet as the very flagship. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to establish a fleet fast will be to acquire foreign screen ships until we can establish dockyards of our own."
CENmil_cruisers:0 "Cruisers"
CENmil_cruisers_desc:0 "One of the steps towards establishing a new navy would be to acquire a light cruiser that's able to provide support to our forces in the coastline and deal with enemy destroyers in the sea. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to field a cruiser will be to acquire a foreign cruiser for now, at least until we can establish dockyards to sustain a fleet on our own."
CENmil_flagship:0 "Flagship for our Navy"
CENmil_flagship_desc:0 "With escort ships and the cruiser ready to set sail, we now need a flagship for our young fleet. With a flagship we could finally start projecting our naval power towards the Caribbean and to finally have the means to face a small fleet in the open sea. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to obtain a flagship will be to acquire it from a foreign power until we can establish dockyards to build a flagship ourselves."
CENmil_naval_lads:0 "Naval Officers"
CENmil_naval_lads_desc:0 "With our new fleet, we have a new demand for officers to occupy the helm of our ships, and new admirals to coordinate our fleet. While some nations were in the progress of making a naval academy, like El Salvador, our best choice will be to send our officers to foreign naval academies in order to get acquainted with the modern basics of naval warfare and fleet manoeuvring."
CENmil_merchant_navy:0 "Central American Merchant Navy"
CENmil_merchant_navy_desc:0 "Central America not only needs military ships. Our great nation unfortunately lacks many resources that are plentiful in other places of the world, and we cannot continue our development unless we have a way to bring those resources to us. Provided this, we shall invest in a merchant fleet that will be tasked with keeping the Centroamerican trade alive and prosperous."
CENmil_dual_sea_protecc:0 "Dual Seas Doctrine"
CENmil_dual_sea_protecc_desc:0 "Our nation is one of the few in the world that occupy two separate oceans at the same time, having ports in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. However, this blessing is also a curse, as we will have to split our efforts in order to cover both oceans at the same time in case of a conflict. Considering we lack the ships in order to win a war by attrition, we need to focus in training our officers so that they can make do with what is available in order to ensure both of our shores are secured from any foreign foe!"

### Descriptions ###

POLITICS_PIO_DESC:0 "Padre Pio is many things, a Priest, a Friar, a Soldier, a Leader, a Mystic. Above all else, A servant of the Lord and His Church. Born to a devout peasant family in Southern Italy, Francesco Forgione decided from a young age to devote his life to God. Upon joining the Order of Friars Minor at the age of 15, Forgione took the name Pio. With the entry of Italy into the Weltkrieg, the now ordained Padre Pio was drafted into the Medical Corps. As Italy collapsed, he returned to his community, just in time for syndicalist insurgents to sack his monastery and kill four of his brothers. Shortly after, stigmata wounds appeared on his hands. It was then that Padre Pio learned of God’s plan for him. Joining an anti-syndicalist militia as Chaplain, his resolve quickly took him to the position of Commander. With God guiding his destiny, Pio has become the most powerful man in the NeoSanfedisti. No amount of suffering will stop Padre Pio from reviving the Church to truly embrace Christ’s message of Purity and Unity."

POLITICS_ZIGGI_DESC:0 "Renato Ziggiotti has not always been a priest, he has not always been a solider, but for the past twenty years he has done almost nothing but fight, trying to free the people of Italy from the socialist menace. Born October 9, 1892 in Campodoro, Ziggiotti lived a fairly normal childhood, entering the Salesian Novitiateon on September 15, 1909. However, the Weltkrieg would shatter his attempt to live as a simple religious, as he along with many of his brothers would be enlisted in the Italian army, first seeing combat in June 1915. Ziggiotti would do fairly well in the army, up until he was shot in the arm in 1917, knocking him out of the fight. In his time in recovery, he would study theology, and first feel his call to the priesthood. When he was eventually discharged from hospital he would be sent back to the collapsing Austrian front. Before he could get to the front, Austria was rapidly approaching Rome, leading to the capitulation of Italy. Ziggiotti as with thousands of other soldiers expected this to be the end of the war but in fact it was only the beginning. As a coalition of Nationalists and Socialists rose up in defiance to Austria and it's newly created Italian Federation, Ziggiotti would find himself leading a group of men against these rebels. As Austrian and Federal troops began to crush the so-called Italian Republic, the Socialist half of the Republic fled to the South, leaving the nationalists for dead. Ziggiotti, now a Captain , and his men were one of the first units sent to the south. Ziggiotti fought hard, but just like the thousands of other men sent to the South they were unable to dislodge the socialists. That was until the Cardinal Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi issued a call to arms. Despite just arriving in the south, the SRI had already begun to commit horrendous crimes against the Church and her clergy. The Cardinal had been imprisoned just before he called on all faithful Catholics of Italy to form a New Army of Holy Faith, a NeoSanfedisti. Ziggiotti (along a few other units) heard this call and took action. Crossing the border, these units would form the professional backbone of the NeoSanfedisti. The first major action of the NeoSanfedisit was the saving of Cardinal Ascalesi. In reward of this, Cardinal Ascalesi  would ordain Ziggiotti after hearing of his desire to become a priest. Since that day, Padre Ziggiotti has become the defacto leader of the NeoSanfedisti, being the one to propose the idea of the Leadership Council. Now that he has been elected to truly lead them, Ziggiotti will do whatever it takes to create a truly holy Italy."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_ISIS_DESC:0 "The Leadership Council of the NeoSanfedisti is less a formal military high command and more a way to keep the disparaging militias of the Army of Holy Faith from attacking each other as much as they do the Socialist Republic of Italy. Formed to unite the various militias of the Faithful who rose in response to the SRI pushing to the south, it cannot be said that the Leadership Council has not done it's job. Prior to the Leadership Council's creation, it was not uncommon to see fellow Catholics attacking one another over trivial issues. With the NeoSanfedisti coming on top of the SRI once and for all, these issues are once again bubbling to surface, and it is likely that the Leadership Council will finally be dissolved once it's hold over the south is consolidated."

POLITICS_PIO_LEO_DESC:0 "Padre Pio is many things, a Priest, a Friar, a, Soldier, a Leader, a Mystic. Above all else, A servant of the Lord and His Church.

No amount of suffering will stop Padre Pio from reviving the Church to truly embrace Christ’s message of Purity and Unity.\nWith the NeoSanfedisti uniting Italy and the previous Pontiff naming Pio his direct successor, Padre Pio is no longer a simple priest, but the earthly head of the Catholic Church! Upon becoming the Roman Pontiff, Pio took the name Leo, the fourteenth pontiff of that name, after Saint Leo the Great, the great defender of orthodoxy. Many within the Church and beyond interpret Pio's papal name to mean the the Papacy will be taking a hard traditionalist bent in the coming years."

Many within the Church and beyond interpret Pio's papal name to mean the the Papacy will be taking a more moderate approach to running the Church, many also expect that His Holiness will focus and encourage missionary activity, to bring the gospel to all nations."

POLITICS_TOGLIATTI_DESC:0 "Palmiro Tolgatti was born in Genoa in 1893 to a well-off middle-class family, his father was an accountant and his mother was a teacher. In 1911 Tolgatti's Father passed away from Cancer which led to his family falling into poverty, Tolgatti would join the Italian Socialist Party around this time too. After graduating from the University of Turin in 1917, Tolgatti served as a Volunteer army officer in the Weltkrieg but he was wounded in action and sent home to heal. During the breakdown of order in the 1920s in Italy, he was able to gather enough supporters to aid in the socialist rebellion that was taking Italy by storm at the time, although they were pushed south by Austria, Tolgatti had helped secure the independence of the Socialist Republic of Italy. Tolgatti has been sworn in as the second Chairman of the Socialist Republic and began to enact sweeping reforms across the agrarian areas that they control, he has also been accused of rigging the elections or strongarming the government to stay in power, Tolgatti has denounced these claims however. Chairman Palmiro Tolgatti is one of the most powerful men in the Italian Peninsula, time will only tell if he can keep that power."

POLITICS_VITTORIO_DESC:0 "Born in Apulia, Cerignola, into a family of poor agricultural laborers in 1892, Di Vittorio became an active socialist at a young age. Joining socialist youth movements at the age of 15 he quickly used his charisma and work ethic to move up from ranks. Joining the May 1904 general strike, during which several workers were killed, Di Vittorio witnessed first hand the inequalities suffered by the working class. Inspired by the Fasci Siciliani in the late 19th century, he became an anarcho-syndicalist union leader who galvanised the masses. Supporting militarism and intervenism, he held nationalist views like his close comrades, De Ambris and Mussolini. When the Weltkrieg came to an end and Italy faced a humiliating defeat, Di Vittorio was one of the leading instigators of the revolution. After the revolutionaries were pushed south by a Central Powers intervention, he used his charisma to rally the syndicalist militias who entrenched themselves preventing a complete collapse of the revolution. Now first Chairman of the Socialist Republic, Di Vittorio is eager to reclaim the rest of the Italian peninsula, and secure Italy’s place in the world!"

POLITICS_LABRIOLA_DESC:0 "Born in Naples on 21 January 1872, Arturo Labriola began his political activities at a young age. Joining the Republican-Socialists in 1891 he moved on to join the most influential movement of his life, the Fasci Siciliani Arising from the poor living conditions of rural peasants in Sicily this movement directly appealed to Labriola who was a strong adherent to democratic socialism. Labriola was an active member and would later serve as an organiser of several strikes in Milan. After brutal repressions against the strikes he fled into exile, living in Paris he worked with Georges Sorel who’s nationalist rhetoric would influence his later views. Returning to Italy he took part in the popular syndicalist movement and also lent his support to the pro-war interventionists.\n\n With the collapse of the Italian Front and outbreak of the revolution, Labriola eagerly took part in the newly formed Socialist Republic, when the S.R.I was pushed south by the Austrian-German intervention he too joined the fleeing government. However his support for syndicalism and the S.R.I would not last long, leaving the Unione Sindacalista after coming into disagreement with Chairman Di Vittorio. He then joined the Unione Socialista Cristiana, finding similarities between their devotion to Christ and agrarian socialist stances to the Fasci Siciliani. However now seeing the bureaucratic and militaristic S.R.I regime as betraying the working class he founded his own movement, based on the Fasci Siciliani. The Fascio Italiano dei lavoratori has found popularity amongst the peasantry with his ideology of Fascism providing hope to the poorest of Italy..\n\n When the Naples collapse broke out he used his new found popularity to rally the workers in defence against the invasive reactionary forces, now in control of Southern Italy he hopes to rebuild the region as a democratic and socialist land that can reunite their northern comrades..."

POLITICS_CALOGERO_VIZZINI_DESC:0 "Few criminals in the world have ever reached such renown status as Calogero Vizzini. His operations in Sicily being enough to topple a standing government and put Southern Italy under the control of a ruthless crime syndicate. Yet, despite Calogero Vizzini infamous status within the Mafia, he carries himself as a gentleman who only resorts to violence when he needs to and respects the people under his care. To some, he is a man if honour, to others he is a ruthless boss. But regardless, his power over the South is large, and the power of the Mafia over his fiefdom is nearly absolute. The South is governed by crime, even if Vizzini can conduct his operations in a somewhat legal matter. "

POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last 20 years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a sovereign nation and the leader of the Italian Federation, at least in an interim fashion. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after 6 years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many work to mantain, the matter of the constant syndicalist threat, especially towards His Holiness in Rome, and his lack of a male heir, weigh heavily on him. The creeping feeling of powerlessness, even now as he is a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."
POLITICS_JULIUS_EVOLA_DESC:0 "Baron Julius Evola is one of the most controversial political philosophers in Europe and, perhaps, the world. Devoting himself to an ideology that has been named "Radical Traditionalism", "Legionarism" and "Ultra-Rightism", Evola believes that modern society is in the age that Hinduism refers to as "Kali Yuga", or an age of darkess and choas. Admiring warrior-societies such as the Teutonic Knights, Roman Empire and Ancient Sparta, Evola claims that there is a Western tradition that must be revived to stand against the consumerism found in both capitalism and socialism. As such he is a fierce spiritualist and anti-materialist whom advocates forms of asceticism, holds the current Catholic Church in contempt for meekness and holds supernatural beliefs. His views would have stayed fringe had foreign powers not both passively propped up the unpopular Bourbon dynasty and exiled the House of Savoy, Evola's utter denunciation of which has won him support among nobles in exile including, apparently, the former King of Italy himself, whom Evola ultimately seeks to make the supreme power of the state."

POLITICS_VICTOR_EMMANUEL_III_DESC:0 "The Former King of Italy and Head of the main branch of the House of Savoy has returned from his long exile to find an army of fanatical monarchists at his disposal. He is utterly an admirer of Julius Evola, now his High Chancellor, for making the seemingly impossible come true and bringing to life his aspirations. It helps that the King is also known to harbor reactionary beliefs which grow increasingly right-wing with Evola at his side and the Socialist enemy in the north. He hopes that he and Legion can accomplish the seemingly impossible and defeat the traditional enemies to his power, the republicans, the socialists and the Catholic Church."

In order to build a truly better federation, we must remind the nobles of their faith, we must remind them that they already have a small chance of salvation, let alone if they are cruel to the poor and needy under their care. As for the faithful masses, we must ensure that they are taken care of, in both body and soul. To do this, Padre Ziggiottis has charged the state with the creation of a basic welfare system, so that those who have lost everything can still stand on their feet. "

However, their pedaling of vices is aiding in the moral destruction of the south, so they will have to be dealt with. Although some within our government say the best way to deal with them is too ignore them and focus on reconstruction.

It is only one piece of the puzzle. The second, and perhaps most important piece, is what the great Padre has planned in regards to societal reorganization. With the state already being highly decentralized, the time has come to begin implementing Catholic Corporatism. In order to remove the ideas and distractions of Class from the mind of the people, ALL classes must work together, in one organic body.

No, the way forward for the Church is too look back. What is it that made the Church great? Her Divine Founder, Jesus Christ and what He gave the Church. What Our Lord gave the Church, her most glorious traditions, her beloved saints, her most mysterious and holy rituals, rituals that are able to call God himself whole and entire into a tiny piece of bread!

Some token reforms that the Pope has championed can surely be implemented, just as how several traditional reforms can also be undertaken. The Church shall not fall to extremism. She will instead take things on a case by case basis, to find the best solution for the entire Body of Christ. After all, it is the modern day.

Despite this condemnations, the practice has yet to be formally condemned by a Council. Several of the Council Fathers seek to change this. A proposed decree that has been presented to the Council Fathers would see Freemasonry outlined and explained why it is seen as heretical, and why a Catholic cannot under any circumstances stance join such an origination.

The decree in essence, would turn the Church from teaching and guiding the world as if she had power of it, to one of a missionary, spreading the gospel to a world that knows it not. Along with this return to 'missionary mode' comes permission to say Holy Mass in the local language of the Faithful. This move is highly experimental, and many wonder if it will not come back to bite the Council in the end.

Are we to begin a new era of Crusades? Will the Church work from within all nations to bring Christ to the world? Many expect the Holy Father to make a statement regarding what's next for both the Church and the Apostolic Realm in the coming days to finally put a rest to these great questions that have begun to plague our people."

SRI_knights_of_the_grail:0 "Knights of the Grail"
SRI_knights_of_the_grail_desc:0 "In order to carry out our goals we will need more than loosely organized militias. The Knights of the Grail, named for adventures whom went on that ancient journey, is a highly-esteemed society made up of our most loyal militants armed with our best equipment so that they may answer directly to the Soveriegn without question and cast his enemies into darkness forever."
SRI_aristocratic_funding:0 "Aristocratic Funding"
SRI_aristocratic_funding_desc:0 "While our cause was already supported by a handful of aristocratic exiles our victory should remove doubt as to our ability to come to power.

SRI_anti_clericalism:0 "Anti-Clericalism"
SRI_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "For too long the catholic priests have prevented the centralization of power under the monarch in favor of giving spiritual authority to a Papacy that preaches a modernist slave morality. While the transition out of traditional Catholicism will not be easy a good start would be anti-clericalism that cloaks the issue of the Pope's influence in just as nationalist terms than Spiritual ones."
SRI_hit_papacy:0 "The Vatican is Vulnerable"
SRI_hit_papacy_desc:0 "Even with socialists to the North and their cause discredited the Papal States continues to play their power games, proving they will always aid themselves to the cost of true leadership.

SRI_legionary_order:0 "Legionary Order"
SRI_legionary_order_desc:0 "It is time to establish an official political class based on the values that should that be rewarded; vitality, traditionalism, strength and loyalty.

SRI_heroic_idealism:0 "Heroic Idealism"
SRI_heroic_idealism_desc:0 "It is through heroic experiences that we not only create men but super-men whom display the best of their nation and find themselves in war, until the act becomes holy itself.

SRI_ascetic_values:0 "Ascetic Values"
SRI_ascetic_values_desc:0 "Modernism has chained the species to material wants, the lowest of desires.

#SRI_sardinias_final_offer_desc:0 "Sardinia rightfully belongs to the House of Savoy and while Amadeo's stance against the socialists is admirable it is not his place to dispute Emmanuel's claim.

SRI_magical_societies:0 "Occult Societies"
SRI_magical_societies_desc:0 "Despite as predicted it having lower acceptance among the masses our newly established ruling class has come to embrace Evola's religious beliefs far more comfortably than the alternatives offered by Catholicism and atheism.

SRI_constrained_science:0 "Science Constrained"
SRI_constrained_science_desc:0 "It is no surprise that the vacuous modernist values sciences study of the material world over spiritual exploration.

SRI_spiritual_casteism:0 "Spiritual Casteism"
SRI_spiritual_casteism_desc:0 "At long last the King and our Warrior-Nobility have established total dominance. We must now recognize our internal nations, or castes, so that each individual may live up to their full potential as they were intended to.

### Events ###
socitaly.1.t:0 "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.1.d:0 "With the defeat of France and then the fall of Rome 6 months later,\nan exhausted Italy was left at the mercy of the Central Powers, seemingly destined to be reorganized into her old pre-unification states within an Italian Federation. Just months after the humiliating announcement, enraged socialists and nationalists proclaimed a new Republic of Italy in Torino, and that all treaties signed by the House of Savoy were to be considered null and void. However, not so far away in Roma, Federal militias mobilised. Austria's plans for a united Italian subject were quickly torn to pieces.\n\nAs civil war erupted, the Italian Federation gained seemingly unstoppable momentum, with utter defeat almost certain, the socialist leaders left the nationalists to die, and managed an invasion into Naples with whatever army we had left. With the historical region of Socialist Republic of Italy under the control of the workers, and the French Commune backing us, we were left in a period of deadlock. Which eventually led to ceasefire when the Austrians pulled out.\n\nAfter a ceasefire was declared in 1922, Three Congresses have come and gone, and revolutionary fervor has begun to change the minds of the peasantry. Of course, there are some that would ruin our progress, but they could never be able to take control? Right?"
socitaly.1.a:0 "Forward!"

socitaly.200.t:0 "Uniting Italy"
socitaly.200.d:0 "Italian nationalists have already begun the call for a Second Risorgimento, to unify Italia once more. Spreading the revolution will not be a simple matter, however. The peninsula exists in an uneasy balance: Germany and Austria are wary of any formal alliance between the SRI and the Third Internationale. They know an alliance is inevitable, but any attempt on our part to bring the French and English into a war to reunite Italy under syndicalist rule would draw intervention and start a new Weltkrieg. The Federation in the north is protected by Austria, but under a similar prohibition against starting a war against us. So long as the prospect of German and Austrian interference remains, we must be aware that any war to reunite Italy can only be done with limited Third Internationale support. We have not made a move yet, but we cannot sit idly for much longer - Italy must be reunited!"

### Fourth Congress ###

socitaly.2.d:0 "Today, the Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union begins. The various factions of the Congress will debate economic, internal, and military policies. The Unione Sindacalista seek to push Orthodox Syndicalism, advancing the current policies of the congress, while the Unione Socialista Cristiana desire a government that helps the people, and supporting Christian socialism. Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the Unione Nazionalista, advances the new ideology of Garibaldismo, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."

The Unione Socialista Cristiana has come out strongly supporting Christian Socialism, their representative claiming that even priests can serve socialism as Jesus wanted. The Unione Nazionalista, on the other hand, are claiming that Christianity is archaic, unsuited for the modern age and that State Atheism will help break the chains of ignorance. Finally, the Unione Sindacalista are supporting a middle ground status quo of secularism."

There are those within the Pope's inner circle who suggest this also presents an opportunity: to use the outrage within [SRI.GetNameDef] and fund a resistance movement. While the possibility exists that [SRI.GetNameDef] could discover our connection and go to war with us, the resistance could significantly weaken them and afford us the ability to raise partisans behind enemy lines once the war begins."

The second plan, put forth by the Unione Nazionalista, is nearly the exact opposite.

Finally, the Unione Nazionalista argues that the office of the Papacy is outdated and the Pope should be exiled. What shall be the decision of the Congress?"

The Unione Socialista Cristiana argues for a conciliatory policy, granting general amnesty and focusing on building socialism instead of going after the dissidents. The Unione Sindacalista believes that a propaganda effort to show socialism's progress, combined with a balanced approach to law enforcement, will help change the minds of the dissidents. The Unione Nazionalista, for their part, wants to empower the Ministry of Public Security to clamp down on any dissent against the republic. What shall the Congress decide?"

The Unione Nazionalista believe that Italy should focus on spreading the revolution to all corners of the world while the Unione Sindacalista believe the focus should be first on Europe.

socitaly.46.d:0 "The Unione Sindacalista has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. The question is, who shall be the Chairman? The leading candidates are Comrade Giuseppe Di Vittorio, Alceste De Ambris, Comrade Palmiro Togliatti, and Comrade Angelo Tasca. Who shall be elected?"
socitaly.46.c:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Di Vittorio!"
socitaly.46.e:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Togliatti!"

socitaly.47.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Mussolini!"
socitaly.47.b:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Bianchi!"

socitaly.48.t:0 "No Majority Achieved!"
socitaly.48.d:0 "No faction of the Congress came out on top. The government is deadlocked, and for now, the country is once again thrown into chaos while the leaders attempt to negotiate some kind of compromise."
socitaly.48.a:0 "A compromise must be found!"

socitaly.49.t:0 "Unione Sindacalista and Unione Socialista Cristiana Italiano Compromise"
socitaly.49.d:0 "In an effort to block the dangerous Unione Nazionalista from achieving any kind of power, the Unione Sindacalista and Unione Socialista Cristiana have agreed to form a coalition government. Alceste De Ambris will assume the role as president, while Giacomo Matteotti becomes the new Chairman of the Congress of People's Unions."
socitaly.49.a:0 "Better than nothing"

socitaly.50.t:0 "Prisoner of the Vatican"
socitaly.50.d:0 "His Holiness has locked himself within the Vatican, as previous popes did during the days of the Kingdom of Italy. He refuses to acknowledge that [SRI.GetNameDef] rules Italy. However, so long as he is locked within the Vatican, he can do little but make noise. Now, the debate has been renewed: should we just leave the Pope alone to rant and rave, force the Conclave to pick a socialist Pope, or send him into exile?"
socitaly.50.a:0 "Exile the Pope!"
socitaly.50.b:0 "Make the Conclave elect a socialist priest"
socitaly.50.c:0 "Just let him complain"

socitaly.51.t:0 "The Papal Conclave Begins"
socitaly.51.d:0 "The Papal Conclave has begun! The Holy See shall come together and choose a new pope that shall support Socialism. It may take some time but they will eventually elect a new Pope who will do his part to liberate the faithful from their chains."
socitaly.51.a:0 "They shall choose right!"

socitaly.52.t:0 "A New Pope"
socitaly.52.d:0 "After many days of debating, the Conclave has elected Achille Liènart as John XXIII."
socitaly.52.a:0 "Yay!"

socitaly.53.t:0 "Exiling the Pope"
socitaly.53.d:0 "We have decided that the Pope has no place within our society, and that he shall be exiled. Where he goes, we don't care, but he shall not remain within Italy any longer!"
socitaly.53.a:0 "Get out of here!"

socitaly.54.t:0 "The Pope Arrives in [Root.GetNameDef]"
socitaly.54.d:0 "The Pope has arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] today, seeking refuge from the syndicalists within Italy who have exiled him from the country. A large crowd has already come out to meet the Holy Father. He has requested more permanent residence in one of our cathedrals, until such a time as the Vatican is once more restored to freedom."
socitaly.54.a:0 "Stay as long you want, Holy Father!"

socitaly.65.t:0 "The Vatican Commune"
socitaly.65.d:0 "We have recently concluded a productive meeting with the Pope. A tiny commune will be created around Saint Peter's Basilica called the Vatican Commune that will be independent from the Republic. Meanwhile, he will accept the legitimacy of our Republic and urge Catholics worldwide to do so as well. This marks a great day for the faithful and for the Republic."
socitaly.65.a:0 "Thank you, Holy Father!"

socitaly.66.t:0 "Revolutionary Irredentism"
socitaly.66.d:0 "There are still Italian lands and our Italian brothers and sisters that are held in bondage, and it is time that the Congress take a stance on their liberation. Some suggest focusing on just the ones in Austria, others think that we should focus on them but also include Malta. The Unione Nazionalista call for a true Greater Italia to be created as a new light of socialism in the world."
socitaly.66.a:0 "Just help liberate our comrades in Austria."
socitaly.66.b:0 "Austrian comrades and Maltese comrades both."
socitaly.66.c:0 "Greater Italia shall be the light of socialism!"

socitaly.67.t:0 "The New Lands"
socitaly.67.d:0 "It has been some time, but we have finally liberated our comrades. Now that socialism has come to the new lands of the republic, we can be secure knowing that we shall be a beacon of socialism within the International."
socitaly.67.a:0 "Avanti Italia!"

socitaly.68.t:0 "Trial for Reactionary Leaders"
socitaly.68.d:0 "With our victory over the reactionary forces, the leaders of the corrupt republic and the "noble" leaders of the despotic kingdoms are standing trial. Some want us to be lenient with them while others want us to be harsh and make an example of them. How shall the court rule?"
socitaly.68.a:0 "Lenient. We already have our victory."
socitaly.68.b:0 "Make an example of them."

socitaly.69.t:0 "What to do with Royal Palaces?"
socitaly.69.d:0 "With the conquest of the South, we have taken control of the territory of the Two Kingdom, and as we bring the revolution southward, the question of what to do about the various noble and royal palaces has arisen. Some think that they should be given over to the local communes, others think that the government should use them for the various ministry positions. Finally, some support the idea of giving them over to the Workers Youth League."
socitaly.69.a:0 "Turn them over to the local communes."
socitaly.69.b:0 "Make them government headquarters."
socitaly.69.c:0 "Make them youth camps."

socitaly.70.t:0 "Resistance to Secularism"
socitaly.70.d:0 "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our official policy of secularism is causing problems with reintegrating the Italian people into a cohesive nation. The Catholic Church was far more powerful in the rest of Italy than in our republic. Consequently, many people are trying to resist and slowing the progress of bringing the revolution to the rest of Italy."
socitaly.70.a:0 "They will learn in time."

socitaly.71.t:0 "Christian Socialist Policies Help"
socitaly.71.d:0 "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our Christian socialist policies are proving to be popular with the people and helpful in bringing them to understand the principles of socialism. While there is still quite a bit of resistance among the more dedicated reactionaries, there is less than our strategists expected before the war."
socitaly.71.a:0 "Thank God!"

socitaly.72.t:0 "Land Reform in Northern Italy"
socitaly.72.d:0 "Now that we have control of Northern Italy, it is time to bring land reform to the south and bring the revolution to the southern farmers. The package of land reforms prepared by the Congress will collectivise and give the land back to the farmers. Furthermore, local agriculture unions will be created to bring syndicalism south."
socitaly.72.a:0 "Break the chains!"

socitaly.73.t:0 "Industrialisation for the South"
socitaly.73.d:0 "The south was never industrialised to its full potential. However, now that we have control of the south we can begin a program to industrialise the region. This will help improve the lives of the people living there by bringing jobs and development and lowering inequality across Italy."
socitaly.73.a:0 "Progress moves south!"

socitaly.74.t:0 "Syndicalisation of the Economy"
socitaly.74.d:0 "With Italy now united, the question has arisen as to how to bring the syndicalist economy to the rest of Italy. Some think the best way is to focus on building up the unions in the areas. Others think the best way to syndicalise the rest of the country is to focus on collective farming. A third option is worker co-operatives, especially those that serve the military, which could be the key to revolutionizing the new regions."
socitaly.74.a:0 "Focus on the unions."
socitaly.74.b:0 "Focus on communal farming."
socitaly.74.c:0 "Focus on worker co-operatives."

socitaly.75.t:0 "New Communes"
socitaly.75.d:0 "With the rest of Italy now under our control, new revolutionary communes are being formed throughout the Republic, from Lombardy and Venetia to Sicily and Naples. These communes have become new social centres and bases for spreading the revolution in the areas."
socitaly.75.a:0 "Lunga Vita ai Comuni!"

socitaly.76.t:0 "Resistance to Social Changes"
socitaly.76.d:0 "Since we have united Italy there has been resistance against the various social changes that we have implemented in the Republic since its founding, particularly in the case of women's rights. The changes that we have brought to Italian society will take time, but eventually, the rest of Italy shall accept them."
socitaly.76.a:0 "Damn reactionaries!"

socitaly.77.t:0 "The Ministry of Public Security help prevent trouble"
socitaly.77.d:0 "The Ministry of Public Security have apprehended a number of reactionary traitors to the Republic operating in the south. The Ministers have made sure that no one in the rest of Italy will dare betray the revolution."
socitaly.77.a:0 "The Secret Police to the Rescue!"

socitaly.78.t:0 "Fasci Siciliani Founded"
socitaly.78.d:0 "The original Fasci Siciliani was a socialist movement in Sicily in the 1880s and 1890s. They were eventually crushed, but their legacy was long-lasting; they fought for democracy and socialism and were true revolutionaries. Today, a new Fasci Siciliani has been founded, drawing on the legacy of the old organisation. This new Fasci Siciliani is focusing on spreading the ideals of the republic into Sicily."
socitaly.78.a:0 "Long live the Fasci!"

socitaly.79.t:0 "Exhibition of the Revolution"
socitaly.79.d:0 "In 1919 the Socialist Republic of Italy was proclaimed. However, the resulting civil war would leave Italy divided. Since then, we have erased these false borders, reunified Italy, and brought the revolution to all corners of our country! To demonstrate our glorious victory to the people, a grand exhibition of the revolution and our struggles and losses has been unveiled in Roma. Celebrating the struggle to bring syndicalism to all corners of Italy, it will no doubt help to educate the masses about the revolution and inform them of the glory of a reunited Italy."
socitaly.79.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

socitaly.80.t:0 "Women Entering Politics"
socitaly.80.d:0 "While women have been legally allowed to vote, work in politics, and sit in the National Congress since the founding of our Republic, it is only now that we have unified Italy that women throughout the whole of the country enjoy these rights. Many women, especially those from the south and the northeast where the reactionaries ruled, are now taking steps to enter politics for the first time in their lives, from local unions and communes to the Congress itself."
socitaly.80.a:0 "Great!"

socitaly.84.t:0 "Female Red Guard Divisions"
socitaly.84.d:0 "With the decision to create the Gruppi di Difesa della Donna, a number of women have formed their own defence unit based out of the city of Livorno. These women have called their unit the Prospero Brigade in honour of the minister who helped create the Gruppi in the first place."
socitaly.84.a:0 "We need every man and woman we can get!"

socitaly.85.t:0 "The Worker-Priest Movement"
socitaly.85.d:0 "The Worker-Priest movement is a movement for the priests of the Catholic Church to help connect to the faithful by working in factories like the laity. The movement is rather popular in the Republic at the moment, and affords the priests the opportunity to connect more closely to the people. Sometimes, sermons can even be heard inside factories and workshops after hours, as the faithful listen to the priests at the end of a long day."
socitaly.85.a:0 "Jesus was a carpenter, after all."

socitaly.86.t:0 "Christian Associations of Italian Workers"
socitaly.86.d:0 "The Christian Associations of Italian Workers, or Associazioni Cristiane dei Lavoratori Italiani (often abbreviated as ACLI), are the largest Catholic lay organisation within the Republic. The goal of the organisation is to help Catholics follow and live in accordance with the philosophy of Christian socialism. Unsurprisingly, the Associazioni are heavily connected with the Christian Socialist Union within the National Congress."
socitaly.86.a:0 "Let us follow in the steps of Jesus."

socitaly.87.t:0 "Futuristic Architecture"
socitaly.87.d:0 "'This is the greatest absurdity of modern architecture. It is perpetuated by the greedy complicity of academies, internment camps for the intelligentsia, where the young are forced to recopy classical models onanistically instead of straining their imaginations to search for solutions to new and urgent problems: the Futurist house and city. A house and city spiritually and materially our own, in which our riotous activity can rage without seeming a grotesque anachronism.' So reads the Futurist Manifesto of architecture. Futurism as an architectural movement has recently been highly popular among the Unione Nazionalista. Mussolini, in particular, is a noted patron of architects building in that style."
socitaly.87.a:0 "The Future is now!"

socitaly.88.t:0 "Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana"
socitaly.88.d:0 "The Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana, or Italian Recreational and Cultural Association, is the largest recreational society within the Republic. Founded in N in the 1920s and later relocated to Palermo, the organisation is purely secular, and its goal is to help support recreational activities for the people as well as to support solidarity amongst the citizens of the Republic. Culture that was once only the purview of the elites, such as opera, plays, and classical music, are now available for the people to enjoy. Furthermore, the Associazione supports book clubs, countryside vacations, and more through arrangements with local communes and unions."
socitaly.88.a:0 "Culture belongs to the masses!"

socitaly.89.t:0 "Unione Donne Italiane Congress"
socitaly.89.d:0 "'We don't see why the revolution is in the hands of only half the population. We are anarchists, but we are also women and we want to make our revolution. Not have men make it for us. We don't want a struggle designed to fit the male because we'll be screwed, as always. We want to fight so that we can claim our part in the share-out. We want to make it clear that just now we're beside ourselves with joy and it would be a mistake to keep us at home knitting! We want to die! But we want to die like men, not live like servants!' So said Ada Prospero at the annual congress of the Unione Donne Italiane, the largest women's organisation in the republic. The Union's goal is dedicated to women's emancipation and liberation. Ada Prospero, in particular, supports the creation of female combat units to fight for the unification of Italy."
socitaly.89.a:0 "We shall see."

socitaly.90.t:0 "1937 Championship between Bari and Naples"
socitaly.90.d:0 "The 1936-1937 Series A Finale for the Italian football league championship has reached the last round. Naples playing against Bari. Bari is the clear favourite to win, as they are the current reigning champions; however, the Naples team this year is playing strong. Who shall win the championship for this year?"
socitaly.90.a:0 "Who shall win, indeed!"

socitaly.91.t:0 "Bari Wins 1937 Championship game!"
socitaly.91.d:0 "It was a close match, but Bari won with a score of 2-1, remaining as the reigning champions of the Italian League. Naturally, the city of Bari is celebrating this victory."
socitaly.91.a:0 "Bari remains the champions!"

socitaly.92.t:0 "Naples Wins 1937 Championship Game!"
socitaly.92.d:0 "In a stunning upset, the Naples team defeated Bari 1-0. For the first time in just under a decade, the reigning champions were defeated. The city of Naples will surely be celebrating all night after this stunning victory."
socitaly.92.a:0 "Naples are the new champions!"

socitaly.100.t:0 "The Founding of Cinecittà"
socitaly.100.d:0 "Benito Mussolini unveiled the opening of Cinecittà today outside the city of Naples. Cinecittà was planned by numerous architects to be less of a film studio and more of a small cinema city. Mussolini himself was quoted as saying during the opening of the studio: 'Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism.'. Many aspiring filmmakers are already speaking with the unions of the area to see about producing films there, while some are already calling it Hollywood on the Arno."
socitaly.100.a:0 "Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism!"

socitaly.101.t:0 "Death of Filippo Turati"
socitaly.101.d:0 "Today, the great statesman Filippo Turati has passed away at the age of 79 years old. Filippo Turati was one of the last surviving founders of the Italian Socialist Party. His strong and constant support of the rights of the workers of Italy from his earliest days has made him famous throughout the Republic. In addition to founding the Socialist Party of Italy, he was also one of the principal architects of the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Italy. The funeral in Naples was attended by visitors from nations around the world and officials from across the political spectrum, all paying their respects to the late great leader as various labour songs were sung, including Inno dei Lavoratori which he penned himself."
socitaly.101.a:0 "The passing of a torch."

socitaly.102.t:0 "Maggio Musicale Napoletano"
socitaly.102.d:0 "In the city of Naples, conductor Vittorio Gui has created a new festival called the Maggio Musicale Napoletano, dedicated to performing operas and musicals free of charge for the people so that way the classics can be enjoyed by all citizens, not just the privileged elites. The opening opera for the festival was Giuseppe Verdi's Nabucco. While it is the first of its kind in Italy, Vittorio Gui has stated he hopes that the Maggio Musicale's success can be replicated in cities throughout the Republic."
socitaly.102.a:0 "Opera for the People!"

socitaly.103.t:0 "Enrico Fermi creates the Naples Pile-1"
socitaly.103.d:0 "Enrico Fermi has recently created the Naples Pile-1; the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Created with the help of students from the University of Naples Federico II, the device may have only been capable of generating a half watt of power, but its success proves that a nuclear reactor can be built."
socitaly.103.a:0 "Comrade Fermi brings progress for the Republic and for the world!"

socitaly.104.t:0 "Enrico Fermi wins Noble Prize"
socitaly.104.d:0 "The physicist Enrico Fermi has recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity. Fermi, who has been a professor at the University of Naples Federico II since the civil war, has published numerous works on physics, especially relating to the new field of nuclear physics. With his Nobel Prize, the Socialist Republic of Italy can celebrate another hero of Italy and of Socialism."
socitaly.104.a:0 "A hero of the Republic!"

socitaly.105.t:0 "Commune of San Marino"
socitaly.105.d:0 "The city-state of San Marino is one of the longest surviving republics on the Italian Peninsula. A relic from the city-state era, San Marino has survived for centuries, lasting from the Roman era all the way to the Risorgimento, and even through the Civil War and the Second Risorgimento. It has long been a haven for refugees from oppression. Today, the elections have brought the Socialists into power in the city-state, and the new Captain Regents are working on bringing syndicalism to their tiny commune. They have assured our republic that they wish to remain friends and seek to build bridges between the two republics."
socitaly.105.a:0 "Greetings Comrades!"

socitaly.106.t:0 "Roma Jazz Festival"
socitaly.106.d:0 "With Rome once again the capital of Italy, a jazz festival has been put on by the various musical unions throughout Italy. Jazz has been within Italy since before the revolution, starting in 1904, though modern Italian Jazz draws inspiration from America. The famed American Jazz musician Louis Armstrong is the highlight of the festival."
socitaly.106.a:0 "Let us enjoy the new music of a new Rome."

socitaly.107.t:0 "Giro d'Italia Refounded"
socitaly.107.d:0 "With Italy reunited, the Giro d'Italia can begin again. The Giro d'Italia is a cycling race that began in 1909, but the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and the ongoing political instability in Italy have altogether prevented the race from being held since 1914. The race course goes from Torino in the north all the way down to Napoli and Bari in the south up back to Milan."
socitaly.107.a:0 "Let the race begin!"

socitaly.108.t:0 "Fausto Coppi Wins the Giro D'Italia"
socitaly.108.d:0 "Fausto Coppi has won the Giro D'Italia, setting a new record. At the age of twenty, he is the youngest cyclist to complete the race. His win has also popularized his training regime and his particular diet, which focuses on whole grains where other racers consume large amounts of red meat."
socitaly.108.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Coppi!"

socitaly.109.t:0 "Spartacus is Released"
socitaly.109.d:0 "Cinecittà has released the epic movie Spartacus. Telling the story of the ancient Roman slave rebellion leader Spartacus, the movie is by all accounts an epic with a cast of thousands. Starting Gino Cervi as Spartacus and directed by Carmine Gallone, the movie has already proven a success and both with critics and the public at large."
socitaly.109.a:0 "I am Spartacus!"

socitaly.110.t:0 "Comrade Ines Donati"
socitaly.110.d.ines_elected:0 "Ines Donati, a strong supporter of the policies of Mussolini and Bianchi, has just been elected for the rank of general in the Red Guards.

Ines Donati is the first woman to be elected as a general from among the troops, and she will shine a beacon for all our female soldiers to follow."
socitaly.110.d.ines_promoted:0 "Ines Donati, a strong supporter of the policies of Mussolini and Bianchi, has just been promoted within the Red Army. She has proven to be rather popular among the soldiers, both men and women.

socitaly.111.d:0 "Comrade Mussolini spoke before a massive crowd today in Rome, declaring that Italy must be purged of all elements of reactionary and capitalist thought, and that the new futurist culture of Italy shall rise from its ashes to build an Italy that is the culmination of the declaration of revolution in 1919."
socitaly.111.a:0 "We must cleanse Italy of corruption!"

socitaly.112.t:0 "Destroy the Cult of the Past"
socitaly.112.d:0 "'With our enthusiastic adherence to Futurism, we will destroy the cult of the past, the obsession with the ancients, and the pedantry and academic formalism that have strangled our society. The past is feudalistic and capitalistic and must be wiped away. The Socialist Republic has no need for the past!' according to a state paper in Torino."
socitaly.112.a:0 "The past is gone!"

socitaly.113.t:0 "Spontaneous Revolutionary Violence"
socitaly.113.d:0 "The leader of the Ministry for Public Security has declared that it will be of no issue if reactionaries are killed by revolutionary violence. This has sparked a wave of violence throughout the country as people engage in spontaneous revolutionary violence against those considered reactionary. When this will be over, no one knows. But the reactionaries shall be purged!"
socitaly.113.a:0 "Death to the reactionaries!"

socitaly.114.t:0 "Bonfire of the Vanities"
socitaly.114.d:0 "In Naples, a massive bonfire was held where citizens threw various 'vanities' considered to be reactionary or capitalistic into the fires. Artwork from before the creation of the Socialist Republic of Italy, books that promoted reactionary thought or un-socialist principles, and household goods deemed bourgeois were also destroyed. This bonfire has been copied by other cities across the republic as many seek to destroy the culture of the past."
socitaly.114.a:0 "Destroy the capitalist vanities!"

socitaly.115.t:0 "Purging the Reactionaries"
socitaly.115.d:0 "A number of the ministers in the government hold rather reactionary views. While they claim to be dedicated to the Republic, we know better. People like Achille Grandi, Giacomo Matteotti, and Giuseppe Saragat are all reactionaries that must be purged! They and others will only corrupt the ideals of socialism and bring back capitalism to the Republic. This will not be allowed!"
socitaly.115.a:0 "We shall not be corrupted!"

socitaly.116.t:0 "Destruction of Churches"
socitaly.116.d:0 "'God does not exist - religion in science is an absurdity, in practice an immorality, and in men a disease.' So proclaims Chairman Mussolini. With that, the attention of the cultural revolutionaries has turned towards Christianity and religion. Churches across Italy have been set upon by Garibaldists. Some have been transformed into town halls, with all sign of them being once a place of worship gone. Even more have been destroyed outright, or laid siege by revolutionaries as devout Christians barricaded themselves in. From the tiny parish churches that dot the towns of Italy to the largest cathedrals in the country, none have been spared. It seems that Comrade Mussolini will not stop until every trace of superstition is destroyed!"
socitaly.116.a:0 "Death to superstition!"

socitaly.117.t:0 "Technicians in the Country and Bureaucrats in the Factories"
socitaly.117.d:0 "The Republic is to not be a bureaucratic republic. However, in the years since its foundation, that has been changing and bureaucrats have been coming back within the government and within the workplaces. In order to make sure that the republic is not bureaucratised, factory technicians and leaders will be made to spend time in the countryside and government bureaucrats will be made to spend time within the factories."
socitaly.117.a:0 "Break the chains!"

socitaly.118.t:0 "Quotations from Chairman Mussolini"
socitaly.118.d:0 "In order to spur on the Cultural Revolution, the thoughts and quotes of Benito Mussolini have been made into a small book that has been printed en masse for citizens to study as they try to follow in the footsteps of the Chairman."

socitaly.119.t:0 "Futurist Food"
socitaly.119.d:0 "As the cultural revolution continues, a book called the Manifesto of Futurist Cooking has been published. Its purpose is to ensure that even the daily habits of eating are transformed. The book has some choice words reserved for pasta; 'No more pasta, as it causes lassitude, pessimism and lack of passion,' a position backed up by Mussolini himself, who is quoted as saying 'a nation of spaghetti eaters cannot have a social revolution'"
socitaly.119.a:0 "Food of the future!"

socitaly.120.t:0 "The Strength of the Army"
socitaly.120.d:0 "As the Cultural Revolution continues, the Army has become more and more important in keeping order and stability. However, within the upper echelons of command, some have started to wonder if the methods of the cultural revolution are productive in building a new society and culture for Italy."
socitaly.120.a:0 "The Army will protect the revolution, of course."

socitaly.121.t:0 "Destruction of Estates"
socitaly.121.d:0 "Many noble estates in the south have been destroyed. The lands of the old S.R.I. held a number of noble estates, and the people in the south have finally decided to destroy these estates and make sure that there is no trace of the relics of the old feudal order."
socitaly.121.a:0 "Death to feudalism!"

socitaly.122.t:0 "Mussolini's Personality Cult"
socitaly.122.d:0 "A cult of personality has begun to grow around Mussolini, thanks to his efforts at using his personal charisma as well as the mass media from newspaper to film to make sure that his image is respected and supported. Portraits of Mussolini have popped up in public and private spaces alike throughout the country."
socitaly.122.a:0 "All for Mussolini!"

socitaly.123.t:0 "Revolutionary Films"
socitaly.123.d:0 "To build a new culture, we must destroy the old one. Archaic plays and operas are no longer to be performed. Instead, using the new film industry, a new culture celebrating the revolution and the Republic will be created. Mussolini, in particular, is sponsoring new actors, actresses and directors that will praise the Cultural Revolution."
socitaly.123.a:0 "Film will bring about a new culture."

socitaly.124.t:0 "End of the Cultural Revolution"
socitaly.124.d:0 "Tragically and somewhat mysteriously, Mussolini has died in a plane crash. With his death, Michele Bianchi has assumed control of the Republic. Bianchi has declared that the Cultural Revolution has been victorious and as such, it should come to an end. With its end, he has begun to slowly scale back some of the 'reforms' that were passed during the Revolution, notably the enforcement of futurist food."
socitaly.124.a:0 "The Revolution is over."

socitaly.125.t:0 "The End of the Revolution"
socitaly.125.d:0 "Mussolini has declared in Rome that the Cultural Revolution is now at an end. The reactionary culture that has infected Italy since the Republic was declared is gone. Today, the sun shines on a new Italia, and the violence and chaos that has reigned over Italy has begun to subside. Life has been changed, but the Republic has been made stronger; or at least, that is what Comrade Mussolini says. It is clear, though, that his grip on power is now absolute."
socitaly.125.a:0 "The Revolution is over."

socitaly.126.t:0 "Syndicalist Partisans Rise Up"
socitaly.126.d:0 "We've always had suspicions that there was an underground network of syndicalists preparing for the day when we and [SRI.GetNameDef] went to war. Their numbers are not overwhelming, but their appearance behind our lines is unexpected, and they have caused a fair amount of disruption throughout the country."
socitaly.126.a:0 "It will change nothing"

It's generally agreed to be an assasination attempt by "The Sons of Hyperborea", an extreme Evolian group that has affilations with the Noble Legion of the Awakening and are said to be behind a string of terrorist attacks with this being their most dangerous one. While there is no evidence of him being directly involved and denying that he encouraged it Evola nonethless defended the attempt on Manduzio's life as defending the "Aryan Spirit" from someone whom is using his mystical abilites "in aid of the Materialistic Spirit that abetted our descension into Kali Yuga". While some anti-Semites and superstituous elements of society are in agreement with this the attack and Evola's apologism has angered the public and political class unlike the more popular vigilante attacks on syndicalists and criminals that his supporters have conducted.

However more religiously fervent and morally disgusted members of the Integralist coalition, including Bernardo Attolico, Carmine Senise and Luigi Rizzo have refused to pledge loyalty and simply stated that they would continue to oppose "demonic demagoguery".

The King has reassured the people he is merely opposing the presently pseudo-Christian Vatican for weakening the state while Evola has privately done the opposite with the Legion and declared the Holy War against darkness as truly beginning.

Nonetheless from the supplies found it is both clear they were receiving foreign funding and, more importantly, have lost too much to recover as they have been chipped away at for too long to handle a blow of this size. While not all citizens have embraced us this may mark the end of our largest internal political resistance.

When only a small detachment of Legionaries or a Grail Knight enter the region they are ambushed so we must act in absolution. We could either put Sicily under siege and use our navy to block them from supplies until the rebel leaders turn themselves in or the population turns on them. Or we could land a garrison on the island to fight their way to the capital and eliminate all listed enemies, followed by hunting down rural mob bosses."

While the King does not seem enthusiastic about Evola's more revolutionary views he nonetheless lavished praise on him for his loyalty to the Aristocracy and his respectulfulness towards his majesty, noting that he and the Legion's undying loyalty will be repaid in full and the socialists will be pushed back into the French Commune."

Any churches deemed abandoned are now under the control of King Emmanuel III, to the outrage of the Papacy. Baron Evola would like to repurpose them as Legion posts where ceremonies can be held but other proposals are to hand it to the Nobility as a reward for loyalty or allow the serfs to take them over. However some Legionaries have rejected each of these proposals and have stated that they should be stripped clean of their riches by the state then burned to the ground to help end Papal influence in Two Siciles, an alternative Evola himself does not seem opposed to. While the King is known to be anti-clerical and to have a hatred of the Pope's attempts to control him most are unsure he would go so far."

Much of the cause of these demands are from Evola's denunciation of monogomy for being what he views as a means for women to enslave male virility to "Eros", claiming not only that classrievolaal civilizations allowed the practice but that the domination of women was a natural way of expressing the male spirit. On a practical level it would also allow for a faster growing population of Legionaries. While the King is surprised by this turn of events he is also well aware this could keep the Nobles happy if he instituted it just for them and this would have less impact on society. On the other hand he could inspire soldiers by allowing them to take concubines via conquest if their Commander allows it as well. What shall he do?"

We have lost a fair few soldiers already but it is obvious we will eventually retake the city as the rebels have no other support and are largely acting out of desperation. We could attempt to capture the city with the troops although we would likely lose many men in the process. Or, ironically, we could learn from the legacy of Cesare Borgia only with the Papacy on the receiving end this time and use artillery bombardment to force their surrender. Finally we could try to level the city completely, which will destroy the city completely with explosives followed by razing which will set a useful example in the future and finish off the rebels."

A first stop for this would be that symbol of the Roman Empire's greatness and of warrior virtues, namely the Colosseum which they desire to seen rebuilt to its former glory.

They both fought well, however in the end the murmillo overcame the retiarius, pinning him to the floor with his foot. He then looked to the crowd and saw that nearly half of whom showed their thumbs to symbolize finishing the fallen foe with his sword, while the rest showed compressed fists that hid their thumb to symbolize sparing the man and sheathing the sword. Unsure of what to do he looked to the king to decide."

A former soldier and footballer whom was arrested for being a suspected anti-Legion integralist supporter his Lord now looks upon him with great esteem and lavishly rewards him for his fighting ability.

srievola.1360.d:0 "With our society establishing the norm of asceticism and fighting for what Baron Evola celebrates as the triumph of Roman values over fatalistic Etruscan ones many of the Knights have begun to sell off valuables that are viewed as overly ornate or comforting and are expecting citizens to do the same. Some of our followers have even begun to raid taverns that are viewed as promoting hedonistic activities that posses no higher spiritual value. This line-of-thinking includes overthrowing the remaining banks, corporations and foreign owned properties that are viewed as disloyal or corrupt and putting them under the Kings domain and destroying utterly useless 'technologies' such as television. All of the collected materials are seemingly going towards the military whenever possible."

srievola.1370.d:0 "The Radical Traditionalists have long believed in a form of spiritual racism, in which blood contains the psychological elements of tradition and provides the life-force for a people. With this racial mixing has been banned and the Aryan-Roman has a clearly higher status than others within our territory. The question now remains of how to treat those of minority ancestry with two proposals given. One is to allow them to organize into their own hierarchies modeled on our values for those whom pledge loyalty to the King, pay tribute, pledge soldiers to our wars and acknowledge the Kings and his Nobles supremacy. This way we can use the best of the aristocratic spirit that exists amongst themselves for our own purposes. Or as Arthur Reghini and much of the Legion have strongly pushed for we could simply place them in our lowest class and let them prove themselves in combat when the time comes."

However this is once again an opportunity to learn from our ancestors rather than institute a crude monetary system by instituting the Corvee System which will replace taxes for those whom can't pay them with required days of government directed labor. Corvees will have greater rights than the class beneath them, the slaves, but nonetheless are required to carry out their work. The labor this will provide us with will also allow our economy to exit the worst that Black Monday caused, for whatever that's worth."

Overall they are still a fringe but among those whom believe their support is strong, they practice asceticism and many in the Legion whom are superstituous are shifting towards such views."

There is no question the Count would win and Evola has advised the King to allow it for the King's time is too important to micromanage every petty dispute of honor among the upper-class and that duels will encourage a culture of "truth, bravery and honor".

This failed of course but due to our reputation they decided to fight to the last man and women which made it especially costly to us, with the event already being called the Pillage of Catanzaro. More pressingly however the revolt only seemed to get out of hand because local soldiers decided to retreat instead of fighting them as ordered by their legionary commanders! We will need to set a precendent to make sure this does not happen again. The most popular proposal is to revive the Roman practice of decimatio, in which all of the disobedient soldiers will draw from a lottery and the ten percent who get the "losing straws" will be beaten to death by their comrades. Less popular proposals include leaving it in the hand of the commanders of themselves at the cost of the King's authority or wiping out every coward which, while tempting, would cost us much cannon fodder in our war against socialism. Of course this will also be setting a precedent for the future."

mafia.1.t:0 "Mafia attacks"
mafia.1.d:0 "The Mafia, which is primarily based in the south has spread their operations northwards in an attempt to weaken our state. However, the initial intent of spreading their connection has grown into a full-scale mission to destroy law and order throughout Italy. This has been achieved through wide-scale attacks by the Mafia, who’s means include the assassination of high-raking officials, strategic destruction of infrastructure and the spreading of wide-scale corruption networks. "
mafia.1.a:0 "They're seriously a problem"

mafia.2.t:0 "An offer from the [SRI.GetName]"
mafia.2.d:0 "The forces in the South of Italy have sent us a formal offer to join their Axis of Bosses. Should we accept, we do have similar goals, and forming a formal alliance with them would benefit us both. "
mafia.2.a:0 "Quite the proposal!"
mafia.2.b:0 "We'll have to pass"

mafia.20.t:0 "An offer from the [SRI.GetName]"
mafia.20.d:0 "The forces in the South of Italy have sent us a formal offer to join their Axis of Bosses. Should we accept, we do have similar goals, but making a formal alliance with the Mafia would be damaging to our Socialist cover. "
mafia.20.a:0 "Quite the proposal!"
mafia.20.b:0 "We'll have to pass"

mafia.3.t:0 "The [LEC.GetName] Passes"

mafia.30.d:0 "We have received a formal reply from the [CSA.GetName], saying that while we share similar goals, we will not embark in a formal alliance. "
mafia.30.a:0 "Too bad."

mafia.4.t:0 "We have Unified Italy"
mafia.4.d:0 "We have finally defeated the forces of the North. Now the iron fist of the Mafia extends throughout all of Italy, yet the fate of Italy still remains unclear. The main question that looms over our government is the fate of the Pope, who acted as the North’s nominal Head of State. Due to our catholic faith nobody wants to bring harm to the Pope, and many consider giving the Pope his state back while we control the Italian Federation from the shadows. This would keep our operations localized to the South, where we exert a higher degree of control. Others however think that we should proclaim a new Italian state under our rule and send the Pope to rule over his own fiefdom in Rome. "
mafia.4.a:0 "Give the Pope free reign."
mafia.4.b:0 "Send the Pope to Rome and proclaim a new Italy!"

mafia.5.t:0 "Ensuring Loyalty"
mafia.5.d:0 "The Mafia’s iron grip over the South of Italy is almost uncontested, yet a brave few still dare to oppose us. Several local towns still stand up to our protection rackets, and Socialist and Fascist strongholds resist our rule. Luckily, these are nothing but inconveniences to us, as we can easily send in our forces both in the Mafia and National Army to crush these rebels. "
mafia.5.a:0 "As Expected."

mafia.6.t:0 "The Gears of State"
mafia.6.d:0 "In our lands, corruption is no longer a problem to be rooted out by a noble few, it is both a means and a way of life. The Government is corrupt on every single level, with every cop, representative and judge being on our payroll, and every political party in the area being loyal to us. \n\n The bedrock of our state is now corruption, ingrained in every part of Italian society. It can no longer be destroyed or challenged. Getting rid of corruption would be paramount to getting rid of the entire state. "
mafia.6.a:0 "And why would we?"

mafia.7.t:0 "The Banks are made of Marble"
mafia.7.d:0 "Banks, the centres where the wealthy have stored their wealth for centuries. But now, with the Mafia controlling all assets of state, the nation’s banks have adjusted to the new and illegitimate way of life. This has led to banks serving a new purpose for the Mafioso command; wide-scale money laundering. With these new corrupt banks, we can take any illicitly acquired funds and easily clean them of their dirty origins and allow them to return to the outside and legal economy. \n\n Banks that have refused to comply with the new standards have often had their owners winding up dead. "
mafia.7.a:0 "More Money for us."

mafia.8.t:0 "Back in Sicily"
mafia.8.d:0 "While the original home of the Mafia is in Sicily, situation has forced us to spread northwards. Of course, this thinning of our forces in Sicily has given a select group of rabble rousers the idea to defy our rule and refuse our rackets. Luckily though, our rule in Sicily is as strong as ever. And the ones who defied were promptly put in their place.\n\n Indeed, in Sicily our word is law, in Sicily our control is absolute, and in Sicily we can do anything we want.\n\n Our roots are in Sicily, and our home will always be in Sicilys"
mafia.8.a:0 "Our Stronghold."

mafia.9.t:0 "The Entente Denounces us!"
mafia.9.d:0 "Despite the fact that the Entente is friendlier to us than the old Socialist Republic that was once on our soil, they still are far from our friends. And now, they are anything but, as the French Government in Algiers has officially denounced us and placed our nation under embargo. This would seriously hinder our ability to do business, however we can easily outrun their blockade or simply use other routes. However, a suggestion to get this embargo lifted is to make an offer to the Entente. This offer would allow the Entente forces to use the Isle of Sardinia as a launching pad to reclaim Europe, something that the Entente would surely accept given their position. "
mafia.9.a:0 "Bastards."
mafia.9.b:0 "Perhaps we could come to an understanding."

mafia.10.t:0 "All at a Price..."
mafia.10.d:0 "Luxury is something that has always been associated with Italian goods. When the wealthy look for quality, they turn to Italy, no matter the product. And of course, the Mafia helps with that. Any imaginable good can be found in our lands, and if it exists then we can typically make it better than anyone else can. From narcotics to cars to fashion to wine, Italy makes it better than anyone else. \n\n Of course, some of our products are more addictive than others. The elite classes across the world have gotten hooked on our drugs and have bankrupted themselves in the process. Of course, we all know what happens to people who don’t pay. "
mafia.10.a:0 "Better pay up."

mafia.11.t:0 "Our Contracts"
mafia.11.d:0 "Another industry the Mafia is spreading its roots in is construction. These front construction companies are gaining lucrative contracts both at home and abroad through no legitimate means. However, with our construction forces being stretched, the question is beginning to arise. Should we focus our efforts on projects at home or gain more contracts abroad. "
mafia.11.a:0 "Focus on Home."
mafia.11.b:0 "Focus on Abroad."

mafia.12.t:0 "High-Profile Assasinations"
mafia.12.d:0 "Major opponents of the Mafia have a tendency of ending up dead, this is just as true as ever. High-profile opponents of the Mafia have faced assassination through many means, such as car bombings, sniper attacks, simple attacks, abductions and many more means. While the government claims that these are nothing but accidents, most people know the truth that these assassinations are the work of the Mafia. Of course, that is the price of opposing our will. "
mafia.12.a:0 "Nothing but Accidents."

mafia.13.t:0 "An offer from the Mob"
mafia.13.d:0 "After the embargo against the Mafioso state in Southern Italy, the majority of our government expected the usual threats of retaliation. However, the Mafia has sent no threats, and instead has sent an offer. This offer would allow us military access to Sardinia if the embargo is lifted. While this offer is tempting, many ponder if it is worth giving the Mafia free reign over the Mediterranean. "
mafia.13.a:0 "Accept."
mafia.13.a:0 "Not a chance."

mafia.14.t:0 "The Illicit State"
mafia.14.d:0 "Cloaked in the shadows Southern Italy lies. As corrupt and seedy as the day is long, the Naples-Sicily region prospers in untold wealth, the Mafia controlling every facet of life. Corruption is engrained in the state, Protection Rackets are as accepted as taxes, and the government freely sells narcotics to its own citizens; fueling an addiction that only lines the pockets of corrupt commissars and bureaucrats. The Black Market and the legal economy have moulded into one, and Italy has become a world hub of less than legitimate business. \n\n In untold wealth Italy prospers, with morality and the law holding no place in the affairs of the state."
mafia.14.a:0 "Wonderful."

mafia.15.t:0 "An Invitation from Don Calogero Vizzini"
mafia.15.d:0 "Don Calogero Vizzini - head of the Sicilian Mafia or ‘La Cosa Nostra’ - has sent a delegation to our operation seeking to discuss a promising arrangement. The Don’s associates offer a spot in the secretive and shadowy Axis of Bosses, an international cabal of crime bosses and slumlords that seek to cooperate in order to benefit our shared dubious business. Side by side, we could stay out of each other's operations as we seek to expand in a united fashion, bringing greater honor and profit to our gangs, though we would have some competition that we could not just simply wipe away as before. Divided, we may fall to law enforcement and forces of order and so-called justice, but together, we may just be able to survive this turbulent time on a wave of profit and opportunity. What is our answer?"
mafia.15.a:0 "We open our arms to this Boss of Bosses."
mafia.15.b:0 "Our enterprise stands alone. We have no need to weaken our own syndicate."

#Catholic ISIS events
cathitaly.1.t:0 "Neo-Sanfedisti Activty"
cathitaly.1.d:0 "Recently, we have received several reports of Neo-Sanfedisti activity. This reactionary militia has been plaguing us since the Revolution began. Their movement began after one of our more radical militias led a controversial attack on San Giovanni Rotondo. Terrified of our Revolution, these Catholic extremists banded together to form militias of their own, and have been causing trouble in the rural areas ever since. The group seems to be incredibly disunited,  only united by a Leadership Council that is otherwise powerless. Despite the massive disunity, two men, Padre Renato Ziggiotti and Padre Pio are the most popular leaders within the NeoSanfedisti. The former dreams of restoring a reactionary order to Italy, unifying it in some “Holy Federation.” Pio, for his part, is more radical; The ideas of nation, class, race, and ideology disgust him. He wishes to topple our Republic and build a society united by faith. Despite this activity, it is not uncommon for the New Army of Holy Faith to vanish for months at a time and reappear either when we are at our weakest, or when our so-called anti-Catholicism is at it's strongest."
cathitaly.1.a:0 "Terrorists stuck in the past."

cathitaly.2.t:0 "The Future of the Neo-Sanfedisti"
cathitaly.2.d:0 "With our Army becoming increasingly more divided, it was decided the Council would hold a vote on its future leadership and path. Initially, many candidates came forward with their plans, but over time it became very clear that it would either be either Padre Ziggiotti or Padre Pio’s ideas that won the day. Ziggiotti gave a rousing speech about the glorious new Italy we could build together, how we would rebuild Italy into a perfect, Holy nation, ruled by Piety and Devotion to the Lord. As his speech drew to a close, almost the entire room was filled with furious applause. Once it died down, Pio carefully stood up and began to speak. Immediately, his soothing voice and mystical aura seemed to transfix the room. He spoke about his dream of a society united by faith, of brothers and sisters coming together in harmony and love. He called for dismantling the nations and systems that keep us from being one in Christ Jesus. When he concluded, there was no applause, only awe. The debate has concluded, and though only God knows what the future holds for our movement, it is time for the Council to decide who will be our new leader."
cathitaly.2.a:0 "The faithful Padre Ziggiotti has won the day!"
cathitaly.2.b:0 "The visionary Padre Pio is given the reins."

cathitaly.3.t:0 "Padre Ziggiotti's Plan"
cathitaly.3.d:0 "Padre Ziggiotti has a dream. He has been quested by the Lord to rebuild Italy into a new, Holy Federation. The plan calls for the return of the nobility, but not before land reform to ensure the people are not to be abused by the aristocracy. At the same time, he has pledged compensation to the nobles whose land will be donated to the peons. Once complete, he plans to approach the North in the hopes of a reunion. But if diplomacy were to fail, perhaps his Holy Federation would be one forged in blood..."
cathitaly.3.a:0 "Thy will be done."

cathitaly.4.t:0 "Padre Pio's Vision"
cathitaly.4.d:0 "Padre Pio is a simple man at his core. When he sees a problem, he does all he can to solve it. When he hears confessions, he can read the soul of the penitent, and can tell them how to truly save their souls. Thus it is with the grand problem of humanity. Pio believes he has seen the signs; he knows why the Socialists and Nationalists rose up-he knows why they reject God. They reject God due to not knowing him. They don't know God due to poor catechism. They had poor catechism due to the distractions of nation, of war, and of bad examples of the faith.\n How does one fix that? How can you attack the root cause of society's ills? Simple. You remove the nation, race, class. You give a good model of faith to the children. And what after that? Once man is solely focused on God, you will know you have solved the problem.\n This solution, once it is successful in the south of Italy, cannot be held within her borders alone. No, the entire Church must fall and come to embrace this truth, this grand vision of Padre Pio. Once the Church has tasted this vision, Pio's vision will be carried to the four corners of the world, so that he can bring man to his true and most glorious end: life with Christ in Heaven above, forever."

cathitaly.5.t:0 "Those Who Still Fight"
cathitaly.5.d:0 "Our army has, by the grace of God, triumphed over the Red Menace. However, our work is not done. The underworld of Italy has been corrupted by the greed and power of the Mafia. They have built a Den of Thieves on the exploitation of the innocent who cannot help themselves. Worse still, they profane our faith while cloaked in the image of the Virgin Maria. Just as Christ drive the materialistic money-changers from His Father’s House, so too must we drive these monsters from the Kingdom of God. At the same time, we face a wicked, ancient threat. Julius Evola and his Legions are a relic of the cruel past that Christ saved man from. We cannot let this new army of Nebuchadnezzar devastate God’s Earth with their philistine ideas of supremacy, nation, and idol-worship. We must defeat this abominable force as the Son of Man conquered the pagans of old!"

cathitaly.6.t:0 "Dealing with the Mafia"
cathitaly.6.d:0 "At last, we have liberated Italia from the grip of the crooked mafia. While we certainly must defang the Syndicate, there remains debate about what to do with the Mafiosos themselves. Some believe their sinful ways of crime, betrayal, and murder put them beyond redemption. After all, they are dangerous men, and the last thing we need is for them to corrupt our ranks with their trickery. Another camp preaches mercy for the monsters. To them, these are our brothers in faith, misguided by worldly greed. If we show them mercy, they could become a powerful ally as well. Did not Jesus show mercy to the tax collector Matthew and the prostitute Mary. Perhaps we should offer these blind men a chance to see?"
cathitaly.6.a:0 "You cannot love Christ and be a mafioso. We shall send them to the Lord for their judgment."

cathitaly.7.t:0 "Dealing with Evola's Legion"
cathitaly.7.d:0 "We cornered the Legion around Bari. Upon luring their army out into the open plains, the modern clash of good and evil began. The Pagan Leviathan fought brutally and desperately, their troops with blackened hearts screaming about degeneracy and “Kali Yuga.” Our warriors were pushed back further from the city, but we did not lose hope. We knew the battle had been won from the very moment Christ sacrificed Himself on the cross. Our men retreated behind our artillery emplacements as the Legionaries surged forward. It was then that the guns roared like the trumpets at Mount Zemaraim. After the devastating barrage, our counter attack began. God was surely with us as we pushed the pagans back to the outskirts of the city. There the leviathan made its final stand. Evola was found in the Basilica of Saint Nicholas, a single gunshot in his forehead. By the justice of God, we have triumphed over the wicked Legion."

cathitaly.8.t:0 "Hope of Faith"
cathitaly.8.d:0 "To My Beloved Sister Viola,\nToday I finally heeded your words and attended mass at the Cattedrale di Avellino. Initially I was disgusted by the ritual I was witnessing. As you know, my years in the Socialist Republic had convinced me that the Church and everything to do with it was all puttanata.  After the First Reading, which recounted the Parable of the Sower I had enjoyed when I was a boy, none other than Padre Ziggiotti began the Homily.\n Somehow, I was enthralled by his words. Oh, how he had such a way with words! He told us of the importance of faith, that without it a void is left in our hearts, and creates sorrow and misfortune. Before I had realized what I had done, I interrupted to blurt out, “But Padre, how does one attain and keep the faith?” People from every pew turned to face me with disgusted looks. But Padre Ziggiotti only laughed gently before answering. “My son, faith is attained through our works. We can express faith through our words, but it is our deeds that truly show that we seek and believe. Walk the path of righteousness, and you will find yourself empowered with faith, that wonderful gift. With belief in God by your side, my son, nothing is impossible.”\n To tell you the truth, few words have moved me as much as the ones he spoke before continuing the Mass. I think I have finally become grateful for the baptism Mama and Papa gave me all those years ago. But now I must get back to work. But thank you, Viola, for everything."

Now we must look to the North, for there the heart of the Church lies. It is time we approach the Holy See as Servants of the Lord and His Church, humbly asking for Italy to be reborn as a holy, united federation. Though we expect and pray for a peaceful outcome, Padre Ziggiotti is ready to wage war should the Pontiff be blind to reason."

cathitaly.10.d:0 "A curious proposition has come in from our severed half to the south. Apparently, after the recent turmoil in the southern Republic’s recent elections, the syndicalist dogs have been overthrown, and in the ensuing unrest and panic, revered priest and catholic militant Padre Renato Ziggotti has taken the reigns of the nation in his hands. Backed by his Neosanfedist militias, Padre Ziggotti has returned the mighty light of God to these heathens, basking the south in the Holy Light of the Lord once more! With his rule cemented, he has sent a request of reunion to the Holy See here in the north. Though Padre Ziggotti may have a reputation for violence against the godless syndicalists, he is still a man of the cloth and a true son of God in our eyes, no matter how misguided he may have once been. Shall we accept his offer with open arms, reuniting these blessed lands and restoring the heart of Catholisicm to its rightful strength, or shall we ignore this madman’s request in hopes that we may retake the South at a later date."

Word has come into Padre Ziggotti’s chambers of the jubilant news that the Holy See to the north has accepted our offer of peaceful reunification. We must make haste at once to begin the preparations for our long awaited reunion. Though the path ahead shall be fraught with danger and trepidation, we shall emerge together on the other side, stronger and more unified than ever before, under the light of God. Italians across the nation may breathe a sigh of relief, for their future has been made brighter than ever before."

They have always been the first to snub their nose at us southerners while they grew fat and blasphemous in their debauchery and excess. This dichotomy is dead! Under the guiding hand of Padre Renato Ziggotti, the south of Italy has been transformed into a bountiful and beautiful land that God himself would smile upon! These sinners to the north have denied our humble request at making our broken nation whole again, but this will be the last time the north turns their back on us and on the Lord. Under Padre Ziggotti’s command, our brave Army of the Holy Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ shall storm north like the crusaders of old and wipe clean the slate of these disgraceful heretics. Italy will be made whole once more, and we will spill the blood of our enemies until the streets run red with their sin-filled blood."

As Padre Ziggotti moves to consolidate the newly made state, the holy light of the Lord washes over these lands, cleansing it of sin and sinner. In this new holy kingdom of God, all will be made pure, and Ziggotti’s Neosanfedisti will make sure of it. As this righteous army stalks our lands, they shall prosthelytize and carry out the will of our Lord, making sure all are made to confess and reconcile their past heresies. This land will be purged of sin, and those who refuse to repent shall feel the blazing light of God to its full extent. We will not tolerate heresy in God’s land."

cathitaly.14.t:0 "Catholic Means Universal"
cathitaly.14.d:0 "Nationalism and Socialism: these concepts, while not down right sinful, are almost idolatry. They corrupt and consume good people with their tempting talk of devotion to nation and revolution. Such concepts have no place in the new society we are building, for devotion is to be reserved for God and His Church. Pio recognizes this, and has begun to take measures to cleanse his realm of these wicked ideas. All clergy, officers and politicans of any rank or stipe even suspected of harboring nationalist or socialist sympathies are to be stripped of their positions. They still have a place in Pio’s vision, but it is certainly not one where they have any influence. The journey to finally be free from that which strays us from God has begun at last."
cathitaly.14.a:0 "Padre Pio has delivered us from evil!"

cathitaly.15.t:0 "Attacking Nationalism"
cathitaly.15.d:0 "With the removal of those suspected to harbor nationalistic or socialist tendencies, the cleansing hand of Pio struck the country. However, this was just the beginning. In order to fully remove that great idol of nationalism, a radical strike must be made. The way to make this strike, in the mind of the great Padre Pio, is twofold. Firstly, the state must be made incredibly decentralized, and all political power will be held by the village in the countryside and in the district within the city. All governmental functions, save for a few powers, namely the military and education, will be handled at the most local level. Doing this will no doubt cause chaos for a short period, but it is necessary to finally remove the idol of nationalism.\n Secondly, national monuments, monuments to the people who united Italy and to the past glories of this nation, must be dealt with. While obviously the people will not take kindly to the destruction of what was, Pio has no intention to destroy these modern day golden calves. They shall be put on display in every town and city in museums and places of shame. This will be done to show our history, for we must not destroy our past, but it will also show the people what we have risen above. In place of the removed monuments, great statues of Our Lord and His Most Blessed Mother, of the blessed Saints, will be raised, to give our people true models to look up to."

cathitaly.16.d:0 "As Padre Pio has begun to implement his glorious vision in southern Italy over the past several months, it is becoming increasingly clear that not only is his vision successful; it works far better then anyone could have predicted. People of all races, classes, and nationalities are working side-by-side, helping each other get to Heaven.\n  His vision has now been proven to be more than just an idea in the head of a visionary, and the second and perhaps most grand phase is about to begin. This phase will involve the implementation of the vision of Pio throughout the entire Church. The only way to achieve that, in the mind of our saintly leader, is to call an Ecumenical Council, a thing only the Holy Father can do. While Padre Pio is a loyal son of Rome, there is no way the current pontiff would entertain Pio's ideas about reform and councils. Thus, our holy Padre has scheduled a meeting with the Vicar of Christ to discuss the reunion of the two halves of Italy, among other things. Padre Pio has his eyes on the Papacy, and with God on his side, how could he fail?"

In his place, His Holiness declared that no conclave would take place, but that instead, Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, leader of the Apostolic State of Southern Italy, would be the next Bishop of Rome.\n Reactions to this announcement have been... mixed to say the least. The Cardinals of the Church have not issued any statement yet, but a handful of theologians have declared this move illegal.

His Holiness-elect, the nominal head of the Italian Federation, is well within his rights to do this, and by all accounts we are legally bound to follow his request. However, this has not stopped some within our government from begging us to refuse. Pio's state in southern Italy is apparently an abomination of what he is calling 'Nationless Catholicism', a system that, in practice, sees nationalism, socialism, and class conflict as horrible and unites the people under the banner of Catholicism. This comes at the cost of nearly any semblance of modernity. While we are legally bound, the argument of these members of our government is compelling. With this in mind, the College of Cardinals has gathered to hold an emergency vote on what to do in regards to the demand from Pio"

cathitaly.20.a:0 "At long last, Italy is reunited!"

cathitaly.21.t:0 "The North refuses to submit!"
cathitaly.21.d:0 "Following an emergency vote by the College of Cardinals,  the Italian Federation has refused our offer to reunite peacefully. While this comes as somewhat of a shock to some, it is not so to Padre Pio. This was to be expected in his eyes; the institutional Church has always been afraid of reform, and Pio's reforms would be more radical then most. With this decision being made, the time has come for battle. The men and women of the NeoSanfedisti stand ready to retake the North-they only await the Padre's word."
cathitaly.21.a:0 "The Die has been Cast"

cathitaly.22.t:0 "New Government for the Federation"
cathitaly.22.d:0 "With war between us and the South all but inevitable, the College of Cardinals has deemed it necessary to install a new government in the Italian Federation. After all, it would discredit us to have a Church-led state fighting with the Pope.\n Although many ideas for the new Italian government have been floated, only two, namely reinstating the Monarchy and creating a Republic, have gained enough traction within the College to be considered for implementation. As the last Cardinal casts his ballot and the votes are counted, it is clear that..."
cathitaly.22.a:0 "...Italy shall be a Kingdom once more!"
cathitaly.22.b:0 "...Italy shall be a Republic!"

cathitaly.23.t:0 "The Elevation of Pope-Elect Pio"
cathitaly.23.d:0 "With Rome now firmly in the hands of Saint Peter's rightful successor, the investiture and coronation of Padre Pio can finally take place. The person to consecrate Pio a bishop is Cardinal Selvaggiani, the dean of the College of Cardinals...\n The consecration of Pio was a simple matter, as in the minds of all, the period of Sede Vacant had gone on long enough. After the ceremony, the Dean of the College was quick to run to the balcony overlooking St. Peter's square and speak those words that the faithful of not just Rome, but the whole world have been waiting for: “Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum, Habemus Papam! Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum, Dominum Francesco Forgione, qui sibi nomen imposuit..."
cathitaly.23.a:0 "...Leo!”"
cathitaly.23.b:0 "...Paulus!”"
cathitaly.23.c:0 "...Gregorius”!"

cathitaly.24.t:0 "Addressing the Cardinals"
cathitaly.24.d:0 "“Your eminences, I assure you that I bear no hostility to you. But, my vision is the path we are to follow, and I will beg for your support if I must.” Cardinal Faulhauber spoke first, “[SRI.GetLeader],  I believe I speak for the majority of my fellow Cardinals when I say that our faith in you is shallow. You were not elected by the College. In fact, you have never been one of us. You are an upstart in over your head, and this dream of yours will bring this Church to ruin.” There seemed to be no anger in the Pontiff’s voice as he responded, “Your Eminence, I am to be addressed as Your Holiness. I beg of you to have faith in me and my leadership. I am unorthodox, yes, but I am also nonetheless as faithful a servant of the Lord as any one of you. His Holiness chose me, and thus I am a part of the sacred line that began with Simon Peter. Must I beg you not to split the Church by electing a new Pope?” Now it was Cardinal Baudrillart’s turn. “It is an insult to God to have someone so blasphemous as you lead our Church, and every moment that we do not choose a new Pontiff is another moment we are ruled by a fraud.” The Pope calmly removed the covers on his hands, and revealed his stigmata to his audience. At once, they were silenced, amazed by his wounds and the blood that flowed from them."
cathitaly.24.a:0 "Thou hast seen me, and thou hast believed."

cathitaly.25.t:0 "Addressing the Laity"
cathitaly.25.d:0 "“Brothers and Sisters, I come before you not as the Pontifex Maximus, but as your brother in faith. Brother Nikolić spoke up, “Your Holiness. We are enthused to welcome you into this humble monastery, but some of us still have doubts about this vision of yours and the miracles attributed to you. The Pope smiled warmly, and gently answered, “My Brother, I understand your doubts. But I beg you to keep your faith. All things are possible for one who believes.” Sister Verini, who was paralyzed, was helped to kneel her before her Pontiff. “Your Holiness, the Lord is with you. Blessed be your name! For you are my leader in faith, and I have faith in you.” The Pope removed his mittens, holding up his wounded hands to those before him. Looking upon the wounds of Christ on the Pope’s hands, they were transfixed. He took his hands in hers, and began to say a prayer. “My friends, behold my hands. Sister Verini has not witnessed them until now, and yet, she believed. You doubted until you saw. Now rise, Sister Verini.” Sister Verini stood up, and began to cry tears of joy. At once, they all knelt before him, and begged for forgiveness."
cathitaly.25.a:0 "For we walk by faith, not by sight."

cathitaly.26.t:0 "Opening of the Second Vatican Council"
cathitaly.26.d:0 "Following almost a year of work and preparation, the bishops of the world, or their appointed representatives, now sit together in the Second Vatican Council. The first session of the Council begin with a beautiful three hour long mass prayed  by the Holy Father. In his homily, the Holy Father called on all of those gathered to carry out the business of the Council reverently and quickly. What changes are to come from the Council remain to be seen, but the door to radical change in the Catholic Church is now open, and whether or not His Holiness will push the Council through this door door remains to be seen."
cathitaly.26.a:0 "The Council is open for business!"

cathitaly.27.t:0 "The Second Vatican Council is Traditionalist"
cathitaly.27.d:0 "Deep within the hallowed halls of St. Peter’s Basilica, the Second Vatican Council deliberates over its sacred task. With the initial arguments out of the way, it has been decided to move the Church in a far more traditionalist direction. Championed by the more conservative old guard of the Church Fathers, the Council has agreed that a return to the old ways is best for the Catholic world as a whole. Latin shall be reinforced as the dominant language and script of the Church, while ultramontanism shall be fully embraced, granting His Holiness greater powers than his position has held in centuries. Under the newly strengthened Pope, the Catholic world shall be carried into the future on the back of tradition."
cathitaly.27.a:0 "We cast away the debauchery of the modern age and return to the old ways"

cathitaly.28.t:0 "The Second Vatican Council is Moderate"
cathitaly.28.d:0 "As the esteemed Church Fathers begin their deliberation behind the sealed gates of the Vatican, they have come to an agreement over the general direction of the Second Vatican Council. The wise holy men have come to the agreement to not radically alter the teachings or positions of the Church at all, instead seeking to tow the line and maintain the status-quo. The experiments with the common vernacular shall be allowed to take place, with Latin remaining the dominant and official language of the Church. While a fine balance will be maintained between the fanatics that follow the teachings of  Pope Paul VI and the conservative traditionalists within the Church. Only by maintaining a balance can the Church survive and grace the world with its enlightening aura."
cathitaly.28.a:0 "We have resisted the temptation of extremism, walking a delicate balance between tradition and reform"

cathitaly.29.t:0 "The Second Vatican Council is Reformist"
cathitaly.29.d:0 "Behind the ornate doors of St. Peter's Basilica, the Second Vatican Council was well under way, with the meeting Council Fathers gathering to discuss the future direction of the Catholic Church. After hours of deliberation, these most pious of men have come to an initial agreement on the general direction of this most holy meeting of minds. The Council has voted to realign our ideals along the radical reformist ideas of Pope Gregory XVII, propelling the Church into a new, zealous direction. The Holy Father’s ideals of Catholicism first, above all other creeds and theories, have rung true with the Council Fathers. Under this new direction, worldly ideologies such as syndicalism, capitalism, or nationalism shall be abandoned in pursuit of something far holier and closer to God’s original plan. We shall shed the dividers of race, class, and nation as we spread the light of the Lord across God’s Kingdom of Earth. With Pope Gregory XVII’s teachings forming the bedrock of our new creed, Catholicism shall reign over mankind as the one true faith!"
cathitaly.29.a:0 "Gregory XVII’s teachings shall lead the Catholic World into a brighter, holier future!"


cathitaly.30.t:0 "Decree on Freemasonary?"
cathitaly.30.d:0 "Of all the various heretical movements in history, none have received more papal condemnations then Freemasonary. This is due primarily to the heresy of relativism, among what others would call more conspiratorial reasons. Regardless, several more traditional minded Council Fathers have formally put before our most holy Council a document that boils down every single papal condemnation into one along with some comentary for our modern times. After a short period of debate, the Council Fathers vote and decide that..."
cathitaly.30.a:0 "...the repeated Papal condemnations are enough, we have no need to waste time with what the faithful already know"
cathitaly.30.b:0 "...the time has come for a formal Councillor condemnation of Freemasonary"

cathitaly.31.t:0 "Decree on Capitalism?"
cathitaly.31.d:0 "From the very beginning of what today has become known as Catholic Social Teaching, Capitalism has lived in a bit of a grey area. While Unrestricted Capitalism has been outright condemn, the other various forms of Capitalism, such as the so-called Social Capitalism and Interventionist Capitalism have not been, leaving many of the faithful confused as to what counts as a moral economic system in the eyes of Holy Mother Church.\n It is with this in mind that a few Church Fathers of a more progressive or reformist bent have put forward for the consideration of the Council a decree that would outline a detailed teaching on the various forms of Capitalism, and would lay out what they have entitled 'Christian Capitalism.' After a period of debate, the Second Vatican Councils votes that...   "
cathitaly.31.a:0 "...This so called Christian Capitalism is nothing more then socialism in Catholic Clothing! We are duty bound to reject it!" 
cathitaly.31.b:0 "...Christian Capitalism is the future of Catholic Social Teaching!"

cathitaly.32.t:0 "End of the Second Vatican Council"
cathitaly.32.d:0 "After a long period of trials and tribulations, the Second Vatican Council has finally come to end. The Council Fathers have left Rome and returned home, and in their wake have left a Church much different from the one of a short time ago. Regardless of how the Council went, the Catholic Church, at least for the time being, is a buzz with change and a renewed spirit. With his main agenda completed, it is expected of the Holy Father to make some kind of statement regarding what's next for the Catholic Church."
cathitaly.32.a:0 "We wait with baited breath Holy Father!"

cathitaly.33.t:0 "Into the World?"
cathitaly.33.d:0 "The Second Vatican Council has at long last finished their endless deliberations, and a definite path has been set for this holy state and the entire Catholic Church. Under the guidance of the Lord’s holy light, our New Army of Holy Faith shall march out from the lands of the Holy See and spread God’s wisdom and warmth around the world. However, a final question remains on what shall be the nature of the NeoSanfedisti as they carry out the Lord’s good works.\n Our armies can become forces of peace and forgiveness, working with both the clergy and the laity to spread God’s good will to the rest of His misguided flock. Under this mission, we shall take their tired, their poor, their downtrodden, and their bereaved, and we shall lift these meek souls from the mud so they too can inherit the Earth and live in God’s good graces.\n In sharp contrast to this, our armies can march forth from these lands of the Holy See, carrying the vengeful fire and spirit of God’s wrath, smiting the myriad of heretics and heathens that plague this Garden of Eden. Under the command of our brave officers and generals, inspired by the light of the Lord himself, a tenth crusade will be declared; this time, not just for the Holy Land in the Levant, but for all of God’s holy lands. One way or another, we will bring the Church, and the light of Christ to the entire world, so that it touches every single soul, sinner and saint alike."
cathitaly.33.a:0 ""Deus Vult! The time has come to spread God’s light to every nation on Earth!"
cathitaly.33.b:0 "The Church will cleanse these lands without needless bloodshed."

cathitaly.34.t:0 "Choosing a Banner to Rally Our Faith Behind"
cathitaly.34.d:0 "With Padre Pio’s ascension following the "Papal Crisis", this honored and devoutly pious servant of God has become both the national leader of our beauteous and pristine state, as well as the head of the Christian World and the Catholic Church. With this position, a great deal of pressure has been placed upon His Holiness' shoulders as he takes his seat amid one of the most tumultuous times in modern history. In order to solidify the people’s faith in both their new Pope and their new state, the Pontiff has called for a small meeting to be held to determine the new flag of his hand crafted state. This banner shall be the symbol of our nation and of our faith - something new to rally behind as we walk through this new valley of death towards our bright horizon, guided and shepherded by both Successor of Saint Peter and the Lord’s Holy Light."
cathitaly.34.a:0 "Rally behind the old naval flag depicting Peter, Paul and Christ."
cathitaly.34.b:0 "Raise a new banner depicting the Keys of Heaven."
cathitaly.34.c:0 "The new Peter and Paul flag design shall serve us well."
cathitaly.34.e:0 "We shall use the Peter, Paul and Christ banner, but modernized."
cathitaly.34.f:0 "Adorn the standard flag of the Papacy!"
cathitaly.34.g:0 "Take notes from the Swiss Guard’s standard."
cathitaly.34.h:0 "Under the watch of the Virgin Mary, our people shall be safe."

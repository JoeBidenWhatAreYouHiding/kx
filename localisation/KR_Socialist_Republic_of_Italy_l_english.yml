### Descriptions ###

POLITICS_VITTORIO_DESC:0 "Born in Cerignola, an unassuming agricultural town located in the Apulia region within the Italian South, Giuseppe Di Vittorio was born a child of poor agricultural labourers, his political radicalization starting from the May 1904 general strike in his hometown and membership in the syndicalist Federation of Young Socialists. With his experience as chairman of Minervino Murge's Chamber of Labour he was elected in 1912 to the central committe of the newly formed Italian Syndicalist Union. After the government issued an amnesty for participants of 1914's Red Week Di Vittorio returned from Switzerland and took a pro-war stance, even joining a Bersaglieri unit in 1915 but returning a year later after being wounded.\nThe war ended, and in another world this may have resulted in Di Vittorio rejoining the majority of the USI in their Neutralist stance, perhaps even becoming a candidate for the PSI, yet this could never be the case. The national humiliation suffered in the lost Weltkrieg kicked off a chain of events that resulted in the Italian Civil War of 1919-1920. Being a major figure within the Union that supported the war, Di Vittorio rallied many veterans together with other war proponents such as Benito Mussolini or Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. The Neutralist USI, the distinction having emerged during the war, and other pacifist Socialists had to accept yet another war. The sectarianism of Italy would not have grown so if not for the Red Republicans declaring the Socialist Republic after French Communard success, forcing the Whites towards Austria. The Civil War ended in an uneasy ceasefire, but the pressure of the conflict set the stage for future politics of the peninsula.\nGiuseppe Di Vittorio became the Chairman, a candidate reluctantly confirmed by Armando Borghi's Neutralist USI, later allying with anti-Di Vittorio Errico Malatesta's Italian Anarchist Union, and the Communist Party of Italy created from the embers of the PSI, more supportive after Amadeo Bordiga's departure South in disgust of Antonio Gramsci's 'opportunism'. An important proponent of Di Vittorio's chairmanship was the National Revolutionary Bloc led by Mussolini, Nicola Bombacci, Alceste De Ambris and Marinetti. The only major opposition came from the Unitary Socialist Party, part of the Reformist sphere in the PSI weakend by people like Ivanoe Bonomi and Gaetano Salvemini becoming major players elsewhere in Italy.\nAnd so Di Vittori, a man charismatic enough to rally the masses, has stood as the Chairman for nearly two decades. But with world rapidly changing, and the web of alliances becoming ever so complicated, Giuseppe's 'status quo' may not last for much longer."

POLITICS_MUSSOLINI_DESC:0 "The tides of history are fickle things, and the invisible hand of fate often guides in twisting, sudden turns. The rise of the infamous Benito Mussolini was one of many such turns, and his ascension to Chairman is the cumulation of a winding career.\n\nBorn in Romagna to a Socialist father and a Catholic mother, Mussolini was named after Benito Juarez of Mexico. Working in his father’s smithy, he was exposed to a leftist, nationalistic worldview that idologised Giuseppe Garibaldi and the heroes of the Risorgimento. As a young man, he studied abroad and learned of Sorel and Nietzsche and also pursued jobs in masonry, teaching, as well as newspaper editing. But his passion was in politics, and he was soon at odds with the Italian authorities.\n\nHis life would turn again with the start of the Weltkrieg. After some initial reluctance, he fought as a Bersaglieri, bringing him out of line with more orthodox socialist positions. His own beliefs began to harden too - Mussolini grew convinced of the need for a revolutionary vanguard.\n\nItaly’s disastrous defeat in the Weltkrieg brought another turn. The chaos led to left's long-sought revolution, and in the thick of the fighting Mussolini and his fellow pro-war compatriots managed to worm their way back into the socialist camp. Uniting an eccentric alliance of nationalists, futurists, and national syndicalists into the banner of the Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario, Mussolini’s career received a restart when he became Minister of Transports. Initially a fringe figure, his ruthlessness and perceived efficiency has won many frustrated by the Republic’s bureaucracy.\n\nNow, the final twist in Mussolini’s life has arrived: he has become Chairman of the Socialist Republic of Italy. Once smeared as a ‘totalitarian’, he has happily adopted the moniker and cosigned the Totalist charter. In his speeches, Mussolini boasts that there will soon be a new Risorgimento. And perhaps the tides of history, in their twisting turns, will prove him right."

### Ideas ###
SRI_red_guards_idea:0 "Confused Armata Rossa"
SRI_red_guards_idea_desc:0 "Since the Civil War in 1920, the core of the Socialist Republic's military has been split between the mostly professional units coming from the so-called 'Red Army of Turin' combined with a myriad of worker's militias and organizations, from the Action Squads of the Revolutionary Bloc through the biggest Red Guards and even ending on the very moderate Garibaldi Battalions. While this has resulted in very loyal armed forces when it comes to revolutionary devotion, the unfortunate side-effect is that our Red Army is deeply confused over its identity and practical effectiveness. We will have to decide the future course for it if we ever hope to match the strength of our comrades in arms from France and Britain."

SRI_strengthen_democracy_desc:0 "One of the major promises of the Partito Socialista Unitario during the Congress was the strengthening of a direct and local democracy that would allow the Italian people a greater role in the political life of the country. Strengthening democracy must therefore be one of our first measures."
SRI_stregthen_the_republic:0 "Primacy of the Unions Continues"

SRI_improve_unions:0 "A Land of Thousand Unions"
SRI_improve_unions_desc:0 "If we are to ensure Northern Italy's successful transformation into a paradise for the working people, we must support the creation of new trade unions as well as subsidizing the few already existing syndicates."
SRI_gradual_industrialization:0 "Careful Planning and Faultless Industrialization"
SRI_gradual_industrialization_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic of Italy is vastly underprepared if it is to destroy the capitalist menace of a Federation up north. They outnumber us in industrial machinery and factories, which we urgently must catch up on soon. The Republic will implement a program in order to ensure that industrialization of the Republic goes orderly and as planned, all the while correcting errors."
SRI_liberation_theology:0 "Liberation Theology"
SRI_liberation_theology_desc:0 "Socialism and Christianity are cut from the same cloth. Both strive to save the downtrodden from the injustices visited upon them.

SRI_worker_priests:0 "Take Over the Popularist Movement"
SRI_worker_priests_desc:0 "To ensure that the overwhelming catholic population does not act against our government, we need to show them that socialism was already part of their identity.

SRI_revolutionary_democracy:0 "Unity of the Democratic Revolution"
SRI_revolutionary_democracy_desc:0 "Each commune must operate democratically, both within and without. The central government must intervene in those communes where democracy has failed to take root and take further measures to ensure that each commune is represented equally on a national level."
SRI_rural_communes:0 "The Grounded Backbone of Communalism"
SRI_rural_communes_desc:0 "Those of our comrades who live in rural areas do not enjoy nearly the same economic opportunities as those in urban localities.

SRI_urbanization:0 "Kickstart the Urban Utopia"
SRI_urbanization_desc:0 "The revolution began in Italy's cities, and to ensure that the spirit of revolution in them never dies, we should invest in our most urbanised communes."
SRI_respect_religion:0 "A Mutual Non-Interference with Religion"
SRI_respect_religion_desc:0 "Catholics have always felt oppressed under the Syndicalists, and so we must prove to them that we are a much more tolerable form of socialism. The christians can have their faith and practice it freely, unless it goes directly against our state. If they respect our aims we shall begrudgingly respect their beliefs."
SRI_christian_identity:0 "A Universal Italian Identity"
SRI_christian_identity_desc:0 "Italy has been a divided land from time immemorial, it is no different now. But to achieve true equality, progress and socialism our people must feel as one national body. No longer shall someone be a Calabrian, a Sicilian or a Florentine. We are all Italians, working hand-in-hand to achieve prosperity and a true socialist utopia."
SRI_communal_autonomy:0 "Autonomous Bodies, Communal System"
SRI_communal_autonomy_desc:0 "The communes of the Socialist Republic of Italy are being constricted by the council's grip, and being the benevolent master that we are, shall cut their bonds, to increase their autonomy within the Republic.

SRI_cement_democratic_reform:0 "The Rebirth of Democratic Socialism"
SRI_cement_democratic_reform_desc:0 "With the Republic having gathered all of the democratic reforms issued previously, they are loose. These loose edicts are so loose that they could easily be destroyed and tossed - which is undesirable, of course! A little bit of government manipulation will finally cement our reforms into Italian law. Italian law will guarantee these freedoms!"
SRI_worker_councils:0 "The Power in the Workers' Councils"
SRI_worker_councils_desc:0 "While the communes are far more democratic and just than anything practised by the bourgeoisie, many have experienced a worrying growth in bureaucracy. To keep this bureaucracy in check, each commune must be mandated to have a council of workers from various unions to act as a local legislature."
SRI_workers_self_management:0 "Great Revolutionary Revanchism"
SRI_workers_self_management_desc:0 "We must send out the call to our people, and make them proud of all they have accomplished so far... while simultaneously making them aware there is still so much left to do, not only here in Italy but also abroad.

SRI_social_welfare:0 "Organize a Truly Social Welfare"

SRI_industrial_democracy:0 "Enshrine the Concept of Industrial Democracy"
SRI_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "Industrial democracy was one of the pillars of our revolution in 1919. Democracy was not to be limited to the Grand Chamber of Labour as the Bourgeois would have it. By re-enforcing our commitment to Industrial Democracy, we can not only strengthen our republic but better improve our factories compared to the capitalist countries."
SRI_industrial_enlightenment:0 "Industry of Enlightenment"

SRI_cement_congres_authority_desc:0 "Now that we have strengthened the Republic, the Chamber's authority can be cemented and the divisions that were tearing the Republic apart since the end of the Civil War can now be resolved for good.

SRI_streghten_the_chairman:0 "All Power to Chairman Mussolini"
SRI_streghten_the_chairman_desc:0 "In order for the Republic to be strong, the Chairman must be strong. How can we help the people without the guiding hand of the Chairman? The Chamber is just an attempt to bring back bourgeois parliamentarianism, but the Chairman shall rule, and the principles of the revolution shall be upheld."
SRI_state_atheism:0 "Unshackle the Prisoners of the Vatican"
SRI_state_atheism_desc:0 "Superstition has no place in the Socialist Republic of Italy. Gods and prophets and lies made up by men to deceive are not needed in the modern age. Religion is something that keeps men in chains, drugged by the opiate of the masses; but we shall break the chains that religion has placed upon us. We shall enforce state atheism, for religion has no place in the Republic!"
SRI_rouse_the_people:0 "Rouse the People of Italy"

SRI_squadrismo:0 "Squadrismo"

SRI_labor_camps:0 "Labour Camps"
SRI_labor_camps_desc:0 "Reactionaries and other enemies of the state need not be completely eliminated. They can be organised into bands of labourers, doing the harshest of jobs, under the supervision of our commissars. Perhaps through such work, they can develop a more correct mindset."
SRI_futurist_culture:0 "A Sinistral Futurist Culture"
SRI_futurist_culture_desc:0 "The futurist movement has become increasingly prominent in our nation. Futurism encourages the total transformation of society for the promotion of the greater good and the rapid development of industry. We should encourage this movement, as it aligns closely with our own goals for Italy."
SRI_cultural_revolution:0 "Grande Rivoluzione Culturale Proletaria"
SRI_cultural_revolution_desc:0 "Reactionary elements still plague our society, and like rats, when one is purged, a dozen more seem to scurry out from under the woodwork. We must endeavour to eliminate them entirely in one fell swoop."
SRI_revolutionary_commisars:0 "Officers of Revolutionary Action"
SRI_revolutionary_commisars_desc:0 "Our armed forces, while brave and good, could be easily misled by reactionary elements. By establishing a core group of undoubtedly loyal soldiers and officers and embedding them in our military, we can ensure that our men remain loyal."
SRI_ensure_officers_loyalty:0 "Ensure Officers' Loyalty"
SRI_ensure_officers_loyalty_desc:0 "We must make sure that the officers are loyal to the Chairman and not being infiltrated with counter-revolutionaries and spies. We must make sure that they are and shall remain loyal."

SRI_cement_chairmans_power_desc:0 "The power of the Chairman to direct the revolution shall be cemented and he shall bring the revolution to everyone and destroy the influence of the Bourgeois attempts to come back into the republic. With his power cemented we shall no longer have to worry about any divisions that threaten the republic."
SRI_communist_dawn_italy:0 "A Communist Dawn in Italy"
SRI_communist_dawn_italy_desc:0 "Despite all the odds and historical circumstances stacked against them the Communist Party of Italy, founded by the members of the long shattered Italian Socialist Party that supported Lenin's Bolshevik Revolution and greater focus on Marxist and post-Marxist Communism, have achieved victory in the Congress and can now start realizing their vision for the world to witness a true dawn of Communism on the Italian peninsula."
SRI_expel_remnant_bordigists:0 "Expel the Remnant Bordigists"
SRI_expel_remnant_bordigists_desc:0 "Amadeo Bordiga, a man as influential in the creation of our Party as he was difficult to work with on the daily basis. Some say he is even more Leninist than Lenin, a person dogmatic to the point of refusing to accept the current realities standing before him. When the Civil War began and the newly formed Communist party took part in it, organizing together with the existing worker councils under the direction of comrade Gramsci, comrade Bordiga criticized this move as nothing short of syndicalism. In fact there has not been a month during which Amadeo, from the comfort of his armchair situated in the South to which he moved as a sign of disgust for the current leadership of the Party, would not send strongly worded letters calling the Revolutionary Trio and the wider PCd'I membership as opportunists that have only helped capitalism to transfigure by taking part in the Civil War. Sadly, there are still some within the party that support this theortician's ramblings, and we simply do not need them to be part of our future projects."
SRI_tascas_bukharinist_methods:0 "Tasca's Bukharinist Methods"
SRI_tascas_bukharinist_methods_desc:0 "Comrade Angelo Tasca has been a keen observer of the changes occurring within the Russian Socialist scene, becoming fascinated by the journey of Nikolai Bukharin and his People's Socialist Party. Having studied the journey of the these former Right Bolsheviks from the brink of political extinction into the leadership of the only major Communist party still operating within Russia, Tasca formulated a plan to ensure that our Communist Party won't face oblivion. While comrade Gramsci finds the focus on material conditions within Marxism as something that needs to be moved past, he has begrudgingly accepted the 'Tasca lean' and their support for an Italian variant of the New Economic Policy."
SRI_worker_councils_basis_revolution:0 "Worker Councils, Basis of the Revolution"
SRI_worker_councils_basis_revolution_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Trio of Antonio Gramsci, Angelo Tasca and Palmiro Togliatti, much to the chagrin of the Ultra-Leftists that have thankfully mostly departed our party, have long wrote in their newspaper 'L'Ordine Nuovo' about the roal which the unionized workers will play in the success of any coming Revolution. The events of the Civil War have proven them right, and thus we have to focus and cooperate with the existing councils to create a strong basis, an unshakable foundation for a true communist society."
SRI_cultural_hegemonies_war_manoeuvre:0 "Cultural Hegemonies and the War of Manoeuvre"
SRI_cultural_hegemonies_war_manoeuvre_desc:0 "Pulling from the faction led by our co-leader, the ‘post-Marxist’ Antonio Gramsci, our revolutionary movement has moved to embrace some of his wisest philosophies and writings, namely the ideas of the War of Manoeuvre - or the struggle to gain decisive influence in society, and the name given to Gramsci’s concept of class war against oppressively imposed societal norms - and the concept of Cultural Hegemony, which is the dominance of a culturally diverse society by the ruling class who manipulate the culture of that society - that is, the beliefs and explanations, perceptions, values, and mores (or social norms) of said society - so that the worldview of the ruling class becomes the accepted cultural norm, thus creating a system where the ruling elite in any form inadvertently or purposefully oppress the masses through their own conception of culture. We must take the concepts of the War of Manoeuvre - also called the War of Position - to heart as we battle preset cultural hegemonies in order to create a truly proletarian revolution that builds our new Leftist society from the ground up themselves."
SRI_officialize_proletarian_defense_formations:0 "Officialize the Proletarian Defense Formations"
SRI_officialize_proletarian_defense_formations_desc:0 "The Proletarian Defense Formations are a broad term encompassing various semi-official paramilitaries existing within the armed structures of the Republic, with most of them being sympathetic to the Communist or Interventionist Syndicalist cause. While the Guardie Rosse is chief among them, there are multiple smaller organizations that could use our support in defending the Revolution from reactionary and capitalist enemies while keeping the proletarian masses safe."
SRI_italian_road_socialism:0 "Italian Road to Socialism"
SRI_italian_road_socialism_desc:0 "A tactic developed by our comrade Palmiro Togliatti, the 'Italian Road to Socialism' is a strategy meant to create a broad basis for the establishment of Communist on our peninsula. Extending the experience we gained while cooperating with the Italian Syncialist Union, especially the faction led by the former chairman Giuseppe Di Vittorio, this road shall involve wider swathes of our population becoming active both within the party. Every decision will take into account a popular democratic centralist process, only through which our programme can be successfully achieved, at least according to the Togliatti faction."
SRI_enshrining_proletarian_constitution:0 "Enshrining a Proletarian Constitution"
SRI_enshrining_proletarian_constitution_desc:0 "Thanks to all the reforms begun by our ambitious party we have taken Italy many steps closer to the achievement of true Communist society. But the enemies of the Revolution and jealous factions within the Republic itself never sleep, hoping for us to slip from that road so they can annul everything we have accomplished so far. This cannot come to pass, and that's why the People's system shall be enshrined into an official constitution for the Republic, one by which we shall be bound and hold the deepest respect for, so the times of top-down autocrats dictating the shape of the nation through their whim alone shall never come again."

Led by the prominent anti-radical general Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi, grandson of his namesake, these modern Garibaldinos seek to set Italy free once and for all. Pulling from the interclassist radical liberalism of Giuseppe Mazzini that calls for the creation of a unitary republic supported by secular spiritualism and civic nationalism while being backed by Randolfo Picciardi and his faction within the Partito Repubblicano Italiano along with Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi’s brothers Sante and Ricciotti Jr. and the rest of the liberal veteran officers within the Associazione Nazionale Combattenti, this counterrevolutionary movement shall topple the militant atheists within the Socialist regime in order to walk the middle line towards freedom, liberty, and equality to all Italians without falling to radicalism or extremism on either side of the aisle on our way towards Italian unification, and Garibaldi and his men are willing to defend such an ideal to the last man."
SRI_dons_to_doges:0 "Assure the Captains of Industry"
SRI_dons_to_doges_desc:0 " During the chaos of the revolution, the industrial heartland of Northwest Italy was nationalized by the newly proclaimed Socialist Republic, and Italy’s world renowned automotive, aeronautic, and shipbuilding industries fell into obscurity. With the state needing a fast and easy avenue towards replenishable funding and capital, our government will reach out to these capitalists, giving assurances to these captains of industry who had fled during the revolution. With their expertise and wealth, we can revitalize Italy’s economic and industrial capabilities, which will be of vital importance if we are to walk in the footsteps of Garibaldi and unite Italy once more.

SRI_align_the_fasci_desc:0 "The National Federation of Agricultural Workers, or Federterra, has been at the forefront of fighting for the rights of rural laborers since its foundation in 1901's Bologna. Growing from humble origins into a mass trade union, the Federterra is a force to be reckoned with, especially considering the support they receive from Unitary Socialists and the allied structures of the General Confederation of Labour. By getting the Federation on our side we would not only acquire valuable contacts within the reformist socialist circles and in the rural parts of the North, but also could reach many more women thanks to the Federterra being the only major trade union led by a woman, that being Argentina Altobelli who merges Mazzinist, feminist and agrarian socialist strains of thought in her work."
SRI_end_radicals:0 "Exterminate the Extremist Fringe"
SRI_end_radicals_desc:0 "Pushed away by the more bombastic voices within the political sphere of the Socialist Republic, small reformist factions within the Unione Socialista Unitaro and disparate groups of republicans have held firm in their moderated stance. In order to create a front against extremism, we will bring these reformists into the spotlight and grant them a place in our new Italy. For the more radical groups, from Mussolini’s Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario to Corradini’s Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, all traces of these revolutionary and overly-radical plagues must be entirely expunged from the Italian consciousness. Only then can our purified and true form of radically liberal republicanism ring true."

SRI_italia_libera_desc:0 "Amassing a broad big tent coalition from across the Italian Centre, Centre-Left, and non-atheist Far-Left under a banner of militant radical liberalism, civic nationalism, and secular spiritualism, the Italia Libera of Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi II and Randolfo Picciardi has united a diverse band of politicians from the Partito Repubblicano Italiano, the Federterra, the Partito d'Azione, the Partito Democratico Italiano, the Partito dei Contadini d'Italia and more from across the non-radical Centre-Left and Centre-Right spectrum in order to save Italy from extremism using the shining torch of liberal unitary republicanism. Furthermore, the coalition calls for a review of the Albertine Statute - Italy’s first modern constitution made in 1848 - in a republican context, the abolition of any concept of royal or revolutionary senate, mass administrative decentralization, the freedom of the various categories of workers to organize themselves as trade unions, the defense of small property and the reduction of income, along with other liberal reforms aimed at eradicating elitism and extremism. Under the Italia Libera, Italy shall forever be safe from violent and radical extremisms such as Totalism and Legionarism, for these ideas shall be hunted down and eradicated as the coalition surges in power to secure our republic’s future."

SRI_rally_the_veterans_desc:0 "The Associazione Nazionale Combattenti is a veteran’s association made of up Italian survivors of the Great War who have since come together by bonding around ideas of anti-Totalism, anti-Legionarism, and radical liberal republicanism. Dominated by figures like Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi II alongside his brothers Sante and Ricciotti Jr, and other famed officers-turned-politicians like Raffaele Rossetti, Gaetano Salvemini, and Luigi Gasparotto, the ANC forms the foundations of the Italia Libera coalition, but these old war dogs can be slow to rouse. We must work to get the entirety of the ANC vocally on our side and active in the movement while also using their influence to get other smaller veteran agencies on our side and away from the gnashing maw of Italian extremist nationalism that has taken hold of so many other similar organizations. With the traditionalist veterans of the ANC on our side, we shall more easily be able to throw our weight around whilst we combat fringe radicalism on a national scale."
SRI_the_king_in_sardinia:0 "A Debate on the King in Sardinia"
SRI_the_king_in_sardinia_desc:0 "Though they exist under their own monarchy, the isle of Sardinia hosts a splinter of our own movement, with their branch of the ANC operating under local leader and fellow Mazzinist Emilio Lussu. Devoted to the same ideas of radical liberalism, constitutionalist direct democracy, class collaborationism, and progressively liberal populism that we are, the Federazione Sarda dell'ANC of Lussu would be perfect allies, if only we can come to terms on the royalist situation. If a constitutionalist compromise was able to be hashed out between our two movements in which our Mazzinist democracy could exist unfettered beneath the unifying guide of a powerless constitutional monarch, peaceful unification between Sardinia and the Mezzogiorno could be well within reach."

SRI_legacy_of_the_gracchi_desc:0 "The brothers Gracchi - Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus - served as plebeian tribunates from 133 BCE to 122/121 BCE respectively, famous for being some of Rome’s earliest progressive social reformers cruelly assassinated at young ages by a reactionary political system steeped in elitism and afraid of true change. With Tiberius passing legislation for a public land survey that would reassert claims and redistribute excess land to poor rural farmers, and with Gaius furthering this policy while spreading it to new Roman colonies outside the peninsula, and with both passing other reforms across many topics such as the assignment of provincial commands, composition of juries for the permanent courts, and the letting of state tax farming contracts, the Gracchi brothers were hellbent on transforming Rome into a truly just and populist paradise for the rural common man, and it is their legacy - one so tragically cut short - that we seek to emulate today. Realizing modernized forms of their proto-Socialist ideas and raising their images and story as new national icons of the republic, our new Italy under Peppino Garibaldi shall do its best to live up to these innocent martyrs and their ingenious legacy."
SRI_correcting_carnaro:0 "Correcting the Charter of Carnaro"
SRI_correcting_carnaro_desc:0 "The Charter of Carnaro was a landmark document written by trade unionist Alceste De Ambris alongside poet Gabriele D’Annunzio that fused Sorelian national syndicalist, corporativist, and democratic republican ideas into one cohesive whole, and it is this document that the Italia Libera holds above all others. Viewing other so-called D’Annunzio loyalist movements like the Totalists of Mussolini or the Legionarists of Corradini as misguided fools only sullying D’Annunzio’s great dream for Italy, we shall put the dream explained within the Carta del Carnaro into practice, creating a syncretic economy kept in check by our concept of radical liberalism and anti-extremist centrism. By fusing the best ideas of Italian politics together while cutting out all of the parasitic and self-serving fat, we shall create the perfect republic."

SRI_emancipate_women_desc:0 "For too long, virtually half of our population has lived their lives politically disenfranchised, slaving away doing more than their fair share of the work required to make Italy the great land it has always been, and according to the Mazzinian Conception - or Mazzini’s worldview - men must make it their duty to help spread women’s rights, with Mazzini even personally admiring British suffragette Jessie White Mario, calling her the bravest woman in modern history. We must rectify this situation by immediately granting women the same rights and privileges as any man would, while also holding them to the same legal standard and granting them the ability to vote in any elections. Doing so will not only make our nation a more equal place, but also ensure newfound political support from millions upon millions of new voters."
SRI_mazzinianist_education:0 "Mazzinist Education"
SRI_mazzinianist_education_desc:0 "Mazzinianesimo, also spelled Mazzinismo and named after its progenitor Giuseppe Mazzini, describes the specific form of radical liberalism championed by our government that posits the idea that the liberation, unification, and future governance of an independent Italian peninsula can only be accomplished through the creation of a constitutional unitary republican state pursuing ideas of interclassism while being supported by mass devotion to a form of civic national religion based around a love for their shared Italian homeland that is pushed as a peaceful and secular alternative to the Catholic-dominated Italian Right and the radical atheism supported by much of the Italian Left. As we work to eradicate illiteracy and grant free basic education to all children in Italy, while also working to expand higher education rates with new universities, grants, and scholarships as well, we shall sprinkle in tastes of this Mazzinist ideology into the expanding curriculum, ensuring that all future generations learn the true and liberal truth as they are molded into productive future members of society."
SRI_laicism:0 "Spiritually Enlightened Secularism Free from the Vatican"
SRI_laicism_desc:0 "Despite our pursuit of secularism, our Mazzinist-based movement does not disparage or despise the Christian faith or broader spirituality, with Giuseppe Mazzini himself considering humanity ‘as the image of God on earth’ while tracing the definition of man's duties to the Law of God. Profoundly spiritualist as well, Mazzini also contested the Syndicalist tendency to attempt to erase not only the transcendent, divine element from the hearts and minds of men, but also the simple sense of duty innate in all throughout what he called the ‘brotherhood’ or ‘association’ of all mankind. However, despite this innate love of faith, Mazzini and the rest of our coalition despite the innate elitism built into the modern Catholic Church and the political and socioeconomic meddling the Papacy has perpetrated for centuries to further its own interests and wealth. As such, while religion shall always have a place in our perfect republic, the Church and wider religion must never play a direct role in politics as we pursue a spiritually-enlightened form of Secularism."

With Mazzinianesimo in mind, a new civic religion shall be crafted for the Italian people with these pro-spiritualist but firmly secularist ideas in mind, allowing the people to carry themselves independently to prosperity with their heads held high."

socitaly.205.t:0 "The March on Turin"
socitaly.205.d:0 "While we thought Garibaldi and his veterans could be trusted, it seems as if we were wrong, today, just hours after the 4th Congress ended in deadlock; Garibaldi and his army of veterans have attempted to take control of the capital. With our grand Militias struggling to keep power, to hold onto Socialism in Italy. The fighting is still intense, and the day ended with..."
socitaly.205.a:0 "Anti-socialist elements within the army rallying around General Garibaldi!"
socitaly.205.b:0 "Red militias regaining control and routing Garibaldi!"

socitaly.206.t:0 "The Sardinian Deal"
socitaly.206.d:0 "It has now come time to finally decide if we shall send the compromise proposal to the Sardinians living under King Amadeo within Emilio Lussu’s Federazione Sarda dell'ANC. If they accept our deal, our nations and movements shall merge under their monarch, who shall continue to serve as a ruling figure head with little power over a dominant democratic government free from royal oversight and dedicated to the Mazzinist dream set forth by Garibaldi II, Piciardi, and Lussu. Though this would compromise our overall republican vision, it would save the lives of untold thousands by avoiding war with little actual damage done to our ultimate operations, for we shall effectively function as a true democratic republic in all but name under a powerless king, while also granting us new allies among the few royalists left in the North like politicians Alfredo Covelli and Achille Lauro or famed general Giovanni Messe. What shall we do?"
socitaly.206.a:0 "Send the proposal."
socitaly.206.b:0 "Republicanism knows no compromise. We will do it on our own."

socitaly.207.t:0 "The Mezzinist Proposal from Northern Italy’s New Garibaldi"
socitaly.207.d:0 "An interesting offer has come in for the Federazione Sarda dell'ANC veteran’s organization headed by the radical liberal Emilio Lussu from the new Northern Italian republican government headed by the counterrevolutionary general Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi - grandson of the famous Italian hero of the our original unification wars. The deal seeks to peacefully unify our two nations under a government of radical liberalism and progressive direct democracy, with the compromise being their normally republican and anti-royalist movement would ally with the sister branch of their ANC here in Sardinia in order to create a united constitutional monarchy spanning Sardinia and Northern Italy, headed by a dominant liberal senate and represented by a powerless monarch in the form of King Amadeo as an alternative to the reign of Victor Emmanuel which has been marred by conservative stagnation and extremist violence. If we were to accept this deal, King Amadeo would be stripped of most of his powers, but the direct democracy that would rise in his wake would be able to effectively guide the masses towards an equal and egalitarian paradise, or so they say, so what say we in return?"
socitaly.207.a:0 "An acceptable proposal. We agree."
socitaly.207.b:0 "Are they mad!?"

socitaly.208.t:0 "Legacy of the Fasci Siciliani"
socitaly.208.d:0 "The Fasci Siciliani dei Lavoratori, Sicilian Workers League, was a popular socialist movement which arose in Sicily during the 1890’s. Gaining support amongst the poorest of the working class who were frustrated with class inequality and political corruption. The Fasci demanded social reforms and when these were not met they began an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout Sicily. The Sicilian peasants who fought and died for their rights are still remembered to this day as an important force in left-wing Italian politics, especially within Southern Italy..."
socitaly.208.a:0 "We remember the fascists!"

socitaly.209.t:0 "Rise of Futurism"
socitaly.209.d:0 "Futurism is an artistic social movement that emphasizes speed, technology, youth and violence. It has emerged as a radical rejection of tradition, opposing both reactionarism and liberalism. Founded by poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the movement has served as an avant-garde vanguard against Italy’s traditionalist and socially conservative populace. It is for this reason that Marinetti has found himself an audience with Chairman Mussolini, Mussolini has admired futurism since its initial inception and hopes that by using this movement the S.R.I can modernize its image. In response Marinetti and other prominent futurists, have pledged their loyalty and support to the Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario!"
socitaly.209.a:0 "Let us race to the future!"

socitaly.211.t:0 "The Sardinians Say Yes"
socitaly.211.d:0 "Sardinia has agreed to our proposal of a compromised but peaceful unification, and now our two nations shall come together without a drop of blood needlessly spilled under a constitutional monarchy bound by the liberal democratic principles of Mazzinianesimo. Long live Italy!"
socitaly.211.a:0 "Viva l'Italia! (Play as Sardinia)"
socitaly.211.b:0 "Viva l'Italia! (Play as Italy)"

socitaly.212.t:0 "Sardinia Turns It Back"
socitaly.212.d:0 "Sardinia has denied our proposal to peacefully unify under a compromise political system, leaving us with little other avenues for recourse. We must either turn our backs on Sardinia, at least for now, or we must prepare for the very war we were trying to avoid. What shall we do?"
socitaly.212.a:0 "Sardinia slips free, for now."
socitaly.212.b:0 "Avanti! We shall take Sardinia by force."

socitaly.213.t:0 "A New Face for the Italia Libera’s Political Front"
socitaly.213.d:0 "Although the national face of this new Italy shall be King Amadeo by design of the compromise, and although general Garibaldi shall maintain his position as the true patriarch, hero, and uniter of this healing state, the political front of the Italia Libera has come to be wracked by debate as the leading position of Randolfo Pacciardi is disputed by his Sardinian counterpart Emilio Lussu. Going with Lussu could be seen as a sign of goodwill to our new Sardinian allies, but would also alienate much of the old guard that have loyally served alongside Pacciardi for years laying in the groundwork for our current successes. Fearing the collapse of our united coalition with our Saridinian allies, some within the Italia Libera have proposed that general Garibaldi should be appointed prime minister to unify both wings of the party. Who shall we choose to lead us into the future?"
socitaly.213.a:0 "Stand loyally alongside Pacciardi."
socitaly.213.b:0 "The Italia Libera unites around Garibaldi."
socitaly.213.c:0 "Yield to Sardinian prowess under Lussu."

socitaly.214.t:0 "The Debate on the Dons to Doges Plan"
socitaly.214.d:0 "The counter-revolutionary state, in this vulnerable and infantile form, needs a fast and easy avenue towards replenishable funding and capital, and with the recent reclamation of the crime-ridden Mezzogirono, an idea has been floated to pardon the leading and most successful dons and bosses of the three main mafia organizations of Southern Italy - the Cosa Nostra of Sicily, the ‘Ndrangheta of Calabria, and the Camorra of Campania - in exchange for them ratting out their co-conspirators, dismantling their criminal organizations, and them joining the government as financial consultants, economic ministers, and business leaders in order to create a culturally-attuned and already-established capitalist foundation from thin air. However, many hardliners reject this idea, desiring nothing less than total justice against the mafiusu and their crimes, leading to a gridlock on this specific issue. \n\nWith the debate on the Dons to Doges plan raging for weeks, it is finally time for Peppino Garibaldi to put an end to the debate once and for all, for he shall finally give his thoughts on the matter while sealing the fate of the three major mafias in Italy - the Cosa Nostra, the ‘Ndrangheta, and the Camorra - once and for all, one way or another. Though these dons and bosses would definitely make profitable titans of industry, whether they can be trusted is another matter entirely. However, their cultural significance and the little good they do for their localities cannot be ignored, for they are living relics and time capsules of an Italian age long since passed, and without them keeping far more base criminals in check, who knows what monsters will fill the power vacuum once they’re gone. So many choices and so many possible repercussions, but a choice must be made, so shall the new doges of Venice and beyond rise again as a new class of ‘loyal’ and hopefully non-corrupt mercantile leaders and scions of capitalist growth, or should we ignore temptation and deal with the mafia for good?"
socitaly.214.a:0 "Okay the plan and turn these crime bosses into capitalist leaders."
socitaly.214.b:0 "Crack down on organized crime and force them into regional obscurity."
socitaly.214.c:0 "Declare all out war on organized crime throughout the nation."

socitaly.215.t:0 "The Brothers Garibaldi and their Black Sheep"
socitaly.215.d:0 "Despite a multitude of allies from all across the Italian political scene of both major and minor importance forming the vast foundation of our coalition, no members get more attention and public adoration than the Garibaldi brothers. The three sons of Ricciotti Garibaldi, himself the son of the famous unification hero General Giuseppe Garibaldi, stand as the most powerful men in Italy, and the most widely beloved. Headed by Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi II, the other brothers Sante and Ricciotti Jr. are war heroes of the Great War and skilled politicians as well, not to be outshined by their older and more famous brother. However, they are not the only existing three of their kind, for Ricciotti Sr. had four other sons and one daughter, who herself largely stays outside the public light. As for the four brothers not within our government, Costante and Bruno died in the Argonne Offensive during the Great War while Menotti Jr. died while on expedition in Sri Lanka in 1934, leaving just Ezio - the black sheep of the Garibaldi family. \n\nA veteran of the Argonne like his brothers, Ezio survived that muddy hellscape to fight further in the Alps until the armistice was signed and Italy was left shattered with its people left broken. Returning home bitter and resentful of the former regime, Ezio fell in with the extremist side of post-D’Annunzio thought, following Mussolini into the throws of National Syndicalism. With the Socialist government toppled however and with Mussolini executed like the traitor he is, the three ruling Garibaldis must now decide what to do with their fallen younger brother."
socitaly.215.a:0 "Publically try Ezio, but spare his life and send him into exile."
socitaly.215.b:0 "Publically try Ezio, and sentence him to a lengthy stint in prison."
socitaly.215.c:0 "Publically try Ezio, and sentence him to death as a message."
socitaly.215.e:0 "Privately pardon Ezio and send him into hiding."
socitaly.215.f:0 "Attempt reeducation by giving Ezio a place in our civil service."

socitaly.216.t:0 "The Masonic Connection"
socitaly.216.d:0 "Despite some unfounded fears by Catholic conservatives across the North, the fact that many of our leaders, like Sante Garibaldi and Randolfo Pacciardi, are Freemasons is nothing to be alarmed of, for even our ideological progenitor Giuseppe Mazzini was a practicing Mason of the Continental variety, which removes much of the restricting rules and barriers to entry for the organization - such as its ban on women - in order to spread masonic teachings atop a more widely popular liberal foundation. The deep links this fraternal organization has with the Italia Libera poses no threat to Italy as the foolish would suspect, but it has opened up strange, unexpected relationships with certain groups. Just recently, we received a masonic delegation from Monrovia who initially came to pay respects to our new government before they realized our party doctrine and began casting aspersions towards our liberal ways before boarding their ship back to Liberia in a huff. Though lodge dinners and secretive rituals may make up some of the backroom chatter in our political meetings, we can assure the public that we Masons only want to do good by our people and our communities."
socitaly.216.a:0 "Hopefully we can remove some atmosphere of suspicion among our Catholic citizenry."

socitaly.217.t:0 "Pacciardi’s Famous Friends"
socitaly.217.d:0 "When not being run ragged running the state as the main political leader behind Peppino Garibaldi, Randolfo Pacciardi has been known to rub elbows with some of the world’s brightest cultural figures. A close friend of American author Ernest Hemingway and his lover the novelist Martha Gellhorn, Pacciardi has been spotted vacationing in the United States with these titans of the written word when not helping other friends like famed director Michael Curtiz in the making of his new hit film ‘Casablanca.’ A socialite in touch with the common man, Pacciardi is just the silver-tongued suave elite that our movement needed to serve as our middle-man with the public and the senate as we work together to destroy the elitism he happily benefits from in the meantime. Despite this opulent lifestyle, Pacciardi is a committed Mazzinist wholly dedicated to our radical liberal cause, and without him we would be more junta than true republican effort."
socitaly.217.a:0 "Here’s looking at you, Randolfo."

socitaly.218.t:0 "Legacy of the Garibaldian Escape"
socitaly.218.d:0 "The Garibaldi family has a storied history with the small city-state of San Marino, with the small slice of autonomous paradise once operating as a safe haven for Italy’s various liberal revolutionaries during the Italian Resurgence, including our own leader’s grandfather the great hero Giuseppe Garibaldi. During his time fleeing Austrian forces in 1849, Garibaldi the elder sought asylum in the city-state, and thanks to the word of Captain Regent Domenico Maria Belzoppi, himself a former liberal revolutionary as well, Garibaldi, his wife Anita, and his 1,500 men were able to sneak into San Marino unharassed in exchange for most of them giving up their arms and going into hiding as to not bring ruin to the city. Following this act of mercy, Garibaldi, Anita, and 150 of their closest loyalists who refused to abandon the heroic general all were able to sneak out of San Marino under the noses of some 12,000 pursuing Austrian soldiers with the help of the Captain Regent’s guard, with Garibaldi forever swearing to honor and protect the city in his wake. Nearly a century later, another Garibaldi now stands as Italy’s unifier, and now a choice must once again be made regarding San Marino. Should Peppino honor the legacy of his grandfather and Captain Regent Belzoppi, allowing San Marino to continue its autonomous existence as allies, or should we not risk anything on our path to towards the total unification of Italy, snuffing out San Marinese independence while we still have the chance?"
socitaly.218.a:0 "Uphold this legacy of cooperation and support San Marino’s autonomy."
socitaly.218.b:0 "Damn the past! Dissolve San Marinese autonomy and integrate the city-state."

socitaly.219.t:0 "Legacy of the First Expedition of the Thousand"
socitaly.219.d:0 "Citing the first Spedizione dei Mille, or Expedition of the Thousand, of 1860 that was led by our own leader’s grandfather - the great hero General Giuseppe Garibaldi - and that our own modern movement takes inspiration from, many radical warhawks within the ANC wish to get revenge on those that once sought to keep Italy divided not only in Austria as is planned with the Fourth War of Italian Independence, but also against the descendants of the Crown of Aragon that utilized their Bourbon puppets to keep the Mezzogiorno under their boot for decades. Calling for the conquest of Aragonese Spain, or all of it, as well as Corsica, the Balearics, and the Aragonese provinces in southern France and eastern Greece, these mad men would have us set sail to foreign lands to ‘get revenge’ on crimes wrought by men long dead in a time that has long healed from these past transgressions. Should we really cave to the jingoistic and dangerous desires of these zealots, or should we stick to the normal scope of the Risorgimento?"
socitaly.219.a:0 "All of Spain shall pay for the crimes of the Aragonese."
socitaly.219.b:0 "Avanti against Aragonese tyranny! We move to conquer Aragonese Iberia."
socitaly.219.c:0 "We shall not rest until the entirety of the Crownlands of old Aragon are under our control!"
socitaly.219.e:0 "We cannot become the oppressive conquerors they were."

socitaly.220.t:0 "A Flag for the Perfect Republic"
socitaly.220.d:0 "With our perfect republic under the genius of Mazzinianesimo being created under the guidance of General Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi and his right-hand man Randolfo Pacciardi, the only major decision left to make before we get on with the statecraft is to choose which flag shall fly above our heads."
socitaly.220.a:0 "Stick with our traditional tricolor."
socitaly.220.b:0 "A flag adorned with the Gracchi Brothers."
socitaly.220.c:0 "A flag emblazoned with the visage of Garibaldi the Great."
socitaly.220.e:0 "A tricolor decorated with the flaming sword of Italia Libera and our Action Party offshoots."

socitaly.221.t:0 "The Dream of a Latin Union"
socitaly.221.d:0 "Starting as an international movement spurred on in order to protect and preserve the unique culture and linguistic roots of the Romance languages and their peoples spread across Iberia, France, Italy, and Romania, the goals of the Latin Union project have begun to shift as more and more thinkers inspired by Pan-European movements advocate for not only the complete cooperation between these sister states, but the total unification of them as well. Should we cave to these outlandish but heartfelt dreams to save our culture from dying to modernism and globalism by working to unite the Romance language nations by whatever means necessary, or should we laugh off these ridiculous plans and keep the project grounded along economic and cooperative lines?"
socitaly.221.a:0 "Keep the idea rooted."
socitaly.221.b:0 "Pursue the Latin Union dream in full!"

socitaly.222.t:0 "Universalism and Esperantism"
socitaly.222.d:0 "In the eyes of many modern scholars, the universalist works and worldviews of both the original Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giusppe Mezzini were some of the larger sources of influence for the growing Esperantist movement that seeks to unite mankind with a shared fabricated language, with these ideological forefathers of ours being likened to other sources of Esperantist inspiration like William of Orange, George Washington, and Lajos Kossuth by members of this strange ideology. General Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi has been somewhat outspoken in public on the matter, denying that his late grandfather had any direct links to the movement, largely due to Garibaldi dying before Esperanto was even invented, but that has not stopped local firebrands from jumping on the idea and lumping Mezzinist doctrine in with the Esperantist Dream. Viewing the constructed, artificial language as a perfect unifying force free of any nationalist or extremist taint that shall help unify the Italian and non-Italian peoples of our united peninsula along Mazzinist doctrine, the Federazione Esperantista Italiana (called the Itala Esperanto-Federacio in their own made-up tongue) has begun to loudly voice their support for the Garibaldi government regardless of Peppino’s words while championing the idea of raising Esperanto alongside Italian as an official language of the perfected republic, while simultaneously working to teach the new language to all students in our newly constructed Mezzinist public schools across the nation. \n\nAligning ourselves with these linguistic humanists would go a long way in legitimizing our universalist stance while granting us new allies across the Italian Left. However, most see this proposed linguistic shift as ‘un-Italian’ even despite our shared and popular non-nationalist, universalist, and anti-ethnocentric message, with most within our government and nearly all outside it calling the plan plain mad. What shall be our state’s official position on this artificial tongue?"
socitaly.222.a:0 "Work to place Esperanto on equal footing with the Italian language."
socitaly.222.b:0 "Promote the language in a non-official capacity."

socitaly.223.t:0 "The Tale of the Duke of Aosta"
socitaly.223.d:0 "Back in 1870, Spain was ruled by King Amadeo I who still stands as Spain’s only monarch in its entire history to come from our own House of Savoy, with Amadeo - also called Amadeus - being the second son of Victor Emmanuel II and thus raised as the spare to the true heir, living most of his life as the Duke of Aosta like all second sons within the House of Savoy before him. However, Amaedo’s rule was doomed from the start as his Spanish domain rapidly decayed under mounting republican pressure, Carlist rebellions in the north, and the threat of Cuban independence. After just three tumultuous years on the throne, he abdicated in 1873 - famously calling the Spanish people ‘ungovernable’ before the Cortes Generales upon his exit - and thus the first Spanish Republic was born. Returning to Italy, he founded the Aosta branch of the House of Savoy, which was junior to the main line descended from King Umberto I which still rules North Italy to this day, but senior to the dukes of Genoa, and now with Italy being shattered, the Aosta branch finds itself ruling an independent Kingdom of Sardinia once again, now under the grandson of Amadeo I who uses his grandfather's regal name. With our government loyal sworn to the Aosta branch of the House of Savoy, and to the legacy of Amadeo I along with it, some radical warhawks within our ranks wish to see the old realm of our beloved Amadeus restored, calling for an Italian ‘reconquest’ of Savoyard Spain. Though utterly ludicrous, many still chomp at the bit for revenge against the Iberians for one past transgression or another, so should we take this rare opportunity to seize on some long forgotten ‘destiny’, or should we continue to focus on Italian matters first and foremost, for the peninsula and the wider Italian sphere is unstable enough as it is..."
socitaly.223.a:0 "Reclaim the legacy of Amadeo I and ride to Iberia!"
socitaly.223.b:0 "We have more pressing and realistic matters to attend to."

socitaly.224.t:0 "The Final Fate of the Democratic Promise"
socitaly.224.d:0 "Despite the Counterrevolution starting under the pseudo-vanguardism of Randolpho Pacciardi’s Partito Repubblicano Italiano allied with the Associazione Nazionale Combattenti headed by the Garibaldi brothers, the end goal for their envisioned and so-called ‘perfect’ republic was to create a truly free system of direct democracy, which has been achieved on a local level all throughout Italy as the various towns and communes vote on their issues, representatives, legislation and more within the wider unitary system that dictates national law. However, this national level has remained in our hands without a say from the wider masses, begging the question of when, or even if, our nation shall hold elections on a national level now that the masses have been saved from extremism. So the question that begs answering is should General Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi II follow through with his destiny as a modern Cincinnatus and a true hero of the people like his grandfather and namesake before him by preparing to step down while the first fair elections since the Counterrevolution are organized, even if it leads to a partial departure to our own Mazzinist values, or should this era of liberal political tutelage continue indefinitely until a ‘true’ sense of stability has been achieved as to to ensure that the Counterrevolution is forever secure as the perfect egalitarian republic is slowly built from on high?"
socitaly.224.a:0 "Continue the necessary tutelage of Garibaldi."
socitaly.224.b:0 "Make good on the promise and begin to organize elections."

socitaly.225.t:0 "The First Post-Counterrevolutionary Elections"
socitaly.225.d:0 "With their decision to yield to true democratic proceedings, the Garibaldi brothers and Pacciardi have moved to organize the nation’s first elections since the Counterrevolution as a new league of reformed and de-radicalized parties rises to the competition. Although all parties in the running have been vetted by the Garibaldi government while all promising to maintain the foundations and founding principles of free, honest, and secular liberal democracy first laid by our initial government, this newly-packed political stage is as varied as ever. From qgraro-wocialist reminists and conservative royalists now supportive of the constitutionalist system to an emboldened socialistic conservative peasant party, the Italian people finally have a diverse array of honest and hopefully incorruptible political parties to choose from, so now they must finally choose...and their choice is?"
socitaly.225.a:0 "The rural unionists of Argentina Altobelli’s Federazione Nazionale dei Lavoratori della Terra."
socitaly.225.b:0 "The liberal socialists of Carlo Rosselli’s Partito d'Azione."
socitaly.225.c:0 "Stand by Pacciardi and Garibaldi in the Partito Repubblicano Italiano."

socitaly.226.t:0 "Amadeo Avenged!"
socitaly.226.d:0 "After six decades, King Amadeo has avenged his grandfather and had successfully led a military campaign to bring the unruly Spanish lands under the House of Savoy-Aosta once more. With the Bourbon loyalists, Carlist pretenders, and the Anarchist rabble driven into hiding by our mighty army, we must now decide what to do with the former domain of King Amadeus. Shall we allow the Spanish a degree of autonomy in exchange for their government proclaiming Amadeo as the new King of Spain, or shall we put an end to any motion of Spanish autonomy and usher in a new glorious union between our two nations?"
socitaly.226.a:0 "Allow the Spaniards autonomy under the House of Savoy-Aosta."

socitaly.1.t:0 "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.1.d:0 "In 1919, the Italians signed an armistice with the Austrians, ending the war for the Kingdom of Italy. However, the brave socialists and nationalists in Italy rose up against the destructive Savoyards, determined to replace their system with something better. Even King Victor Emanuel and his son’s abdication was not enough to stop the will of the people, and civil war broke out across Italy. Even as we pushed the royalists out of northern Italy, however, there were traitors in our own ranks. The “Whites” in the republican uprising, unwilling to accept the inevitability of the revolution, broke with our movement and soon sold themselves out completely to the Austrians. With our enemies all united against us, our advances were halted on the Po and on the Abruzzo line, and the war was over. \n\nSince the ceasefire in 1920, three Congresses have come and gone, and revolutionary fervor has spread to every corner of northern Italy. Much has been done to uplift the Italian peasantry from their previous conditions, but much still remains to do."
socitaly.1.a:0 "Forward!"

socitaly.200.t:0 "Uniting Italy"
socitaly.200.d:0 "Italian nationalists have already begun the call for a Second Risorgimento, to unify Italy once more. Spreading the revolution will not be a simple matter, however. The peninsula exists in an uneasy balance: Germany and Austria are wary of any formal alliance between the SRI and the Third Internationale. They know an alliance is inevitable, but any attempt on our part to bring the French and English into a war to reunite Italy under syndicalist rule would draw intervention and start a new Weltkrieg. The Republic of Italy to the east is protected by Austria, but under a similar prohibition against starting a war against us. So long as the prospect of German and Austrian interference remains, we must be aware that any war to reunite Italy can only be done with limited Third Internationale support. We have not made a move yet, but we cannot sit idly for much longer - Italy must be reunited!"

### Fourth Congress ###
socitaly.2.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.2.d:0 "Today, the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy begins. The various factions of the Congress will debate economic, internal, and military policies. The Unione Sindacale Italiana seek to push orthodox Syndicalism, advancing the current policies of the congress, while the Partito Socialista Unitario desire a government that supports a more moderate approach to bringing socialism to the country. Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario, advances the new ideology of Garibaldismo, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."
socitaly.2.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

socitaly.3.t:0 "Day 1: Economic Policy"
socitaly.3.d:0 "The first order of business is the economic policy of the Republic. The Partito Socialista Unitario advocate for a focus on agrarianism and supporting the rural communes. The Unione Sindacale Italiana and the Partito Comunista d'Italia argue for furthering syndicalist economic policies so as to develop the nation into a proper industrial democratic republic. Mussolini's Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario, for their part, demand nothing short of total and immediate industrialisation, implemented by a powerful central government."
socitaly.3.a:0 "We must expand our agriculture."
socitaly.3.b:0 "We should focus on industrialisation."
socitaly.3.c:0 "Nothing short of total industrialisation will suffice!"

socitaly.4.t:0 "Day 2: Internal Policy"
socitaly.4.d:0 "The discussion on the second day of the Congress focused on more internal matters. Both the Partito Comunista d'Italia and the Unione Sindacale Italiana's representative came forward and pushed for further empowerment of the unions while the Partito Socialista Unitario's representative came forward and pushed for empowering the rural communes instead. Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario's representative argued that it is the Chairman of the Republic that should be empowered."
socitaly.4.a:0 "Focus on empowering the Communes"
socitaly.4.b:0 "Focus on empowering the Unions"
socitaly.4.c:0 "Focus on Empowering the Chairman"

socitaly.5.t:0 "Day 3: Religious Policy"
socitaly.5.d:0 "The final order of business is the status of Christianity within the republic. The Partito Socialista Unitario, while an atheist party in nature, say that Italian culture is bound up with that of the Catholic Church. Trying to divorce the two would be folly, so they say a common ground must be found where the Church can work with the government rather than against it. The Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario, on the other hand, claim that Christianity is archaic and unsuited for the modern age, and that a state atheism which forces religion out of daily life will break the chain of ignorance. Finally, the Unione Sindacale Italiana and Partito Comunista d'Italia support a status quo of official secularism, where the government is non-religious in all matters and neither works with the church nor against it."

socitaly.10.d:0 "In an effort to block the dangerous Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario from achieving any kind of power, the Unione Sindacale Italiana and Partito Comunista d'Italia have agreed to form a coalition government.

socitaly.19.d:0 "A number of highly-placed Catholics who have been deemed at risk for supporting the Papacy over their own government were recently rounded up by the Republican Guard today and placed in prison until such a time as they can be properly vetted. It's a move that's sure to outrage other Catholics in the republic, but should any trouble arise, the presence of so many ready informants will ensure it is dealt with readily."
socitaly.19.a:0 "It must be done, for the greater good"

socitaly.20.t:0 "Northern Catholics Suppressed"
socitaly.20.d.nosic:0 "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of Syndicalism, the government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful – anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to the Pope – and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation. It's a move which has spurred resentment in the south, and renewed calls for war. There are those within the Pope's inner circle who suggest this also presents an opportunity: to use the outrage within [SRI.GetNameDef] and fund a resistance movement. While the possibility exists that [SRI.GetNameDef] could discover our connection and go to war with us, the resistance could significantly weaken them and afford us the ability to raise partisans behind enemy lines once the war begins."

socitaly.29.d.last:0 "Earlier today, the last of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators.

socitaly.32.t:0 "Policy Towards the Church"
socitaly.32.d.radsoc:0 "While the policy of the Partito Socialista Unitario is to work with the Church, our support of the Worker-Priest movement has created mixed reactions amongst the faithful.

There is a concern within the government that this resistance will only provide an opening for the Papacy to exploit once it comes time for war with the Mezzogiorno."
socitaly.32.d.synd:0 "While the policy of the Unione Sindacale Italiana has been to ignore matters of faith, many within our government say our support of the Worker-Priest movement has violated our traditional neutrality. What's more, it's causing mixed reactions amongst the country's faithful. Some of them claim we are perverting the Christian faith towards an industrial cause, and question the use of scripture in motivating workers.

socitaly.33.d:0 "The economy of the country has been suffering in recent years. While great progress has been made since the civil war that tore Italy apart, we must consider ways to improve the economy. Two main proposals have been put forth to the Chamber. The first, favoured by the Partito Socialista Unitario, would focus on decentralising our industry by empowering the various communes throughout the country. The second plan, put forth by the Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario, is nearly the exact opposite. It instead would favour creating an organisation called the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) that will organise and guide the syndicates and unions in order to bring prosperity to Italy and its people."

socitaly.34.t:0 "Reviewing the Army"
socitaly.34.d:0 "The Red Army and the Defense Formations have been the backbone of the Socialist Republic of Italy's army since the civil war. The Defense Formations are organised as local militias, having major support among the local communes that field and equip them. However, with some nationalists seeking to reunify Italy, plans have been put forth to turn the Red Army into a truly professional force. Such plan is controversial for many members of the Defense Formations that are highly suspicious of a centralised military apparatus, despite the benefits that it will bring."

Celebrations are being held throughout the nation, and Rome in particular, in honour of this momentous event."
socitaly.41.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

socitaly.42.t:0 "The Fate of the Pope"
socitaly.42.d:0 "One of the first issues on the agenda is what is to be done with the Pope. The Partito Socialista Unitario argue that the government has no business interfering with the Catholic Church, and that the Pope should be left alone. The Unione Sindacale Italiana and the Partito Comunista d'Italia believe that the throne of Saint Peter's should be occupied by a socialist. Finally, the Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario argues that the office of the Papacy is outdated and the Pope should be exiled. What shall be the decision of the Congress?"
socitaly.42.a:0 "Leave the Church alone."
socitaly.42.b:0 "Install a Red Pope."
socitaly.42.c:0 "Exile the Pope from Italy."

socitaly.43.t:0 "Internal Policy"
socitaly.43.d:0 "The second matter on the Fifth Congress's agenda is how to handle the issue of dissidents in the Republic. Not all within the Republic are accepting socialism, particularly in the areas where the reactionaries held sway prior to the Second Risorgimento. The Partito Socialista Unitario argues for a conciliatory policy, granting general amnesty and focusing on building socialism instead of going after the dissidents. The Unione Sindacale Italiana and the Partito Comunista d'Italiabelieves that a propaganda effort to show socialism's progress, combined with a balanced approach to law enforcement, will help change the minds of the dissidents. The Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario, for their part, wants to empower OVRA to clamp down on any dissent against the republic. What shall the Congress decide?"
socitaly.43.a:0 "The dissidents are not a threat."
socitaly.43.b:0 "Increase the propaganda to support the Republic."
socitaly.43.c:0 "Arrest the dissidents and those who help them!"

socitaly.44.t:0 "Italy's Place on the World Stage"
socitaly.44.d:0 "The next order of the Congress is to decide on what role the Socialist Republic of Italy shall play within the International and on the world stage. Until the Second Risorgimento, the Republic was focused on reuniting Italy, but now that that goal has been achieved, Italy's political future must be determined. The Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario believe that Italy should focus on spreading the revolution to all corners of the world while both the Unione Sindacale Italiana and the Partito Comunista d'Italia believe the focus should be first on Europe. Finally, the Partito Socialista Unitario believe Italy's role is to help nurture socialism within Italy and the members of the International first."

socitaly.50.t:0 "Prisoner of the Vatican"
socitaly.50.d:0 "His Holiness has locked himself within the Vatican, as previous popes did during the days of the Kingdom of Italy. He refuses to acknowledge that [SRI.GetNameDef] rules Italy. However, so long as he is locked within the Vatican, he can do little but make noise. Now, the debate has been renewed: should we just leave the Pope alone to rant and rave, force the Conclave to pick a socialist Pope, or send him into exile?"
socitaly.50.a:0 "Exile the Pope!"
socitaly.50.b:0 "Make the Conclave elect a socialist priest"

socitaly.51.t:0 "The Papal Conclave Begins"
socitaly.51.d:0 "The Papal Conclave has begun! The Holy See shall come together and choose a new pope that shall support Socialism. It may take some time but they will eventually elect a new Pope who will do his part to liberate the faithful from their chains."
socitaly.51.a:0 "They shall choose right!"

socitaly.52.t:0 "A New Pope"

socitaly.53.a:0 "Get out of here!"

socitaly.54.t:0 "The Pope Arrives in [Root.GetNameDef]"
socitaly.54.d:0 "The Pope has arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] today, seeking refuge from the syndicalists within Italy who have exiled him from the country. A large crowd has already come out to meet the Holy Father. He has requested more permanent residence in one of our cathedrals, until such a time as the Vatican is once more restored to freedom."
socitaly.54.a:0 "Stay as long you want, Holy Father!"

socitaly.65.t:0 "The Vatican Commune"
socitaly.65.d:0 "We have recently concluded a productive meeting with the Pope. A tiny commune will be created around Saint Peter's Basilica called the Vatican Commune that will be independent from the Republic. Meanwhile, he will accept the legitimacy of our Republic and urge Catholics worldwide to do so as well. This marks a great day for the faithful and for the Republic."
socitaly.65.a:0 "Thank you, Holy Father!"

socitaly.66.t:0 "Revolutionary Irredentism"
socitaly.66.d:0 "There are still Italian lands and our Italian brothers and sisters that are held in bondage, and it is time that the Chamber take a stance on their liberation. Some suggest focusing on just the ones in Austria, others think that we should focus on them but also include Malta. The Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario call for a true Greater Italia to be created as a new light of socialism in the world."
socitaly.66.a:0 "Just help liberate our comrades in Austria."

socitaly.68.t:0 "Trial for Reactionary Leaders"
socitaly.68.d:0 "With our victory over the reactionary forces, the leaders of the corrupt republic and the "noble" leaders of the despotic kingdoms are standing trial. Some want us to be lenient with them while others want us to be harsh and make an example of them. How shall the court rule?"
socitaly.68.a:0 "Lenient. We already have our victory."
socitaly.68.b:0 "Make an example of them."

socitaly.69.t:0 "What to do with Royal Palaces?"
socitaly.69.d:0 "With the conquest of the South, we have taken control of the territory of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and as we bring the revolution southward, the question of what to do about the various noble and royal palaces has arisen. Some think that they should be given over to the local communes, others think that the government should use them for the various ministry positions. Finally, some support the idea of giving them over to the Workers Youth League."
socitaly.69.a:0 "Turn them over to the local communes."

socitaly.69.c:0 "Make them youth camps."

socitaly.70.t:0 "Resistance to Secularism"
socitaly.70.d:0 "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our official policy of secularism is causing problems with reintegrating the Italian people into a cohesive nation. The Catholic Church was far more powerful in the rest of Italy than in our republic. Consequently, many people are trying to resist and slowing the progress of bringing the revolution to the rest of Italy."
socitaly.70.a:0 "They will learn in time."

socitaly.71.t:0 "Non-Interference Policies Help"
socitaly.71.d:0 "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our non-interference towards christianity is proving to be popular with the people and helpful in bringing them to understand the principles of socialism. While there is still quite a bit of resistance among the more dedicated reactionaries, there is less than our strategists expected before the war."
socitaly.71.a:0 "Thank 'heavens'!"

socitaly.72.t:0 "Land Reform in Southern Italy"
socitaly.72.d:0 "Now that we have control of Southern Italy, it is time to bring land reform to the south and bring the revolution to the southern farmers. The package of land reforms prepared by the Chamber will collectivise and give the land back to the farmers. Furthermore, local agriculture unions will be created to bring syndicalism south."
socitaly.72.a:0 "Break the chains!"

socitaly.73.t:0 "Industrialisation for the South"
socitaly.73.d:0 "The south was never industrialised to its full potential. However, now that we have control of the south we can begin a program to industrialise the region. This will help improve the lives of the people living there by bringing jobs and development and lowering inequality across Italy."
socitaly.73.a:0 "Progress moves south!"

socitaly.74.t:0 "Syndicalisation of the Economy"
socitaly.74.d:0 "With Italy now united, the question has arisen as to how to bring the syndicalist economy to the rest of Italy. Some think the best way is to focus on building up the unions in the areas. Others think the best way to syndicalise the rest of the country is to focus on collective farming. A third option is worker co-operatives, especially those that serve the military, which could be the key to revolutionizing the new regions."
socitaly.74.a:0 "Focus on the unions."
socitaly.74.b:0 "Focus on communal farming."
socitaly.74.c:0 "Focus on worker co-operatives."

socitaly.75.t:0 "New Communes"
socitaly.75.d:0 "With the rest of Italy now under our control, new revolutionary communes are being formed throughout the Republic, from Lombardy and Venetia to Sicily and Naples. These communes have become new social centres and bases for spreading the revolution in the areas."
socitaly.75.a:0 "Lunga Vita ai Comuni!"

socitaly.76.t:0 "Resistance to Social Changes"
socitaly.76.d:0 "Since we have united Italy there has been resistance against the various social changes that we have implemented in the Republic since its founding, particularly in the case of women's rights. The changes that we have brought to Italian society will take time, but eventually, the rest of Italy shall accept them."
socitaly.76.a:0 "Damn reactionaries!"

socitaly.77.t:0 "OVRA help prevent trouble"
socitaly.77.d:0 "OVRA have apprehended a number of reactionary traitors to the Republic operating in the south. The Ministers have made sure that no one in the rest of Italy will dare betray the revolution."
socitaly.77.a:0 "The Secret Police to the Rescue!"

socitaly.78.t:0 "Fasci Siciliani Founded"
socitaly.78.d:0 "The original Fasci Siciliani was a socialist movement in Sicily in the 1880s and 1890s. They were eventually crushed, but their legacy was long-lasting; they fought for democracy and socialism and were true revolutionaries. Today, a new Fasci Siciliani has been founded, drawing on the legacy of the old organisation. This new Fasci Siciliani is focusing on spreading the ideals of the republic into Sicily."
socitaly.78.a:0 "Long live the Fasci!"

socitaly.79.t:0 "Exhibition of the Revolution"
socitaly.79.d:0 "In 1919 the Socialist Republic of Italy was proclaimed. However, the resulting civil war would leave Italy divided. Since then, we have erased these false borders, reunified Italy, and brought the revolution to all corners of our country! To demonstrate our glorious victory to the people, a grand exhibition of the revolution and our struggles and losses has been unveiled in Roma. Celebrating the struggle to bring syndicalism to all corners of Italy, it will no doubt help to educate the masses about the revolution and inform them of the glory of a reunited Italy."
socitaly.79.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

socitaly.80.t:0 "Women Entering Politics"
socitaly.80.d:0 "While women have been legally allowed to vote, work in politics, and sit in the Grand Chamber of Labour since the founding of our Republic, it is only now that we have unified Italy that women throughout the whole of the country enjoy these rights. Many women, especially those from the south and the northeast where the reactionaries ruled, are now taking steps to enter politics for the first time in their lives, from local unions and communes to the Chamber itself."
socitaly.80.a:0 "Great!"

socitaly.84.t:0 "Female Red Guard Divisions"
socitaly.84.d:0 "With the decision to create the Gruppi di Difesa della Donna, a number of women have formed their own defence unit based out of the city of Livorno. These women have called their unit the Prospero Brigade in honour of the minister who helped create the Gruppi in the first place."
socitaly.84.a:0 "We need every man and woman we can get!"

socitaly.85.t:0 "The Worker-Priest Movement"
socitaly.85.d:0 "The Worker-Priest movement is a movement for the priests of the Catholic Church to help connect to the faithful by working in factories like the laity. The movement is rather popular in the Republic at the moment, and affords the priests the opportunity to connect more closely to the people. Sometimes, sermons can even be heard inside factories and workshops after hours, as the faithful listen to the priests at the end of a long day."
socitaly.85.a:0 "Jesus was a carpenter, after all."

socitaly.86.t:0 "Christian Associations of Italian Workers"
socitaly.86.d:0 "The Christian Associations of Italian Workers, or Associazioni Cristiane dei Lavoratori Italiani (often abbreviated as ACLI), are the largest Catholic lay organisation within the Republic. The goal of the organisation is to help Catholics follow and live in accordance with the philosophy of Christian socialism. Unsurprisingly, the Associazioni are heavily connected with the Popularist Movement and thus more moderate members of the Unitary Socialist faction within the Grand Chamber of Labour."
socitaly.86.a:0 "Let us follow in the steps of Jesus."

socitaly.87.t:0 "Futuristic Architecture"
socitaly.87.d:0 "'This is the greatest absurdity of modern architecture. It is perpetuated by the greedy complicity of academies, internment camps for the intelligentsia, where the young are forced to recopy classical models onanistically instead of straining their imaginations to search for solutions to new and urgent problems: the Futurist house and city. A house and city spiritually and materially our own, in which our riotous activity can rage without seeming a grotesque anachronism.' So reads the Futurist Manifesto of architecture. Futurism as an architectural movement has recently been highly popular among the Blocco Nazionale Rivoluzionario. Mussolini, in particular, is a noted patron of architects building in that style."
socitaly.87.a:0 "The Future is now!"

socitaly.88.t:0 "Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana"
socitaly.88.d:0 "The Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana, or Italian Recreational and Cultural Association, is the largest recreational society within the Republic. Founded in Florence in the 1920s, the organisation is purely secular, and its goal is to help support recreational activities for the people as well as to support solidarity amongst the citizens of the Republic. Culture that was once only the purview of the elites, such as opera, plays, and classical music, are now available for the people to enjoy. Furthermore, the Associazione supports book clubs, countryside vacations, and more through arrangements with local communes and unions."
socitaly.88.a:0 "Culture belongs to the masses!"

socitaly.89.t:0 "Unione Donne Italiane Congress"
socitaly.89.d:0 "'We don't see why the revolution is in the hands of only half the population. We are anarchists, but we are also women and we want to make our revolution. Not have men make it for us. We don't want a struggle designed to fit the male because we'll be screwed, as always. We want to fight so that we can claim our part in the share-out. We want to make it clear that just now we're beside ourselves with joy and it would be a mistake to keep us at home knitting! We want to die! But we want to die like men, not live like servants!' So said Ada Prospero at the annual congress of the Unione Donne Italiane, the largest women's organisation in the republic. The Union's goal is dedicated to women's emancipation and liberation. Ada Prospero, in particular, supports the creation of female combat units to fight for the unification of Italy."
socitaly.89.a:0 "We shall see."

socitaly.90.d:0 "The 1936-1937 Series A Finale for the Italian football league championship has reached the last round. Torino playing against Bologna. The Bulls against the Greyhounds. Bologna is the clear favourite to win, as they are the current reigning champions; however, the Torino team this year is playing strong. Who shall win the championship for this year?"
socitaly.90.a:0 "Who shall win, indeed!"

socitaly.91.t:0 "Bologna Wins 1937 Championship game!"
socitaly.91.d:0 "It was a close match, but Bologna won with a score of 2-1, remaining as the reigning champions of the Italian League. Naturally, the city of Bologna is celebrating this victory."
socitaly.91.a:0 "The Greyhounds remain the champions!"

socitaly.92.t:0 "Torino Wins 1937 Championship Game!"
socitaly.92.d:0 "In a stunning upset, the Torino team defeated Bologna 1-0. For the first time in just under a decade, the reigning champions were defeated. The city of Torino will surely be celebrating all night after this stunning victory."
socitaly.92.a:0 "The Bulls are the new champions!"

socitaly.100.t:0 "The Founding of Cinecittà"
socitaly.100.d:0 "Benito Mussolini unveiled the opening of Cinecittà today outside the city of Florence. Cinecittà was planned by numerous architects to be less of a film studio and more of a small cinema city. Mussolini himself was quoted as saying during the opening of the studio: 'Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism.'. Many aspiring filmmakers are already speaking with the unions of the area to see about producing films there, while some are already calling it Hollywood on the Arno."
socitaly.100.a:0 "Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism!"

socitaly.101.t:0 "Death of Filippo Turati"
socitaly.101.d:0 "Today, the great statesman Filippo Turati has passed away at the age of 79 years old. Filippo Turati was one of the last surviving founders of the Italian Socialist Party. His strong and constant support of the rights of the workers of Italy from his earliest days has made him famous throughout the Republic. In addition to founding the Socialist Party of Italy, he was also one of the principal architects of the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Italy. The funeral in Torino was attended by visitors from nations around the world and officials from across the political spectrum, all paying their respects to the late great leader as various labour songs were sung, including Inno dei Lavoratori which he penned himself."
socitaly.101.a:0 "The passing of a torch."

socitaly.102.t:0 "Maggio Musicale Fiorentino"
socitaly.102.d:0 "In the city of Florence, conductor Vittorio Gui has created a new festival called the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, dedicated to performing operas and musicals free of charge for the people so that way the classics can be enjoyed by all citizens, not just the privileged elites. The opening opera for the festival was Giuseppe Verdi's Nabucco. While it is the first of its kind in Italy, Vittorio Gui has stated he hopes that the Maggio Musicale's success can be replicated in cities throughout the Republic."
socitaly.102.a:0 "Opera for the People!"

socitaly.103.t:0 "Enrico Fermi creates the Pisa Pile-1"
socitaly.103.d:0 "Enrico Fermi has recently created the Pisa Pile-1; the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Created with the help of students from the University of Pisa, the device may have only been capable of generating a half watt of power, but its success proves that a nuclear reactor can be built."
socitaly.103.a:0 "Comrade Fermi brings progress for the Republic and for the world!"

socitaly.104.t:0 "Enrico Fermi wins Noble Prize"
socitaly.104.d:0 "The physicist Enrico Fermi has recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity. Fermi, who has been a professor at the University of Pisa since the civil war, has published numerous works on physics, especially relating to the new field of nuclear physics. With his Nobel Prize, the Socialist Republic of Italy can celebrate another hero of Italy and of Socialism."
socitaly.104.a:0 "A hero of the Republic!"

socitaly.105.t:0 "Commune of San Marino"
socitaly.105.d:0 "The city-state of San Marino is one of the longest surviving republics on the Italian Peninsula. A relic from the city-state era, San Marino has survived for centuries, lasting from the Roman era all the way to the Risorgimento, and even through the Civil War and the Second Risorgimento. It has long been a haven for refugees from oppression. Today, the elections have brought the Socialists into power in the city-state, and the new Captain Regents are working on bringing syndicalism to their tiny commune. They have assured our republic that they wish to remain friends and seek to build bridges between the two republics."
socitaly.105.a:0 "Greetings Comrades!"

socitaly.106.t:0 "Roma Jazz Festival"
socitaly.106.d:0 "With Rome once again the capital of Italy, a jazz festival has been put on by the various musical unions throughout Italy. Jazz has been within Italy since before the revolution, starting in 1904, though modern Italian Jazz draws inspiration from America. The famed American Jazz musician Louis Armstrong is the highlight of the festival."
socitaly.106.a:0 "Let us enjoy the new music of a new Rome."

socitaly.107.t:0 "Giro d'Italia Refounded"
socitaly.107.d:0 "With Italy reunited, the Giro d'Italia can begin again. The Giro d'Italia is a cycling race that began in 1909, but the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and the ongoing political instability in Italy have altogether prevented the race from being held since 1914. The race course goes from Torino in the north all the way down to Napoli and Bari in the south up back to Milan."
socitaly.107.a:0 "Let the race begin!"

socitaly.108.t:0 "Fausto Coppi Wins the Giro D'Italia"
socitaly.108.d:0 "Fausto Coppi has won the Giro D'Italia, setting a new record. At the age of twenty, he is the youngest cyclist to complete the race. His win has also popularized his training regime and his particular diet, which focuses on whole grains where other racers consume large amounts of red meat."
socitaly.108.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Coppi!"

socitaly.109.t:0 "Spartacus is Released"
socitaly.109.d:0 "Cinecittà has released the epic movie Spartacus. Telling the story of the ancient Roman slave rebellion leader Spartacus, the movie is by all accounts an epic with a cast of thousands. Starting Gino Cervi as Spartacus and directed by Carmine Gallone, the movie has already proven a success and both with critics and the public at large."
socitaly.109.a:0 "I am Spartacus!"

socitaly.111.t:0 "The Grande Rivoluzione Culturale Proletaria Begins"
socitaly.111.d:0 "Comrade Mussolini spoke before a massive crowd today in Rome, declaring that Italy must be purged of all elements of reactionary and capitalist thought, and that the new futurist culture of Italy shall rise from its ashes to build an Italy that is the culmination of the declaration of revolution in 1919."
socitaly.111.a:0 "We must cleanse Italy of corruption!"

socitaly.112.t:0 "Destroy the Cult of the Past"
socitaly.112.d:0 "'With our enthusiastic adherence to Futurism, we will destroy the cult of the past, the obsession with the ancients, and the pedantry and academic formalism that have strangled our society. The past is feudalistic and capitalistic and must be wiped away. The Socialist Republic has no need for the past!' according to a state paper in Torino."
socitaly.112.a:0 "The past is gone!"

socitaly.113.t:0 "Spontaneous Revolutionary Violence"
socitaly.113.d:0 "The leader of the Ministry for Public Security has declared that it will be of no issue if reactionaries are killed by revolutionary violence. This has sparked a wave of violence throughout the country as people engage in spontaneous revolutionary violence against those considered reactionary. When this will be over, no one knows. But the reactionaries shall be purged!"
socitaly.113.a:0 "Death to the reactionaries!"

socitaly.114.t:0 "Bonfire of the Vanities"
socitaly.114.d:0 "In Florence, a massive bonfire was held where citizens threw various 'vanities' considered to be reactionary or capitalistic into the fires. Artwork from before the creation of the Socialist Republic of Italy, books that promoted reactionary thought or un-socialist principles, and household goods deemed bourgeois were also destroyed. This bonfire has been copied by other cities across the republic as many seek to destroy the culture of the past."
socitaly.114.a:0 "Destroy the capitalist vanities!"

socitaly.115.t:0 "Purging the Reactionaries"
socitaly.115.d:0 "A number of the ministers in the government hold rather reactionary views. While they claim to be dedicated to the Republic, we know better. People like Achille Grandi, Giacomo Matteotti, and Giuseppe Saragat are all reactionaries that must be purged! They and others will only corrupt the ideals of socialism and bring back capitalism to the Republic. This will not be allowed!"
socitaly.115.a:0 "We shall not be corrupted!"

socitaly.116.t:0 "Destruction of Churches"
socitaly.116.d:0 "'God does not exist - religion in science is an absurdity, in practice an immorality, and in men a disease.' So proclaims Chairman Mussolini. With that, the attention of the cultural revolutionaries has turned towards Christianity and religion. Churches across Italy have been set upon by Garibaldists. Some have been transformed into town halls, with all sign of them being once a place of worship gone. Even more have been destroyed outright, or laid siege by revolutionaries as devout Christians barricaded themselves in. From the tiny parish churches that dot the towns of Italy to the largest cathedrals in the country, none have been spared. It seems that Comrade Mussolini will not stop until every trace of superstition is destroyed!"
socitaly.116.a:0 "Death to superstition!"

socitaly.117.t:0 "Technicians in the Country and Bureaucrats in the Factories"
socitaly.117.d:0 "The Republic is to not be a bureaucratic republic. However, in the years since its foundation, that has been changing and bureaucrats have been coming back within the government and within the workplaces. In order to make sure that the republic is not bureaucratised, factory technicians and leaders will be made to spend time in the countryside and government bureaucrats will be made to spend time within the factories."
socitaly.117.a:0 "Break the chains!"

socitaly.118.t:0 "La Mia Vita"
socitaly.118.d:0 "In order to spur on the Cultural Revolution, the life story, political considerations, and reasons why one would act to ensure the success of the revolutionary struggle, all dictated by Benito Mussolini have been made into a book called La Mia Vita (My Life) that has been printed en masse for citizens to study as they try to follow in the footsteps of the Chairman."
socitaly.118.a:0 "Heed the wise words of Comrade Chairman Mussolini."

socitaly.119.t:0 "Futurist Food"
socitaly.119.d:0 "As the cultural revolution continues, a book called the Manifesto of Futurist Cooking has been published. Its purpose is to ensure that even the daily habits of eating are transformed. The book has some choice words reserved for pasta; 'No more pasta, as it causes lassitude, pessimism and lack of passion,' a position backed up by Mussolini himself, who is quoted as saying 'a nation of spaghetti eaters cannot have a social revolution'"
socitaly.119.a:0 "Food of the future!"

socitaly.120.t:0 "The Strength of the Army"
socitaly.120.d:0 "As the Cultural Revolution continues, the Army has become more and more important in keeping order and stability. However, within the upper echelons of command, some have started to wonder if the methods of the cultural revolution are productive in building a new society and culture for Italy."
socitaly.120.a:0 "The Army will protect the revolution, of course."

socitaly.121.t:0 "Destruction of Estates"
socitaly.121.d:0 "Many noble estates in the south have been destroyed. The lands of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies held a number of noble estates, and the people in the south have finally decided to destroy these estates and make sure that there is no trace of the relics of the old feudal order."
socitaly.121.a:0 "Death to feudalism!"

socitaly.122.t:0 "Mussolini's Personality Cult"
socitaly.122.d:0 "A cult of personality has begun to grow around Mussolini, thanks to his efforts at using his personal charisma as well as the mass media from newspaper to film to make sure that his image is respected and supported. Portraits of Mussolini have popped up in public and private spaces alike throughout the country."
socitaly.122.a:0 "All for Mussolini!"

socitaly.123.t:0 "Revolutionary Films"
socitaly.123.d:0 "To build a new culture, we must destroy the old one. Archaic plays and operas are no longer to be performed. Instead, using the new film industry, a new culture celebrating the revolution and the Republic will be created. Mussolini, in particular, is sponsoring new actors, actresses and directors that will praise the Cultural Revolution."
socitaly.123.a:0 "Film will bring about a new culture."

socitaly.124.t:0 "The Tricolour Question"
socitaly.124.d:0 "While the colors of our dear Italy have historically been that of a green-white-red tricolor, since the Red and White Republicans split our revolutionary government had chosen to fly a black-white-red flag to identify itself. This was done due to the necessity to distinguish ourselves from the rival Austrian lapdogs in Milan and Veneto. The color scheme, inspired by both the Napoleonic era Roman Republic and the Italian Syndicalist Union, has become a symbol of the revolutionary struggle in Italy popular among the myriad of paramilitaries organized to fill the void of the old army.\nBut with the peninsula now fully under our control, some have proposed to legitimise ourselves further to the world and our people by restoring the old tricolor. A final decision needs to be made lest it continues to distract our leadership for much longer."
socitaly.124.a:0 "Keep the revolutionary colors."
socitaly.124.b:0 "Restore the old Tricolore."

socitaly.125.t:0 "The End of the Revolution"
socitaly.125.d:0 "Mussolini and Starace have declared in Rome that the Cultural Revolution is now at an end. The reactionary culture that has infected Italy since the Republic was declared is gone. Today, the sun shines on a new Italia, and the violence and chaos that has reigned over Italy has begun to subside. Life has been changed, but the Republic has been made stronger; or at least, that is what Comrade Mussolini says. It is clear, though, that his grip on power is now absolute."
socitaly.125.a:0 "The Revolution is over."

socitaly.126.t:0 "Syndicalist Partisans Rise Up"
socitaly.126.d:0 "We've always had suspicions that there was an underground network of syndicalists preparing for the day when we and [SRI.GetNameDef] went to war. Their numbers are not overwhelming, but their appearance behind our lines is unexpected, and they have caused a fair amount of disruption throughout the country."
socitaly.126.a:0 "It will change nothing"

socitaly.127.t:0 "The Balance in Italy"
socitaly.127.d.ita:0 "The balance on the Italian peninsula has been delicate since the end of the civil war, with [SRI.GetNameDef] maintaining a tense peace with its neighbors due to the knowledge that drawing in the French would surely bring intervention from the Germans and Austrians. Thus any conflict in Italy would need to be a self-contained one. With [ITA.GetNameDef] drawing in its own allies into the war, the situation has now officially changed: the balance is broken."

socitaly.20000.d:0 "Now that our brave soldiers have successfully liberated the entire Socialist Republic, we are in the position to negotiate a mutually beneficial peace with the allies of the Turin regime in exchange for the full incorporation of former SRI into our administration. Although talks of a possible ceasefire would seem like the obvious option, some within our command are convinced that the forces which have foolishly chosen to support the failed Italian claimants have been severely weakened, and they are confident that our armies are more than capable enough to take out the entire alliance. The decision is up to the highest heads of our government, should we call for peace or shall we continue the fight?"
socitaly.20000.a:0 "The Red North is ours, let's negotiate."
socitaly.20000.b:0 "We shall vanquish their entire alliance!"

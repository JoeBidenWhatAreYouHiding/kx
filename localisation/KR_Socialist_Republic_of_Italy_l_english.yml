### Descriptions ###

POLITICS_PIO_DESC:0 "Padre Pio is many things, a Priest, a Friar, a Soldier, a Leader, a Mystic. Above all else, A servant of the Lord and His Church. Born to a devout peasant family in Southern Italy, Francesco Forgione decided from a young age to devote his life to God. Upon joining the Order of Friars Minor at the age of 15, Forgione took the name Pio. With the entry of Italy into the Weltkrieg, the now ordained Padre Pio was drafted into the Medical Corps. As Italy collapsed, he returned to his community, just in time for syndicalist insurgents to sack his monastery and kill four of his brothers. Shortly after, stigmata wounds appeared on his hands. It was then that Padre Pio learned of God’s plan for him. Joining an anti-syndicalist militia as Chaplain, his resolve quickly took him to the position of Commander. With God guiding his destiny, Pio has become the most powerful man in the NeoSanfedisti. No amount of suffering will stop Padre Pio from reviving the Church to truly embrace Christ’s message of Purity and Unity."

POLITICS_ZIGGI_DESC:0 "Renato Ziggiotti has not always been a priest, he has not always been a solider, but for the past twenty years he has done almost nothing but fight, trying to free the people of Italy from the socialist menace. Born October 9, 1892 in Campodoro, Ziggiotti lived a fairly normal childhood, entering the Salesian Novitiateon on September 15, 1909. However, the Weltkrieg would shatter his attempt to live as a simple religious, as he along with many of his brothers would be enlisted in the Italian army, first seeing combat in June 1915. Ziggiotti would do fairly well in the army, up until he was shot in the arm in 1917, knocking him out of the fight. In his time in recovery, he would study theology, and first feel his call to the priesthood. When he was eventually discharged from hospital he would be sent back to the collapsing Austrian front. Before he could get to the front, Austria was rapidly approaching Rome, leading to the capitulation of Italy. Ziggiotti as with thousands of other soldiers expected this to be the end of the war but in fact it was only the beginning. As a coalition of Nationalists and Socialists rose up in defiance to Austria and it's newly created Italian Federation, Ziggiotti would find himself leading a group of men against these rebels. As Austrian and Federal troops began to crush the so-called Italian Republic, the Socialist half of the Republic fled to the South, leaving the nationalists for dead. Ziggiotti, now a Captain , and his men were one of the first units sent to the south. Ziggiotti fought hard, but just like the thousands of other men sent to the South they were unable to dislodge the socialists. That was until the Cardinal Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi issued a call to arms. Despite just arriving in the south, the SRI had already begun to commit horrendous crimes against the Church and her clergy. The Cardinal had been imprisoned just before he called on all faithful Catholics of Italy to form a New Army of Holy Faith, a NeoSanfedisti. Ziggiotti (along a few other units) heard this call and took action. Crossing the border, these units would form the professional backbone of the NeoSanfedisti. The first major action of the NeoSanfedisit was the saving of Cardinal Ascalesi. In reward of this, Cardinal Ascalesi  would ordain Ziggiotti after hearing of his desire to become a priest. Since that day, Padre Ziggiotti has become the defacto leader of the NeoSanfedisti, being the one to propose the idea of the Leadership Council. Now that he has been elected to truly lead them, Ziggiotti will do whatever it takes to create a truly holy Italy."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_ISIS_DESC:0 "The Leadership Council of the NeoSanfedisti is less a formal military high command and more a way to keep the disparaging militias of the Army of Holy Faith from attacking each other as much as they do the Socialist Republic of Italy. Formed to unite the various militias of the Faithful who rose in response to the SRI pushing to the south, it cannot be said that the Leadership Council has not done it's job. Prior to the Leadership Council's creation, it was not uncommon to see fellow Catholics attacking one another over trivial issues. With the NeoSanfedisti coming on top of the SRI once and for all, these issues are once again bubbling to surface, and it is likely that the Leadership Council will finally be dissolved once it's hold over the south is consolidated."

POLITICS_PIO_LEO_DESC:0 "Padre Pio is many things, a Priest, a Friar, a, Soldier, a Leader, a Mystic. Above all else, A servant of the Lord and His Church.

No amount of suffering will stop Padre Pio from reviving the Church to truly embrace Christ’s message of Purity and Unity.\nWith the NeoSanfedisti uniting Italy and the previous Pontiff naming Pio his direct successor, Padre Pio is no longer a simple priest, but the earthly head of the Catholic Church! Upon becoming the Roman Pontiff, Pio took the name Leo, the fourteenth pontiff of that name, after Saint Leo the Great, the great defender of orthodoxy. Many within the Church and beyond interpret Pio's papal name to mean the Papacy will be taking a hard traditionalist bent in the coming years."

POLITICS_RICCARDO_LOMBARDI_DESC:0 "Born in Regalbuto, Sicily, on August 16th 1901, Riccardo Lombardi lived in the region long before the Socialist takeover. However, he does identify himself with that government. Specifically, he considers himself a part of the Christian-Socialist faction within the S.R.I., the Fasci. This does not mean he has always been this way; Lombardi and close friend Guido Mignoli hopped from party to party until hedging their bets with the Socialists, and have now founded their own faction in the form of the Fasci. His ideology can be described in many ways, and his recent popularity is probably best explained by the fact that his supporters can project their beliefs onto him. Syndicalists, Socialists, Communists, and even some Liberals who identify with the Crocean faction can identify with the man, and this combined with his political talent has made him a formidable force within Italy. With this support, he has sharply criticized the government's inability to provide for it's people, drawing on a combination of populist, religious, and socialist rhetoric to energize his supporters, who come from every walk of life. Now that he has taken power, he hopes to move forward with his agenda of Christian-Socialism, providing for his people and dealing with his enemies in the Mafia and elsewhere. One of the largest threats to Lombardi's power will certainly come from Julius Evola, who has been a rival to Lombardi for years and whom Lombardi has energetically opposed. The two mostly recently clashed when Lombardi and his men defended a socialist newspaper hub from Evola's men, and only time can tell what the outcome of this rivalry will be. One thing is clear though: with Lombardi in charge of the Socialist Republic of Italy, its people know their interests will be represented at last, and the country will prosper because of it."

POLITICS_TOGLIATTI_DESC:0 "Palmiro Tolgatti was born in Genoa in 1893 to a well-off middle-class family, his father was an accountant and his mother was a teacher. In 1911 Tolgatti's Father passed away from Cancer which led to his family falling into poverty, Tolgatti would join the Italian Socialist Party around this time too. After graduating from the University of Turin in 1917, Tolgatti served as a Volunteer army officer in the Weltkrieg but he was wounded in action and sent home to heal. During the breakdown of order in the 1920s in Italy, he was able to gather enough supporters to aid in the socialist rebellion that was taking Italy by storm at the time, although they were pushed south by Austria, Tolgatti had helped secure the independence of the Socialist Republic of Italy. Tolgatti has been sworn in as the second Chairman of the Socialist Republic and began to enact sweeping reforms across the agrarian areas that they control, he has also been accused of rigging the elections or strongarming the government to stay in power, Tolgatti has denounced these claims however. Chairman Palmiro Tolgatti is one of the most powerful men in the Italian Peninsula, time will only tell if he can keep that power."

POLITICS_VITTORIO_DESC:0 "Born in Apulia, Cerignola, into a family of poor agricultural laborers in 1892, Di Vittorio became an active socialist at a young age. Joining socialist youth movements at the age of 15 he quickly used his charisma and work ethic to move up from ranks. Joining the May 1904 general strike, during which several workers were killed, Di Vittorio witnessed first hand the inequalities suffered by the working class. Inspired by the Fasci Siciliani in the late 19th century, he became an anarcho-syndicalist union leader who galvanised the masses. Supporting militarism and intervenism, he held nationalist views like his close comrades, De Ambris and Mussolini. When the Weltkrieg came to an end and Italy faced a humiliating defeat, Di Vittorio was one of the leading instigators of the revolution. After the revolutionaries were pushed south by a Central Powers intervention, he used his charisma to rally the syndicalist militias who entrenched themselves preventing a complete collapse of the revolution. Now first Chairman of the Socialist Republic, Di Vittorio is eager to reclaim the rest of the Italian peninsula, and secure Italy’s place in the world!"

POLITICS_LABRIOLA_DESC:0 "Born in Naples on 21 January 1872, Arturo Labriola began his political activities at a young age. Joining the Republican-Socialists in 1891 he moved on to join the most influential movement of his life, the Fasci Siciliani Arising from the poor living conditions of rural peasants in Sicily this movement directly appealed to Labriola who was a strong adherent to democratic socialism. Labriola was an active member and would later serve as an organiser of several strikes in Milan. After brutal repressions against the strikes he fled into exile, living in Paris he worked with Georges Sorel who’s nationalist rhetoric would influence his later views. Returning to Italy he took part in the popular syndicalist movement and also lent his support to the pro-war interventionists.\n\n With the collapse of the Italian Front and outbreak of the revolution, Labriola eagerly took part in the newly formed Socialist Republic, when the S.R.I was pushed south by the Austrian-German intervention he too joined the fleeing government. However his support for syndicalism and the S.R.I would not last long, leaving the Unione Sindacale Italiana after coming into disagreement with Chairman Di Vittorio. He then joined the Unione Socialista Unitario, finding similarities between their moderate socialist and soft agrarian stances to the Fasci Siciliani. However now seeing the bureaucratic and militaristic S.R.I regime as betraying the working class he founded his own movement, based on the Fasci Siciliani. The Fascio Italiano dei lavoratori has found popularity amongst the peasantry with his ideology of Fascism providing hope to the poorest of Italy..\n\n When the Naples collapse broke out he used his new found popularity to rally the workers in defence against the invasive reactionary forces, now in control of Southern Italy he hopes to rebuild the region as a democratic and socialist land that can reunite their northern comrades..."

POLITICS_CALOGERO_VIZZINI_DESC:0 "Few criminals in the world have ever reached such renown status as Calogero Vizzini. His operations in Sicily being enough to topple a standing government and put Southern Italy under the control of a ruthless crime syndicate. Yet, despite Calogero Vizzini infamous status within the Mafia, he carries himself as a gentleman who only resorts to violence when he needs to and respects the people under his care. To some, he is a man if honour, to others he is a ruthless boss. But regardless, his power over the South is large, and the power of the Mafia over his fiefdom is nearly absolute. The South is governed by crime, even if Vizzini can conduct his operations in a somewhat legal matter. "

POLITICS_JULIUS_EVOLA_DESC:0 "Baron Julius Evola is one of the most controversial political philosophers in Europe and, perhaps, the world. Devoting himself to an ideology that has been named "Radical Traditionalism", "Legionarism" and "Ultra-Rightism", Evola believes that modern society is in the age that Hinduism refers to as "Kali Yuga", or an age of darkess and choas. Admiring warrior-societies such as the Teutonic Knights, Roman Empire and Ancient Sparta, Evola claims that there is a Western tradition that must be revived to stand against the consumerism found in both capitalism and socialism. As such he is a fierce spiritualist and anti-materialist whom advocates forms of asceticism, holds the current Catholic Church in contempt for meekness and holds supernatural beliefs. His views would have stayed fringe had foreign powers not both passively propped up the unpopular Bourbon dynasty and exiled the House of Savoy, Evola's utter denunciation of which has won him support among nobles in exile including, apparently, the former King of Italy himself, whom Evola ultimately seeks to make the supreme power of the state."

POLITICS_VICTOR_EMMANUEL_III_DESC:0 "The Former King of Italy and Head of the main branch of the House of Savoy has returned from his long exile to find an army of fanatical monarchists at his disposal. He is utterly an admirer of Julius Evola, now his High Chancellor, for making the seemingly impossible come true and bringing to life his aspirations. It helps that the King is also known to harbor reactionary beliefs which grow increasingly right-wing with Evola at his side and the Socialist enemy in the north. He hopes that he and Legion can accomplish the seemingly impossible and defeat the traditional enemies to his power, the republicans, the socialists and the Catholic Church."
POLITICS_MUSSOLINI_DESC:0 "The tides of history are fickle things, and the invisible hand of fate often guides in twisting, sudden turns. The rise of the infamous Benito Mussolini was one of many such turns, and his ascension to Chairman is the cumulation of a winding career.\n\nBorn in Romagna to a Socialist father and a Catholic mother, Mussolini was named after Benito Juarez of Mexico. Working in his father’s smithy, he was exposed to a leftist, nationalistic worldview that idologised Giuseppe Garibaldi and the heroes of the Risorgimento. As a young man, he studied abroad and learned of Sorel and Nietzsche and also pursued jobs in masonry, teaching, as well as newspaper editing. But his passion was in politics, and he was soon at odds with the Italian authorities.\n\nHis life would turn again with the start of the Weltkrieg. After some initial reluctance, he fought as a Bersaglieri, bringing him out of line with more orthodox socialist positions. His own beliefs began to harden too - Mussolini grew convinced of the need for a revolutionary vanguard.\n\nItaly’s disastrous defeat in the Weltkrieg brought another turn. The chaos led to left's long-sought revolution, and in the thick of the fighting Mussolini and his fellow pro-war compatriots managed to worm their way back into the socialist camp. Uniting an eccentric alliance of nationalists, futurists, and national syndicalists into the banner of the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista, Mussolini’s career received a restart when he became Minister of Transports. Initially a fringe figure, his ruthlessness and perceived efficiency has won many frustrated by the Republic’s bureaucracy.\n\nNow, the final twist in Mussolini’s life has arrived: he has become Chairman of the Socialist Republic of Italy. Once smeared as a ‘totalitarian’, he has happily adopted the moniker and cosigned the Totalist charter. In his speeches, Mussolini boasts that there will soon be a new Risorgimento. And perhaps the tides of history, in their twisting turns, will prove him right."

SRI_strengthen_democracy_desc:0 "One of the major promises of the Unione Socialista Unitario during the Congress of Trade Unions is the strengthening of a direct and local democracy that would allow the Italian people a greater role in the political life of the country. Strengthening democracy must therefore be one of our first measures."
SRI_stregthen_the_republic:0 "Primacy of the Unions Continues"

SRI_improve_unions:0 "A Land of Thousand Unions"
SRI_improve_unions_desc:0 "If we are to ensure Southern Italy's successful transformation from a mostly rural territory into a paradise for the working people, we must support the creation of new trade unions as well as subsidizing the few already existing syndicates."
SRI_gradual_industrialization:0 "Careful Planning and Faultless Industrialization"
SRI_gradual_industrialization_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic of Italy is vastly underprepared if it is to destroy the capitalist menace of a Federation up north.

SRI_christian_identity:0 "A Universal Italian Identity"
SRI_christian_identity_desc:0 "Italy has been a divided land from time immemorial, it is no different now.

SRI_industrial_democracy:0 "Enshrine the Concept of Industrial Democracy"
SRI_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "Industrial democracy was one of the pillars of our revolution in 1919. Democracy was not to be limited to the National Congress as the Bourgeois would have it.

SRI_state_atheism:0 "Unshackle the Prisoners of the Vatican"
SRI_state_atheism_desc:0 "Superstition has no place in the Socialist Republic of Italy. Gods and prophets and lies made up by men to deceive are not needed in the modern age.

SRI_futurist_culture_desc:0 "The futurist movement has become increasingly prominent in our nation.

We should encourage this movement, as it aligns closely with our own goals for Italy."
SRI_cultural_revolution:0 "Grande Rivoluzione Culturale Proletaria"

Although it seems everyone has an idea for the future of the south, everything from restoring the monarchy to the creation of theocracy. However only two men and their visions have any hope of being passed. These two men are Padre Pio and Padre Ziggiotti. Both have their plans and followers, but only one can come out on top..."

SRI_Ziggiottis_Plan_desc:0 "Ziggiotti's Plan, unlike the radical reforms of Pio is simple. Padre Ziggiotti's grand scheme is to make some minor reforms, mostly in the way of land for the peons. Once the Land Reform is complete, he will use the South's piety to unite with the North into a truly Holy Italia"
SRI_meaningful_land_reform:0 "Meaningful Land Reform"
SRI_meaningful_land_reform_desc:0 "Perhaps the one good thing about the Socialist Republic was the promise of land reform. Although never getting passed words on a page, the idea of land reform is something almost all the people of the South wanted. The time has come to enact this. Instead of just making promises, we shall truly go about reforming the ownership of land, with charity and justice in mind."

The effects of this can already be felt. In those who are walking away from the Faith, depression or worse, is rampant.

SRI_light_of_reason:0 "The Light of Reason"
SRI_light_of_reason_desc:0 "Despite what Socialists, Secularists and other opponents of the Church claim, the Catholic Church is not some bulwark against science and reason. After all, it was the Church who build most of the great universities of Europe. While some claim that encouraging the people to be faithful Catholics and at same time funding the sciences is a contradiction, we say otherwise! Along with our program of bringing the Faith back to a land long devoid of it, we shall also increase research funding. After all, understanding God's creation is one of man's greatest abilities."
SRI_light_hand:0 "A Light Hand"

Both of these groups fear we will bring the wrath of God upon them, however that is far from our intentions. Our Lord's message was one of mercy and justice.

SRI_economic_integeration_desc:0 "With Italy finally reunited after a near decade long separation, glaring issues have emerged about the state of the nation, most notably being the economies. Both the north and the south have developed radically different economies. While we have made major strives in de-syndicalizing the economy of the south, the sudden of merger with the north has brought chaos to both the northern and southern economies. In order to avoid an economic depression, one of the first acts of a united Italy must be to integrate and stabilize our economy."

SRI_a_better_federation_desc:0 "As the Italian people have once more been brought back to unity, we are already seeing the fruits of unity. However, we are also seeing the problems of the old Federation, namley squbbling nobles and lack of care for the Faithful. This will not do. In order to build a truly better federation, we must remind the nobles of their faith, we must remind them that they already have a small chance of salvation, let alone if they are cruel to the poor and needy under their care. As for the faithful masses, we must ensure that they are taken care of, in both body and soul. To do this, Padre Ziggiottis has charged the state with the creation of a basic welfare system, so that those who have lost everything can still stand on their feet. "

SRI_Holy_Italia_desc:0 "We have done it! Italy stands united once more, but not under a secular government, not under a goverment of Godless socialists! No, Italy stands united as brothers and sisters in the thing common to all Italians, the Catholic Faith! Unlike the Federation of the past, the Holy Federation does not pretend to be a nation of faith, it truly is. Rome and Italy at large have been graced by the LORD to be a Holy Land like Jerusalem and Palastine, and atlast, she has a government that will treat her as such!

SRI_deal_with_mafia_desc:0 "Between the two groups that threaten our rule, the Mafia is by far the least dangerous of the two. Owing to their nominal Catholicism, the crime families have been fairly peaceable with us. However, their pedaling of vices is aiding in the moral destruction of the south, so they will have to be dealt with. Although some within our government say the best way to deal with them is too ignore them and focus on reconstruction. After all, why would we need to waste men and bullets on them if when the people are once again moral they wouldn't turn to the vices offered by the Mafia in the first place?"
SRI_deal_evolaism:0 "Dealing with the Evolaites"
SRI_deal_evolaism_desc:0 "Julius Evola and his so-called 'Legion' are one of the most heinous groups to come into existence in history. If his rejection of Catholicism wasn't enough, he preaches a neo-paganism that would see the Church and all she built thrown into the dustbin of history. While some kind of compromise with the Mafia may be possible, no such thing can be reached with the Legion. All of the government is in agreement, Evola must be destroyed for the betterment of all mankind."

SRI_Pios_Vision_desc:0 "Padre Pio's grand vision is not one bound to just Italy. The holy mystic's plan is much more grand then that. But before any rash action, Pio must test his ideas.

While southern Italy is definitely not a melting pot, those who are not Italian shall still be treated as all others citzens of the Apastolic Realm.

In order to do this, the Padre has issued a general decree that those in postions of power, be it in the armed forces, the clergy or in the political class who hold to nationalism and socialism are to be removed from power.

This first strike shall be twofold. Firstly, the nation be highly decentralized in all but the most critical matters. Secondly, the great statutes and national monuments that cloud the minds of the Faithful with thoughts of nation shall be removed and replaced by statutes and works to Our Lord and his most Holy Church. With the first strike made, Italy will finally be on it's way to true Salvation, which comes only from the bosom of Holy Mother Church."

SRI_God_sees_no_classes_desc:0 "Although the removal of nationalism and socialism in the minds of the people is the primary part of Pio's grand vision, it is not the only part. It is only one piece of the puzzle. The second, and perhaps most important piece, is what the great Padre has planned in regards to societal reorganization. With the state already being highly decentralized, the time has come to begin implementing Catholic Corporatism. In order to remove the ideas and distractions of Class from the mind of the people, ALL classes must work together, in one organic body. Classes shall begin to work together, until as such time as class itself can be completely erased. But until that time, we shall do all we can to lessen the impact class has."

This has caused great suffering for Padre Pio, who himself was raised in poverty. In order to solve the ever present problem of poverty, Padre Pio has ordered the creation of a network of soup kitchens, public housing and hospitals, to provide both aid to those who belong to the poor, but also to put the light and fire of Christ within their breast."

With this new-found success, the time has come to implement these plans and practices throughout the entire Catholic Church. The way to do that? A Church Council, as only a Council can generate enough buzz and hype to fully get Pio's reforms in practice. However, only the Bishop of Rome can call a Council.

SRI_address_laity_desc:0 "The Catholic Laity, over the past few months, have been greatly scandalized by the sudden departure of the Holy Father and the direct appointment of the next. The whole so-called Italy stand off did not help things. If we to have the Second Vatican Council have any chance of sticking, the Laity must view Pio as the legitimate Pontiff.

However, this does not mean that moderation is the way forward either. Those who are lukewarm are spit out of Our Lord's mouth and thrown into the Pit. No, the way forward for the Church is too look back. What is it that made the Church great? Her Divine Founder, Jesus Christ and what He gave the Church. What Our Lord gave the Church, her most glorious traditions, her beloved saints, her most mysterious and holy rituals, rituals that are able to call God himself whole and entire into a tiny piece of bread!

Neither is the way forward a radical return to tradition. No, the way forward is viva moderation, as it is in all cases. Some token reforms that the Pope has championed can surely be implemented, just as how several traditional reforms can also be undertaken. The Church shall not fall to extremism. She will instead take things on a case by case basis, to find the best solution for the entire Body of Christ. After all, it is the modern day.

Only in this manner, will the Catholic Church be able to stay the force it rightfully is. While many scoff at this plan, we know that our way is true.

They hold that only the Roman Pontiff should have any say in most if not all matters of the Church, in a word, they reject any autonomy for the bishops of any country. While we cannot completely do away with local autonomy of the bishops, we can greatly strengthen the position of the Bishop of Rome, to allow for an easier time in implementing our reforms."

Along with this however, the proposal will recommend that study groups be set up in every parish of the Church, to both help the Faithful understand Latin, but also to help them see the beauty of this most holy language."

Despite this condemnations, the practice has yet to be formally condemned by a Council. Several of the Council Fathers seek to change this. A proposed decree that has been presented to the Council Fathers would see Freemasonry outlined and explained why it is seen as heretical, and why a Catholic cannot under any circumstances stance join such an origination. While the proposal is interesting, it still remains up to the Council Fathers if it will be promulgated or not."

The decree in essence, would turn the Church from teaching and guiding the world as if she had power of it, to one of a missionary, spreading the gospel to a world that knows it not. Along with this return to 'missionary mode' comes permission to say Holy Mass in the local language of the Faithful. This move is highly experimental, and many wonder if it will not come back to bite the Council in the end. Regardless, with the inevitable passage of the decree, the Catholic Church will once more be a missionary to the World."

Yes, love of country and patriotism is a virtue, but it must go not further. Love of one's country is a good thing! But the idolizing of nation? Hating those who do not belong to one's own nation? No, these are ideas are unchristian and sinful.

SRI_garibaldi_ii_desc:0 "Just like the original Cacciatori delle Alpi - or the Hunters of the Alps, also nicknamed the Garibaldinos after their leader - before us who were led by the great Italian hero Giuseppe Garibaldi in a fight against the Austrians and the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a new resistance forces has arisen in northern Italy rallied around Garibaldi that seeks to unite Italy once again at long last while eradicating extremism on both sides. Led by the prominent anti-radical general Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi, grandson of his namesake, these modern Garibaldinos seek to set Italy free once and for all. Pulling from the interclassist radical liberalism of Giuseppe Mazzini that calls for the creation of a unitary republic supported by secular spiritualism and civic nationalism while being backed by Randolfo Picciardi and his faction within the Partito Repubblicano Italiano along with Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi’s brothers Sante and Ricciotti Jr. and the rest of the liberal veteran officers within the Associazione Nazionale Combattenti, this counterrevolutionary movement shall topple the militant atheists within the Socialist regime in order to walk the middle line towards freedom, liberty, and equality to all Italians without falling to radicalism or extremism on either side of the aisle on our way towards Italian unification, and Garibaldi and his men are willing to defend such an ideal to the last man."
SRI_dons_to_doges:0 "Assure the Captains of Industry"
SRI_dons_to_doges_desc:0 " During the chaos of the revolution, the industrial heartland of Northwest Italy was nationalized by the newly proclaimed Socialist Republic, and Italy’s world renowned automotive, aeronautic, and shipbuilding industries fell into obscurity. With the state needing a fast and easy avenue towards replenishable funding and capital, our government will reach out to these capitalists, giving assurances to these captains of industry who had fled during the revolution. With their expertise and wealth, we can revitalize Italy’s economic and industrial capabilities, which will be of vital importance if we are to walk in the footsteps of Garibaldi and unite Italy once more. "
SRI_align_the_fasci:0 "Woo the Unione Socialista Unitario"
SRI_align_the_fasci_desc:0 "The democratic socialists of the Unione Socialista Unitario are perhaps the only politicians within the official power structure of the old Socialist government worth saving, for much of their populist and agrarian policies align with our own, especially their use of universal civic nationalism and their hands-off but peaceful approach to secularism and the Catholic Church we ourselves share. If we can get them to agree to expel their most radical members while making assurances to conform to the democratic republican structure of our new counterrevolutionary state, then we shall have no problem giving their communes and unions a bit of autonomy so long as they stay loyal at the end of their slacked chain."
SRI_end_radicals:0 "Exterminate the Extremist Fringe"
SRI_end_radicals_desc:0 "Pushed away by the more bombastic voices within the political sphere of the Socialist Republic, small reformist factions within the Unione Socialista Unitaro and disparate groups of republicans have held firm in their moderated stance. In order to create a front against extremism, we will bring these reformists into the spotlight and grant them a place in our new Italy. For the more radical groups, from Mussolini’s Unione Nazionale Sindacalista to Balbo’s Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, all traces of these revolutionary and overly-radical plagues must be entirely expunged from the Italian consciousness. Only then can our purified and true form of radically liberal republicanism ring true."
SRI_italia_libera:0 "A United Front Under the Italia Libera"
SRI_italia_libera_desc:0 "Amassing a broad big tent coalition from across the Italian Centre, Centre-Left, and non-atheist Far-Left under a banner of militant radical liberalism, civic nationalism, and secular spiritualism, the Italia Libera of Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi II and Randolfo Picciardi has united a diverse band of politicians from the Partito Repubblicano Italiano, the Unione Socialista Unitario, the Partito Socialista Riformista Italiano, and more from across the non-radical Centre-Left spectrum in order to save Italy from extremism using the shining torch of liberal unitary republicanism. Furthermore, the coalition calls for a review of the Albertine Statute - Italy’s first modern constitution made in 1848 - in a republican context, the abolition of any concept of royal or revolutionary senate, mass administrative decentralization, the freedom of the various categories of workers to organize themselves as trade unions, the defense of small property and the reduction of income, along with other liberal reforms aimed at eradicating elitism and extremism. Under the Italia Libera, Italy shall forever be safe from violent and radical extremisms such as Totalism and Legionarism, for these ideas shall be hunted down and eradicated as the coalition surges in power to secure our republic’s future."
SRI_rally_the_veterans:0 "Rally the Veterans of the ANC"
SRI_rally_the_veterans_desc:0 "The Associazione Nazionale Combattenti is a veteran’s association made of up Italian survivors of the Great War who have since come together by bonding around ideas of anti-Totalism, anti-Legionarism, and radical liberal republicanism. Dominated by figures like Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi II alongside his brothers Sante and Ricciotti Jr, and other famed officers-turned-politicians like Raffaele Rossetti, Gaetano Salvemini, and Luigi Gasparotto, the ANC forms the foundations of the Italia Libera coalition, but these old war dogs can be slow to rouse. We must work to get the entirety of the ANC vocally on our side and active in the movement while also using their influence to get other smaller veteran agencies on our side and away from the gnashing maw of Italian extremist nationalism that has taken hold of so many other similar organizations. With the traditionalist veterans of the ANC on our side, we shall more easily be able to throw our weight around whilst we combat fringe radicalism on a national scale."
SRI_the_king_in_sardinia:0 "A Debate on the King in Sardinia"
SRI_the_king_in_sardinia_desc:0 "Though they exist under their own monarchy, the isle of Sardinia hosts a splinter of our own movement, with their branch of the ANC operating under local leader and fellow Mazzinist Emilio Lussu. Devoted to the same ideas of radical liberalism, constitutionalist direct democracy, class collaborationism, and progressively liberal populism that we are, the Federazione Sarda dell'ANC of Lussu would be perfect allies, if only we can come to terms on the royalist situation. If a constitutionalist compromise was able to be hashed out between our two movements in which our Mazzinist democracy could exist unfettered beneath the unifying guide of a powerless constitutional monarch, peaceful unification between Sardinia and the Mezzogiorno could be well within reach."
SRI_legacy_of_the_gracchi:0 "Legacy of the Gracchi Brothers"
SRI_legacy_of_the_gracchi_desc:0 "The brothers Gracchi - Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus - served as plebeian tribunates from 133 BCE to 122/121 BCE respectively, famous for being some of Rome’s earliest progressive social reformers cruelly assassinated at young ages by a reactionary political system steeped in elitism and afraid of true change. With Tiberius passing legislation for a public land survey that would reassert claims and redistribute excess land to poor rural farmers, and with Gaius furthering this policy while spreading it to new Roman colonies outside the peninsula, and with both passing other reforms across many topics such as the assignment of provincial commands, composition of juries for the permanent courts, and the letting of state tax farming contracts, the Gracchi brothers were hellbent on transforming Rome into a truly just and populist paradise for the rural common man, and it is their legacy - one so tragically cut short - that we seek to emulate today. Realizing modernized forms of their proto-Socialist ideas and raising their images and story as new national icons of the republic, our new Italy under Peppino Garibaldi shall do its best to live up to these innocent martyrs and their ingenious legacy."
SRI_correcting_carnaro:0 "Correcting the Charter of Carnaro"
SRI_correcting_carnaro_desc:0 "The Charter of Carnaro was a landmark document written by trade unionist Alceste De Ambris alongside poet Gabriele D’Annunzio that fused Sorelian national syndicalist, corporativist, and democratic republican ideas into one cohesive whole, and it is this document that the Italia Libera holds above all others. Viewing other so-called D’Annunzio loyalist movements like the Totalists of Mussolini or the Legionarists of Balbo as misguided fools only sullying D’Annunzio’s great dream for Italy, we shall put the dream explained within the Carta del Carnaro into practice, creating a syncretic economy kept in check by our concept of radical liberalism and anti-extremist centrism. By fusing the best ideas of Italian politics together while cutting out all of the parasitic and self-serving fat, we shall create the perfect republic."
SRI_class_collaboration:0 "Promote Class Collaboration"
SRI_class_collaboration_desc:0 "Class warfare and the exploitation of the natural divisions of society will get our new republic nowhere aside from an early grave.

SRI_emancipate_women:0 "The Total Emancipation of Women"
SRI_emancipate_women_desc:0 "For too long, virtually half of our population has lived their lives politically disenfranchised, slaving away doing more than their fair share of the work required to make Italy the great land it has always been, and according to the Mazzinian Conception - or Mazzini’s worldview - men must make it their duty to help spread women’s rights, with Mazzini even personally admiring British suffragette Jessie White Mario, calling her the bravest woman in modern history. We must rectify this situation by immediately granting women the same rights and privileges as any man would, while also holding them to the same legal standard and granting them the ability to vote in any elections. Doing so will not only make our nation a more equal place, but also ensure newfound political support from millions upon millions of new voters."
SRI_mazzinianist_education:0 "Mazzinist Education"
SRI_mazzinianist_education_desc:0 "Mazzinianesimo, also spelled Mazzinismo and named after its progenitor Giuseppe Mazzini, describes the specific form of radical liberalism championed by our government that posits the idea that the liberation, unification, and future governance of an independent Italian peninsula can only be accomplished through the creation of a constitutional unitary republican state pursuing ideas of interclassism while being supported by mass devotion to a form of civic national religion based around a love for their shared Italian homeland that is pushed as a peaceful and secular alternative to the Catholic-dominated Italian Right and the radical atheism supported by much of the Italian Left. As we work to eradicate illiteracy and grant free basic education to all children in Italy, while also working to expand higher education rates with new universities, grants, and scholarships as well, we shall sprinkle in tastes of this Mazzinist ideology into the expanding curriculum, ensuring that all future generations learn the true and liberal truth as they are molded into productive future members of society."
SRI_laicism:0 "Spiritually Enlightened Secularism Free from the Vatican"
SRI_laicism_desc:0 "Despite our pursuit of secularism, our Mazzinist-based movement does not disparage or despise the Christian faith or broader spirituality, with Giuseppe Mazzini himself considering humanity ‘as the image of God on earth’ while tracing the definition of man's duties to the Law of God. Profoundly spiritualist as well, Mazzini also contested the Syndicalist tendency to attempt to erase not only the transcendent, divine element from the hearts and minds of men, but also the simple sense of duty innate in all throughout what he called the ‘brotherhood’ or ‘association’ of all mankind. However, despite this innate love of faith, Mazzini and the rest of our coalition despite the innate elitism built into the modern Catholic Church and the political and socioeconomic meddling the Papacy has perpetrated for centuries to further its own interests and wealth. As such, while religion shall always have a place in our perfect republic, the Church and wider religion must never play a direct role in politics as we pursue a spiritually-enlightened form of Secularism."
SRI_social_patriotism:0 "Social Patriotism and Civic Religion"

With Mazzinianesimo in mind, a new civic religion shall be crafted for the Italian people with these pro-spiritualist but firmly secularist ideas in mind, allowing the people to carry themselves independently to prosperity with their heads held high."

### Fourth Congress ###
socitaly.2.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union"
socitaly.2.d:0 "Today, the Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union begins. The various factions of the Congress will debate economic, internal, and military policies. The Unione Sindacale Italiana seek to push Orthodox Syndicalism, advancing the current policies of the congress, while the Unione Socialista Unitario desire a government that helps the people, and supporting moderate socialism. Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista, advances the new ideology of Garibaldismo, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."
socitaly.2.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

socitaly.3.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union - Economic Policy"
socitaly.3.d:0 "The first order of business is the economic policy of the Republic. The Unione Socialista Unitario advocate for a focus on agrarianism and supporting the rural communes. The Unione Sindacale Italiana argue for furthering syndicalism to be a proper industrial democratic republic. While Mussolini's Unione Nazionale Sindacalista demand nothing short of total and immediate industrialisation."
socitaly.3.a:0 "We must expand our agriculture."
socitaly.3.b:0 "We should focus on industrialisation."
socitaly.3.c:0 "Nothing short of total industrialisation will suffice!"

socitaly.4.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union - Internal Policy"
socitaly.4.d:0 "The discussion on the second day of the Congress focused on more internal matters. The Unione Sindacale Italiana's representative came forward and pushed for further empowerment of the unions while the Unione Socialista Unitario's representative came forward and pushed for empowering the rural communes instead. Unione Nazionale Sindacalista's representative argued that it is the chairman that should be empowered."
socitaly.4.a:0 "Focus on empowering the Communes."
socitaly.4.b:0 "Focus on empowering the Unions."
socitaly.4.c:0 "Focus on Empowering the Chairman."

socitaly.5.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union - Religious Policy"
socitaly.5.d:0 "The final order of business is the status of Christianity within the republic. The Unione Socialista Unitario has come to softly endorse Christian Socialism, their representative claiming that coopting the existing Popolarismo ideology endorsed by the church structures will help to soothe the anger of traditional catholics. The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista, on the other hand, are claiming that Christianity is archaic, unsuited for the modern age and that State Atheism will help break the chains of ignorance. Finally, the Unione Sindacale Italiana are supporting a middle ground status quo of secularism."
socitaly.5.a:0 "Support Christian Socialism."
socitaly.5.b:0 "Support Secularism."
socitaly.5.c:0 "Support State Atheism."

socitaly.6.t:0 "Unione Socialista Unitario Majority!"
socitaly.6.d:0 "The Unione Socialista Unitario has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. Now two leading members of the faction can assume the role of Chairman, Giacomo Matteotti or Giuseppe Romita. Whom shall be elected the new Chairman?"
socitaly.6.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Matteotti!"
socitaly.6.b:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Romita!"

socitaly.7.t:0 "Unione Sindacale Italiana Majority!"
socitaly.7.d:0 "The Unione Sindacale Italiana has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. Now, along with Chairman Di Vittorio remaining in power, two other leading members of the faction could assume the role of Chairman, Palmiro Togliatti or Alceste De Ambris. Whom shall be elected the new Chairman?"
socitaly.7.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Di Vittorio!"
socitaly.7.b:0 "Congratulations, Comrade De Ambris!"
socitaly.7.c:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Togliatti!"

socitaly.8.t:0 "Unione Nazionale Sindacalista Majority!"
socitaly.8.d:0 "The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. With this victory, Benito Mussolini is now the new chairman."
socitaly.8.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Mussolini!"

socitaly.9.t:0 "No Majority Achieved!"
socitaly.9.d:0 "No faction of the Congress came out on top. The government is deadlocked, and for now, the country is once again thrown into chaos while the leaders attempt to negotiate some kind of compromise."
socitaly.9.a:0 "Damn it!"

socitaly.10.t:0 "Unione Sindacale Italiana and Unione Socialista Unitario Compromise"
socitaly.10.d:0 "In an effort to block the dangerous Unione Nazionale Sindacalista from achieving any kind of power, the Unione Sindacale Italiana and Unione Socialista Unitario have agreed to form a coalition government. Chairman Di Vittorio maintains his role as president, while Giacomo Matteotti becomes the new Chairman of the Congress of People's Unions."
socitaly.10.a:0 "Better than nothing."

socitaly.11.t:0 "Stalemate in the Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.11.d:0 "During the recent Congress of the Socialist Republic of Union, none of the three factions achieved a clear majority. This would normally not be our concern, but the lack of compromise is further destabilizing an ally which is already unsteady on its feet. Perhaps we can help them choose their new government?"
socitaly.11.a:0 "Support the Unione Socialista Unitario!"
socitaly.11.b:0 "Support the Unione Sindacale Italiana!"
socitaly.11.c:0 "Support the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista."
socitaly.11.e:0 "It's not our problem."

socitaly.16.t:0 "French Support the Unione Socialista Unitario"
socitaly.16.d:0 "The French government has declared its support for the Unione Socialista Unitario. Should we listen to their advice or should we try to find a solution on our own?"
socitaly.16.a:0 "The Unione Socialista Unitario will be the new government!"
socitaly.16.b:0 "Let us try and find a compromise ourselves."

socitaly.17.t:0 "French Support the Unione Sindacale Italiana"
socitaly.17.d:0 "The French government has declared its support for the Unione Sindacale Italiana. Should we listen to their advice or should we try to find a solution on our own?"
socitaly.17.a:0 "The Unione Sindacale Italiana will be the new government!"
socitaly.17.b:0 "Let us try and find a compromise ourselves."

socitaly.18.t:0 "French Support the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista"
socitaly.18.d:0 "The French government has declared its support for the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista. Should we listen to their advice or should we try to find a solution on our own?"
socitaly.18.a:0 "The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista will be the new government!"
socitaly.18.b:0 "Let us try and find a compromise ourselves."

### NeoSanfedisti ###

socitaly.19.t:0 "Suppression of Catholics"
socitaly.19.d:0 "A number of highly-placed Catholics who have been deemed at risk for supporting the Papacy over their own government were recently rounded up by the Republican Guard today and placed in prison until such a time as they can be properly vetted. It's a move that's sure to outrage other Catholics in the republic, but should any trouble arise, the presence of so many ready informants will ensure it is dealt with readily."
socitaly.19.a:0 "It must be done, for the greater good"

socitaly.20.t:0 "Southern Catholics Suppressed"
socitaly.20.d.nosic:0 "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of Syndicalism, the government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful – anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to the Pope – and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation. It's a move which has spurred resentment in the south, and renewed calls for war. There are those within the Pope's inner circle who suggest this also presents an opportunity: to use the outrage within [SRI.GetNameDef] and fund a resistance movement. While the possibility exists that [SRI.GetNameDef] could discover our connection and go to war with us, the resistance could significantly weaken them and afford us the ability to raise partisans behind enemy lines once the war begins."
socitaly.20.d.sic:0 "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of Syndicalism, the government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful – anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to the Pope – and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation.

While the possibility exists that [SRI.GetNameDef] could discover our connection and go to war with us, the resistance could significantly weaken them and afford us the ability to raise partisans behind enemy lines once the war begins. This would, of course, depend on whether we get the blessing of [SIC.GetNameDef], who would be forced to come to our rescue if such a war began."
socitaly.20.a:0 "We will fund the Neosanfedisti resistance!"
socitaly.20.b:0 "No, it is far too great a risk"

socitaly.21.t:0 "Southern Catholics Suppressed"
socitaly.21.d:0 "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of Syndicalism, the government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful – anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to the pope – and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation. It's a move which has spurred resentment in the south, and renewed calls for war."
socitaly.21.a:0 "These people are innocent of all but faith!"

socitaly.22.t:0 "The NeoSanfedisti"
socitaly.22.d:0 "The NeoSanfedisti - literally 'the new holy faithful men', named after an eighteenth-century Italian terrorist organisation - has begun attacking government installations all over the republic. Aiming to create as much havoc as they can in the name of the 'oppressed' Catholic Church, the NeoSanfedisti could tie up much of our resources if their actions continue."

Republican Guard investigators are on the scene, and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind the Catholic terrorists than they were before."

socitaly.27.a:0 "Damn terrorists!"

socitaly.28.t:0 "Barracks Bombed in [attack_state.GetName]"
socitaly.28.d:0 "During the night, a Republican Guard barracks in [attack_state.GetName] was attacked by the NeoSanfedisti, the bomb causing great loss of life and equipment. The Republican Guard has vowed revenge and plans to take the terrorists out and end this slaughter."
socitaly.28.a:0 "We will get them sooner or later..."

socitaly.29.t:0 "Ringleaders Apprehended!"
socitaly.29.d:0 "Earlier today, several of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators. This is a serious blow to the Catholic terrorists, and brings the country one step closer to eliminating them for good."
socitaly.29.d.last:0 "Earlier today, the last of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators. This puts an end to the group's operations within [SRI.GetNameDef], and an example will be made of the men to ensure that no other Catholic agitators get similar ideas in the future."
socitaly.29.a:0 "The sooner, the better!"
socitaly.29.b:0 "Finally!"

socitaly.30.t:0 "Foreign Support for the NeoSanfedisti"
socitaly.30.d:0 "While it comes as little surprise to some, we finally have acquired proof that [PAP.GetNameDef] has been directly funding the NeoSanfedisti terrorists. Many citizens of [SRI.GetNameDef], both within the Congress and the general public, cry out for vengeance, although some caution that we may not yet be ready for the war against the south."
socitaly.30.a:0 "To war with the reactionary terrorists!"
socitaly.30.b:0 "We must bid our time."

socitaly.31.t:0 "Pope Rallies the NeoSanfedisti"
socitaly.31.d:0 "The Pope has issued a call to the NeoSanfedisti faithful, and they have answered in large numbers, raising troops in Southern Italy behind our lines. Apparently they have been planning this for some time, and [ITA.GetNameDef] has been supplying them with training and equipment. It seems we did not find their ringleaders quickly enough."
socitaly.31.a:0 "It will make no difference"

socitaly.32.t:0 "Policy Towards the Church"
socitaly.32.d.radsoc:0 "While the policy of the Unione Socialista Unitario is to use the previously existing Popularist movement to overpower the clerical resistanc, our support of the Worker-Priest movement has created mixed reactions amongst the faithful. Some of them claim we are perverting the Christian faith towards an industrial cause, and question the use of scripture in motivating workers. There is a concern within the government that this resistance will only provide an opening for the Papacy to exploit once it comes time for war with the Mezzogiorno."
socitaly.32.d.synd:0 "While the policy of the Unione Sindacale Italiana has been to ignore matters of faith, many within our government say our support of the Worker-Priest movement has violated our traditional neutrality. What's more, it's causing mixed reactions amongst the country's faithful. Some of them claim we are perverting the Christian faith towards an industrial cause, and question the use of scripture in motivating workers. There is a concern within the government that this resistance will only provide an opening for the Papacy to exploit once it comes time for war with the Mezzogiorno."
socitaly.32.a:0 "Come down hard on this resistance"
socitaly.32.b:0 "Ease back on our support - the movement should be voluntary"

socitaly.33.t:0 "Assessing the Economy"
socitaly.33.d:0 "The economy of the country has been suffering in recent years. While great progress has been made since the civil war that tore Italy apart, we must consider ways to improve the economy. Two main proposals have been put forth to the Congress. The first, favoured by the Unione Socialista Unitario, would focus on decentralising our industry by empowering the various communes throughout the country. The second plan, put forth by the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista, is nearly the exact opposite. It instead would favour creating an organisation called the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) that will organise and guide the syndicates and unions in order to bring prosperity to Italy and its people."
socitaly.33.a:0 "Support the Communal Syndicalism plan"
socitaly.33.b:0 "Support the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale plan"

socitaly.34.t:0 "Reviewing the Guards"
socitaly.34.d:0 "The Red Guards, or Guardia Rosse, have been the backbone of the Socialist Republic of Italy's army since the civil war. Organised as local militias, they have major support among the local communes that field and equip them. However, with some nationalists seeking to reunify Italy, plans have been put forth to reform the Red Guards into a true Red Army. However, such a plan is controversial for many members of the Red Guards that are highly suspicious of a centralised military apparatus, despite the benefits that it will bring."
socitaly.34.a:0 "Support the Red Guards"
socitaly.34.b:0 "Create the Red Army!"

socitaly.35.t:0 "Military Research Focus"
socitaly.35.d:0 "With the Red Army now in place, it is time for the research committee to help better focus our efforts."

socitaly.38.t:0 "Awarding Naval Contracts"
socitaly.38.d:0 "We have two union-owned and -operated shipyards which are vying for the government contracts. One, the Cantieri Navali Riuniti, specializes in smaller ships, while the other, the Cantieri Navali Livorno, specializes in capital ships. We will have to select where our focus lies."
socitaly.38.a:0 "Award it to the Cantieri Navali Riuniti"
socitaly.38.b:0 "Award it to the Cantieri Navali Livorno"

socitaly.40.t:0 "Italy is United!"
socitaly.40.d:0 "At long last, Italy has been reunited, and the revolution has spread to every corner of the peninsula! Today is a great day and shall be considered a national holiday. Let all Italians rejoice now that Italy is reunited!"
socitaly.40.a:0 "Viva l'Italia!"

socitaly.41.t:0 "Fifth Congress"
socitaly.41.d:0 "Today, the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy begins. Delegates from all the unions across Italy have convened for the Congress, which is the first to be held in Rome and in a united Italy. Celebrations are being held throughout the nation, and Rome in particular, in honour of this momentous event."
socitaly.41.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

socitaly.42.t:0 "The Fate of the Pope"
socitaly.42.d:0 "One of the first issues on the agenda is what is to be done with the Pope. The Unione Socialista Unitario argue that the government would only suffer a massive backlash if we interfere with the church. The Unione Sindacale Italiana believe that the throne of Saint Peter's should be occupied by a socialist. Finally, the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista argues that the office of the Papacy is outdated and the Pope should be exiled. What shall be the decision of the Congress?"
socitaly.42.a:0 "Leave the Church alone."
socitaly.42.b:0 "Install a Red Pope."
socitaly.42.c:0 "Exile the Pope from Italy."

socitaly.43.t:0 "Internal Policy"
socitaly.43.d:0 "The second matter on the Fifth Congress's agenda is how to handle the issue of dissidents in the Republic. Not all within the Republic are accepting socialism, particularly in the areas where the reactionaries held sway prior to the Second Risorgimento. The Unione Socialista Unitario argues for a conciliatory policy, granting general amnesty and focusing on building socialism instead of going after the dissidents. The Unione Sindacale Italiana believes that a propaganda effort to show socialism's progress, combined with a balanced approach to law enforcement, will help change the minds of the dissidents. The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista, for their part, wants to empower OVRA to clamp down on any dissent against the republic. What shall the Congress decide?"
socitaly.43.a:0 "The dissidents are not a threat."
socitaly.43.b:0 "Increase the propaganda to support the Republic."
socitaly.43.c:0 "Arrest the dissidents and those who help them!"

socitaly.44.t:0 "Italy's Place on the World Stage"
socitaly.44.d:0 "The next order of the Congress is to decide on what role the Socialist Republic of Italy shall play within the International and on the world stage. Until the Second Risorgimento, the Republic was focused on reuniting Italy, but now that that goal has been achieved, Italy's political future must be determined. The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista believe that Italy should focus on spreading the revolution to all corners of the world while the Unione Sindacale Italiana believe the focus should be first on Europe. Finally, the Unione Socialista Unitario believe Italy's role is to help nurture socialism within Italy and the members of the International first."
socitaly.44.a:0 "Nurture socialism from within"
socitaly.44.b:0 "A European revolution!"
socitaly.44.c:0 "A world revolution!"

socitaly.45.t:0 "Unione Socialista Unitario Victory"
socitaly.45.d:0 "The Unione Socialista Unitario has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. They must now determine who is to lead the country. Comrades Olindo Vernocchi, Gaetano Salvemini, Giuseppe Romita, and Giacomo Matteotti are the leading candidates to assume the role of Chairman. Who shall it be?"
socitaly.45.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Vernocchi!"
socitaly.45.b:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Romita!"
socitaly.45.c:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Salvemini!"
socitaly.45.e:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Matteotti!"

socitaly.46.t:0 "Unione Sindacale Italiana Victory"
socitaly.46.d:0 "The Unione Sindacale Italiana has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. The question is, who shall be the Chairman? The leading candidates are Comrade Giuseppe Di Vittorio, Alceste De Ambris, Comrade Palmiro Togliatti, and Comrade Angelo Tasca. Who shall be elected?"
socitaly.46.c:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Di Vittorio!"
socitaly.46.e:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Togliatti!"
socitaly.46.b:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Tasca!"
socitaly.46.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade De Ambris!"

socitaly.47.t:0 "Unione Nazionale Sindacalista Victory"
socitaly.47.d:0 "The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government."
socitaly.47.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Mussolini!"
socitaly.47.b:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Bianchi!"

socitaly.48.t:0 "No Majority Achieved!"
socitaly.48.d:0 "No faction of the Congress came out on top. The government is deadlocked, and for now, the country is once again thrown into chaos while the leaders attempt to negotiate some kind of compromise."
socitaly.48.a:0 "A compromise must be found!"

socitaly.49.t:0 "Unione Sindacale Italiana and Unione Socialista Unitario Italiano Compromise"
socitaly.49.d:0 "In an effort to block the dangerous Unione Nazionale Sindacalista from achieving any kind of power, the Unione Sindacale Italiana and Unione Socialista Unitario have agreed to form a coalition government. Alceste De Ambris will assume the role as president, while Giacomo Matteotti becomes the new Chairman of the Congress of People's Unions."
socitaly.49.a:0 "Better than nothing"

socitaly.50.t:0 "Prisoner of the Vatican"
socitaly.50.d:0 "His Holiness has locked himself within the Vatican, as previous popes did during the days of the Kingdom of Italy. He refuses to acknowledge that [SRI.GetNameDef] rules Italy. However, so long as he is locked within the Vatican, he can do little but make noise. Now, the debate has been renewed: should we just leave the Pope alone to rant and rave, force the Conclave to pick a socialist Pope, or send him into exile?"
socitaly.50.a:0 "Exile the Pope!"
socitaly.50.b:0 "Make the Conclave elect a socialist priest"
socitaly.50.c:0 "Just let him complain"

socitaly.51.t:0 "The Papal Conclave Begins"
socitaly.51.d:0 "The Papal Conclave has begun! The Holy See shall come together and choose a new pope that shall support Socialism. It may take some time but they will eventually elect a new Pope who will do his part to liberate the faithful from their chains."
socitaly.51.a:0 "They shall choose right!"

socitaly.52.t:0 "A New Pope"
socitaly.52.d:0 "After many days of debating, the Conclave has elected Achille Liènart as John XXIII."
socitaly.52.a:0 "Yay!"

socitaly.53.t:0 "Exiling the Pope"
socitaly.53.d:0 "We have decided that the Pope has no place within our society, and that he shall be exiled. Where he goes, we don't care, but he shall not remain within Italy any longer!"
socitaly.53.a:0 "Get out of here!"

socitaly.54.t:0 "The Pope Arrives in [Root.GetNameDef]"
socitaly.54.d:0 "The Pope has arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] today, seeking refuge from the syndicalists within Italy who have exiled him from the country. A large crowd has already come out to meet the Holy Father. He has requested more permanent residence in one of our cathedrals, until such a time as the Vatican is once more restored to freedom."
socitaly.54.a:0 "Stay as long you want, Holy Father!"

socitaly.65.t:0 "The Vatican Commune"
socitaly.65.d:0 "We have recently concluded a productive meeting with the Pope. A tiny commune will be created around Saint Peter's Basilica called the Vatican Commune that will be independent from the Republic. Meanwhile, he will accept the legitimacy of our Republic and urge Catholics worldwide to do so as well. This marks a great day for the faithful and for the Republic."
socitaly.65.a:0 "Thank you, Holy Father!"

socitaly.66.t:0 "Revolutionary Irredentism"
socitaly.66.d:0 "There are still Italian lands and our Italian brothers and sisters that are held in bondage, and it is time that the Congress take a stance on their liberation. Some suggest focusing on just the ones in Austria, others think that we should focus on them but also include Malta. The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista call for a true Greater Italia to be created as a new light of socialism in the world."
socitaly.66.a:0 "Just help liberate our comrades in Austria."
socitaly.66.b:0 "Austrian comrades and Maltese comrades both."
socitaly.66.c:0 "Greater Italia shall be the light of socialism!"

socitaly.67.t:0 "The New Lands"
socitaly.67.d:0 "It has been some time, but we have finally liberated our comrades. Now that socialism has come to the new lands of the republic, we can be secure knowing that we shall be a beacon of socialism within the International."
socitaly.67.a:0 "Avanti Italia!"

socitaly.68.t:0 "Trial for Reactionary Leaders"
socitaly.68.d:0 "With our victory over the reactionary forces, the leaders of the corrupt republic and the "noble" leaders of the despotic kingdoms are standing trial. Some want us to be lenient with them while others want us to be harsh and make an example of them. How shall the court rule?"
socitaly.68.a:0 "Lenient. We already have our victory."
socitaly.68.b:0 "Make an example of them."

socitaly.69.t:0 "What to do with Royal Palaces?"
socitaly.69.d:0 "With the conquest of the South, we have taken control of the territory of the Two Kingdom, and as we bring the revolution southward, the question of what to do about the various noble and royal palaces has arisen. Some think that they should be given over to the local communes, others think that the government should use them for the various ministry positions. Finally, some support the idea of giving them over to the Workers Youth League."
socitaly.69.a:0 "Turn them over to the local communes."
socitaly.69.b:0 "Make them government headquarters."
socitaly.69.c:0 "Make them youth camps."

socitaly.70.t:0 "Resistance to Secularism"
socitaly.70.d:0 "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our official policy of secularism is causing problems with reintegrating the Italian people into a cohesive nation. The Catholic Church was far more powerful in the rest of Italy than in our republic. Consequently, many people are trying to resist and slowing the progress of bringing the revolution to the rest of Italy."
socitaly.70.a:0 "They will learn in time."

socitaly.71.t:0 "on-Interference Policies Help"
socitaly.71.d:0 "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our non-interference towards christianity is proving to be popular with the people and helpful in bringing them to understand the principles of socialism. While there is still quite a bit of resistance among the more dedicated reactionaries, there is less than our strategists expected before the war."
socitaly.71.a:0 "Thank 'heavens'!"

socitaly.72.t:0 "Land Reform in Northern Italy"
socitaly.72.d:0 "Now that we have control of Northern Italy, it is time to bring land reform to the south and bring the revolution to the southern farmers. The package of land reforms prepared by the Congress will collectivise and give the land back to the farmers. Furthermore, local agriculture unions will be created to bring syndicalism south."
socitaly.72.a:0 "Break the chains!"

socitaly.73.t:0 "Industrialisation for the South"
socitaly.73.d:0 "The south was never industrialised to its full potential. However, now that we have control of the south we can begin a program to industrialise the region. This will help improve the lives of the people living there by bringing jobs and development and lowering inequality across Italy."
socitaly.73.a:0 "Progress moves south!"

socitaly.74.t:0 "Syndicalisation of the Economy"
socitaly.74.d:0 "With Italy now united, the question has arisen as to how to bring the syndicalist economy to the rest of Italy. Some think the best way is to focus on building up the unions in the areas. Others think the best way to syndicalise the rest of the country is to focus on collective farming. A third option is worker co-operatives, especially those that serve the military, which could be the key to revolutionizing the new regions."

socitaly.76.t:0 "Resistance to Social Changes"
socitaly.76.d:0 "Since we have united Italy there has been resistance against the various social changes that we have implemented in the Republic since its founding, particularly in the case of women's rights. The changes that we have brought to Italian society will take time, but eventually, the rest of Italy shall accept them."

socitaly.78.t:0 "Fasci Siciliani Founded"
socitaly.78.d:0 "The original Fasci Siciliani was a socialist movement in Sicily in the 1880s and 1890s. They were eventually crushed, but their legacy was long-lasting; they fought for democracy and socialism and were true revolutionaries. Today, a new Fasci Siciliani has been founded, drawing on the legacy of the old organisation. This new Fasci Siciliani is focusing on spreading the ideals of the republic into Sicily."
socitaly.78.a:0 "Long live the Fasci!"

socitaly.79.t:0 "Exhibition of the Revolution"
socitaly.79.d:0 "In 1919 the Socialist Republic of Italy was proclaimed. However, the resulting civil war would leave Italy divided. Since then, we have erased these false borders, reunified Italy, and brought the revolution to all corners of our country! To demonstrate our glorious victory to the people, a grand exhibition of the revolution and our struggles and losses has been unveiled in Roma. Celebrating the struggle to bring syndicalism to all corners of Italy, it will no doubt help to educate the masses about the revolution and inform them of the glory of a reunited Italy."
socitaly.79.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

socitaly.80.t:0 "Women Entering Politics"
socitaly.80.d:0 "While women have been legally allowed to vote, work in politics, and sit in the National Congress since the founding of our Republic, it is only now that we have unified Italy that women throughout the whole of the country enjoy these rights. Many women, especially those from the south and the northeast where the reactionaries ruled, are now taking steps to enter politics for the first time in their lives, from local unions and communes to the Congress itself."

socitaly.84.a:0 "We need every man and woman we can get!"

socitaly.85.t:0 "The Worker-Priest Movement"
socitaly.85.d:0 "The Worker-Priest movement is a movement for the priests of the Catholic Church to help connect to the faithful by working in factories like the laity. The movement is rather popular in the Republic at the moment, and affords the priests the opportunity to connect more closely to the people. Sometimes, sermons can even be heard inside factories and workshops after hours, as the faithful listen to the priests at the end of a long day."
socitaly.85.a:0 "Jesus was a carpenter, after all."

socitaly.86.t:0 "Christian Associations of Italian Workers"
socitaly.86.d:0 "The Christian Associations of Italian Workers, or Associazioni Cristiane dei Lavoratori Italiani (often abbreviated as ACLI), are the largest Catholic lay organisation within the Republic. The goal of the organisation is to help Catholics follow and live in accordance with the philosophy of Christian socialism. Unsurprisingly, the Associazioni are heavily connected with the Popularist Movement and thus more moderate members of the Unitary Socialist faction within the National Congress."
socitaly.86.a:0 "Let us follow in the steps of Jesus."

socitaly.87.t:0 "Futuristic Architecture"
socitaly.87.d:0 "'This is the greatest absurdity of modern architecture. It is perpetuated by the greedy complicity of academies, internment camps for the intelligentsia, where the young are forced to recopy classical models onanistically instead of straining their imaginations to search for solutions to new and urgent problems: the Futurist house and city. A house and city spiritually and materially our own, in which our riotous activity can rage without seeming a grotesque anachronism.' So reads the Futurist Manifesto of architecture. Futurism as an architectural movement has recently been highly popular among the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista. Mussolini, in particular, is a noted patron of architects building in that style."

socitaly.88.t:0 "Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana"
socitaly.88.d:0 "The Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana, or Italian Recreational and Cultural Association, is the largest recreational society within the Republic. Founded in N in the 1920s and later relocated to Palermo, the organisation is purely secular, and its goal is to help support recreational activities for the people as well as to support solidarity amongst the citizens of the Republic. Culture that was once only the purview of the elites, such as opera, plays, and classical music, are now available for the people to enjoy. Furthermore, the Associazione supports book clubs, countryside vacations, and more through arrangements with local communes and unions."
socitaly.88.a:0 "Culture belongs to the masses!"

socitaly.89.t:0 "Unione Donne Italiane Congress"
socitaly.89.d:0 "'We don't see why the revolution is in the hands of only half the population. We are anarchists, but we are also women and we want to make our revolution. Not have men make it for us. We don't want a struggle designed to fit the male because we'll be screwed, as always. We want to fight so that we can claim our part in the share-out. We want to make it clear that just now we're beside ourselves with joy and it would be a mistake to keep us at home knitting! We want to die! But we want to die like men, not live like servants!' So said Ada Prospero at the annual congress of the Unione Donne Italiane, the largest women's organisation in the republic. The Union's goal is dedicated to women's emancipation and liberation. Ada Prospero, in particular, supports the creation of female combat units to fight for the unification of Italy."

socitaly.100.d:0 "Benito Mussolini unveiled the opening of Cinecittà today outside the city of Naples. Cinecittà was planned by numerous architects to be less of a film studio and more of a small cinema city. Mussolini himself was quoted as saying during the opening of the studio: 'Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism.'. Many aspiring filmmakers are already speaking with the unions of the area to see about producing films there, while some are already calling it Hollywood on the Arno."

socitaly.101.t:0 "Death of Filippo Turati"
socitaly.101.d:0 "Today, the great statesman Filippo Turati has passed away at the age of 79 years old. Filippo Turati was one of the last surviving founders of the Italian Socialist Party. His strong and constant support of the rights of the workers of Italy from his earliest days has made him famous throughout the Republic. In addition to founding the Socialist Party of Italy, he was also one of the principal architects of the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Italy. The funeral in Naples was attended by visitors from nations around the world and officials from across the political spectrum, all paying their respects to the late great leader as various labour songs were sung, including Inno dei Lavoratori which he penned himself."

The opening opera for the festival was Giuseppe Verdi's Nabucco. While it is the first of its kind in Italy, Vittorio Gui has stated he hopes that the Maggio Musicale's success can be replicated in cities throughout the Republic."

socitaly.104.t:0 "Enrico Fermi wins Noble Prize"
socitaly.104.d:0 "The physicist Enrico Fermi has recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity.

A relic from the city-state era, San Marino has survived for centuries, lasting from the Roman era all the way to the Risorgimento, and even through the Civil War and the Second Risorgimento. It has long been a haven for refugees from oppression. Today, the elections have brought the Socialists into power in the city-state, and the new Captain Regents are working on bringing syndicalism to their tiny commune. They have assured our republic that they wish to remain friends and seek to build bridges between the two republics."

socitaly.106.t:0 "Roma Jazz Festival"
socitaly.106.d:0 "With Rome once again the capital of Italy, a jazz festival has been put on by the various musical unions throughout Italy.

socitaly.107.t:0 "Giro d'Italia Refounded"
socitaly.107.d:0 "With Italy reunited, the Giro d'Italia can begin again. The Giro d'Italia is a cycling race that began in 1909, but the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and the ongoing political instability in Italy have altogether prevented the race from being held since 1914. The race course goes from Torino in the north all the way down to Napoli and Bari in the south up back to Milan."

socitaly.114.t:0 "Bonfire of the Vanities"
socitaly.114.d:0 "In Naples, a massive bonfire was held where citizens threw various 'vanities' considered to be reactionary or capitalistic into the fires.

socitaly.115.t:0 "Purging the Reactionaries"
socitaly.115.d:0 "A number of the ministers in the government hold rather reactionary views. While they claim to be dedicated to the Republic, we know better.

socitaly.116.t:0 "Destruction of Churches"
socitaly.116.d:0 "'God does not exist - religion in science is an absurdity, in practice an immorality, and in men a disease.' So proclaims Chairman Mussolini. With that, the attention of the cultural revolutionaries has turned towards Christianity and religion. Churches across Italy have been set upon by Garibaldists. Some have been transformed into town halls, with all sign of them being once a place of worship gone. Even more have been destroyed outright, or laid siege by revolutionaries as devout Christians barricaded themselves in. From the tiny parish churches that dot the towns of Italy to the largest cathedrals in the country, none have been spared. It seems that Comrade Mussolini will not stop until every trace of superstition is destroyed!"

Though this would compromise our overall republican vision, it would save the lives of untold thousands by avoiding war with little actual damage done to our ultimate operations, for we shall effectively function as a true democratic republic in all but name under a powerless king, while also granting us new allies among the few royalists left in the South like politicians Alfredo Covelli and Achille Lauro or famed general Giovanni Messe.

The deal seeks to peacefully unify our two nations under a government of radical liberalism and progressive direct democracy, with the compromise being their normally republican and anti-royalist movement would ally with the sister branch of their ANC here in Sardinia in order to create a united constitutional monarchy spanning Sardinia and South Italy, headed by a dominant liberal senate and represented by a powerless monarch in the form of King Amadeo as an alternative to the reign of Victor Emmanuel which has been marred by conservative stagnation and extremist violence. If we were to accept this deal, King Amadeo would be stripped of most of his powers, but the direct democracy that would rise in his wake would be able to effectively guide the masses towards an equal and egalitarian paradise, or so they say, so what say we in return?"

It has emerged as a radical rejection of tradition, opposing both reactionarism and liberalism. Founded by poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the movement has served as an avant-garde vanguard against Italy’s traditionalist and socially conservative populace. It is for this reason that Marinetti has found himself an audience with Chairman Mussolini, Mussolini has admired futurism since its initial inception and hopes that by using this movement the S.R.I can modernize its image.

Going with Lussu could be seen as a sign of goodwill to our new Sardinian allies, but would also alienate much of the old guard that have loyally served alongside Pacciardi for years laying in the groundwork for our current successes. Fearing the collapse of our united coalition with our Saridinian allies, some within the Italia Libera have proposed that general Garibaldi should be appointed prime minister to unify both wings of the party.

Though these dons and bosses would definitely make profitable titans of industry, whether they can be trusted is another matter entirely. However, their cultural significance and the little good they do for their localities cannot be ignored, for they are living relics and time capsules of an Italian age long since passed, and without them keeping far more base criminals in check, who knows what monsters will fill the power vacuum once they’re gone. So many choices and so many possible repercussions, but a choice must be made, so shall the new doges of Venice and beyond rise again as a new class of ‘loyal’ and hopefully non-corrupt mercantile leaders and scions of capitalist growth, or should we ignore temptation and deal with the mafia for good?"

The three sons of Ricciotti Garibaldi, himself the son of the famous unification hero General Giuseppe Garibaldi, stand as the most powerful men in Italy, and the most widely beloved. Headed by Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi II, the other brothers Sante and Ricciotti Jr. are war heroes of the Great War and skilled politicians as well, not to be outshined by their older and more famous brother. However, they are not the only existing three of their kind, for Ricciotti Sr. had four other sons and one daughter, who herself largely stays outside the public light. As for the four brothers not within our government, Costante and Bruno died in the Argonne Offensive during the Great War while Menotti Jr. died while on expedition in Sri Lanka in 1934, leaving just Ezio - the black sheep of the Garibaldi family. \n\nA veteran of the Argonne like his brothers, Ezio survived that muddy hellscape to fight further in the Alps until the armistice was signed and Italy was left shattered with its people left broken. Returning home bitter and resentful of the former regime, Ezio fell in with the extremist side of post-D’Annunzio thought, following Mussolini into the throws of National Syndicalism. With the Socialist government toppled however and with Mussolini executed like the traitor he is, the three ruling Garibaldis must now decide what to do with their fallen younger brother."

The deep links this fraternal organization has with the Italia Libera poses no threat to Italy as the foolish would suspect, but it has opened up strange, unexpected relationships with certain groups. Just recently, we received a masonic delegation from Monrovia who initially came to pay respects to our new government before they realized our party doctrine and began casting aspersions towards our liberal ways before boarding their ship back to Liberia in a huff. Though lodge dinners and secretive rituals may make up some of the backroom chatter in our political meetings, we can assure the public that we Masons only want to do good by our people and our communities."

A close friend of American author Ernest Hemingway and his lover the novelist Martha Gellhorn, Pacciardi has been spotted vacationing in the United States with these titans of the written word when not helping other friends like famed director Michael Curtiz in the making of his new hit film ‘Casablanca.’ A socialite in touch with the common man, Pacciardi is just the silver-tongued suave elite that our movement needed to serve as our middle-man with the public and the senate as we work together to destroy the elitism he happily benefits from in the meantime. Despite this opulent lifestyle, Pacciardi is a committed Mazzinist wholly dedicated to our radical liberal cause, and without him we would be more junta than true republican effort."

socitaly.218.d:0 "The Garibaldi family has a storied history with the small city-state of San Marino, with the small slice of autonomous paradise once operating as a safe haven for Italy’s various liberal revolutionaries during the Italian Resurgence, including our own leader’s grandfather the great hero Giuseppe Garibaldi. During his time fleeing Austrian forces in 1849, Garibaldi the elder sought asylum in the city-state, and thanks to the word of Captain Regent Domenico Maria Belzoppi, himself a former liberal revolutionary as well, Garibaldi, his wife Anita, and his 1,500 men were able to sneak into San Marino unharassed in exchange for most of them giving up their arms and going into hiding as to not bring ruin to the city. Following this act of mercy, Garibaldi, Anita, and 150 of their closest loyalists who refused to abandon the heroic general all were able to sneak out of San Marino under the noses of some 12,000 pursuing Austrian soldiers with the help of the Captain Regent’s guard, with Garibaldi forever swearing to honor and protect the city in his wake. Nearly a century later, another Garibaldi now stands as Italy’s unifier, and now a choice must once again be made regarding San Marino. Should Peppino honor the legacy of his grandfather and Captain Regent Belzoppi, allowing San Marino to continue its autonomous existence as allies, or should we not risk anything on our path to towards the total unification of Italy, snuffing out San Marinese independence while we still have the chance?"

Calling for the conquest of Aragonese Spain, or all of it, as well as Corsica, the Balearics, and the Aragonese provinces in southern France and eastern Greece, these mad men would have us set sail to foreign lands to ‘get revenge’ on crimes wrought by men long dead in a time that has long healed from these past transgressions.

General Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi has been somewhat outspoken in public on the matter, denying that his late grandfather had any direct links to the movement, largely due to Garibaldi dying before Esperanto was even invented, but that has not stopped local firebrands from jumping on the idea and lumping Mezzinist doctrine in with the Esperantist Dream. Viewing the constructed, artificial language as a perfect unifying force free of any nationalist or extremist taint that shall help unify the Italian and non-Italian peoples of our united peninsula along Mazzinist doctrine, the Federazione Esperantista Italiana (called the Itala Esperanto-Federacio in their own made-up tongue) has begun to loudly voice their support for the Garibaldi government regardless of Peppino’s words while championing the idea of raising Esperanto alongside Italian as an official language of the perfected republic, while simultaneously working to teach the new language to all students in our newly constructed Mezzinist public schools across the nation. \n\nAligning ourselves with these linguistic humanists would go a long way in legitimizing our universalist stance while granting us new allies across the Italian Left. However, most see this proposed linguistic shift as ‘un-Italian’ even despite our shared and popular non-nationalist, universalist, and anti-ethnocentric message, with most within our government and nearly all outside it calling the plan plain mad.

socitaly.223.d:0 "Back in 1870, Spain was ruled by King Amadeo I who still stands as Spain’s only monarch in its entire history to come from our own House of Savoy, with Amadeo - also called Amadeus - being the second son of Victor Emmanuel II and thus raised as the spare to the true heir, living most of his life as the Duke of Aosta like all second sons within the House of Savoy before him. However, Amaedo’s rule was doomed from the start as his Spanish domain rapidly decayed under mounting republican pressure, Carlist rebellions in the north, and the threat of Cuban independence. After just three tumultuous years on the throne, he abdicated in 1873 - famously calling the Spanish people ‘ungovernable’ before the Cortes Generales upon his exit - and thus the first Spanish Republic was born. Returning to Italy, he founded the Aosta branch of the House of Savoy, which was junior to the main line descended from King Umberto I which still rules North Italy to this day, but senior to the dukes of Genoa, and now with Italy being shattered, the Aosta branch finds itself ruling an independent Kingdom of Sardinia once again, now under the grandson of Amadeo I who uses his grandfather's regal name. With our government loyal sworn to the Aosta branch of the House of Savoy, and to the legacy of Amadeo I along with it, some radical warhawks within our ranks wish to see the old realm of our beloved Amadeus restored, calling for an Italian ‘reconquest’ of Savoyard Spain. Though utterly ludicrous, many still chomp at the bit for revenge against the Iberians for one past transgression or another, so should we take this rare opportunity to seize on some long forgotten ‘destiny’, or should we continue to focus on Italian matters first and foremost, for the peninsula and the wider Italian sphere is unstable enough as it is..."

However, this national level has remained in our hands without a say from the wider masses, begging the question of when, or even if, our nation shall hold elections on a national level now that the masses have been saved from extremism. So the question that begs answering is should General Giuseppe ‘Peppino’ Garibaldi II follow through with his destiny as a modern Cincinnatus and a true hero of the people like his grandfather and namesake before him by preparing to step down while the first fair elections since the Counterrevolution are organized, even if it leads to a partial departure to our own Mazzinist values, or should this era of liberal political tutelage continue indefinitely until a ‘true’ sense of stability has been achieved as to to ensure that the Counterrevolution is forever secure as the perfect egalitarian republic is slowly built from on high?"

However, he has taken flak from the more unmovable within our group that question his dedication to our specific breed of Leftist ideology, with many fearing that Lombardi supports Leftist Unity and compromise too much. However, his record as a devoted Chistian Socialist and his work with Guido Mignoli and Geredo Bruni have gained him support from our more pious. \n\nOpposing him is the leader of the Fasci old guard Aruturo Labriola, who has risen once again in popularity due to his close connections to the original Fasci movement, who he protested in support of despite not being an original member, and due to string-pulling by France. A dedicated Fasci advocate for decades, Labriola has gained fame and respect for working alongside Napoleone Colajanni and Filippo Turati in the past as Christian Socialist writers and newsmen, and for serving valiantly in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. Once exiled from Italy due to organizing strikes in Milan with his fellow Socialist forefathers of modern Italy, Labriola lived abroad for a time, sparking friendships with and becoming influenced by foreign figures like Georges Sorel, Hubert Lagardelle, and Paul Lafargue, becoming deeply influenced by French Syndicalism. However, rumors swirl that Labriola has fleeting loyalty to revolutionary ideas, instead supporting more reformist actions inspired by his newfound allies like Ivanoe Bonomi, while others salaciously suggest that his recent resurgence is largely due to Masonic funding; claims fueled by his position as a leading member of the Grand Orient of Italy, though Labriola has denied these claims time and time again, swearing his loyalty to our party and ideology first and foremost.

Terrified of our Revolution, these Catholic extremists banded together to form militias of their own, and have been causing trouble in the rural areas ever since. The group seems to be incredibly disunited,  only united by a Leadership Council that is otherwise powerless. Despite the massive disunity, two men, Padre Renato Ziggiotti and Padre Pio are the most popular leaders within the NeoSanfedisti. The former dreams of restoring a reactionary order to Italy, unifying it in some “Holy Federation.” Pio, for his part, is more radical; The ideas of nation, class, race, and ideology disgust him. He wishes to topple our Republic and build a society united by faith.

Ziggiotti gave a rousing speech about the glorious new Italy we could build together, how we would rebuild Italy into a perfect, Holy nation, ruled by Piety and Devotion to the Lord. As his speech drew to a close, almost the entire room was filled with furious applause. Once it died down, Pio carefully stood up and began to speak. Immediately, his soothing voice and mystical aura seemed to transfix the room. He spoke about his dream of a society united by faith, of brothers and sisters coming together in harmony and love. He called for dismantling the nations and systems that keep us from being one in Christ Jesus. When he concluded, there was no applause, only awe. The debate has concluded, and though only God knows what the future holds for our movement, it is time for the Council to decide who will be our new leader."

cathitaly.3.d:0 "Padre Ziggiotti has a dream. He has been quested by the Lord to rebuild Italy into a new, Holy Federation. The plan calls for the return of the nobility, but not before land reform to ensure the people are not to be abused by the aristocracy. At the same time, he has pledged compensation to the nobles whose land will be donated to the peons. Once complete, he plans to approach the North in the hopes of a reunion. But if diplomacy were to fail, perhaps his Holy Federation would be one forged in blood..."

cathitaly.4.t:0 "Padre Pio's Vision"
cathitaly.4.d:0 "Padre Pio is a simple man at his core. When he sees a problem, he does all he can to solve it. When he hears confessions, he can read the soul of the penitent, and can tell them how to truly save their souls. Thus it is with the grand problem of humanity. Pio believes he has seen the signs; he knows why the Socialists and Nationalists rose up-he knows why they reject God. They reject God due to not knowing him. They don't know God due to poor catechism. They had poor catechism due to the distractions of nation, of war, and of bad examples of the faith.\n How does one fix that? How can you attack the root cause of society's ills? Simple. You remove the nation, race, class. You give a good model of faith to the children. And what after that? Once man is solely focused on God, you will know you have solved the problem.\n This solution, once it is successful in the south of Italy, cannot be held within her borders alone. No, the entire Church must fall and come to embrace this truth, this grand vision of Padre Pio. Once the Church has tasted this vision, Pio's vision will be carried to the four corners of the world, so that he can bring man to his true and most glorious end: life with Christ in Heaven above, forever."

cathitaly.5.d:0 "Our army has, by the grace of God, triumphed over the Red Menace. However, our work is not done. The underworld of Italy has been corrupted by the greed and power of the Mafia. They have built a Den of Thieves on the exploitation of the innocent who cannot help themselves. Worse still, they profane our faith while cloaked in the image of the Virgin Maria. Just as Christ drive the materialistic money-changers from His Father’s House, so too must we drive these monsters from the Kingdom of God. At the same time, we face a wicked, ancient threat. Julius Evola and his Legions are a relic of the cruel past that Christ saved man from. We cannot let this new army of Nebuchadnezzar devastate God’s Earth with their philistine ideas of supremacy, nation, and idol-worship. We must defeat this abominable force as the Son of Man conquered the pagans of old!"

cathitaly.6.t:0 "Dealing with the Mafia"
cathitaly.6.d:0 "At last, we have liberated Italia from the grip of the crooked mafia. While we certainly must defang the Syndicate, there remains debate about what to do with the Mafiosos themselves. Some believe their sinful ways of crime, betrayal, and murder put them beyond redemption. After all, they are dangerous men, and the last thing we need is for them to corrupt our ranks with their trickery. Another camp preaches mercy for the monsters. To them, these are our brothers in faith, misguided by worldly greed. If we show them mercy, they could become a powerful ally as well. Did not Jesus show mercy to the tax collector Matthew and the prostitute Mary. Perhaps we should offer these blind men a chance to see?"

cathitaly.7.t:0 "Dealing with Evola's Legion"
cathitaly.7.d:0 "We cornered the Legion around Bari. Upon luring their army out into the open plains, the modern clash of good and evil began. The Pagan Leviathan fought brutally and desperately, their troops with blackened hearts screaming about degeneracy and “Kali Yuga.” Our warriors were pushed back further from the city, but we did not lose hope. We knew the battle had been won from the very moment Christ sacrificed Himself on the cross. Our men retreated behind our artillery emplacements as the Legionaries surged forward. It was then that the guns roared like the trumpets at Mount Zemaraim. After the devastating barrage, our counter attack began. God was surely with us as we pushed the pagans back to the outskirts of the city. There the leviathan made its final stand. Evola was found in the Basilica of Saint Nicholas, a single gunshot in his forehead. By the justice of God, we have triumphed over the wicked Legion."

cathitaly.8.t:0 "Hope of Faith"
cathitaly.8.d:0 "To My Beloved Sister Viola,\nToday I finally heeded your words and attended mass at the Cattedrale di Avellino. Initially I was disgusted by the ritual I was witnessing. As you know, my years in the Socialist Republic had convinced me that the Church and everything to do with it was all puttanata.  After the First Reading, which recounted the Parable of the Sower I had enjoyed when I was a boy, none other than Padre Ziggiotti began the Homily.\n Somehow, I was enthralled by his words. Oh, how he had such a way with words! He told us of the importance of faith, that without it a void is left in our hearts, and creates sorrow and misfortune. Before I had realized what I had done, I interrupted to blurt out, “But Padre, how does one attain and keep the faith?” People from every pew turned to face me with disgusted looks. But Padre Ziggiotti only laughed gently before answering. “My son, faith is attained through our works. We can express faith through our words, but it is our deeds that truly show that we seek and believe. Walk the path of righteousness, and you will find yourself empowered with faith, that wonderful gift. With belief in God by your side, my son, nothing is impossible.”\n To tell you the truth, few words have moved me as much as the ones he spoke before continuing the Mass. I think I have finally become grateful for the baptism Mama and Papa gave me all those years ago. But now I must get back to work. But thank you, Viola, for everything."

Now we must look to the North, for there the heart of the Church lies. It is time we approach the Holy See as Servants of the Lord and His Church, humbly asking for Italy to be reborn as a holy, united federation. Though we expect and pray for a peaceful outcome, Padre Ziggiotti is ready to wage war should the Pontiff be blind to reason."

cathitaly.10.d:0 "A curious proposition has come in from our severed half to the south. Apparently, after the recent turmoil in the southern Republic’s recent elections, the syndicalist dogs have been overthrown, and in the ensuing unrest and panic, revered priest and catholic militant Padre Renato Ziggotti has taken the reigns of the nation in his hands. Backed by his Neosanfedist militias, Padre Ziggotti has returned the mighty light of God to these heathens, basking the south in the Holy Light of the Lord once more! With his rule cemented, he has sent a request of reunion to the Holy See here in the north. Though Padre Ziggotti may have a reputation for violence against the godless syndicalists, he is still a man of the cloth and a true son of God in our eyes, no matter how misguided he may have once been. Shall we accept his offer with open arms, reuniting these blessed lands and restoring the heart of Catholisicm to its rightful strength, or shall we ignore this madman’s request in hopes that we may retake the South at a later date."

We must make haste at once to begin the preparations for our long awaited reunion. Though the path ahead shall be fraught with danger and trepidation, we shall emerge together on the other side, stronger and more unified than ever before, under the light of God.

They have always been the first to snub their nose at us southerners while they grew fat and blasphemous in their debauchery and excess. This dichotomy is dead! Under the guiding hand of Padre Renato Ziggotti, the south of Italy has been transformed into a bountiful and beautiful land that God himself would smile upon! These sinners to the north have denied our humble request at making our broken nation whole again, but this will be the last time the north turns their back on us and on the Lord. Under Padre Ziggotti’s command, our brave Army of the Holy Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ shall storm north like the crusaders of old and wipe clean the slate of these disgraceful heretics. Italy will be made whole once more, and we will spill the blood of our enemies until the streets run red with their sin-filled blood."

As Padre Ziggotti moves to consolidate the newly made state, the holy light of the Lord washes over these lands, cleansing it of sin and sinner. In this new holy kingdom of God, all will be made pure, and Ziggotti’s Neosanfedisti will make sure of it. As this righteous army stalks our lands, they shall prosthelytize and carry out the will of our Lord, making sure all are made to confess and reconcile their past heresies. This land will be purged of sin, and those who refuse to repent shall feel the blazing light of God to its full extent. We will not tolerate heresy in God’s land."

cathitaly.14.t:0 "Catholic Means Universal"
cathitaly.14.d:0 "Nationalism and Socialism: these concepts, while not down right sinful, are almost idolatry. They corrupt and consume good people with their tempting talk of devotion to nation and revolution. Such concepts have no place in the new society we are building, for devotion is to be reserved for God and His Church. Pio recognizes this, and has begun to take measures to cleanse his realm of these wicked ideas. All clergy, officers and politicans of any rank or stipe even suspected of harboring nationalist or socialist sympathies are to be stripped of their positions. They still have a place in Pio’s vision, but it is certainly not one where they have any influence. The journey to finally be free from that which strays us from God has begun at last."

cathitaly.15.t:0 "Attacking Nationalism"
cathitaly.15.d:0 "With the removal of those suspected to harbor nationalistic or socialist tendencies, the cleansing hand of Pio struck the country. However, this was just the beginning. In order to fully remove that great idol of nationalism, a radical strike must be made. The way to make this strike, in the mind of the great Padre Pio, is twofold. Firstly, the state must be made incredibly decentralized, and all political power will be held by the village in the countryside and in the district within the city. All governmental functions, save for a few powers, namely the military and education, will be handled at the most local level. Doing this will no doubt cause chaos for a short period, but it is necessary to finally remove the idol of nationalism.\n Secondly, national monuments, monuments to the people who united Italy and to the past glories of this nation, must be dealt with. While obviously the people will not take kindly to the destruction of what was, Pio has no intention to destroy these modern day golden calves. They shall be put on display in every town and city in museums and places of shame. This will be done to show our history, for we must not destroy our past, but it will also show the people what we have risen above. In place of the removed monuments, great statues of Our Lord and His Most Blessed Mother, of the blessed Saints, will be raised, to give our people true models to look up to."

cathitaly.16.d:0 "As Padre Pio has begun to implement his glorious vision in southern Italy over the past several months, it is becoming increasingly clear that not only is his vision successful; it works far better then anyone could have predicted. People of all races, classes, and nationalities are working side-by-side, helping each other get to Heaven.\n  His vision has now been proven to be more than just an idea in the head of a visionary, and the second and perhaps most grand phase is about to begin. This phase will involve the implementation of the vision of Pio throughout the entire Church. The only way to achieve that, in the mind of our saintly leader, is to call an Ecumenical Council, a thing only the Holy Father can do. While Padre Pio is a loyal son of Rome, there is no way the current pontiff would entertain Pio's ideas about reform and councils. Thus, our holy Padre has scheduled a meeting with the Vicar of Christ to discuss the reunion of the two halves of Italy, among other things. Padre Pio has his eyes on the Papacy, and with God on his side, how could he fail?"

What the two men discussed for the next 12 hours was not recorded, but the effects of the meeting would be felt early the next morning.\n On the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, the Vicar of Christ announced his resignation. He was the first pope to do so in centuries, and that was not all. In his place, His Holiness declared that no conclave would take place, but that instead, Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, leader of the Apostolic State of Southern Italy, would be the next Bishop of Rome.\n Reactions to this announcement have been... mixed to say the least. The Cardinals of the Church have not issued any statement yet, but a handful of theologians have declared this move illegal. Either way, with Padre Pio now becoming the so-called  “Pope-Elect“, it is expected he will attempt to unite Italy before his coronation."

His Holiness-elect, the nominal head of the Italian Federation, is well within his rights to do this, and by all accounts we are legally bound to follow his request. However, this has not stopped some within our government from begging us to refuse. Pio's state in southern Italy is apparently an abomination of what he is calling 'Nationless Catholicism', a system that, in practice, sees nationalism, socialism, and class conflict as horrible and unites the people under the banner of Catholicism. This comes at the cost of nearly any semblance of modernity. While we are legally bound, the argument of these members of our government is compelling. With this in mind, the College of Cardinals has gathered to hold an emergency vote on what to do in regards to the demand from Pio"

This was to be expected in his eyes; the institutional Church has always been afraid of reform, and Pio's reforms would be more radical then most.

After the ceremony, the Dean of the College was quick to run to the balcony overlooking St. Peter's square and speak those words that the faithful of not just Rome, but the whole world have been waiting for: “Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum, Habemus Papam!

You were not elected by the College. In fact, you have never been one of us. You are an upstart in over your head, and this dream of yours will bring this Church to ruin.” There seemed to be no anger in the Pontiff’s voice as he responded, “Your Eminence, I am to be addressed as Your Holiness. I beg of you to have faith in me and my leadership. I am unorthodox, yes, but I am also nonetheless as faithful a servant of the Lord as any one of you. His Holiness chose me, and thus I am a part of the sacred line that began with Simon Peter. Must I beg you not to split the Church by electing a new Pope?” Now it was Cardinal Baudrillart’s turn. “It is an insult to God to have someone so blasphemous as you lead our Church, and every moment that we do not choose a new Pontiff is another moment we are ruled by a fraud.” The Pope calmly removed the covers on his hands, and revealed his stigmata to his audience.

The Pope smiled warmly, and gently answered, “My Brother, I understand your doubts. But I beg you to keep your faith. All things are possible for one who believes.” Sister Verini, who was paralyzed, was helped to kneel her before her Pontiff. “Your Holiness, the Lord is with you. Blessed be your name! For you are my leader in faith, and I have faith in you.” The Pope removed his mittens, holding up his wounded hands to those before him. Looking upon the wounds of Christ on the Pope’s hands, they were transfixed. He took his hands in hers, and began to say a prayer. “My friends, behold my hands. Sister Verini has not witnessed them until now, and yet, she believed. You doubted until you saw. Now rise, Sister Verini.” Sister Verini stood up, and began to cry tears of joy.

However, a final question remains on what shall be the nature of the NeoSanfedisti as they carry out the Lord’s good works.\n Our armies can become forces of peace and forgiveness, working with both the clergy and the laity to spread God’s good will to the rest of His misguided flock. Under this mission, we shall take their tired, their poor, their downtrodden, and their bereaved, and we shall lift these meek souls from the mud so they too can inherit the Earth and live in God’s good graces.\n In sharp contrast to this, our armies can march forth from these lands of the Holy See, carrying the vengeful fire and spirit of God’s wrath, smiting the myriad of heretics and heathens that plague this Garden of Eden. Under the command of our brave officers and generals, inspired by the light of the Lord himself, a tenth crusade will be declared; this time, not just for the Holy Land in the Levant, but for all of God’s holy lands.

With this position, a great deal of pressure has been placed upon His Holiness' shoulders as he takes his seat amid one of the most tumultuous times in modern history. In order to solidify the people’s faith in both their new Pope and their new state, the Pontiff has called for a small meeting to be held to determine the new flag of his hand crafted state. This banner shall be the symbol of our nation and of our faith - something new to rally behind as we walk through this new valley of death towards our bright horizon, guided and shepherded by both Successor of Saint Peter and the Lord’s Holy Light."
cathitaly.34.a:0 "Rally behind the old naval flag depicting Peter, Paul and Christ."
cathitaly.34.b:0 "Raise a new banner depicting the Keys of Heaven."
cathitaly.34.c:0 "The new Peter and Paul flag design shall serve us well."
cathitaly.34.e:0 "We shall use the Peter, Paul and Christ banner, but modernized."
cathitaly.34.f:0 "Adorn the standard flag of the Papacy!"
cathitaly.34.g:0 "Take notes from the Swiss Guard’s standard."
cathitaly.34.h:0 "Under the watch of the Virgin Mary, our people shall be safe."

cathitaly.36.t:0 "The Legacy of the Two Sicilies"
cathitaly.36.d1:0 "As nobles that fled to the north of Italy finally have the chance to return to their former homes in our new state, monarchists amongst our number have proposed enthroning the Bourbons as the heads of our holy state, in the image of our namesakes who fought for the former Kingdom of Two Sicilies. Such a move would surely bolster our legitimacy in the eyes of Italians in the North as well as the South, but numerous protests can already be heard throughout our new state. The already unruly population under us grows restless, as many brand a return to monarchy as a return to the ideals that resulted in our defeat in 1919. After all, we have just recently gained power in the South, and such a move would be reckless. However, our military is confident that they can enforce cooperation amongst the people for the return of the monarchy. How shall we proceed?"
cathitaly.36.d2:0 "As nobles that fled to the north of Italy return to their former homes in our new state, monarchists among our number have proposed rejoining the Bourbon kingdom in the north, in the image of our namesakes who fought for the former Kingdom of Two Sicilies, and in the process reconcile with the north. A bloodless resolution to the Civil War would surely be the best choice for the Italian nation that has lost so much already, but do we trust the northerners to guide our united nation to prosperity? The tension between North and South is still palpable, with many within our ranks outright decrying the corrupt rule of the North. The Austrian hand slinks deep within Milan and Rome, no doubt. However, the choice is ultimately up to us, though war with the North would likely be wildly unpopular amongst our people."
cathitaly.36.a:0 "Enthrone the Bourbons, The Two Sicilies live again!."
cathitaly.36.b:0 "Send an envoy north, the Bourbons shall receive their birthright."
cathitaly.36.c:0 "We don't need them, our faithful rule alone."

cathitaly.37.t:0 "Revival of Two Sicilies?"
cathitaly.37.d:0 "When the Socialists in the South fell to the uprising of the Catholic Neosanfedisti, many wondered what their rise would hold in store for the future of Italy and our Kingdom, but it seems fortune may smile upon us, they have recognized the old Bourbon claim to the Two Sicilies and have extended us an olive branch. They humbly request to continue to have some say in government through representatives and advisors to the King. While this is truly the best outcome, many within our government are wary of allowing such zealous radicals to remain within our administration. But, surely, this is better than spilling the blood of thousands of Italian young men, is it not?"
cathitaly.37.a:0 "Our birthright is secure!."
cathitaly.37.b:0 "We cannot trust these fanatics in the slightest."

cathitaly.38.t:0 "The Restoration of the Two Sicilies"
cathitaly.38.d:0 "The north has sent back word with approval of the restoration, The Kingdom of Two Sicilies lives and peace in Italy is assured. The North has been reconciled with the South without the slaughter of Italian citizens. Rejoice, for never again will we be divided! Our short-lived independence in the 19th century will last for a thousand years! There will be growing pains, of course, but these pains are better than the pain of thousands of grieving mothers."
cathitaly.38.a:0 "Viva o rre cu Fagmiglia."

cathitaly.39.t:0 "The Bourbons rebuke us!"
cathitaly.39.d:0 "The Bourbon Kingdom of the north has sent back word, they rebuke us, calling us fanatics, zealots and radicals! After such a humble offer, we thought for sure that they would agree to reunification, but it seems that they are more interested in politics than the Italian people. The Austrians have done enough meddling in the North, that they identify more with Vienna than Napoli! We have done all we can. If Italy is to live again, the Northerners must submit to our guidance. Otherwise, we will be slaves to the Hun and Communard for eternity, and the teachings of Christ will be lost. This cannot be! We must secure the sovereignty of our people, even if they resist us."
cathitaly.39.a:0 "Ca v'abbrucia lu panare!."

cathitaly.40.t:0 "The Restoration of the Bourbons"
cathitaly.40.d:0 "The North Italians have decided to restore the Bourbon dynasty, binding their nation to ours under one king. The massive fortifications and bunkers along Rome and Anzio are being dismantled, as our diplomats and administration discuss how to formalize the reunification. Both armies have stood down and are in the arduous process of combining their doctrines and equipment into one Italian army. Families have been reunited, and the whole nation can breathe a collective sigh as Italian has been reunited without further struggle or conflict. The King, [ROOT.GetLeader] has been coronated in Rome, with full support from the Pope. In a speech to Rome, [ROOT.GetLeader], beset by jubilant crowds of people grateful for a new day of stable, optimistic peace, praised both the North and South for seeing the wisdom in pacifism. Celebrations have erupted throughout all of our nation. May we see this peace forever!"
cathitaly.40.a:0 "Viva o rre cu Fagmiglia."

cathitaly.41.t:0 "One Kingdom for Italy"
cathitaly.41.d:0 "Ever since the Socialists fled south of the Italian peninsula, Italy has been divided between 2 administrations, a state of affairs which was maintained even when they were nominally reunited under the House of Bourbon. Safer waters have been reached as the Neosanfedisti has destroyed the rule of the godless Communards in the South. In its stead remained a rule that was more amicable to the North. However, it has come time to mend ourselves into one nation proper, leaving only one gaping question: which ought to take primacy, between the monarchist north and Neosanfedisti south. Representatives of both have met in Rome to discuss the fate of the nation. After days upon days of fiery debate and discourse, who has won the final Italian struggle?"
cathitaly.41.a:0 "The Neosanfedisti come out in triumph."

northsri.1.t:0 "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
northsri.1.d:0 "In 1919, the Italians signed an armistice with the Austrians, ending the war for the Kingdom of Italy. However, the brave socialists and nationalists in Italy rose up against the destructive Savoyards, determined to replace their system with something better. Even King Victor Emanuel and his son’s abdication was not enough to stop the will of the people, and civil war broke out across Italy. Even as we pushed the royalists out of northern Italy, however, there were traitors in our own ranks. The “Whites” in the republican uprising, unwilling to accept the inevitability of the revolution, broke with our movement and soon sold themselves out completely to the Austrians. With our enemies all united against us, our advances were halted on the Po and on the Abruzzo line, and the war was over. \n\nSince the ceasefire in 1920, three Congresses have come and gone, and revolutionary fervor has spread to every corner of northern Italy. Much has been done to uplift the Italian peasantry from their previous conditions, but much still remains to do."
northsri.1.a:0 "Forward!"

northsri.200.t:0 "Uniting Italy"
northsri.200.d:0 "Italian nationalists have already begun the call for a Second Risorgimento, to unify Italy once more. Spreading the revolution will not be a simple matter, however. The peninsula exists in an uneasy balance: Germany and Austria are wary of any formal alliance between the SRI and the Third Internationale. They know an alliance is inevitable, but any attempt on our part to bring the French and English into a war to reunite Italy under syndicalist rule would draw intervention and start a new Weltkrieg. The Republic of Italy to the east is protected by Austria, but under a similar prohibition against starting a war against us. So long as the prospect of German and Austrian interference remains, we must be aware that any war to reunite Italy can only be done with limited Third Internationale support. We have not made a move yet, but we cannot sit idly for much longer - Italy must be reunited!"
northsri.200.a:0 "Viva l'Italia!"

### Fourth Congress ###
northsri.2.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy"
northsri.2.d:0 "Today, the Fourth Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy begins. The various factions of the Congress will debate economic, internal, and military policies. The Unione Sindacale Italiana seek to push orthodox Syndicalism, advancing the current policies of the congress, while the Partito Socialista Italiano desire a government that supports a more moderate approach to bringing socialism to the country. Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista, advances the new ideology of Garibaldismo, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."
northsri.2.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

northsri.3.t:0 "Day 1: Economic Policy"
northsri.3.d:0 "The first order of business is the economic policy of the Republic. The Partito Socialista Italiano advocate for a focus on agrarianism and supporting the rural communes. The Unione Sindacale Italiana argue for furthering syndicalist economic policies so as to develop the nation into a proper industrial democratic republic. Mussolini's Unione Nazionale Sindacalista, for their part, demand nothing short of total and immediate industrialisation, implemented by a powerful central government."
northsri.3.a:0 "We must expand our agriculture."
northsri.3.b:0 "We should focus on industrialisation."
northsri.3.c:0 "Nothing short of total industrialisation will suffice!"

northsri.4.t:0 "Day 2: Internal Policy"
northsri.4.d:0 "The discussion on the second day of the Congress focused on more internal matters. The Unione Sindacale Italiana's representative came forward and pushed for further empowerment of the unions while the Partito Socialista Italiano's representative came forward and pushed for empowering the rural communes instead. Unione Nazionale Sindacalista's representative argued that it is the Chairman of the Republic that should be empowered."
northsri.4.a:0 "Focus on empowering the Communes"
northsri.4.b:0 "Focus on empowering the Unions"
northsri.4.c:0 "Focus on Empowering the Chairman"

northsri.5.t:0 "Day 3: Religious Policy"
northsri.5.d:0 "The final order of business is the status of Christianity within the republic. The Partito Socialista Italiano, while an atheist party in nature, say that Italian culture is bound up with that of the Catholic Church. Trying to divorce the two would be folly, so they say a common ground must be found where the Church can work with the government rather than against it. The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista, on the other hand, claim that Christianity is archaic and unsuited for the modern age, and that a state atheism which forces religion out of daily life will break the chain of ignorance. Finally, the Unione Sindacale Italiana support a status quo of official secularism, where the government is non-religious in all matters and neither works with the church nor against it."
northsri.5.a:0 "Support common ground with the Church!"
northsri.5.b:0 "Support secularism!"
northsri.5.c:0 "Support state atheism!"

northsri.6.t:0 "Partito Socialista Italiano Majority!"

northsri.6.b:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Romita!"

northsri.7.t:0 "Unione Sindacale Italiana Majority!"
northsri.7.d:0 "The Unione Sindacale Italiana has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. Now, two leading members of the faction can assume the role of Chairman, Palmiro Togliatti or Alceste De Ambris. Whom shall be elected the new Chairman?"

northsri.8.t:0 "Unione Nazionale Sindacalista Majority!"
northsri.8.d:0 "The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista has achieved a majority and are now in charge of the government. With this victory, Benito Mussolini is now the new chairman."
northsri.8.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Mussolini!"

northsri.9.t:0 "No Majority Achieved!"
northsri.9.d:0 "No faction of the Congress came out on top. The government is deadlocked, and for now, the country is once again thrown into chaos while the leaders attempt to negotiate some kind of compromise."
northsri.9.a:0 "Damn it!"

northsri.10.t:0 "Unione Sindacale Italiana and Partito Socialista Italiano Compromise"
northsri.10.d:0 "In an effort to block the dangerous Unione Nazionale Sindacalista from achieving any kind of power, the Unione Sindacale Italiana and Partito Socialista Italiano have agreed to form a coalition government. Palmiro Togliatti is to maintain his role as president, while Giacomo Matteotti will become the new Chairman of the Congress of People's Unions."
northsri.10.a:0 "Better than nothing."

northsri.11.t:0 "Stalemate in the Socialist Republic of Italy"
northsri.11.d:0 "During the recent Congress of the Socialist Republic of Italy, none of the three factions were able to achieve a clear majority, and the government has collapsed into deadlock. This would normally not be our concern, but the Italians' inability to compromise is only destabilizing an ally which is already unsteady on its feet. Perhaps we can help them choose their new government?"
northsri.11.a:0 "Support the Partito Socialista Italiano!"
northsri.11.b:0 "Support the Unione Sindacale Italiana!"
northsri.11.c:0 "Support the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista"

northsri.16.a:0 "The Partito Socialista Italiano will be the new government!"
northsri.16.b:0 "Let us try and find a compromise ourselves."

northsri.19.d:0 "A number of highly-placed Catholics who have been deemed at risk for supporting the Papacy over their own government were recently rounded up by the Republican Guard today and placed in prison until such a time as they can be properly vetted. It's a move that's sure to outrage other Catholics in the republic, but should any trouble arise, the presence of so many ready informants will ensure it is dealt with readily."
northsri.19.a:0 "It must be done, for the greater good"

northsri.20.t:0 "Northern Catholics Suppressed"
northsri.20.d.nosic:0 "In a move that comes as a confirmation to many of the evils of Syndicalism, the government recently rounded up scores of Catholic faithful – anyone whose allegiances might be suspect, and who might have been an ally to the Pope – and placed them in prison pending eventual interrogation. It's a move which has spurred resentment in the south, and renewed calls for war. There are those within the Pope's inner circle who suggest this also presents an opportunity: to use the outrage within [SRI.GetNameDef] and fund a resistance movement. While the possibility exists that [SRI.GetNameDef] could discover our connection and go to war with us, the resistance could significantly weaken them and afford us the ability to raise partisans behind enemy lines once the war begins."

northsri.29.t:0 "Ringleaders Apprehended!"
northsri.29.d:0 "Earlier today, several of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators. This is a serious blow to the Catholic terrorists, and brings the country one step closer to eliminating them for good."
northsri.29.d.last:0 "Earlier today, the last of the ringleaders behind the NeoSanfedisti movement were apprehended by Republican Guard investigators. This puts an end to the group's operations within [SRI.GetNameDef], and an example will be made of the men to ensure that no other Catholic agitators get similar ideas in the future."

northsri.30.t:0 "Foreign Support for the NeoSanfedisti"
northsri.30.d:0 "While it comes as little surprise to some, we finally have acquired proof that [PAP.GetNameDef] has been directly funding the NeoSanfedisti terrorists.

northsri.32.t:0 "Policy Towards the Church"

There is a concern within the government that this resistance will only provide an opening for the Papacy to exploit once it comes time for war with the Mezzogiorno."
northsri.32.d.synd:0 "While the policy of the Unione Sindacale Italiana has been to ignore matters of faith, many within our government say our support of the Worker-Priest movement has violated our traditional neutrality. What's more, it's causing mixed reactions amongst the country's faithful.

While great progress has been made since the civil war that tore Italy apart, we must consider ways to improve the economy. Two main proposals have been put forth to the Congress. The first, favoured by the Partito Socialista Italiano, would focus on decentralising our industry by empowering the various communes throughout the country. The second plan, put forth by the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista, is nearly the exact opposite. It instead would favour creating an organisation called the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) that will organise and guide the syndicates and unions in order to bring prosperity to Italy and its people."

Organised as local militias, they have major support among the local communes that field and equip them. However, with some nationalists seeking to reunify Italy, plans have been put forth to reform the Red Guards into a true Red Army. However, such a plan is controversial for many members of the Red Guards that are highly suspicious of a centralised military apparatus, despite the benefits that it will bring."

northsri.42.t:0 "The Fate of the Pope"
northsri.42.d:0 "One of the first issues on the agenda is what is to be done with the Pope. The Partito Socialista Italiano argue that the government has no business interfering with the Catholic Church, and that the Pope should be left alone. The Unione Sindacale Italiana believe that the throne of Saint Peter's should be occupied by a socialist. Finally, the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista argues that the office of the Papacy is outdated and the Pope should be exiled. What shall be the decision of the Congress?"

northsri.43.t:0 "Internal Policy"
northsri.43.d:0 "The second matter on the Fifth Congress's agenda is how to handle the issue of dissidents in the Republic. Not all within the Republic are accepting socialism, particularly in the areas where the reactionaries held sway prior to the Second Risorgimento. The Partito Socialista Italiano argues for a conciliatory policy, granting general amnesty and focusing on building socialism instead of going after the dissidents. The Unione Sindacale Italiana believes that a propaganda effort to show socialism's progress, combined with a balanced approach to law enforcement, will help change the minds of the dissidents. The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista, for their part, wants to empower OVRA to clamp down on any dissent against the republic. What shall the Congress decide?"

Until the Second Risorgimento, the Republic was focused on reuniting Italy, but now that that goal has been achieved, Italy's political future must be determined. The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista believe that Italy should focus on spreading the revolution to all corners of the world while the Unione Sindacale Italiana believe the focus should be first on Europe. Finally, the Partito Socialista Italiano believe Italy's role is to help nurture socialism within Italy and the members of the International first."

The leading candidates are Comrade Giuseppe Di Vittorio, Alceste De Ambris, Comrade Palmiro Togliatti, and Comrade Angelo Tasca. Who shall be elected?"

northsri.47.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Mussolini!"
northsri.47.b:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Bianchi!"

northsri.48.t:0 "No Majority Achieved!"
northsri.48.d:0 "No faction of the Congress came out on top. The government is deadlocked, and for now, the country is once again thrown into chaos while the leaders attempt to negotiate some kind of compromise."
northsri.48.a:0 "A compromise must be found!"

northsri.49.t:0 "Unione Sindacale Italiana and Partito Socialista Italiano Compromise"
northsri.49.d:0 "In an effort to block the dangerous Unione Nazionale Sindacalista from achieving any kind of power, the Unione Sindacale Italiana and Partito Socialista Italiano have agreed to form a coalition government. Alceste De Ambris will assume the role as president, while Giacomo Matteotti becomes the new Chairman of the Congress of People's Unions."
northsri.49.a:0 "Better than nothing"

northsri.50.t:0 "Prisoner of the Vatican"
northsri.50.d:0 "His Holiness has locked himself within the Vatican, as previous popes did during the days of the Kingdom of Italy. He refuses to acknowledge that [SRI.GetNameDef] rules Italy. However, so long as he is locked within the Vatican, he can do little but make noise. Now, the debate has been renewed: should we just leave the Pope alone to rant and rave, force the Conclave to pick a socialist Pope, or send him into exile?"
northsri.50.a:0 "Exile the Pope!"
northsri.50.b:0 "Make the Conclave elect a socialist priest"
northsri.50.c:0 "Just let him complain"

northsri.51.t:0 "The Papal Conclave Begins"
northsri.51.d:0 "The Papal Conclave has begun! The Holy See shall come together and choose a new pope that shall support Socialism. It may take some time but they will eventually elect a new Pope who will do his part to liberate the faithful from their chains."
northsri.51.a:0 "They shall choose right!"

northsri.52.t:0 "A New Pope"
northsri.52.d:0 "After many days of debating, the Conclave has elected Achille Liènart as John XXIII."
northsri.52.a:0 "Yay!"

northsri.53.t:0 "Exiling the Pope"
northsri.53.d:0 "We have decided that the Pope has no place within our society, and that he shall be exiled. Where he goes, we don't care, but he shall not remain within Italy any longer!"
northsri.53.a:0 "Get out of here!"

northsri.54.t:0 "The Pope Arrives in [Root.GetNameDef]"
northsri.54.d:0 "The Pope has arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] today, seeking refuge from the syndicalists within Italy who have exiled him from the country. A large crowd has already come out to meet the Holy Father. He has requested more permanent residence in one of our cathedrals, until such a time as the Vatican is once more restored to freedom."
northsri.54.a:0 "Stay as long you want, Holy Father!"

northsri.65.t:0 "The Vatican Commune"
northsri.65.d:0 "We have recently concluded a productive meeting with the Pope. A tiny commune will be created around Saint Peter's Basilica called the Vatican Commune that will be independent from the Republic. Meanwhile, he will accept the legitimacy of our Republic and urge Catholics worldwide to do so as well. This marks a great day for the faithful and for the Republic."
northsri.65.a:0 "Thank you, Holy Father!"

northsri.66.t:0 "Revolutionary Irredentism"
northsri.66.d:0 "There are still Italian lands and our Italian brothers and sisters that are held in bondage, and it is time that the Congress take a stance on their liberation. Some suggest focusing on just the ones in Austria, others think that we should focus on them but also include Malta. The Unione Nazionale Sindacalista call for a true Greater Italia to be created as a new light of socialism in the world."
northsri.66.a:0 "Just help liberate our comrades in Austria."
northsri.66.b:0 "Austrian comrades and Maltese comrades both."
northsri.66.c:0 "Greater Italia shall be the light of socialism!"

northsri.67.t:0 "The New Lands"

northsri.67.a:0 "Avanti Italia!"

northsri.68.t:0 "Trial for Reactionary Leaders"
northsri.68.d:0 "With our victory over the reactionary forces, the leaders of the corrupt republic and the "noble" leaders of the despotic kingdoms are standing trial. Some want us to be lenient with them while others want us to be harsh and make an example of them. How shall the court rule?"
northsri.68.a:0 "Lenient. We already have our victory."
northsri.68.b:0 "Make an example of them."

northsri.69.t:0 "What to do with Royal Palaces?"
northsri.69.d:0 "With the conquest of the South, we have taken control of the territory of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and as we bring the revolution southward, the question of what to do about the various noble and royal palaces has arisen. Some think that they should be given over to the local communes, others think that the government should use them for the various ministry positions. Finally, some support the idea of giving them over to the Workers Youth League."
northsri.69.a:0 "Turn them over to the local communes."
northsri.69.b:0 "Make them government headquarters."
northsri.69.c:0 "Make them youth camps."

northsri.70.t:0 "Resistance to Secularism"
northsri.70.d:0 "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our official policy of secularism is causing problems with reintegrating the Italian people into a cohesive nation. The Catholic Church was far more powerful in the rest of Italy than in our republic. Consequently, many people are trying to resist and slowing the progress of bringing the revolution to the rest of Italy."
northsri.70.a:0 "They will learn in time."

northsri.71.t:0 "Non-Interference Policies Help"
northsri.71.d:0 "As we bring the revolution to the rest of Italy, our non-interference towards christianity is proving to be popular with the people and helpful in bringing them to understand the principles of socialism. While there is still quite a bit of resistance among the more dedicated reactionaries, there is less than our strategists expected before the war."
northsri.71.a:0 "Thank 'heavens'!"

northsri.72.t:0 "Land Reform in Southern Italy"
northsri.72.d:0 "Now that we have control of Southern Italy, it is time to bring land reform to the south and bring the revolution to the southern farmers. The package of land reforms prepared by the Congress will collectivise and give the land back to the farmers. Furthermore, local agriculture unions will be created to bring syndicalism south."
northsri.72.a:0 "Break the chains!"

northsri.73.t:0 "Industrialisation for the South"
northsri.73.d:0 "The south was never industrialised to its full potential. However, now that we have control of the south we can begin a program to industrialise the region. This will help improve the lives of the people living there by bringing jobs and development and lowering inequality across Italy."
northsri.73.a:0 "Progress moves south!"

northsri.74.t:0 "Syndicalisation of the Economy"
northsri.74.d:0 "With Italy now united, the question has arisen as to how to bring the syndicalist economy to the rest of Italy. Some think the best way is to focus on building up the unions in the areas. Others think the best way to syndicalise the rest of the country is to focus on collective farming. A third option is worker co-operatives, especially those that serve the military, which could be the key to revolutionizing the new regions."
northsri.74.a:0 "Focus on the unions."
northsri.74.b:0 "Focus on communal farming."
northsri.74.c:0 "Focus on worker co-operatives."

northsri.75.t:0 "New Communes"
northsri.75.d:0 "With the rest of Italy now under our control, new revolutionary communes are being formed throughout the Republic, from Lombardy and Venetia to Sicily and Naples. These communes have become new social centres and bases for spreading the revolution in the areas."
northsri.75.a:0 "Lunga Vita ai Comuni!"

northsri.76.t:0 "Resistance to Social Changes"
northsri.76.d:0 "Since we have united Italy there has been resistance against the various social changes that we have implemented in the Republic since its founding, particularly in the case of women's rights. The changes that we have brought to Italian society will take time, but eventually, the rest of Italy shall accept them."
northsri.76.a:0 "Damn reactionaries!"

northsri.77.t:0 "OVRA help prevent trouble"
northsri.77.d:0 "OVRA have apprehended a number of reactionary traitors to the Republic operating in the south. The Ministers have made sure that no one in the rest of Italy will dare betray the revolution."
northsri.77.a:0 "The Secret Police to the Rescue!"

northsri.78.t:0 "Fasci Siciliani Founded"
northsri.78.d:0 "The original Fasci Siciliani was a socialist movement in Sicily in the 1880s and 1890s. They were eventually crushed, but their legacy was long-lasting; they fought for democracy and socialism and were true revolutionaries. Today, a new Fasci Siciliani has been founded, drawing on the legacy of the old organisation. This new Fasci Siciliani is focusing on spreading the ideals of the republic into Sicily."
northsri.78.a:0 "Long live the Fasci!"

northsri.79.t:0 "Exhibition of the Revolution"
northsri.79.d:0 "In 1919 the Socialist Republic of Italy was proclaimed. However, the resulting civil war would leave Italy divided. Since then, we have erased these false borders, reunified Italy, and brought the revolution to all corners of our country! To demonstrate our glorious victory to the people, a grand exhibition of the revolution and our struggles and losses has been unveiled in Roma. Celebrating the struggle to bring syndicalism to all corners of Italy, it will no doubt help to educate the masses about the revolution and inform them of the glory of a reunited Italy."
northsri.79.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"

northsri.80.t:0 "Women Entering Politics"
northsri.80.d:0 "While women have been legally allowed to vote, work in politics, and sit in the National Congress since the founding of our Republic, it is only now that we have unified Italy that women throughout the whole of the country enjoy these rights. Many women, especially those from the south and the northeast where the reactionaries ruled, are now taking steps to enter politics for the first time in their lives, from local unions and communes to the Congress itself."
northsri.80.a:0 "Great!"

northsri.84.t:0 "Female Red Guard Divisions"
northsri.84.d:0 "With the decision to create the Gruppi di Difesa della Donna, a number of women have formed their own defence unit based out of the city of Livorno. These women have called their unit the Prospero Brigade in honour of the minister who helped create the Gruppi in the first place."
northsri.84.a:0 "We need every man and woman we can get!"

northsri.85.t:0 "The Worker-Priest Movement"
northsri.85.d:0 "The Worker-Priest movement is a movement for the priests of the Catholic Church to help connect to the faithful by working in factories like the laity. The movement is rather popular in the Republic at the moment, and affords the priests the opportunity to connect more closely to the people. Sometimes, sermons can even be heard inside factories and workshops after hours, as the faithful listen to the priests at the end of a long day."
northsri.85.a:0 "Jesus was a carpenter, after all."

northsri.86.t:0 "Christian Associations of Italian Workers"
northsri.86.d:0 "The Christian Associations of Italian Workers, or Associazioni Cristiane dei Lavoratori Italiani (often abbreviated as ACLI), are the largest Catholic lay organisation within the Republic. The goal of the organisation is to help Catholics follow and live in accordance with the philosophy of Christian socialism. Unsurprisingly, the Associazioni are heavily connected with the Popularist Movement and thus more moderate members of the Unitary Socialist faction within the National Congress."
northsri.86.a:0 "Let us follow in the steps of Jesus."

northsri.87.t:0 "Futuristic Architecture"
northsri.87.d:0 "'This is the greatest absurdity of modern architecture. It is perpetuated by the greedy complicity of academies, internment camps for the intelligentsia, where the young are forced to recopy classical models onanistically instead of straining their imaginations to search for solutions to new and urgent problems: the Futurist house and city. A house and city spiritually and materially our own, in which our riotous activity can rage without seeming a grotesque anachronism.' So reads the Futurist Manifesto of architecture. Futurism as an architectural movement has recently been highly popular among the Unione Nazionale Sindacalista. Mussolini, in particular, is a noted patron of architects building in that style."
northsri.87.a:0 "The Future is now!"

northsri.88.t:0 "Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana"
northsri.88.d:0 "The Associazione Ricreativa e Culturale Italiana, or Italian Recreational and Cultural Association, is the largest recreational society within the Republic. Founded in Florence in the 1920s, the organisation is purely secular, and its goal is to help support recreational activities for the people as well as to support solidarity amongst the citizens of the Republic. Culture that was once only the purview of the elites, such as opera, plays, and classical music, are now available for the people to enjoy. Furthermore, the Associazione supports book clubs, countryside vacations, and more through arrangements with local communes and unions."
northsri.88.a:0 "Culture belongs to the masses!"

northsri.89.t:0 "Unione Donne Italiane Congress"
northsri.89.d:0 "'We don't see why the revolution is in the hands of only half the population. We are anarchists, but we are also women and we want to make our revolution. Not have men make it for us. We don't want a struggle designed to fit the male because we'll be screwed, as always. We want to fight so that we can claim our part in the share-out. We want to make it clear that just now we're beside ourselves with joy and it would be a mistake to keep us at home knitting! We want to die! But we want to die like men, not live like servants!' So said Ada Prospero at the annual congress of the Unione Donne Italiane, the largest women's organisation in the republic. The Union's goal is dedicated to women's emancipation and liberation. Ada Prospero, in particular, supports the creation of female combat units to fight for the unification of Italy."
northsri.89.a:0 "We shall see."

northsri.90.d:0 "The 1936-1937 Series A Finale for the Italian football league championship has reached the last round. Torino playing against Bologna. The Bulls against the Greyhounds. Bologna is the clear favourite to win, as they are the current reigning champions; however, the Torino team this year is playing strong. Who shall win the championship for this year?"
northsri.90.a:0 "Who shall win, indeed!"

northsri.91.t:0 "Bologna Wins 1937 Championship game!"
northsri.91.d:0 "It was a close match, but Bologna won with a score of 2-1, remaining as the reigning champions of the Italian League. Naturally, the city of Bologna is celebrating this victory."
northsri.91.a:0 "The Greyhounds remain the champions!"

northsri.92.t:0 "Torino Wins 1937 Championship Game!"
northsri.92.d:0 "In a stunning upset, the Torino team defeated Bologna 1-0. For the first time in just under a decade, the reigning champions were defeated. The city of Torino will surely be celebrating all night after this stunning victory."
northsri.92.a:0 "The Bulls are the new champions!"

northsri.100.t:0 "The Founding of Cinecittà"
northsri.100.d:0 "Benito Mussolini unveiled the opening of Cinecittà today outside the city of Florence. Cinecittà was planned by numerous architects to be less of a film studio and more of a small cinema city. Mussolini himself was quoted as saying during the opening of the studio: 'Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism.'. Many aspiring filmmakers are already speaking with the unions of the area to see about producing films there, while some are already calling it Hollywood on the Arno."
northsri.100.a:0 "Cinema is the most powerful weapon against Capitalism!"

northsri.101.t:0 "Death of Filippo Turati"
northsri.101.d:0 "Today, the great statesman Filippo Turati has passed away at the age of 79 years old. Filippo Turati was one of the last surviving founders of the Italian Socialist Party. His strong and constant support of the rights of the workers of Italy from his earliest days has made him famous throughout the Republic. In addition to founding the Socialist Party of Italy, he was also one of the principal architects of the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Italy. The funeral in Torino was attended by visitors from nations around the world and officials from across the political spectrum, all paying their respects to the late great leader as various labour songs were sung, including Inno dei Lavoratori which he penned himself."
northsri.101.a:0 "The passing of a torch."

northsri.102.t:0 "Maggio Musicale Fiorentino"
northsri.102.d:0 "In the city of Florence, conductor Vittorio Gui has created a new festival called the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, dedicated to performing operas and musicals free of charge for the people so that way the classics can be enjoyed by all citizens, not just the privileged elites. The opening opera for the festival was Giuseppe Verdi's Nabucco. While it is the first of its kind in Italy, Vittorio Gui has stated he hopes that the Maggio Musicale's success can be replicated in cities throughout the Republic."
northsri.102.a:0 "Opera for the People!"

northsri.103.t:0 "Enrico Fermi creates the Pisa Pile-1"
northsri.103.d:0 "Enrico Fermi has recently created the Pisa Pile-1; the world's first artificial nuclear reactor. Created with the help of students from the University of Pisa, the device may have only been capable of generating a half watt of power, but its success proves that a nuclear reactor can be built."
northsri.103.a:0 "Comrade Fermi brings progress for the Republic and for the world!"

northsri.104.t:0 "Enrico Fermi wins Noble Prize"
northsri.104.d:0 "The physicist Enrico Fermi has recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity. Fermi, who has been a professor at the University of Pisa since the civil war, has published numerous works on physics, especially relating to the new field of nuclear physics. With his Nobel Prize, the Socialist Republic of Italy can celebrate another hero of Italy and of Socialism."
northsri.104.a:0 "A hero of the Republic!"

northsri.105.t:0 "Commune of San Marino"
northsri.105.d:0 "The city-state of San Marino is one of the longest surviving republics on the Italian Peninsula. A relic from the city-state era, San Marino has survived for centuries, lasting from the Roman era all the way to the Risorgimento, and even through the Civil War and the Second Risorgimento. It has long been a haven for refugees from oppression. Today, the elections have brought the Socialists into power in the city-state, and the new Captain Regents are working on bringing syndicalism to their tiny commune. They have assured our republic that they wish to remain friends and seek to build bridges between the two republics."
northsri.105.a:0 "Greetings Comrades!"

northsri.106.t:0 "Roma Jazz Festival"
northsri.106.d:0 "With Rome once again the capital of Italy, a jazz festival has been put on by the various musical unions throughout Italy. Jazz has been within Italy since before the revolution, starting in 1904, though modern Italian Jazz draws inspiration from America. The famed American Jazz musician Louis Armstrong is the highlight of the festival."
northsri.106.a:0 "Let us enjoy the new music of a new Rome."

northsri.107.t:0 "Giro d'Italia Refounded"
northsri.107.d:0 "With Italy reunited, the Giro d'Italia can begin again. The Giro d'Italia is a cycling race that began in 1909, but the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and the ongoing political instability in Italy have altogether prevented the race from being held since 1914. The race course goes from Torino in the north all the way down to Napoli and Bari in the south up back to Milan."
northsri.107.a:0 "Let the race begin!"

northsri.108.t:0 "Fausto Coppi Wins the Giro D'Italia"
northsri.108.d:0 "Fausto Coppi has won the Giro D'Italia, setting a new record. At the age of twenty, he is the youngest cyclist to complete the race. His win has also popularized his training regime and his particular diet, which focuses on whole grains where other racers consume large amounts of red meat."
northsri.108.a:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Coppi!"

northsri.109.t:0 "Spartacus is Released"
northsri.109.d:0 "Cinecittà has released the epic movie Spartacus. Telling the story of the ancient Roman slave rebellion leader Spartacus, the movie is by all accounts an epic with a cast of thousands. Starting Gino Cervi as Spartacus and directed by Carmine Gallone, the movie has already proven a success and both with critics and the public at large."
northsri.109.a:0 "I am Spartacus!"

northsri.110.t:0 "Comrade Ines Donati"
northsri.110.d.ines_elected:0 "Ines Donati, a strong supporter of the policies of Mussolini and Bianchi, has just been elected for the rank of general in the Red Guards.

northsri.110.d.ines_promoted:0 "Ines Donati, a strong supporter of the policies of Mussolini and Bianchi, has just been promoted within the Red Army.

northsri.111.d:0 "Comrade Mussolini spoke before a massive crowd today in Rome, declaring that Italy must be purged of all elements of reactionary and capitalist thought, and that the new futurist culture of Italy shall rise from its ashes to build an Italy that is the culmination of the declaration of revolution in 1919."
northsri.111.a:0 "We must cleanse Italy of corruption!"

northsri.112.t:0 "Destroy the Cult of the Past"
northsri.112.d:0 "'With our enthusiastic adherence to Futurism, we will destroy the cult of the past, the obsession with the ancients, and the pedantry and academic formalism that have strangled our society. The past is feudalistic and capitalistic and must be wiped away. The Socialist Republic has no need for the past!' according to a state paper in Torino."
northsri.112.a:0 "The past is gone!"

northsri.113.t:0 "Spontaneous Revolutionary Violence"
northsri.113.d:0 "The leader of the Ministry for Public Security has declared that it will be of no issue if reactionaries are killed by revolutionary violence. This has sparked a wave of violence throughout the country as people engage in spontaneous revolutionary violence against those considered reactionary. When this will be over, no one knows. But the reactionaries shall be purged!"
northsri.113.a:0 "Death to the reactionaries!"

northsri.114.t:0 "Bonfire of the Vanities"
northsri.114.d:0 "In Florence, a massive bonfire was held where citizens threw various 'vanities' considered to be reactionary or capitalistic into the fires. Artwork from before the creation of the Socialist Republic of Italy, books that promoted reactionary thought or un-socialist principles, and household goods deemed bourgeois were also destroyed. This bonfire has been copied by other cities across the republic as many seek to destroy the culture of the past."
northsri.114.a:0 "Destroy the capitalist vanities!"

northsri.115.t:0 "Purging the Reactionaries"
northsri.115.d:0 "A number of the ministers in the government hold rather reactionary views. While they claim to be dedicated to the Republic, we know better. People like Achille Grandi, Giacomo Matteotti, and Giuseppe Saragat are all reactionaries that must be purged! They and others will only corrupt the ideals of socialism and bring back capitalism to the Republic. This will not be allowed!"
northsri.115.a:0 "We shall not be corrupted!"

northsri.116.t:0 "Destruction of Churches"
northsri.116.d:0 "'God does not exist - religion in science is an absurdity, in practice an immorality, and in men a disease.' So proclaims Chairman Mussolini. With that, the attention of the cultural revolutionaries has turned towards Christianity and religion. Churches across Italy have been set upon by Garibaldists. Some have been transformed into town halls, with all sign of them being once a place of worship gone. Even more have been destroyed outright, or laid siege by revolutionaries as devout Christians barricaded themselves in. From the tiny parish churches that dot the towns of Italy to the largest cathedrals in the country, none have been spared. It seems that Comrade Mussolini will not stop until every trace of superstition is destroyed!"
northsri.116.a:0 "Death to superstition!"

northsri.117.t:0 "Technicians in the Country and Bureaucrats in the Factories"
northsri.117.d:0 "The Republic is to not be a bureaucratic republic. However, in the years since its foundation, that has been changing and bureaucrats have been coming back within the government and within the workplaces. In order to make sure that the republic is not bureaucratised, factory technicians and leaders will be made to spend time in the countryside and government bureaucrats will be made to spend time within the factories."
northsri.117.a:0 "Break the chains!"

northsri.119.t:0 "Futurist Food"
northsri.119.d:0 "As the cultural revolution continues, a book called the Manifesto of Futurist Cooking has been published. Its purpose is to ensure that even the daily habits of eating are transformed. The book has some choice words reserved for pasta; 'No more pasta, as it causes lassitude, pessimism and lack of passion,' a position backed up by Mussolini himself, who is quoted as saying 'a nation of spaghetti eaters cannot have a social revolution'"
northsri.119.a:0 "Food of the future!"

northsri.120.t:0 "The Strength of the Army"
northsri.120.d:0 "As the Cultural Revolution continues, the Army has become more and more important in keeping order and stability. However, within the upper echelons of command, some have started to wonder if the methods of the cultural revolution are productive in building a new society and culture for Italy."
northsri.120.a:0 "The Army will protect the revolution, of course."

northsri.121.t:0 "Destruction of Estates"
northsri.121.d:0 "Many noble estates in the south have been destroyed. The lands of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies held a number of noble estates, and the people in the south have finally decided to destroy these estates and make sure that there is no trace of the relics of the old feudal order."
northsri.121.a:0 "Death to feudalism!"

northsri.122.t:0 "Mussolini's Personality Cult"
northsri.122.d:0 "A cult of personality has begun to grow around Mussolini, thanks to his efforts at using his personal charisma as well as the mass media from newspaper to film to make sure that his image is respected and supported. Portraits of Mussolini have popped up in public and private spaces alike throughout the country."
northsri.122.a:0 "All for Mussolini!"

northsri.123.t:0 "Revolutionary Films"
northsri.123.d:0 "To build a new culture, we must destroy the old one. Archaic plays and operas are no longer to be performed. Instead, using the new film industry, a new culture celebrating the revolution and the Republic will be created. Mussolini, in particular, is sponsoring new actors, actresses and directors that will praise the Cultural Revolution."
northsri.123.a:0 "Film will bring about a new culture."

northsri.124.t:0 "End of the Cultural Revolution"
northsri.124.d:0 "Tragically and somewhat mysteriously, Mussolini has died in a plane crash. With his death, Michele Bianchi has assumed control of the Republic. Bianchi has declared that the Cultural Revolution has been victorious and as such, it should come to an end. With its end, he has begun to slowly scale back some of the 'reforms' that were passed during the Revolution, notably the enforcement of futurist food."
northsri.124.a:0 "The Revolution is over."

northsri.125.t:0 "The End of the Revolution"
northsri.125.d:0 "Mussolini has declared in Rome that the Cultural Revolution is now at an end. The reactionary culture that has infected Italy since the Republic was declared is gone. Today, the sun shines on a new Italia, and the violence and chaos that has reigned over Italy has begun to subside. Life has been changed, but the Republic has been made stronger; or at least, that is what Comrade Mussolini says. It is clear, though, that his grip on power is now absolute."

northsri.126.d:0 "We've always had suspicions that there was an underground network of syndicalists preparing for the day when we and [SRI.GetNameDef] went to war. Their numbers are not overwhelming, but their appearance behind our lines is unexpected, and they have caused a fair amount of disruption throughout the country."
northsri.126.a:0 "It will change nothing"

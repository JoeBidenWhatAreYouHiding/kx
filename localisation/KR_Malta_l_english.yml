## Ideas ##
MLT_langaune_question:0 "The Language Question"
MLT_langaune_question_desc:0 "One of the most pivotal questions of the current Maltese political scene, the Language Question, concerns the very future of every soul in the nation. With Malta long being the play thing of outside powers, her own culture reflects that. Influences from the British, Italians, and even the Germans can be felt everywhere one looks. While this has created a unique melting pot of cultures, due to the fact that not one these influences is fully in command, it has also caused great strife, further egged on by Germany's decision to remove English and Italian as official languages and add German to the list in 1930, leaving Maltese and German as the sole official languages of our island and inflaming tensions across the archipelago. All major parties within Malta argue for adopting their preferred major language, so that they can finally put this question to rest. With the rise of the New Sons however, this question, like all things has been put on hold, seemingly permanently."

MLT_republicanismonrise:0 "Pangs of Republicanism"
MLT_republicanismonrise_desc:0 "Since 1921, when Germany first gained control over Malta and restored the Sovereign Military Order of Malta to power over the archipelago, the people have lacked a truly democratic way to express themselves. While the 1930 elections did much to calm these calls for a return to democracy, the sudden rise of the New Sons and their paralyzing effect on the nation practically undid all good that came from it. Even with the New Sons in effective power, these calls for democracy carry on, seemingly as a way to parrot that Malta is not under the control of a sole entity."

MLT_commie_cells:0 "Socialist Cells"
MLT_commie_cells_desc:0 "Despite Malta's overwhelming Catholic and conservative population, some socialist cells within the Labour Party, rumored to have strong ties to the near-by Socialist Republic of Italy do exist. While posing little threat even before the New Sons come to be, if and when the New Sons should falter in their control over our fair isles, they could present a significant risk to our security."

MLT_blind_garrison:0 "The Blind Garrison"
MLT_blind_garrison_desc:0 "Present since 1921 and further bolstered in 1924, the Kasierreich's Malta Garrison has been effectively blind to the true ongoings of our state since the rise of the New Sons six years ago. Keeping the Kaiserreich ignorant with disappearances and bribery, the New Sons have duped the German Empire into thinking everything is function normal on our little archipelago, regardless of how actually paralyzed the local garrison is. Despite their blindness, the Garrison is still our only true defense against the outside world, and should Malta ever overstep, it can be assured that the Garrison would intervene, to protect the Kaiser's Mediterranean prize." 
MLT_sons_of_malta_base:0 "The ''New Sons of Malta''"
MLT_sons_of_malta_base_desc:0 "The ‘New’ Sons of Malta are a contemporary facsimile of the original Independent Order of the Sons of Malta, a fraternal organization similar to the Freemasons that was active during 1800s as a mystic secret society with many prominent politicians and world figures being members of its ranks. A far cry from this noble and harmless past, the New Sons are a group of pretenders - rich, powerful, and well connected men working together to pursue their own selfish agenda on a global scale. Using their vast fortunes and influence, these deluded dreamers have seized control of the archipelago of Malta after Germany loosened its grip in 1930. Since then, this shadowy cabal of cowardly businessmen and spoiled aristocrats have masqueraded as ne'er-do-wells and masterminds bent on freeing their home isles from German control by controlling the strings of the Kaiserreich from its dark underbelly. In reality, the New Sons have only managed to gain a small amount of influence within Germany's FAUD and among her investment banking class,  making their "Grand Plan" seemingly a pipe dream. In short, the New Sons may have been able to fool the naive and the poor citizens of Malta these long six years, but it seems they are destined to exposure and failure. Until then however, Malta is locked in their greedy vice, waiting for the moment that their future comes knocking..."

MLT_to_bring_down_an_empire_desc:0 "The yoke of the Hohenzollern cancer has spread to our once proud islands and now holds us as a playpen for “protection from the syndicalists” when we are little more than another possession of them. But the Maltese spirit is not destined to be chained down. Our order plants the seeds of devastation that will open up the chance for our freedom."
MLT_wild_cat_strikes:0 "Spark Wildcat Strikes!"
MLT_wild_cat_strikes_desc:0 "For the past several years since the end of the Weltkerig, if not even before, the economy of the Kaiserreich has been failing. Be it a stagnant world economy, the crashing of Wall Street, or even just the Reich's own overgrowth, her economy is headed for a recession. While such a thing will obviously come sooner or later, by using our influence within the FAUD to trigger wildcat strikes around Germany, we could push the final domino down, and finally be able to enact our Grand Plan to free our isles!"

While such a thing will obviously come sooner or later, by using our influence with the many investors within Germany, we could spark a round of panic pullouts and buyouts, possibly pushing the final domino down, and allowing us to finally be able to enact our Grand Plan to free our isles!"

MLT_our_chance_desc:0 "Success! The German economy is in shambles, and her empire is at last vulnerable after years of waiting. Regardless if it was our intervention that caused Black Monday, our chance is finally here, and we cannot waste it!"
MLT_the_socialists:0 "Readying the Socialists"
MLT_the_socialists_desc:0 "The Socialists of Malta are far and few between, mostly hidden within the depths of the Labour Party. Regardless of this fact, they still make up part of Malta, and thus part of the Grand Plan. To ensure the Grand Plan's success, we must get the Socialists ready to go on strike, to cripple the Garrison's ability to repair and restock"
MLT_ready_the_revolution:0 "The Revolution on Standby"
MLT_ready_the_revolution_desc:0 "For the Grand Plan to work, the Socialists and their working class contacts must be on constant alert, ready to answer the call to action at any time of day. The Revolution simply must be on standby if we are to have any chance for victory."
MLT_the_knights:0 "Preparing the Knights"
MLT_the_knights_desc:0 "The Knights of Malta have long been the de-facto rulers of Malta since she fell under the Kaiser's boot following the British Revolution. While their numbers are small, and they are not what they used to be, the Knights still hold much valor. While their part in the Grand Plan is small, it is vital, and thus they must be prepared."
MLT_prep_crusade:0 "Awaken the Crusader Spirit"
MLT_prep_crusade_desc:0 "The Knights of Malta have the luxury of being one of the few orders of Crusaders still in existence. With a proven history of connection to the old Kingdom of Jerusalem, many younger members of the Order long to reclaim the Holy Land. By awaking this spirit, by painting the Germanic heretics as simply the first step in restoring Outremer, we can prepare them for the part they shall play in the Grand Plan."
MLT_the_republicans:0 "Frenzy the Republicans"
MLT_the_republicans_desc:0 "The various political parties of Malta, be it the Nazzjonalista or the Kostituzzjonali, are the most important peice of the Grand Plan. While their place in the actual liberation of Malta will be small to nonexistence, the post liberation world is a much different matter. They shall form the basis of our new civilzation, giving the people a true voice with the halls of power, thus they must be frenzied, and ready to act as soon as the time is ripe."

MLT_democratic_mandate_desc:0 "For the second time in Maltese history, truly democratic elections have finally taken place. No longer is the government of Malta something imposed by a foreign power, or enforced by a shadow organization. The people of Malta have finally spoken, and their voices have at last finally be heard. Never again will the people of Malta be governed by anyone but themselves."
MLT_nat:0 "A Nationalist Victory"
MLT_nat_desc:0 "Having been elected in a landslide majority in the elections of 1930, it comes as little shock that the Partit Nazzjonalista secured victory in Malta's second elections. Riding to power on a platform that wishes to codify the existing status quo, the Nazzjonalista strive to protect the Church's place in society and promote closer ties with Italy. The Party also pushes for a hardline against the dwindling British and German presence in Malta, as there is only one true motherland for the Maltese people, Italy. "
MLT_ensure_churches_place:0 "Safeguard Holy Mother Church"
MLT_ensure_churches_place_desc:0 "The Church and the Maltese State have always existed as intertwined entities. The Church commands and the State listens. While this state of affairs was once common throughout Eurupe, since the dawn of the enlightenment, it is becoming less and less the case. In this modern age, only Malta, Italy and perhaps Austria can brag about maintaining the basis of Christendom. To ensure that this Holy and Blessed state of affairs never wavers, the Partit Nazzjonalista has moved to enshrine the Church's place in a newly drafted Maltese constitution. Even despite the wishes of an increasingly secular world, never again shall Mother Church's place be threatened! "
MLT_anti_angloid:0 "Rabid Anti-Anglophilia"
MLT_anti_angloid_desc:0 "The Partit Nazzjonalista is the heir to one of Malta's first political parties, the Anti-Reform Party, which was founded as a way to combat England's attempts to remove Italian and the Church from Malta. Due to this, Anglophobia is within the Party's very DNA. As such, the Party has moved to do away with many of the remaining institutions and laws that were created during England's reign. On top of this, schools shall teach the youth the truth of those Imperialist war dogs that once threatened our great island. By doing this, we can ensure that never again will the Anglo rule Malta."
MLT_what_do_knights:0 "The Final Fate of Malta's Stoic Guardians"
MLT_what_do_knights_desc:0 "For nearly two hundred years, the Knights of Malta had ruled over our fair isle, until their eviction by the Emperor of the French in 1798. Since then, the Order of Saint John had existed in a strange limbo, technically being a sovereign entity, but not controlling any territory. This would come to an end following the Weltkrieg, where Germany would formally reinstate the Knights as the lords of Malta, both as a way to keep the population happy by having Catholic leadership and to be able to keep a strong hand . With the fall of the New Sons and with elections creating a popular government, the Knights, once again, have entered into a state of limbo. While technically still ruling over Malta, since the elections, the government of [MLT.GetLeader] has ruled every aspect of the island. With this being the case, the time has come for the Partit Nazzjonalista to decide just what to do with Malta's protectors."
MLT_a_pious_and_maltese_malta:0 "A Malta Worthy of Saint Paul's Legacy"
MLT_a_pious_and_maltese_malta_desc:0 "Saint Paul himself is the man who brought the faith of Christ to these fair shores. In almost every aspect of our culture, St. Paul is honored in some way. In recent years however, be it due to perfidious Albion, the New Sons or even the Knights themselves, Malta has been unworthy to even whisper St. Paul's name. With the rise of the Partit Nazzjonalista however, this has changed. Malta is no longer stagnant, under the thumb of a great power. Finally, Malta is a free nation, under God. At long last, we are truly worth to be Saint Paul's proudest children."
MLT_nationalistic_democracy:0 "A Uniquely Maltese Democracy"
MLT_nationalistic_democracy_desc:0 "Despite some calls within the Party to do away with democracy wholesale, this cannot be. While we may take a hard stance against liberalism, democracy is still perhaps the best way for us to maintain a popular mandate. Due to this, we shall maintain the democratic process. However, this does not mean that Maltese democracy will be a pure one. Far from it in fact, as if there is one thing that allows the demonic to enter government, it is unfettered access to the ballot box. To ensure that our democratic process does not fall into the Devil's traps, we shall implement various safeguards. While other parties will be able to still come to power, they shall do so under vicarious observation, staffed by clergy of Holy Mother Church. Maltese democracy shall be like no other on Earth, as ours shall be protected by God Himself. "
MLT_march_on_valletta:0 "The March on Valletta"
MLT_march_on_valletta_desc:0 "While coming to power on the back of the democratic process, it is becoming increasingly clear that since coming to power, factionalism and divide within the party has grown a thousandfold. While the causes for this factionalism are practically endless, under the leadership of [MLT.GetLeader], it is clear that the largest cause is democracy itself. For if one could lose their power by not constantly making promises, by changing the platform to appeal to the masses, factionalism becomes evident. Due to this, [MLT.GetLeader] has declared that democracy can no longer stand. Deciding that the easiest way to end democracy is by way of self-coup, the Tal-Ġakketta Blu has been ordered to march into Valletta and arrest oppositional leadership and dissolve their parties. By the end of the day, the Maltese state shall be the Partit Nazzjonalista, and the Partit Nazzjonalista shall be the state"

With the youth wing in power, the government has moved to make the Tal-Ġakketta Blu an official arm of the state. By granting these already ex-policemen power to enforce the law once again, we can ensure the people of Malta truly live up to the example the Party wishes them to.

Due to this, the Party under the Youth Wing has entered a period of mass disunity, over which ideology is fit for Malta.

While most who conquered Malta usually allowed this state of affairs to remain, as it made controlling the islands much easier, under our restored British mandate, this cannot stand. The Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon, and its controlling Malta is a paramount to demonic possession. Thus, we must destroy the Church's hold over Malta. While not all within the Constitutionalist Party take such a strange stance on the Church, the Party is united on the desire to birth a truly secular Malta, free from the chains of the past.

In wartime, many civil liberties were suppressed in the name of fighting the Kaiser. Even for those few years after the Great War before the revolution, a sense of 'normal' was never reached. During the strikes that led to the Revolution, the strikers were suppressed, not talked with. This is the lesson of Imperial Britain, that a nation must never forsake their liberties if they wish for their state to continue. As Malta deals with its own labor issues, we must take the lessons of Britain to heart. We must act with compassion and empathy, and not strike while the iron is hot.

To this end, with approval from the Crown, [MLT.GetLeader] shall suspend the constitution and dissolve parliament. In their place, a new 'Emergency Council' shall arise to lead Malta. The Emergency Council shall be made up of representatives from every party, and shall remain until either the Church backs down, or is destroyed in its entirety.

However, officials from the Church have approached the government, claiming that if we tone down our rhetoric, and lift some of our more gracious policies, then they shall lift the injunction. While it will mean compromising with perhaps our greatest public enemy, if we do not agree to compromise with the Church, our entire goal of fighting for democracy would prove to be in vain.

The Church, ever looking to preserve it's power, in the name of saving souls, opposes great reform, with the local clergy even once declaring voting for different parties as an act of sin that debases the nation's unity. Seeing any reforms in any direction as a step towards Socialism, it is no wonder that the Labour Party has done so poorly, especially as its two main leaders bicker over the status of the Church while still supporting the faith. However, unlike many reformers in wider Europe, Maltese Reformism is much different. The Labour Party of Boffa stands hand-in-hand with the Church, working to create a free and equal Malta under God's Light, while Mintoff works to keep the faith alive and well while removing Church influence. Thus, one of our first official acts simply must be the universal application of Catholic Social Teaching to law.

Any person, be they female or male, regardless of religion, over the age of 18 shall be granted the right to vote. By doing this, not only do we ensure that the entire populace can have representation, but by being the ones to grant the vote, we can expect even more political support, something the Labour Party is in desperate need of, despite our victory."

Within Paul Boffa's faction of the Party, not wishing to rock the boat and viewing it as a chance to ensure relations with the Church, believe that the Knights should be kept, acting as a sort of constitutional monarchy. Others, most vocally from the Radicals, wish to see the Knights once again evicted from Malta, with a true Republic being declared in their stead.

With our electoral victory and with Boffa wishing to work with every party in reach, Labour leadership has decided to investigate the claims of Socialist infiltration.

Indeed, even as we took power ourselves, the Knights attempted to wrest control of the State from us. However, even despite this, we have proved the doubters wrong.

Thus, the government under Mintoff shall begin a program of de-clericifying the Maltese state. While we shall not go as far to declare a secular state just yet, for that would be a bridge too far at this point, we shall begin building walls between Church and State while working towards the secular dream.

Thus, by direct order of Dom Mintoff, various heavy industries and the entirety of the Grand Harbor shall be placed under state control, along with a directive to begin looking to find the best way to nationalize more of the economy.

Just as Chirst said to love the poor and treat them with respect, we finally have. No longer will a man go hungry simply because he did not make enough to pay for food and his rent.

While we do not mean to subject the Greeks to an unjust government, they already toil and suffer under one that rejects God, thus we have the reason we need to recreate one of the many lost Empires of Christendom.

By having most major legal work done in the German language, it comes as no shock that German also was added on top of the melting pot of languages that call Malta home.

With the ascension of the radical wing of the Knights of Malta, this will no longer remain the case.

While borders and administrations have changed in the 300 years since then, the current Maltese state is the direct heir of the Knights. Thus, as we begin looking into the world, why not attempt to reclaim what was once ours? To do this, we shall simply offer a fair price for these islands. After All, it's not like the various global empires that control them will miss them right?

As it happens, the Federation has been dealing with a massive wave of unrest, no doubt spread by the Syndicalist Communards in an effort to liberate their brothers in the Caribbean. Regardless of the reason for the unrest, the Leewards are also a hotbed for this activity, thus our government has declared that in an effort to aid the Federation, we could buy the islands off them. By offering a fair price, few doubt that we may just be able to reclaim a once lost part our nation with no bloodshed. "

While we are separated by an entire ocean, these islands and our own home islands shall become two peas in a pod, sharing a unique culture that will be a unique fusion of Maltese and Caribbean elements.

Before European relief arrived and forced the Ottoman Turks into a shattered retreat, Malta held for four months with 6,000 brave souls. In order to ensure that such an initiative is once again championed by any foe that may make such a similar mistake in invading Malta, another line of defense will need to be established. An independent Maltese navy will form the basis of this line of defense. This will ensure that no enemy combatant steps foot on our shores. However, whatever limited shipbuilding facilities or dockyards within the Grand Harbor that we possess are inherited from British efforts prior to the Weltkrieg.

To make matters worse, the garrisons have had difficulty procuring new equipment and supplies due to the limited budget of the Maltese military. The garrison is, however, updated to match contemporary standards by obtaining weapons from other nations.

In preparation for plausible amphibious landings against Malta, bunkers will be built on the shores and doctrines will be prepared and intensely drilled.

We must also be aware of our limitations and act accordingly, understanding that our soldiers' lives are of the utmost importance. Our officer corps has already begun learning amphibious war doctrines to avoid bloody waters on foreign shores during any beach assault. In addition, they will have the proper equipment needed to minimize casualties and succeed in their mission. Amphibious warfare is not the only means we can use to gain a upper hand on our enemy, but also vertical envelopment - death from above. Jumping out of an airplane is one of the safest things a man can do, provided he follows proper procedure. The Air Wing has already started several experiments concerning deployment from aircraft, seeing large success with an initial batch of volunteers.

The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 also greatly benefitted Malta with the Mediterranean becoming the "world highway of trade", not to mention that we were already a base of operations for the British Mediterranean Fleet and a coaling station for vessels sailing from beyond the Canal. However, at the dawn of the 20th century, Malta found its former prosperity declining worryingly as ships switched from coal to oil and grew in size. This has led to the rate of port calls in Malta shrinking, as we can no longer accommodate these ships with our facilities. As a result, we must start looking at expanding the economic sector to gradually shift away from our reliance on the port - there have been several suggestions but expanding our maritime facilities, nurturing a tourist economy, and even banking are the most prevalent ones."

This is also the first significant step to allowing us to slowly rebuild our economic prosperity. We have also acquired private investors from surrounding nations to finance these efforts. This has allowed us to begin the process of constructing upgraded jetties and docks to further enhance the efficiency of our ports, enabling them to receive larger vessels.

This will limit the strain placed on local farmers for the time being. We must also develop long-term strategies to increase our agricultural production capacity to some extent and secure our food supply for the future, as conflict looms on the horizon. To stockpile wheat and other grains, we will contact nations such as France, Italy, and Ukraine to determine whether agreements can be reached to aid us in our precarious situation.

However, the rising radical faction led avowed Socialist Dominic Mintoff has seen skyrocketing support, and now poses a serious threat to Boffa’s long standing dominance. More concerningly, these ‘Radikali’ have been reported to not even be true Labourists at all, instead being infiltrators from the various Socialist and Syndicalist cells that stalk Malta, though these reports have been from our contacts in the SMOM and it is not known if we can truly trust them. Driven on in secret through funding from Socialists in Italy, these Radicals have long duped their partymates, and now may even have the power to seize the Labour nomination. With the final tally of the internal elections being counted, it is only a matter of time before the decision is made and the party’s fate is sealed.

Priding themselves on Catholic conservatism and tradition, they are supported by much of the traditional and rural population, as well as being supported through foreign channels by the Italian Federation and the Pope, they are led by Enrico Mizzi. Their main opponent are the Knights themselves, whose Sovereign Military Order of Malta has long been the lords of our archipelago, but have lost respect over the years due to their bending to Germany and their ineffectiveness in stopping the New Sons of Malta. Should this faction of the Party win election, it is likely the Knights would simply use the mandate to fully instate themselves into absoulte power. The darkshorse candidates are from the ‘Radikali’ - a group of radical and young Nationalist who holding their love for Malta and the Lord above all, they are led by George Borg Olivier.

Both seeking returned ties to the Entente and the British Crown, the groups mainly differ in their economic and social policies, with the Liberali being more progressive and populist, and are led by Mabel Strickland, daughter of Gerald Strickland. The Konservatiivi are far more concerned with the free proliferation of capitalism, though both are still rather conservative by any moderate metric, they are led by Gerald Strickland.

mlt.8.d:0 "The small but stalwart archipelago of Malta has a long and storied history of constantly falling under the sway of different foreign powers. Whether it be the Sicilian Arabs of the long-gone Emirate or the French and British who both had their time as lords over this paradise within the Mediterranean, the islands rarely have been allowed to live their own way, and when they have, it was usually under the watch of the historic and heroic Knights of Malta. \n\nHowever, the Knights have fallen far from grace, and now largely exist as pro-German sycophants - a husk of their past power save for the few circles of radicals that still cling to the old ways. Led by the 76th Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere-Albani, the SMOM, long existing in a state of exile, were reinstated by the Kaiserreich as a means to both have a strong hand and to keep the Catholic population happy, as to keep the Grand Harbor running without issue. Allied and heavily backed by the Kaiserreich and its new Maltese Garrison, the Knights ruled as a soft military government while Germany mainly uses the islands as an airstrip. This military government largely held on unopposed on the surface, but across the underground of Malta, Republican protests and Socialist agents worked to undermine their rule at every turn. Meanwhile, a highly secretive group of disenfranchised Maltese businessmen and aristocrats formed the so-called New Sons of Malta. Pulling the strings from afar as they amassed their wealth and power in secret using a variety of dubious and black market methods, the New Sons sought to drive Germany from Malta at cost, all from behind the scenes. \n\nThis scheming came to a head in late 1930, when the Kaiserreich, unaware of the growing local racial tensions, decided to allow the native Maltese to form a civilian government underneath the Knights’ watch. Despite the local Nationalist-Conservative party, the ‘Partit Nazzjonalista’, winning the local elections, their rule was quickly and completely undermined when the New Sons of Malta finally played their hand. Appearing from the shadows like phantoms, they moved unseen, working with blackmail and extortion, bribery and assassination, to completely cripple both the German-Knights coalition government and the newly elected Partit Nazzjonalista cabinet, effectively freezing Maltese politics. With this secret society of elites and mysterious financiers seizing power over Malta, they have managed to rule for nearly six years, duping the German delegation and Berlin the entire time. \n\nHowever, the New Sons are far from secure in their rule, for after funding from their respective favored Italian factions and from the New Sons themselves in a bid to destabilize the German Garrison, the Democratic parties and Socialist cells within Malta have gained great power. Worse yet for them, a radical wing of the Knights which wishes to see Jerusalem reclaimed, have started to grow in popularity and Germany has begun to catch on to the New Sons’ plot, despite sedition acts passed by their puppeted façade government sending panic and disorganization through the archipelago. With these tensions rising, and the Republicans increasingly more vocal in their desire for new elections and an end to the clearly fake government’s charade, it would seem that time is ticking for the New Sons, and Malta shall soon be free to choose its destiny once again."

Devoutly Catholic, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and ever chivalrous and stalwart, this knightly military order has faded into and out of prominence for centuries, but once again finds itself thrust into national prominence as the New Sons and their coalition collapse. Viewed by some as traitors due to their ties with the Kaiserreich, the SMOM is fiercely dedicated to Maltese nationalism and the preservation of our archipelago, declaring adamantly that their cooperation with Germany is purely seen as a necessity to preserve Maltese culture and the survival of our people. Preaching for a pious and stable Malta tied to the German Empire, the front-face of the Order hides a more independent, illustrious, and possibly deluded secret faction that holds far greater aspirations for the archipelago tied to former and long-dead glories. Regardless of their obsession with the past and that they possibly harbor far more dangerous zealots and radicals within their ranks, the Order is wholly devoted to protecting Malta in perpetuity, no matter the cost. Once the German Garrison is forced from the island in accordance with the Great Plan, the SMOM will once again play their party to ensure Maltese independence, for they are planned to become the main military of the nation, and regardless of their political aspirations, there they shall serve admirably in the defense of the nation, though we will have to keep tabs their deep ties to the Partit Nazzjonalista. No matter the outcome of the Grand Plan, the Maltese people can always rely on these knights in shining armor to save them."

Coalescing under a provisional government until the first elections can be organized and held - if and only when our gamble pays off, the current democratic scene is mainly divided into three camps: Partit Nazzjonalista, Partit Kostituzzjonali, and Partit Laburista. \n\nThe Partit Nazzjonalista is a right-wing, conservative, and nationalist party that is divided into three subfactions all vying for influence: the Ċentristi who are mainly moderates split between either preferring cooperation with Italy or maintaining full independence, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta who seek to bring measured military rule Malta while maintaining ties to the Kaiserreich, and the Radikali - a faction that seeks to restablish a strong and Maltese state, arm-in-arm with the Church. \n\nThe Partit Kostituzzjonali is the main liberal party of Malta, forming the middleground of the democratic process.  Split between a more capitalistic Konservatiivi faction and a more progressive Liberali faction, the party still largely agrees that cooperation with the Entente is the best way forward for Malta, and has pursued close ties with the Algiers Regime and Canada. \n\nThe least cemented camp is the Partit Laburista, which is currently caught in an internal rift the party hides from the public and its supporters. Paul Boffa leads the base of the party as a champion of European-style Social Democracy and non-Syndicalist labourite policies, but his position has been slowly eroded away by the Radikali led by Dominic Mintoff and Carmelo Borg Pisani. These Radikali have surged to prominence due to a large influx of funding coming from the Socialist Republic of Italy - something our organization has been hard at work to ensure, and have begun to steal supporters from Boffa’s labourites in an attempt to quietly seize the party. \n\nTogether, these varied groups make up the republican elements of Malta, and with these desperate democrats in our hands, the Grand Plan is sure to succeed."

Led by Dominic Mintoff, an avowed Christian Socialist taking inspiration from Italy’s Alceste De Ambris and Giacomo Matteoti, and Carmelo Borg Pisani, a Maltese nationalist who greatly amires and seeks to emulates Bennito Mussolini’s Totalism while also pulling from Italo Balbo’s ideas. These ‘Radikali’ seek to infiltrate democracy and tear it down from within. Though much of the nation remains unaware of these rats and their vile plot, Paul Boffa and his labourites currently are engaged in political war for the soul of the Partit Laburista and possibly for the fate of the nation. Despite their current goals and feud with the Labourites, these Socialists still have a part to play in the Grand Plan, and with our guidance and additional financial assistance, they too shall help our gamble pay off."

Across the Kaiserreich, bastions of German influence falter to native unrest and seditious activity, usurping our colonial mandates and military garrisons in the far reaches of our Empire. \n\nOne such region using this time of instability to their advantage is Malta. A group calling themselves the 'New Sons of Malta' have used their considerable fortunes to rally the local Maltese political factions under a shared banner in a semi-cohesive and barely-cooperating coalition aimed at toppling our  garrison that has held the islands since the fall of the British Empire. Though these ‘New Sons’ have vast amounts of wealth at their disposal, their influence has been vastly drowned out by the swelling tide of Maltese nationalist and nativist sentiments that have consumed the archipelago, and their ‘rule’ over Malta shall soon and assuredly fall to one of the myriad of local political factions that have temporarily set aside their differences to free their islands from our grasp. \n\nDespite being an important naval and air base for the Kaiserreich, Malta serves no larger or necessary purpose within our empire, and with Black Monday still ravaging our economy, we are in little position to stop them.

However, this situation has spiralled out of the control of the New Sons, for the very movements they once funded have swelled to be both uncontrollable and no longer beholden to these bored rich men masquerading as a secret order. \n\nShortly after the German flag was torn down over Valletta, so too was the shadow order of the New Sons, with their identities revealed and their surviving members forced to flee the island lest they face retribution. Our Malta, now freed from the grasp of both the Hun and the New Sons, is now free to pursue its own destiny, and with the ever tumultuous political landscape of our small archipelago now free to blast off in a new direction, our newly freed nation and people now stand at a crossroads as the coalition created by the New Sons collapses nearly as quickly as it formed.

These so-called 'New Sons' however, were unable to secure their rule and collapsed just as quickly as Malta it's gained freedom.

While not directly linked to founding of the great Crusader Kingdoms, our order was founded within the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and we are perhaps one of the last vestiges of that long-dead Kingdom to still exist. This fact has lead many within the order, especially those in the younger generation, to yearn for a return to the old order, one in which Catholicism and Catholic Kings and Princes ruled over the Holy Land. Having ties to the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece and viewing Austria as the one power that may actually support such a rival, this grouping poses little actual threat to the Order of St. John as a whole. Despite this, due to the fact that the Order is the undisputed master of Malta, their presence could possibly lead to disunity in the future.

The government of [MLT.GetLeader] was silent on this coup attempt until roughly four hours after the last arrest. In a short speech, the elected leader of the nation declared that Maltese democracy had come to an end. Citing everything from the Bible to an alleged plot to struggle the democratic process by sections of the Labour Party, [MLT.GetLeader] laid out a series of constitutional changes that would be implemented posthaste. In essence, the Maltese political structure is to be replaced by a Party-Government structure. In other words, Parliament shall be abolished, and the Nationalist Party and its leadership shall alone rule our fair isles. Along with this, the Church’s position as the ‘spiritual head’ of Malta with the Bishop of Malta being granted a token amount of temporal authority. \n\nWith this sudden change in the political structure, placing the Nationalist Party alone at the head of Malta, many within the Party have begun to wonder if perhaps the time has come to a new face to lead us.

Some have also called for us to appoint the Bishop of Malta,  Maurus Caruana, and his future successors as our head of state. By doing this, not only would we ensure that the Church remains at the head of our society, but we can also ensure that our state does not drift from moral government. Even if the Bishop was made our temporal leader, the General Council would still act as the government under him, making him little more than a figurehead.

This is not to say all tension is gone from the isle however, as the aura of the Opera house feels downright electric, as whilst the congress has remained professional, with the trade unions that have different allegiances letting differing viewpoints speak their minds as to their vision of the future of our island, the now quite obvious factionalism feels quite worrying. The unions and more labour minded christian groups have put their backing and tally votes towards Dom Mintoff, who has been trying to champion them in the democratic system, even with the knight’s heel holding his popular efforts down. The worry stems from their opposition, the charismatic vanguard figure of Carmelo Borg Pisani, who took a much more upfront view to combating the reactionaries on the island. Having been the leader of an underground resistance cell outside of his public apparatus as an artist of the futurist variant, he has utilized the printing press to spread inflaming material during the knights reign, and the totalist charter to our dock unions, something that now during the congress, we have seen unions aligned to Mintoff having challenges to leadership by disgruntled members, swayed by Borg Pisani.

mlt.26.t:0 "A Direction for the Futurist State"
mlt.26.d:0 "Chairman Borg Pisani is a man who ponders much in his time of governance, and his hobby of making art for a new age. But recently, whilst sitting at his office chair, he has been most perturbed, let alone pressured whenever he reads a new letter received from allies in Naples, or from his loyal supporters who came with him from Italy to Malta that constantly petition him to put Malta’s resources to a wider use. He owes a gratitude to his totalist tutors back in Italy, for when studying there, he had grown infatuated with the Italian Red Army which had been forced to yield the north and hold onto a hostile south, yet despite all that, the tutors in the state universities had taught him idealism alongside his passion for art, and so when Mussolini had begin spreading the idea of a futurist state, one where the culture of the nation was propelled forth into something new and utopian. It was this upbringing that had brought him back home to Malta with Italian veterans in tow, where they began an underground resistance in the dockyards, and while he could not join Mussolini to sign the totalist charter in London, he had spread its declaration through backchannel onto the isle. But in his time of studying, both back in the folds of Naples with the newly founded futurist ideals, and whilst here, learning the culture of Malta and its fused culture as it stands as a gateway between the Arab and European world. His tutor Mussolini had constantly written about throwing away the shackles of old cultures and forming a new identity and pride to go off of, but it was the very agents of mussolini now lobbying him to bring Malta into Italy’s fold. Meanwhile, even his former contender Dom Mintoff had spoken of the need to lean Malta towards the Arab identity of the south, rather than the consistently imperialistic Europe. Certainly, Malta does not lack a connection to those Arabs who had some of the first socialist foundations created, as its hub in the mediterranean had been consistently used for piracy against European empires. Whatever the motivation, Borg Pisani is gathering quite a migraine while disputing these two ideas in his head, and now he must decide where his motivations lie, for these motivations will rock the foundations of Malta into whatever he envisions."

mlt.26.b:0 "The ideals of futurism call for a newly formed identity"

mlt.27.t:0 "A Focus for the State"
mlt.27.d:0 "It is an understatement to say that it would be a balancing act trying to grant welfare, worker’s compensation and union projects on the state’s agenda all at once. Dom Mintoff had of course willingly stepped into these shoes to do such a miracle act in the first place, but now he is confronted by a problematic matter that cannot be done by budget management or promised future dates, as this problem has two very conflicting pathways. The more fishery and farming based trade unions on the coast have begun requesting further investment into their trades as they provide such a huge block to the daily sustenance and diet of a Maltese citizen. Their requests have garnered the support of our more green minded laborers as well, who have formed a block around these petitions due to simple opposition to the second formed powerblock. That block being the unions that support further buildup of factories and steelworks on the island. Beginning in a way to guarantee work for these unions memberships that are based centrally on the island, but rapidly snowballing into a sense of pride in their smokestack workplaces, Union bosses from this block have begun parodying slogans that could be expected from English or American Appalachian miners, that being a worker covered in black soot after a days work, is a happy worker. The conflicting matter between these two partisan union blocks is the fact that on such a confined space of an island, these two very different categories of industries just cannot co-exist, For with the necessary safeguarding of Aquaculture, and the ever expanding pollution of factory blocks, these two labour groups just seem to step on each others toes. Now, only one can be selected to be the chosen of the State, as that industry will be granted funding, and of course, the permission to develop when faced with the defeating prospect of withering away."

mlt.28.t:0 "The Red Corsairs" 
mlt.28.d:0 "Whilst Malta may have lost its icon of the knights who stood sentinel of the isle, it has gained some new heroes of the proletarian masses on the island. These heroes are those corsairs that have begun striking out from the isle, using fast boats and highly professional tactics (skills that some speculate originate from the elite body of the disbanded knights)to board and seize vessels throughout the mediterranean. The shock assaults and daring maneuvers have surprised the quiet and previously peaceful seas, as now these skillful pirates under the red banner of revolution have performed impressive feats. From directly striking at bustling harbors where they can capture even more plunder from the stored goods on the piers, to direct strikes unto Entente and German military vessels, where our red corsairs have shown a particular venom towards the imperialists who had a influence upon our island, yet did nothing to lift any of the workers from poverty. These redistributors of the high seas have gained much acclaim here at home, where when they return from a successful nautical voyage, they spread the goods to the population. The mystery of these pirates who leave and return with shared plunder is making the waves in a literal sense, as now all in the sea learn of the name ‘blackheart’, and can only speculate as reports of legions of these corsairs venture out of their blackstone coves. Some of the more cowardly of our government have voiced concerns about bringing the wrath of larger powers unto our isle by giving such open love to these pirates that originate from here, but what must we fear when our shores are guarded by such revolutionary elites?" 
mlt.28.a:0 "Many a Imperial ship has been sunk by these Red Corsairs"

mlt.29.t:0 "The Red Knights of Malta" 
mlt.29.d:0 "Today, the tiled streets and busy cornerstones of Malta rang out to the lockstep of boots and a drummer’s tune. But rather than what the workers feared to be a resurgence of archaic knights marching to a foreign whip, they were shocked by the greeting of the Sovereign Order’s banner, now accompanied on its weave by a red star. The Knights barracks and monastery’s now blare internationalist songs from their trumpets, while glass panes of Jesus and Saint Paul of Tarsus among others replace the old kings that reigned over Malta and the crusader kingdoms. The radio cries out with announcements from the Prime Minister's office, where the change was announced concurrently with the knights reveal parade. These are Malta’s new guardians. The ones who had stood guard over Maltese customs for so long have not been tossed aside with the revolution, but given new heart as they can be reformed into the life-aid’s of the masses, who shall embrace proletarian ideals alongside their love of the isle’s identity. The once tight order has been opened up to the public, where any good laborer who wishes to become a sentinel of the people’s struggle can now join them, although that does not make entrance any easier. The demand for them to remain an elite corps militarily, and highly prestigious in the ceremonial aspect has meant the tough screening remains, blocking out any quiet quitters weak of will." 
mlt.29.a:0 "Our values remain, now with a red tint"

mlt.30.t:0 "The Extent of German Cooperation"
mlt.30.d:0 "It has come to light that deliberate efforts aimed at undermining Malta's sovereignty have been underway, with reports indicating collaboration between the self-proclaimed Knights of Malta and representatives of the German Kaiserliche Marine. Shockingly, these arrangements have granted German authorities significant rights over facilities in the Grand Harbour, effectively shifting the power balance on the island. The presence of German sailors and marines has led to a de facto takeover, with the island's economy now heavily reliant on their wages. The autonomy and independence cherished by the islanders are at stake, prompting the Maltese government to take corrective measures to reaffirm their sovereignty. However, these actions might be too little, too late, as any opposition could trigger a bloodless coup, ultimately leading to a German occupation of Malta."
mlt.30.a:0 "Malta will prosper under the guiding light of the Kaiserreich!"
mlt.30.b:0 "Malta will preserve its sovereignty through the protection of the Kaiserliche Marine!"

mlt.31.t:0 "Direction of the Crusade Effort"
mlt.31.d:0 "For the first time since the Spanish reconquista or the Hussite wars in Bohemia, we stand at the threshold of a new Crusade aimed at reclaiming the Holy Land. This is not to be taken lightly, as it will taken an significant amount of manpower and equipment to ensure our success, as our faith through God alone will not ensure our victory in this day and age. However, as most Crusader Kings have done, it is important we must act nobly and seek papal endorsement and the support of other faithful nations. We can also shoulder this burden under our own initiative, and seek assistance through other means, but not in a heavily reliant manner. While the latter option would restrict us, it means that we have a lot more leeway in our actions taken in preparation and during the crusade"
mlt.31.a:0 "It is better to seek the guidance of that who speaks to God, to ensure that what we do is ordained in His favor!"
mlt.31.b:0 "Approval or not, the liberation of the faithful will occur!"


mlt.32.t:0 "The Loyalists"
mlt.32.d:0 "While we may have done away completely with any form of direct civilian involvement with our government, that is not to say we have completely cut off the people from having a voice. Upon coming to full power, all Parties that wished to remain legalized, were forced to swear an oath of allegiance. Both the Labour and Consitionalist parties refusing to take this oath. Indeed, only one of Malta’s major political forces actually did swear by the required oath, that being the Nationalists. While far from fully waking to our tune, the Nationalists, as they have in the past., have proven themselves a worthy ally. Thus, with us wishing to still maintain some semblance that we are listening to the people, the government has concocted a plan. The Nationalists shall be granted a seat at the table, breaking bread with us as they aid the Knights in ruling Malta. By doing this, not only will we gain a direct line to the people, but we shall be rewarding one of the most loyal allies we have had since being restored onto Malta following the British Revolution.  "
mlt.32.a:0 "Cheers to our allies!"

mlt.33.t:0 "Malta in the Empire?"
mlt.33.d:0 "The Government of Malta has approached us with a most curious proposal. They have submitted a request to formally join the German Empire as a Constituent Kingdom, similar to how Luxembourg joined the Kaiserreich after the conclusion of the Wektkreig. The Kaiser, while reportedly thrilled by the scheme, has faced resistance from some within the Bundesrat, who caution that admitting Malta as a constituent kingdom may destabilize the fragile balance within our legislature. There are also those who urge caution in integrating such a distant land with its own distinct culture. "
mlt.33.a:0 "Malta shall be as German as Bayern or Saxony!"
mlt.33.b:0 "Do you even know where Malta is?"

mlt.34.t:0 "Germany Aggress!"
mlt.34.d:0 "Delightful news, the Kaiser has officially accepted our proposal to join the German Empire as a Constituent Kingdom. The process of integration has already begun, as new seats are added to Germany’s legislature to account for Malta. Similar to Luxemburg’s admission after the Weltkreig, Malta shall become an integral part of the Kaiserreich, sharing a status with other German Constituent Kingdoms such as Saxony or Bavaria."
mlt.34.a:0 "Malta shall become a key piece in Germany’s puzzle."

mlt.35.t:0 "The German Empire Refuses"
mlt.35.d:0 "While the Kaiser was reportedly enthralled with the prospect of Malta joining the German Empire, the German Legislature has proven to be much more weary on the matter. The official reason given for refusing our proposal was the ‘insurmountable effort needed to integrate the distinct society of Malta into the greater German Empire’. As of now, it seems the prospect of Malta joining the German Empire is dead in the water."
mlt.35.a:0 "Unfortunate."

mlt.36.t:0 "Conflict over Rhodes"
mlt.36.d:0 "As we grapple with resurfacing echoes of our past grandeur, an unexpectedly disconcerting threat has emerged from Malta. Ironically, the focus of apprehension centers around the Island of Rhodes, where these persistent Crusader Kings plot a reconquest of what they claim is their birthright. While many in Istanbul have dismissed the menace posed by this ancient and weakened order, grave concerns persist due to the current crises that afflict our nation both from external borders and within. This unsettling reality implies that in the event of an invasion, our long-neglected garrison may be inadequately prepared to withstand such an assault and may ultimately surrender. Rhodes' local administration has urgently appealed for reinforcements in manpower and resources to bolster the city's defenses. However, this endeavor demands substantial investment, a commitment many hesitate to make. This predicament could lead to a political setback should the city face an attack and the Knights capture it."
mlt.36.a:0 "Allahu Akbar, These infidel Christian dogs will once again be felled by the might of our armies!"
mlt.36.b:0 "Rhodes is too close to peninsula - we will not allow it to fall!"

mlt.37.t:0 "A Siege Thwarted"
mlt.37.d:0 "It has become evident that the garrison at Rhodes presented a formidable challenge for our valiant infantry. In a scene reminiscent of the Entente landing forces' ill-fated attempt at Gallipoli, our own efforts to establish a secure foothold and entrench ourselves have faltered. The Rhodes garrison adeptly utilized outdated coastal batteries from the previous Weltkrieg to effectively thwart our advancement toward the harbor in the dead of the night. In addition, local militias systematically harassed our landing parties across the surrounding countryside, further complicating our progress. Consequently, our forces had no choice but to withdraw and regroup, leaving our initial plans to seize Rhodes in disarray. Despite our unwavering endeavors, we found ourselves incapable of breaching the fortified defenses of the Rhodes garrison. This unfortunate outcome has resulted in significant losses of both equipment and manpower. A pressing concern is the potential for a retaliatory response from the Ottoman fleet in the Mediterranean. In response, we have initiated diplomatic efforts through intermediaries to mitigate tensions and foster improved relations to the best of our abilities."
mlt.37.a:0 "They played us like a damn fiddle!"

mlt.38.t:0 "A Stronghold in the Eastern Mediterranean"
mlt.38.d:0 "Through subterfuge and careful landing, we managed to seize Rhodes without substantial losses! Maltese saboteurs and engineers successfully penetrated Rhodes' old fortifications! Under the nose of Turkish sentries, disabled antiquated coastal batteries that surely would’ve prevented the main landing force from entering the harbor. This daring and well-coordinated operation not only neutralized the immediate threat posed by the coastal defenses but also allowed our main landing force to establish a foothold on the island with minimal resistance. Maltese forces quickly secured key strategic points within the city. With the element of surprise on our side, we have gained a significant advantage in the ongoing battle for control of Rhodes. The seizure of this island has opened up new opportunities for our operations in the region and boosted our overall strategic position. As we consolidate our gains and establish a firm presence on Rhodes, our focus now turns to fortifying our positions and preparing for potential counteroffensives from Ottoman forces."
mlt.38.a:0 "Pro Fide Pro Utilitate Hominum!"

mlt.39.t:0 "Sicily under Attack!"
mlt.39.d:0 "This morning, an unsettling development has occurred. Reports indicate that Sicily has initiated a revolt against our authority, worsening the already precarious state of the peninsula. Despite earlier beliefs that ongoing crises triggered by governmental inaction and mafia influence were transient, the situation has escalated dramatically. This is due to the formal declaration of Sicilian independence in Palermo. To compound matters, reports reveal the involvement of Maltese officials and soldiers in aiding these rebels in capturing key ports, towns, and villages across the region."
mlt.39.a:0 "We are in no position to provide any form of resistance - better we let them have it for now and strike when the time is right…"
mlt.39.b:0 "Sicily is strategically important - send a naval force and mobilize the reserves immediately to ensure that it does not fall!"

mlt.40.t:0 "The Seizure of Sicily"
mlt.40.d:0 "The Sicilian gambit has proven successful! Disguised as fishermen and collaborating with members of the Sicilian mafia and rebels dissatisfied with the current government, a group of our operatives has managed to seize control in Palermo. Although this endeavor carried significant risks, given the potential for patrol boats or sentries to intercept the force, it appears our efforts have borne fruit, as Sicily now proudly flies the Maltese flag! It only makes sense that Sicily is reunited with Malta, the Maltese being descendants of Sicilians anyway."
mlt.40.a:0 "Treasures of the Mediterranean united under one banner!"

mlt.41.t:0 "Sicilian Neckties"
mlt.41.d:0 "In what can only be likened to a tense Mexican standoff, our invasion of the island of Sicily has encountered significant obstacles. Our landing force faced interception by garrisons from a nearby town, catching us off guard. To compound our troubles, the contacts within the mafia, whom we believed we had successfully bought off, unexpectedly appeared on the scene. Their demand for additional payment further escalated the situation, throwing our plans into disarray. Eventually, after a tense moment of silence, a firefight erupted. Once the smoke had cleared, virtually no survivors remained, leaving the ghastly scene for local villagers from the nearby town to discover the following morning. The incident has escalated into a diplomatic crisis, as not only the mafia is demanding compensation for the death of their men, but the local administration of Sicily has initiated communication with the mainland to investigate the perpetrators of the incident. All fingers point back to us, necessitating swift action on our part to salvage this situation and avoid further deterioration of the already precarious circumstances."
mlt.41.a:0 "Ensure that the dead Maltese soldiers are passed off as local rebels, and cut our contacts with the mafia!"
mlt.41.b:0 "Stage a full-scale invasion of the island - bring me the heads of these mafiosos!"

mlt.42.t:0 "Malta Seeks an Alliance"
mlt.42.d:0 "It seems that a relic from history has approached us, expressing a desire for a pact in our ongoing war against the Ottomans. Our agents in Cyprus and other locations have conveyed encouraging reports of local secessionist movements and rebellions. Malta, a nation that has declared a crusade against the Ottomans, is now interested in potential cooperation with us for the reconquest of the Holy Land. As part of this collaboration, a substantial amount of territory in Asia Minor and the surrounding islands would rightfully be available for us to claim."
mlt.42.a:0 "Once More Unto the Breach!"
mlt.42.b:0 "The last time a crusade called that involved us, our capital was pillaged!"

mlt.43.t:0 "That’s Greek to Me"
mlt.43.d:0 "It appears that the Maltese delegation sent to communicate the interest of a mutual assistance pact between the Greeks and Maltese has ended with no fruit to bear. The Greeks, seemingly interested in only reclaiming its rightful cores, has denied any sort of desire to be involved with the Maltese crusade, even if a large portion of Asia Minor is up for grabs."
mlt.43.a:0  "Unfortunate, perhaps we should seek allies elsewhere?"
mlt.43.b:0 "Thrace and Macedonia will then act as the perfect bridge to razing Istanbul - even if it costs a few Greek lives!"

mlt.44.t:0 "Restoration of the Latin Empire"
mlt.44.d:0 "With the fall of the Hellenic state to our forces, the time has come to correct an old injustice. Ten years prior to the Fourth Crusade, which sacked Constanoiople, and spelt the doom of the Byzantine Empire, the so-called Massacre of the Latins occurred. In this massacre, almost the entire Catholic or ‘Latin’ population of Nova Roma was killed, their only crime being that they were loyal to the pope. While this event was not directly responsible for the bloody crimes committed during that so-called Crusade which killed the last vestige of Rome, it has left a lasting impact on Western Christians, who study the history of the Schism and the Crusades. While this horrid injustice was never truly answered for, the Fourth Crusade did establish the so-called Latin Empire, in what is now Greece. With us once again pushing to reclaim the Holy Land, and with the refusal of the Greek authorities to listen to reason, the time has come to reestablish the lost Empire. All of the lands of the Greeks that we own, shall be transferred to this restored Imperium Romanum,  and all rightful Roman lands we gain shall be transferred to them. To sit upon this restored Roman throne shall be none other than Kaiser Karl, saintly King-Emperor of Austria-Hungary. The title of Latin Emperor was willed to Charles of Anjou, the most senior living descendent of Charles being Kaiser Karl. If the new Latin Emperor ever truly sees his Empire is of little concern to ours, as the government shall be staffed with loyalists, who shall work towards the conversion of Greek lands to the One True Faith."

mlt.62.d:0 "It has come to our attention that the island-nation of Malta, formerly a neutral state, has recently launched into aggressive maneuvers in the Mediterranean. One such shrewd maneuver is the seizure of our rightful territories of Gibraltar and the Balearic Islands. It appears that these moves have been backed by the Kaiserreich, and thus opposing them would bring on the wrath of the German Empire itself. Sabre-rattlers within the Cabinet demand war, and have already summoned the German Ambassador to explain himself for Malta’s actions. The German Ambassador however has played dumb and stated that the actions of Malta are outside of German Awareness. Nevertheless, he has also stated that any attack on Malta would be treated as an attack on the entire Reichpakt."

mlt.63.t:0 "What to Do with Armenia"
mlt.63.d:0 "As we begin to make our preparations to strike against the Turks in earnest, an intriguing proposal has reached the upper echelons of the Order. While we have already done much to obtain allies in our glorious conquest, we are still left with few friends that could directly aid us in our mission against the Ottomans. However, that is not to say that none exist. Armenia, long a subject and oppressed nation by the Ottomans, has recently gone through a slew of Revolutionary activity. While technically no longer existing as a nation state besides on the fringes of border mountains, the Armenian people are clearing, readying themselves for rebellion against the Turks. With this being the case, many within the Order have begun to wonder if we should reach out to them. We could very easily gain ourselves an ally, should we simply offer them a place at the table when we carve up the Ottoman turkey. While this could win us an ally, a majority of Armenians belong to the schismatic Orthodox Church, which could lead to strife in the future."
mlt.63.a:0 "We cannot risk working with a rogue, Orthodox, nation."
mlt.63.b:0 "We need any help we can get..."

mlt.64.t:0 "An Offer from the Order"
mlt.64.d:0 "Today, a cloaked messenger arrived at the halls of the Armenian government-in-exile, which has existed within our borders since its inception. The messenger brought an offer, from the Order of St. John, which has recently pivoted in a radical anti-Turkish direction. In short, the offer would grant the Armenian state a massive increase in land, should they only offer to aid the Knights in their conquest against the Ottomans. While an intriguing offer for sure, our spies are unsure if the government in exile accepted the offer or not. In anycase, we must be on the lookout, for if a Knight from Malta can find those rebels, surely we can as well."
mlt.64.a:0 "The government in exile covertly accepts Malta’s offer."
mlt.64.b:0 "The government in exile refuses Malta’s offer, not wishing to bend the knee to foreigners any longer."

mlt.65.t:0 "Armenia Agrees!"
mlt.65.d:0 "Incentivized by the possibility of greater gains through our mutual cooperation, it appears Armenia has agreed to formally align with Malta in the common goal of fighting the Turks, and ensuring that Armenia is restored to its status as a sovereign nation. In this united front against our common adversary, our collaboration holds the promise of not only liberating Armenia from the grasp of the Turks but also ushering in an era of renewed sovereignty, stability, and prosperity for the Armenian people."
mlt.65.a:0 "The great schism between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox faiths will unite to complete the holy task of purging those heretics off the face of the planet!"

mlt.66.t:0 "Armenia Says No"
mlt.66.d:0 "Although fighting against a common enemy and the incentive of a greater conquest to reclaim lands wrongfully taken from them, Armenia has denied the prospect of cooperating with us to ensure that both of our war efforts are conducted successfully. This is believed to be due to Armenia only wishing to reclaim its sovereignty and core territories but nothing more than that to not anger any Turkish reprisals."

No longer shall a humble Christian, the Levant, the Balkans, or the entire Mediterranean tremble in dread before this enduring scourge that has persisted into the 20th century. With the territories we've rightfully reclaimed and those we've liberated, we will initiate an offensive against the Turkish peninsula and all other Ottoman holdings, decisively severing the head of this predatory beast once and for all."

mlt.68.t:0 "An Offer from Malta"
mlt.68.d:0 "We have received news that the Maltese have broken their streak of neutrality and are working to unite the Mediterranean under a single banner. They have formally requested Sardinia’s participation in the project, and have suggested the use of force if we refuse to do so. This threat, while thinly veiled, has made many consider taking part in their project (with a decent few in the Cabinet going off about the potential upsides to a united Mediterranean compact). Of course, Sardinia has the might of the Entente behind it, and we would most likely have little trouble disposing of a few Maltese troublemakers."

This island, while at times uppity, is an instrumental part of the French homeland and has proven invaluable in preparations for reclaiming the Metropole. The lump sum offered for the island is more than generous, and there is little doubt that these funds could greatly help our strained coffers and aid in our reclamation of France proper. However, if it's enough to persuade us to give up such a vital territory remains to be seen."

mlt.78.d:0 "As we continue to work towards creating and fostering a new, Mediterranean identity for the people who now call our Federation home, the ugly question of Religion has reared it;s ugly head. While Malta and the western Islands of our Federation are mostly Catholic, the islands to our east are majority Orthodox. Due to this situation, many are beginning to wonder just what the Federation’s policy on religion shall become. According to de facto Maltese law, the Catholic Church is already practically an arm of the state, even if on paper we have a separation. With the Orthodox now becoming a large portion of the population, simply maintaining State Catholicism may just cause no small amount of unrest within these lands. Thus, many have begun calling for Orthodoxy to be adopted alongside Catholicism as the twin religions of the Federation. Others, more progressive, members of parliament however are calling for us to adopt Secularism on a Federation level. WHile these seculars are fine with the islands themselves adopting a state religion, on a national  level, they claim, we must be neutral as to avoid a collapse of the Federation. "

mlt.79.d:0 "The echoes of battle have subsided, and the aftermath of our triumph over the Turks presents a complex dilemma. The question now arises: how do we carve up this turkey? Three distinct courses of action have emerged, as the Order debates the future of the Turkish state. Some voices argue for a more direct hand, suggesting that we establish a mandate over the conquered land. This mandate would oversee the well-being of the population until such time as they embrace the Catholic faith. Only then,would the population be granted full freedom and self-governance. The proposed leader of this mandate is the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, Antonio Anastasio Rossi. This approach, while it ensures a Catholic Turkey, will no doubt cause resistance from the locals. Secondly, we could establish a free, albeit controlled, Turkish state under our watch. Being granted autonomy and the ability to govern themselves to a degree, the Turks may come to not view us as such an evil invader as they currently do. Finally, we could simply cede the lands to our Hellenic allies. Greece has long dreamed of exacting vengeance on the Turks, and we are in a perfect position to do just that. Besides just granting Greece the right to revenge, we would also be pushing the ‘Turkish Question’ onto them, leaving us free to focus on the Holy Land. As the Order grows ever deeper in debate over the Turkish matter, it is clear that…"

mlt.80.t:0 "Fate of the Status Quo"
mlt.80.d:0 "Since the Ottoman take over in Jerusalem, a concept known as the ‘Status Quo’ has been a fact of life for the various Christiian sites within the city. In essence, the Status Quo states that unless every single domination that has a stake in any given church agrees to a change, it cannot occur. While this has broadly kept the peace, it has also caused a period of stagnation, exemplified by things such as the so-called 'Immovable Ladder’ which has remained in place for three hundred years. While this so far has remained the case, even with our reclamation of the Holy Land for the One True Faith, many are starting to call for its end. Afterall, why should we share power when we alone have reclaimed Jerusalem for the Church? While it is a loaded question and concept, now is the time that we could finally end the horrid system, and return total control of the Holy Land to the Church, once and for all. "

The question on everyone's minds is whether the Governor-General should be a figurehead, content with nominal exercises of royal authority, or whether they should play a more active and leading role in the government.\n\nTraditionalists argue that the Governor-General should remain a symbol of the Crown's presence in Malta, upholding a long-standing tradition. Under this approach, the Governor-General would focus on ceremonial duties, representing the King's authority during official events, and embodying the continuity of British-Maltese relations. Critics of this approach suggest that such a role might limit the Governor-General's ability to address pressing issues facing the Dominion.\nAs the decision looms, the future of Malta's governance remains uncertain.

This 'Puerto Rican Eggnog' now bears the distinctive mark of Maltese influence. The rich tapestry of flavors from both cultures has resulted in a delightful fusion of taste. The tropical notes of the Caribbean intertwine with the essence of Maltese ingredients, creating a refreshment that encapsulates the spirit of this cultural convergence. Along with this, local business have begun to thrive under Maltese control. A prime example of this is the Soggy Dollar Bar. Nestled in the heart of the Virgin Islands, the Soggy Dollar Bar stands as a testament to the crossroads of Maltese and Caribbean heritage.

With its origins rooted in the Caribbean's laid-back atmosphere, the bar welcomes patrons from both worlds, new or old. Here, tales are exchanged, laughter is shared, and a sense of unity blossoms as individuals from diverse backgrounds come together to celebrate life.  exchange of customs, flavors, and stories ignites a sense of unity that transcends borders.

Small independent pirate towns and other nautical autonomies styles on old ventures like the pirate haven at Havana or the famed Libertalia have popped up across our new holdings as all things pirate from rum-running (and drinking) to raiding becoming all too common in the Caribbean Sea once more.

Originally born as two simple brothers in Greece, Kheir-ed-din and Aruj eventually converted to Islam and lived a life of adventure and piracy before finding themselves stranded in Malta after their ship took damage, finding safe harbor in the natural refuge that has since grown to become the Grand Harbour. Realizing the wonder of nature they had found and the great strategic importance it could possess, the brothers worked to create Malta’s first artificial dockyard in the cove’s safe waters, which then served as their shelter and the hub of their corsair operations for years to come. We must raise Kheir-ed-din and Aruj as true folk heroes of Maltese history and our past and future as dominant naval powers. Creating statues in their image across the Port of Valletta while expanding its operations in their name, we shall create the Malta-based thalassocracy that Kheir-ed-din and Aruj always dreamed of."

mlt.98.d:0 "Despite our slide into a pirate-based economy and culture that pulls on the slave-fueled utopianism of the Qarmatians and on the profitable barbarism of the Barbary Corsairs and the Cilicians, that does not mean that we are savage criminals, for we have a code of ethics and laws, a privateering code, a guideline on who can be enslaved and who cannot, and an ideological thoughtform to follow that preaches utopian socialism delivered at the back of our sails. However, it would seem that not all of our new privateers got the message. Reports have flooded in from all across Malta and the wider Mediterranean, telling tales of sanguine violence and base savagery committed at the hands of pirates and coastal raiders sailing under our flag, tainting our noble and utopian thalassocracy with the plague of selfish criminality as these traitors and leeches that sap on our legacy commit gutless acts in order to self-serve their own ambitions instead of providing for the masses in a Robin Hood-esque fashion as we dictate and as our loyal privateers truly do. Should we reign in these rogues and put them to the sword to ensure a sense of ideological purity while lowering the risk of retribution from our foes we plunder and enslave for the good of Malta, or shall we allow these upstart captains and buccaneers live their chaotic and violent lives as they please no matter the cost or chance of repercussions, so long as they pay their fair share to the government?"

Formed mostly by ex-police officers who wished to see their homeland protected, the militia has grown rapidly since then. Be it providing security durning official events, to ensuring that the enemies of the Party are kept at bay, when it comes to a strong arm, the Nationalist Party could not have asked for better parents. Since coming to power, the Blueshirts have effectively been used to ensure the Party program is carried out in it’s fullest.

Olivier, due to his fiery speeches and devotion to Malta and her people, was hand picked by the victorious Nationalist Party following the 1930 election to serve as a cabinet member. While he was unable to do much with his position due to the New Sons effectively freezing Malta, he was still able to increase the power and respect of the Radicals. Now in power, Olivier shall do anything and everything he can to defend the Church, Malta and the Family, no matter the cost. "

His own father, Fortunato Mizzi, was the founder of the Anti-Reform Party, one of the first political parties to exist in our society. In essence, both Father and Son share similarities. Both are pro-Itlaian and both are in favor of protecting Holy Mother Church and her place in Maltese society. In a very real way, politics is the bread and butter of the Mizzi family. Indeed, even Prime Minister Mizzi’s own son, born in 1927, is expected to take up the family business when he comes of age. Although the lad is only a little past nine, he allegedly has already been given basic political tasks by his father. It seems that in the Mizzi family, politics is business.

WIth us making good on our promise to fight the power of the Church, this move comes as no small shock. While it shall make governing the nation much harder, by drawing a line like we have, we can know where our potential allies in the political sphere lay, and where our enemies are as well. This move by the Church shall no doubt come back to bite them, as they have taken the guesswork out of much politicking.

Recognizing his past service to the old British Empire and his current service as lord protector of Malta and the loyal scion of Entente operations in the area, the British Empire in exile in Canada has moved to name Gerald Strickland as a true baron, titles and position within the House of Lords and all - a marked and historical step-up from his pre-British Revolution position in the House of Commons. A true aristocrat in the eyes of the English Crown at last in addition to his current position as a Maltese count make Baron Strickland one of the most decorated and respected men in the nation, both at home and abroad.

From Australasia to Malta, Strickland has done service in the name of good and honest conservative governance, and now back at home and in control of Malta’s destiny, we truly could not be in better hands. By his hand, a conservative and sovereign Malta that cares for her people and puts their needs first while still walking arms linked with the Entente shall reign by mandate of our noble and unconquerable people."

An unflappable conservative with a progressive streak when it comes to social issues and the expansion of human rights, Mabel Strickland got her start as an esteemed journalist and newspaper proprietor before she rose to take her father’s place as Prime Minister of Malta by mandate of the enlightened masses. Not wishing to rock the boat too hard, Mabel shall adhere largely to the platform her father put in place, with the addition of a focus on women's rights and modernizing social progress so that our conservative efforts may survive the scrutiny of the global stage we now find ourselves on."

mlt.107.d:0 "While the Constitutionalist Party presents itself as a balkwark of unity and justice for the remaining Anglo-Maltese, this is far from the case. With internal division is indeed far from threatening to split the Party, it does exist in spades. The largest of these factions of internal discontent are the so-called Progressives. While still advocating for much the same as the Orthodox line, they differ strongly on two key issues. Firstly, they hold to what they call ‘Dominionism, not Integrationism.’ In short, they wish to be united with England, yes, but not directly integrated into the United Kingdom. While the Party itself is silent on the question of integration, the Progressives are clear in their demands. They also hold a much more progressive view on civil rights. While all within the Party wish to get Malta on the same level as England as far as rights are concerned, the Progressives want to go further, adopting many parts of Labour’s old program, before the dissolution of that old party. In any case, the Progressives are by far the largest nonOrthodox faction within the Party, and represent the most leftist of currents among the Anglo-Maltese.   "

Furthermore, the Boffa doctrine further calls for cooperation with the Entente and their exiled imperials over the Germans that once oppressed our people and the Internationale that seeks to breed nothing but chaos, while creating an autarky-focused economy with a vastly expanded industrial sector, all to reach Boffa’s envisioned end goal - a modern and industrial welfare state in Malta allied with Ottawa and supported by a special relationship with the Papacy. \n\nCalling other more radical Labour leaders like Dom Mintoff full-blown syndicalists stalking about behind a sheepish facade as they try to infect Malta with the poison of internationalism, Pawlu Boffa promises to put all these foul forces to rest as he and his Labour government work with the Catholic Church and the Entente to bring true salvation to the masses."

Shifting government funds away from certain sectors of lessening importance in our modern Malta like our dwindling agrarian sector that has largely shifted to only producing a few specific and locally sourced produces and luxuries like tea, fruit, and incense shall be siphoned towards Boffa’s new government taskforce aimed at modernizing healthcare across the nation. Passing new legislation for a single-payer universal healthcare system modeled on the program created by Canadian progressives in the CFF within Alberta and Saskatchewan like Albert Ernest Archer and Tommy Douglas, while also funding the new creation of free clinics, hospitals, doctors offices, pediatric centers, and more, Boffa’s Labour government shall ensure that Maltese citizens get some of the best, most modern, and most affordable medical care in the world."

Furthermore, centers of higher education like the University of Malta shall be expanded while new ones shall be constructed in other parts of the nation, ensuring that the next generation of Maltese leaders and experts shall be more educated than any generation before them. However, as we have moved to usher in this new wave of educational reform modeled on modern Entente standards and practices first pioneered by the British and French, our allies within the Church and its leading hierarchy have come knocking for their just due. Having aided us in our goals of spreading Labour reforms to all corners of our nation, even in the most conservative and traditionalist of neighborhoods, all thanks to the undeniably massive influence of the Papacy and the wider Church, these theologians have now asked for their price. Though we have already granted them many new freedoms and privileges, the Church still desires more as they practically demand a say in our public education initiative going forward as to ensure our teachings remain in tune with their Godly scripture. Although this flies in the face of secular standards within modern Western education, Boffa relies deeply on Church support to make his Labour government have any authority in this deeply conservative land. Should we allow the Church to influence our new initiative, or should we ignore their demands, risking backlash?"

Pulling on ideas first championed by his late contemporary, friend, and fellow architect Andrea Vassallo, Malta shall see a new age of architectural beauty supported by various styles like Neoclassicism, Rococo Revivalism, Neo-Gothic, Art Nouveau, and Neo-Romanesque to create a pristine and beautiful new Malta that pulls from the past while taking lessons from modernity, starting with Mintoff’s planned renovation of downtown Valletta.

In his pursuit of a comprehensive welfare state and a partially-nationalized economy free of corporate interests, Mintoff has utilized authoritarian and backhanded measures at the worst of times, sidelining the democratic government and the rest of Labour in order to pursue his own interests while secretly inciting political violence and mass unrest in order to distract his opponents and give him all the justification in the world to utilize harsher tactics. Although his rule has seen one of the largest jumps in the standard of living in our nation’s long history, it has been achieved through less than scrupulous means, weakening Mintoff’s position within the eyes of many - though it is not like it matters with the sheer command and influence Mintoff now wields.

While these claims have been proven false by both endless paper trails and basic common sense, there is still no shortage of nutcases who still believe that the influence of the Sons goes far deeper than previously thought. These people have successfully lobbied the Malta Police Force to dig deeper into the New Sons conspiracy, raising their headquarters to finally get to the truth of the so-called ‘Conspiracy’\n\n While these theorists were originally overjoyed by the formal investigation, their curiosity has turned to dismay as the truth of the New Sons has emerged. The cold hard truth is that the New Sons were nothing more than a disorganized band of hooligans whose success in freeing Malta from the Iron Cross can be attributed to nothing more than pure luck. What little influence they held outside of Malta can be attributed to a stunning web of incompetence within the Abteilung III b and the German Police.\n\n While the myth of an all-encompassing conspiracy around the New Sons can be safely disproven, there is no shortage of deranged ruffians who will continue going off about the ‘true’ depths of the conspiracy."

mlt.116.d:0 "Once a devout Catholic and Church ally working with the rest of Labour under the Pope’s watchful eye, and once a sucker for the British Empire hellbent on getting Malta accepted in Great Britain itself as a distinct constituent national entity on the same grounds as Scotland, Dom Mintoff has gone through a political evolution in the strangest of ways to the positions he now founds himself championing. After accusing the reactionary-infected Papay and wider Church hierarchy in Rome and abroad of attempting to excommunicate him and his Labour allies over their radical views and distaste for the Italian Federation, Mintoff turned his back on the Church he so loved, but never faltered in his devotion to God, leading to the strange form of pious secular we now champion. After this move and the collapse of the British Empire to the might of revolutionary furor, Mintoff ditched his pro-Entente ideas for a deep appreciation of Socialist Internationalism and revolutionary ideology over failed reform. \n\nHowever, instead of turning to isolationism or another European power like those in the Third Internationale, Mintoff instead came to the realization that Malta must reconnect with its roots and return to good standing within North Africa and the Arab world instead. Striking up friendships with Leftists and Liberals throughout the southern and eastern Mediterranean like Michel Aflaq, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Şevket Süreyya Aydemir, Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu, Burhan Belge, and more while beginning to work with anti-reactionary Pan-Arab groups, Mintoff believes Malta’s only hope for a future in which its own needs are met with the help of outside powers is with these new Muslim allies, going so far as to promote Arabic over English and German throughout the nation while spreading these pro-Arab anti-European ideas to other fringe Leftists in Malta like Carmelo Borg Pisani.

However, despite his move back to his home of Malta, Carmelo Borg Pisani never stopped being a loyal adherent to Mussolini’s ideology, even continuing his career as a spy for his mentor as well. Now ruling as Reise of his own National Syndicalist state, Borg Pisani has kept this lifelong expertise of espionage alive and well, creating the Servizz Nazzjonali ta' Informazzjoni tal-Poplu (National People’s Information Service) to serve all of the Revolution’s informational warfare needs, with Borg Pisani himself serving as Chief Spymaster.

Maltese Leftism has a tenuous relationship with the Pope and the wider Catholic Church to say the least, with our broad ‘coalition’ of Leftists being largely broken up into three main groups. The first group is simple - they are dominated by Borg Pisani’s Totalists and wish for one thing only, being the complete and total eradication of the Papacy in its entirety beginning with the public execution of the Pope and his Cardinals. The second group, and by far the largest, is mainly headed by Dom Mintoff’s radical Labourites who wish to create an autonomous ‘Vatican City’ within Rome in order to give the Papacy their own independent state while getting them out of Italian political affairs once and for all. Finally, the smallest faction is led by Pawlu Boffa and his moderate Labourites, who as the only Maltese Leftists still loyal to the Church wish to work with the Pope by creating a system in which the Pope acts as a unifying figure presiding over the democratically elected government in a realization of the dream the Italian Federation failed at building.

From this lofty height, Reise Borg Pisani shall rise to become the all-powerful captain of Malta, unmatched by all and untethered by any other authority - earthly or heavenly - as he begins to run the nation like a tight ship in order to achieve a perfect national revolution and the syncretic cultural reformation we have tacked onto it.

Instead, all one needs to do is apply. Providing you are a Catholic in good standing, there is no reason why you will be denied entry. While this reform shall take time to implement, it will no doubt prove usefully. Malta is already lacking in manpower, and The Knights even more so.

The Order of St John, known as the Bailiwick of Brandenburg, forced out of the Hospitaller since the Reformation for its Protestant views, has been immediately united back with its Catholic counterpart, with the Kaiser being granted the title of 'Protector of the Hospitaller Order' in the process. This move has granted the Lutheran Kaiser an equal footing over the future of the Order, with the Bishop of Rome himself. For the time being, this shall have little consequence, as the Bailiwick of Brandenburg has been forced to accept Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere as Grandmaster. While he may protest, there is little that the Pope in Rome can do, however, as already Protestant Knights have begun to flood the island of Malta in an act of reunion, and all seem wary of a violent conflict. Confronted with the changing reality, His Holiness's objections stopped before they could spill into excommunications, and while the newly built unity between our Catholic and Protestant brethren is uneasy due to this hierarchical upset, the island remains at peace."

They wish to see our glorious Grandmaster depart for our shores, replaced by one of their own number. By far the most popular choice for a replacement to our glorious Grandmaster would be one Wichard von Alvensleben. A noble by birth, Alvensleben is a deeply religious man, who has done many great works of charity for the People of the Empire. Along with this, he hails from the House of Alvensleben, one of the oldest, albeit Protestat, German noble houses. Opposed to Wichard, those who wish to see the Grandmaster leave hold that the old commander of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg, Prince Oskar himself, should be chosen to lead the Order. Already having held the position by virtue of election, the son of the Kaiser would be the perfect choice, if not for the fact that he may alienate the Catholic majority of our new island home. In anycase, the Order has a while elect to ignore these calls, the growing pains will no doubt subside in time, as Catholic and Protestant work together for the betterment of the Order, and the People. "
mlt.124.a:0 "Elect Wichard von Alvensleben to lead us into the future!"
mlt.124.b:0 "Prince Oskar, free of any other duty, is a share fire choice."
mlt.124.c:0 "Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere is doing fine!"

mlt.125.t:0 "The Charitable Hand of the Master"
mlt.125.d:0 "While the Order of St. John was founded as an Order for the running of hospitals, in recent years, this aspect of our mission has fallen behind. Not helped by being appointed to once again rule Malta, the Grandmaster has declared that even if we cannot fully embrace our calling, we must still make an attempt at it. Thus, a directive has come down that an entire third of our treasury is to be used for charitable acts. Be it opening soup kitchens, providing for housing or even simply helping to repair buildings around the world, funds from the Order of Malta shall make it happen. While it is costly, for the better of souls and to fulfill our mission as Knights, no price is too high."
mlt.125.a:0 "Tuitio fidei et obsequium pauperum"


mlt.126.t:0 "A Seat in Rome"
mlt.126.d:0 "Prior to Germany restoring our control over Malta following the Weltkrieg, the Knights of Malta existed in a strange state of limo. Technically speaking, the Order continued to exist as a sovereignty entity, even if it held no direct land. At least this is what we were in the popular consensus. In reality, we held and continue to hold a small number of buildings in and around the Eternal City. Granted to us by the Pope or purchased over time, these buildings acted as the sole place that Knights of Malta existed as a sovereign state. Since being restored to Malta, we have kept hold of these buildings, although a few have been transformed into embassies for the Maltese state. In any case, should the Order ever need them for whatever reason, these buildings shall continue to serve as a bastion of the Order, if we hold Malta or not."
mlt.126.a:0 "An interesting case."


mlt.127.t:0 "The New Templars"
mlt.127.d:0 "As we work to restore ancient and dead Orders that once called the Holy Land home, one that we as of yet had to work towards were the Knights Templar. By far the most popular of the Crusading orders, the Templars ceased to exist following then being branded heretics by the Pope. While not all of the Templars died out, and groups such as the Military Order of the Christ the King were founded out of the ruins of the Templars, the actual group itself is long dead. However, this shall no longer be the case. The  Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon are to be reforged, and shall become the most elite of our brother orders. While it will no doubt take time to fully reestablish this once glorious order, it shall no doubt be worth it. The Templars were always the best of us, and we shall do what we can to rebuild them to their former glory."
mlt.127.a:0 "May the Father of Understanding grant us aid in this endeavor!."

mlt.128.t:0 "Winning the Pope's Ear"
mlt.128.d:0 "It appears that our attempts to reach the ear of His Holiness has proven fruitful. A Cardinal and member of the Order of the Holy Sepulcher has told us in private that he will personally take our case for a new Crusade directly to the Pope. While this news is great and glorious, it is only the first step. Even despite this, the fact that we have taken the first step in the first place is no doubt a sign of Providence that shortly we shall march for Jerusalem. After all, there’s no way the Pope could refuse us right?"
mlt.128.a:0 "Deus Vult?"

mlt.129.t:0 "A New Crusade?"
mlt.129.a:0 "Today, a Cardinal has come to His Holiness with a strange request. The Knights of Malta, whom the Cardinal is acting as middle man for, have begun undertaking preparations to reclaim the Holy Land from the Ottoman Turks. In this effort, they have attempted to covertly contact the Pope in hopes that he would support their efforts, and call a new Crusade, justifying their own actions. While such an idea is outlandish, to simply call a Crusade would mean little. There is no need for us to directly get involved. Besides, the Order of St. John has always been something of a headache, and this may be a perfect chance to be rid of them. As the Cardinal finishes his speech and leaves the Papal offices quickly, His Holiness quickly decides too…"
mlt.129.a:0 "...call a new Crusade."
mlt.129.b:0 "...refuse to sign off on a suicide mission."


mlt.130.t:0 "The Last Crusade"
mlt.130.d:0 "Early in the morning, from atop St. Peter’s Square, His Holiness [ITA.getleader] has officially declared the state of a new Crusade. Calling it on behalf of the Knights of Malta who have been making preparations to strike for Jerusalem, the Pope has declared that nothing will stop the Church until Jerusalem has been reclaimed. Reactions to this news have been greatly mixed. The Ottomans, the target of this Crusade, have called it a grave injustice and have sworn to do all in their power to stop these Crusaders. Others have simply shrugged it off, declaring it simply a strange move by the Holy Father. In any event, it would appear that the Catholic Church is once more at war with those who hold the Holy Land."
mlt.130.a:0 "Deus lo Vult!"
Mlt.130.b:0 "A Crusade? In this day and age?"


mlt.131.t:0 "A Quiet Rejection"
mlt.131.d:0 "Much to the dismay of ourselves and our allies, it would appear that His Holiness has flatly rejected our request to call a Crusade. While refusing to call a new Crusade, which could threaten the fragile balance of peace, His Holiness has blessed our mission personally, which he says is the best he can do. While a sad outcome, perhaps it is not unexpected. After all, the days of the Church commanding vast armies is over, and to simply call a Crusade could have little to no effect on the Catholic population. In any event, our mission to take Jerusalem carries on, even if without the blessing of the Church."
mlt.131.a:0 "Jerusalem shall fall!!"

mlt.132.t:0 "Moving the Immovable Ladder"
mlt.132.d:0 "As the status quo comes to an end, and the Holy Roman Catholic Church establishes itself as the sole Church for these lands, the greatest example of the era of the status quo is finally over. As of this morning, the Immovable Ladder has been moved. While a tiny occurrence in the grand scheme, it is a clear indication of the power of the Church. No longer is the Holy Land bounded by endless debate, but action can finally be taken. This day is once that shall go down in history, as the end of the status quo and the establishment of Catholic dominance. Vivat Christus Rex!"
mlt.132.a:0 "Deo Gratis!"

mlt.133.t:0 "The Last Order"
mlt.133.d:0 "The Order of St. John is not the only existing Order of the Catholic Church that can trace back to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In fact, the Order of St. John is not even the oldest Crusader Order still in existence. However, the Order of St. John is the only Order that is worthy to restore the torch of Catholicism to the Holy Land. We are the only ones who are willing to stand up against the Turks and take back what is rightfully ours! This truth, this gospel of our mission, must be shared with the entirety of the world. All must know that the Knights of Malta are worthy and willing to do all that is necessary to reclaim Jerusaulem. For if we do not, who will?"
mlt.133.a:0 "Long live the Order!"

mlt.134.t:0 "Return of the Holy Relics?"
mlt.134.d:0 "Whispers of a bygone era echo through the annals of history, tales of holy relics lost during the First Crusade. The Holy Lance, the Holy Grail - revered artifacts thought to hold divine power. As we once again tread the sacred land, a choice presents itself: shall we seek to unearth these long-lost relics? A fervent call to action resonates among us. The time has come to embark on a quest to recover the lost relics of the First Crusade. Our determination to reclaim these artifacts, said to possess immense spiritual significance, fuels our resolve. With faith and determination, we set out on a journey that could reshape the course of history. In contrast, some argue for a focus on the present rather than delving into the past. They assert that the relics are but symbols, and their absence should not deter us from the task at hand. By forgoing this quest, we can direct our efforts towards integrating these wilds. However, the siren call of glory and honor that could be gained from finding these Holy items is a strange one. The question is, will the Knights of Malta fall to that siren call, or shall they continue their mission, ignoring the call of adventure? "
mlt.134.a:0 "We must find the relics, no matter the cost!"
mlt.134.b:0 "We have more pressing matters than hunting for ancient relics!"

mlt.135.t:0 "Holy Relics Found!"
mlt.135.d:0 "In a twist of fate, the echoes of history resound once more. Miraculously, the lost relics of the First Crusade have been rediscovered. A wave of astonishment and wonder has washed over us as the entire Order with their reclamation. The legendary stories of the First Crusade, considered by many to be myth, are seemingly proven correct, as the soldiers go into combat wielding the Holy Lance, suffering nothing, not even a flesh wound. Members of the Order who had suffered great injury have sipped from the cup of Christ, and have been totally healed when the cup touched their lips. The discovery of these sacred artifacts are a divine sign, a testament to our connection to the past. Their return heralds a new era, and we shall treat them with the utmost respect, safeguarding them for generations to come. "
mlt.135.a:0 "God has truly blessed us..."

mlt.136.t:0 "Fate of Mecca"
mlt.136.d:0 "Deus lo vult! Clearly, the true faithful have been fully vindicated, as the capital of Islam, the holy city of Mecca, has been thoroughly conquered by the soldiers of God despite all the resistance these descendants of the Saracens could muster. With the city’s capture, we have finally put to rest a feud that stretches back a millennia, and riotous celebration has overtaken the homefront as lamentations ring across the Islamic world. Already, many temples within the city have found themselves looted, desecrated, or simply razed to the ground in a torrent of fervor both great and terrible, just as the wrath of the Lord is. The justification for such fury has found itself not only in the historical grievances of merciless wars waged on Allah’s behalf and Arab slavery, but in the dogged defense of some of our remnant enemy within the city limits, as irregulars ambush our men and some soldiers even stoop to perfidy.\n\nHowever, despite the reigning chaos, several other sectors of the city possess silent guns and a lack of blood being spilled. Many of our field commanders, opposite their more brutal compatriots, call for mercy to the vanquished, citing that it was Christ Himself who declared the other cheek must be turned, and the clemency of Saladin himself upon those who had justly surrendered. These more compassionate knights have preemptively illegalized looting and extrajudicial killings within their subordinate commands, despite the danger this kindness may pose.\n\nThis divide has come to a head as two of our own battalions have confronted one another before the Masjid al-Haram and the many civilians who have fled to it for safety. There remain conflicting reports of irregulars among those hiding at the “untouchable” landmark, and as one of the battalions has tried to force its way into the temple to “exact righteous justice”, the other has remained steadfast in defending the space from harm. The situation remains at a standstill, and if not resolved soon it is likely to create violence within our own ranks.\n\nThe highest senior commander in the area, unsure of how to resolve the impasse, has placed the decision at the feet of the Grandmaster, deferring the lives of the thousands of Mecca’s inhabitants, and thus the temperament of the whole crusade, to him."
mlt.136.a:0 "The Lord is a man of war."
mlt.136.b:0 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they are the sons of God."

lt.137.t:0 "The New Noblity"
mlt.137.d:0 "Since the expansion of the Mittelmeer realm has offered us a rather sizable amount of territory, compounded by the dispossession of the Anglo-Maltese from our primary isle, we have for a while been left with large swaths of land with few to properly take care of it. Initially this was rectified by having the state manage “unheld” land directly, but this has started to grow quite taxing on our newly Mediterranean-encompassing administration.\n\nThus, this land has quickly found itself being offered up for grabs to the young, more adventurous progeny of many noble families who found themselves dispossessed of their estates in the calamitous Black Monday freefall, on the condition that they make said land profitable and provide for the state. Enticed by the promise of a life outside of the Empire and out in the “frontier”, this homesteading project has found Malta and its territories being quickly flooded with hundreds of entrepreneurial, yet poor, nobles from the Fatherland.\n\nThis new class has proven itself to be a loyal, if rather ambitious, sort, with healthy economic competition and steady stewardship breathing a new life into the Mittelmeer. Many of our cultural advisors are also seeming rather pleased with the effect this move will have in the next generation, hoping that we can recreate the success the Baltendeutsche have found for themselves in Riga. Our military, meanwhile, will not be lacking for promising officer candidates for the foreseeable future.\n\nNow, if only the problem of this population’s penchant for power plays could be addressed…"
mlt.137.a:0 "A new life, in Malta!"

mlt.138.t:0 "An Atlantic Dam?"
mlt.138.d:0 "For the past few weeks, there has been a remarkably enthusiastic push by a Bavarian technician for a meeting to be held among the administration’s leading economic figures, and, wanting to finally give their secretaries a break from the pestering, our economic minister agreed to hear out the individual in question.\n\nIntroducing himself properly as Hermann Sörgel, he immediately spilled into proclamations of the wonder of hydroelectric power and the fantastical results it could grant if someone were to truly adopt a utopian vision. Sweat dripping from his brow and onto his papers the whole way through, he described his grand plan as a damming of the Mediterranean Sea, turning the Strait of Gibraltar into a source of limitless power and creating large amounts of arable land out of the lowered sea levels. He described how the dam would be managed by a neutral organization, which could functionally blackmail other powers into eternal peace by threatening to cut off the dam’s electricity to them, and how the new land could be settled to form an unbreakable bond between Europe and Africa, forming a “Eurafrica” or “Atlantropa”.\n\nIt was at this point that it became evident why this man was so adamant about pushing for his project in the Maltese administration, for he was surely pushed out of everywhere else for even attempting to make this project into reality. The moment that the sheer amount of concrete was considered, the amount of man hours required to even lay the foundations contemplated, the “Atlantropa” idea was quickly considered beyond the realm of reality and thoroughly in the world of fantasy.\n\nHerr Sörgel was dispassionately thanked for his time, offered a few empty promises, and ordered to never send a letter to the Maltese government ever again."
mlt.138.a:0 "One can dream, maybe."

mlt.139.t:0 "Fate of Mt. Athos"
mlt.139.d:0 "For hundreds of years, since the days of the Byzantine Empire, through the Fourth Crusade and the Ottomans, a prevalent theocratic Orthodox community of some 20 monasteries has existed upon Mount Athos, possessing artifacts, texts, paintings, icons, and architecture that has survived every calamity Greece has been through since possibly the 8th century.\n\nThis has spawned a rather heated debate in the government.\n\nWhile the monks that live there are notable for their continuation of traditions that are long dead in many other areas of Greece, and even in the Orthodox Church itself, they are expectant of large degrees of civil autonomy that go against the egalitarian and democratic values that we are trying to build and consistently espouse. Not only do the monks here desire to answer only to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, but they demand the authority to restrict goods and people within their territory, notably so that they can keep women barred from entry.\n\nOur relationship with the church is shaky and we could easily remove these monks if we so desired, but there remains a vocal amount of support for the monks and the argument that it’s not really worth the trouble of removing them when they don’t occupy a strategic location, rest upon no valuable resources, and have no feasible means of threatening the state.\n\nUltimately, the decision remains in the hands of the executive."

From the Balearics to the Isle of Rhodes, from Malta to Crete and even to Cyprus and Crimea and beyond, the people once united only by sea lands and disconnected, fragmented cultural beats now stand united in full. Under the glorious rule of [MLT.GetLeader] our newly united people shall embrace a bright future together."

mlt.141.d:0 "In the annals of our history, a figure emerges whose life and loyalty embody the essence of devotion to both the Order and the Church. This man is none other than Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere, the remarkable Grandmaster of our esteemed Order. Born with ties to the Germans  Ludovico's allegiance remains unswervingly dedicated to the principles of the Order and the Church. Born of noble blood, Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere's lineage connects him to German nobility, yet his heart and actions firmly anchor him within our Order's fold. His ties to the Reich have no doubt come in handy, yet he is still firmly a Catholic and a protector of the Church first and foremost. Throughout his life, Ludovico has stood as a shining example of a princely knight. His commitment to the Order's values, even in the face of conflicting loyalties, showcases his unwavering dedication. From his resolute defense of our sacred principles to his championing of unity among the dominations, Ludovico has etched his name in the annals of our Order's history. Ludovico's leadership as Grandmaster has been marked by an unwavering commitment to the well-being of our brethren. His diplomatic finesse and strategic acumen have guided the Order through the challenging times that followed our restoration. He has forged alliances and fostered cooperation to strengthen our position. Under his stewardship, the Order continues to thrive as a beacon of honor, chivalry, and piety."

mlt.142.t:0 "It-Tempji Megalitiċi ta' Malta"
mlt.142.d:0 "All across Malta lies a series of prehistoric temples and megalithic structures, built across three distinct periods - the Ġgantija phase, the Saflieni phase, and the Tarxien phase - ranging between 3600 BCE and 2500 BCE, that now stand as the oldest free-standing structures so far discovered on the planet. From smaller sites like those belonging to the earliest Ġgantija phase - (or Giantess’ Tower phase, as based on an old Maltese myth that these sites were built by civilized giants) to the apex during the Tarxien phase that saw the largest and most elaborate of these temple complexes being built, these structures are integral to not only Maltese history, but to all of Human history as a whole, for these sites represent some of the earliest free-standing structure-building groups of ancient humanity ever discovered. Although most Maltese nationals and international onlookers agree with our move to protect these megalithic temple complexes and burial sites, a small subset of Borg Pisani’s Futurists scream that these ancient relics only get in the way of true societal evolution, and as such must be destroyed. Luckily, we don’t have to listen to these nutjobs...right?"
mlt.142.a:0 "Mark these sites as official treasures of Maltese history to be protected and preserved."
mlt.142.b:0 "Get these ugly things out of here! Replace them with some real art!"

mlt.143.t:0 "An Age of Empires Long Passed"
mlt.143.d:0 "There is an ancient legend passed around by our oldest of elder knights that speaks of a time long past when the Knights of Malta set sail for the New World in order to find the mythical Fountain of Youth. With their adventures taking them all around the Caribbean as they battled crafty corsairs, savage tribals, and the elements themselves, our kin eventually found themselves deep in the mangrove jungles of Spanish Florida. There, at the sight of an ancient fortress built among the ruins of an old Spanish treasure fleet stood the Fountain of Youth, ripe for the taking and within the grasp of our knightly predecessors. However, our ancestors were thwarted by a coalition of pirates, natives, and colonials led by the knight-turned-pirate captain Morgan Black, crippling the Order’s operations in the region which eventually aided in the complete collapse of Knight operations in the New World. We must never forget this legacy, even if it is only a myth, as we set sail for the Caribbean once again to stake a claim in this land of treasures and myth."
mlt.143.a:0 "We look to the Order’s history to find valuable lessons such as these."

mlt.144.t:0 "Maintaining the Luxurious Illusion"
mlt.144.d:0 "Although the New Sons have come to control Malta from the shadows, it would seem that many of the tourists here on vacation from across the Kaiserreich and the wider Reichspakt are none the wiser. Seemingly oblivious to our ‘subtle’ seizure of power, these happy-go-lucky vacationers shall be our economic salvation. We shall expand our tourist industry until it blocks out the rest of our actions here, putting on a show as the good, loyal colonial holding in the Mediterranean as we siphon funds from clueless nobles and rich families visiting our pristine beaches from Berlin and beyond."
mlt.144.a:0 "Germany’s true tourist destination shall stay open, no matter what."

mlt.145.t:0 "The Pope Calls for Malta’s Assistance in Italy"
mlt.145.d:0 "Contacting the loyal servant of the Church, our Prime Minister Pawlu Boffa, the Pope in Rome has requested Malta’s aid in the struggle for Italian independence as war consumes the Peninsula. Promising aid, supplies, and weaponry to fight this new crusade for them, the Papacy begs for we Maltese - the last of the true Italians not already consumed by this awful brother war - to come and end the struggle once and for all so that no more innocent Catholic blood must be spilled in God’s beloved Italy. However, Boffa has been previously occupied by his dream of creating a united federation of Mediterranean archipelagoes and islands, and many within his Labour Party urge him to ignore the peninsula that so callously left us to rot under German rule in order to follow our own destiny our own way. What shall we do as the fate of Italy, the wider Mediterranean, and all of Christendom dangle in the balance?"
mlt.145.a:0 "The Pope in Rome calls for aid, and we answer. Avanti Italia!"
mlt.145.b:0 "We shall always be loyal to the Papacy, but our people need us here."

mlt.146.t:0 "Fate of Mintoff’s Independent Socialism"
mlt.146.d:0 "As Dom Mintoff continues his efforts of fully cementing his form of Socialism in our state while walking hand in hand with his old rivals in the Internationale, we must decide on the fate of Maltese Socialism. With most of the Totalista Futurista having shattered and fragmented after it became clear we would not yield our grip on power, their old Neo-Qarmatians have come to roost within our Labour wing as the rest of their ilk flee the nation or find themselves in our prisons or early graves. Furthermore, the moderate Labourites once loyal to Pawlu Boffa have mostly come to recognize our dominance, becoming nothing more than a benign tumor affixed to our backside. This leaves the few true Syndicalists within our midst as the only outliers, but they are now greatly empowered by their Internationalist benefactors, making them impossible to remove. However, Mintoff could utilize them to his advantage by realizing the old, previously unfounded rumors about him being an agent of Syndicalist powers in order to subsume the Maltese Syndicalist movement and turning it to serve Mintoff’s interests for Labour and for Malta. However, Mintoff struggles with this decision as he debates whether or not to sell a piece of Malta’s soul to the globalist devils in order to fulfill his dream of total Maltese Leftist unity and his own total dominance over all Malta. What shall we do?"
mlt.146.a:0 "Stick to our current positions."

mlt.147.t:0 "Fate of Local Democracy Under the Knights"
mlt.147.d:0 "Although the Knights of Malta completely eradicated infectious federal democracy with our rise to power, local government still exists across the archipelago in small villages and hamlets outside the urban sprawl of Valletta or outside the reach of our castle redoubts and fortress monasteries. Should we allow these local communities to elect Knight-approved candidates of their own choice to serve as intermediary leaders and representatives of our own Knightly will in a form of modernized pseudo-feudalism while we focus on other more important matters, or should we maintain our complete stranglehold on Maltese government for the good of the nation and the ignorant masses?"

mlt.148.d:0 "With Italy united under the righteous leadership of Reise Carmelo Borg Pisani, and with our Neo-Roman Futurism evolving the Italo-Maltese culture and setting it on the accelerated path to modern utopia, our glorious leader must decide on our destiny. Should we stay in Italy and work on building our new paradise in peace, possibly looking outward to reclaim the lands of Greater Italy as well to free our remaining kin, or should we take our Neo-Roman identity to heart, creating a new Roman state neither republican or imperial in nature like the failures of Rome’s past under the Senate and its Caesars. Instead, we could make a new revolutionary Rome that cares for our people and pushes the National Syndicalist ideology to its perfected maximum under the all-powerful authority of Reise Borg Pisani. However, this would make us a pariah on the world's stage, causing the entire Western world to aim their sights at us, but these are small concessions we must overcome if Rome is to breathe once again."

## Ideas ##
MLT_langaune_question:0 "The Language Question"
MLT_langaune_question_desc:0 "One of the most pivotal questions of the current Maltese political scene, the Language Question, concerns the very future of every soul in the nation. With Malta long being the play thing of outside powers, her own culture reflects that. Influences from the British, Italians, and even the Germans can be felt everywhere one looks. While this has created a unique melting pot of cultures, due to the fact that not one these influences is fully in command, it has also caused great strife, further egged on by Germany's decision to remove English and Italian as official languages and add German to the list in 1930, leaving Maltese and German as the sole official languages of our island and inflaming tensions across the archipelago. All major parties within Malta argue for adopting their preferred major language, so that they can finally put this question to rest. With the rise of the New Sons however, this question, like all things has been put on hold, seemingly permanently."

MLT_republicanismonrise:0 "Pangs of Republicanism"
MLT_republicanismonrise_desc:0 "Since 1921, when Germany first gained control over Malta and restored the Sovereign Military Order of Malta to power over the archipelago, the people have lacked a truly democratic way to express themselves. While the 1930 elections did much to calm these calls for a return to democracy, the sudden rise of the New Sons and their paralyzing effect on the nation practically undid all good that came from it. Even with the New Sons in effective power, these calls for democracy carry on, seemingly as a way to parrot that Malta is not under the control of a sole entity."

MLT_commie_cells:0 "Socialist Cells"
MLT_commie_cells_desc:0 "Despite Malta's overwhelming Catholic and conservative population, some socialist cells within the Labour Party, rumored to have strong ties to the near-by Socialist Republic of Italy do exist. While posing little threat even before the New Sons come to be, if and when the New Sons should falter in their control over our fair isles, they could present a significant risk to our security."

MLT_blind_garrison:0 "The Blind Garrison"
MLT_blind_garrison_desc:0 "Present since 1921 and further bolstered in 1924, the Kasierreich's Malta Garrison has been effectively blind to the true ongoings of our state since the rise of the New Sons six years ago. Keeping the Kaiserreich ignorant with disappearances and bribery, the New Sons have duped the German Empire into thinking everything is function normal on our little archipelago, regardless of how actually paralyzed the local garrison is. Despite their blindness, the Garrison is still our only true defense against the outside world, and should Malta ever overstep, it can be assured that the Garrison would intervene, to protect the Kaiser's Mediterranean prize." 
MLT_sons_of_malta_base:0 "The ''New Sons of Malta''"
MLT_sons_of_malta_base_desc:0 "The ‘New’ Sons of Malta are a contemporary facsimile of the original Independent Order of the Sons of Malta, a fraternal organization similar to the Freemasons that was active during 1800s as a mystic secret society with many prominent politicians and world figures being members of its ranks. A far cry from this noble and harmless past, the New Sons are a group of pretenders - rich, powerful, and well connected men working together to pursue their own selfish agenda on a global scale. Using their vast fortunes and influence, these deluded dreamers have seized control of the archipelago of Malta after Germany loosened its grip in 1930. Since then, this shadowy cabal of cowardly businessmen and spoiled aristocrats have masqueraded as ne'er-do-wells and masterminds bent on freeing their home isles from German control by controlling the strings of the Kaiserreich from its dark underbelly. In reality, the New Sons have only managed to gain a small amount of influence within Germany's FAUD and among her investment banking class,  making their "Grand Plan" seemingly a pipe dream. In short, the New Sons may have been able to fool the naive and the poor citizens of Malta these long six years, but it seems they are destined to exposure and failure. Until then however, Malta is locked in their greedy vice, waiting for the moment that their future comes knocking..."

## Events ##

mlt.1.t:0 "A Future in Flux"
mlt.1.d:0 "After years of instability and decay gnawed away at their flimsy foundations, the New Sons of Malta have finally been ousted, and with them gone, their facade government had collapsed. Our archipelago now stands at the precipice of its new future, for citizens across Malta could easily wake up to one of two very different realities as the power vacuum rushes to be filled. \n\nThe two main groups currently holding the strength, ties, and support necessary to seize power peacefully with the support of at least a decent percent of the population are the Republicans, rallying around three main democratic parties, and the Knights of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. With the SMOM’s reputation as a German interest group growing, they may experience some pushback, but with the rising Socialist tendencies within some groups inside the Labour party, they may be needed to keep Malta from Socialism. We must tread carefully, for our destiny is dawning, and we best make the right choices now so as to not sully our new found freedom."
mlt.1.a:0 "Begin to organize elections! The Repubblika ta’ Malta shall be reaffirmed!"
mlt.1.b:0 "For stability and piety, the Knights wrest control as the false Sons fall."

mlt.2.t:0 "The Riots of St. Paul’s Bay"
mlt.2.d:0 "With the Sovereign Military Order of Malta’s decision to retain the reins of power in Malta and not give way to democratic practices, the various republican elements around our archipelago began to riot, particularly in the capital of Veletta. However, just a few miles away, a far larger uprising was growing in St. Paul’s Bay, Malta’s largest and most industrialized city. Long a hotspot for Socialist thought, especially among the intelligentsia and the local dockhands and factory workers, St. Paul’s Bay is now engulfed in popular uprising as the local Socialist cells, riled up and antagonized to action by the Knights and by their new allies in Socialist Italy. This uprising, bringing with it a mass general strike, has crippled Malta’s fledgling economy, and the Knights must act soon if they have any hope at stopping the Red Menace. With their weapons at the ready, the Knights dived into the heart of the city to try to save it from this foreign-backed crimson tide."
mlt.2.a:0 "The Knights are crushed by SRI marines, and the Red Star rises over Malta."
mlt.2.b:0 "The Socialists are routed before their SRI allies can save them."

mlt.3.t:0 "Labour Party Internal ‘Elections’"
mlt.3.d:0 "With the first free elections since 1917 nearing on the horizon, the Partit Laburista has called for an internal leadership election to decide the new face and direction of the party. With Paul Boffa’s reputation preceding him, much of the main body of the Labourists joined in with his camp without second thought. However, the rising radical faction led avowed Socialist Dominic Mintoff has seen skyrocketing support, and now poses a serious threat to Boffa’s long standing dominance. More concerningly, these ‘Radikali’ have been reported to not even be true Labourists at all, instead being infiltrators from the various Socialist and Syndicalist cells that stalk Malta, though these reports have been from our contacts in the SMOM and it is not known if we can truly trust them. Driven on in secret through funding from Socialists in Italy, these Radicals have long duped their partymates, and now may even have the power to seize the Labour nomination. With the final tally of the internal elections being counted, it is only a matter of time before the decision is made and the party’s fate is sealed. Let us hope the warnings from the Knights did not go unheeded."
mlt.3.a:0 "The Radikali under Mintoff wrests control of the party in secret."
mlt.3.b:0 "Party Leader Boffa holds on and disperses the Radikali."

mlt.4.t:0 "Nationalist Party Internal Elections"
mlt.4.d:0 "As the landmark elections near ever closer, the Partit Nazzjonalista have announced that they will be holding an internal election of their own to determine the future direction of the party. Unlike in the Labour Party, the main man in the PN is Enrico Mizzi without question, for only he has the respect and influence to get the disparate groups within the modern PN to cooperate. What these internal elections shall instead decide is who shall come to form the bulk of Mizzi’s cabinet should he be elected. Within the NP lies three major factions who stand a shot at earning Mizzi’s favour. The Ċentristi are the mainstay of the NP party, and form the bulk of its base. Priding themselves on Catholic conservatism and tradition, they are supported by much of the traditional and rural population, as well as being supported through foreign channels by the Italian Federation and the Pope. Their main opponent are the Knights themselves, whose Sovereign Military Order of Malta has long been the lords of our archipelago, but have lost respect over the years due to their bending to Germany and their ineffectiveness in stopping the New Sons of Malta. The darkshorse candidates are from the ‘Kavallieri Radikali’ - a group of radical and extremist Knights from the Order that long for past glories, holding their love in the Lord above all. These three varied groups must court Mizzi and his allies if they wish to have a shot at ruling our islands."
mlt.4.a:0 "The moderate Ċentristi win out."
mlt.4.b:0 "The Sovereign Military Order’s moderates maintain their mandate."
mlt.4.c:0 "The darkhorse Kavallieri Radikali seizes control of the NP."

mlt.5.t:0 "Constitutionalist Party Internal Elections"
mlt.5.d:0 "Finally, following suit with the other democratic parties, the Partit Kostituzzjonali have announced their intention to hold internal elections. Like the PN, the PK has one main figure at its head capable of unifying its disparate factions - Baron Gerald Strickland. Remaining here after the fall of the British Empire to protect the remaining Anglos unable to flee the island as London fell to the reds and as German marines arrived on Malta, the 1st Baron Strickland is a capable, if aging, leader that has long kept the remaining British souls left in this archipelago from splitting apart. Within the PK lies two major wings - the Konservatiivi and the Liberali - both vying to form the majority of Strickland’s cabinet. Both seeking returned ties to the Entente and the British Crown, the groups mainly differ in their economic and social policies, with the Liberali being more progressive and populist while the Konservatiivi are far more concerned with the free proliferation of capitalism, though both are still rather conservatrve by any moderate metric. Whichever side wins out shall join Stickland to represent the few Anglos left on this tiny archipelago for their chance at returning home."
mlt.5.a:0 "The capitalistic Konservatiivi win the day."
mlt.5.b:0 "The progressive Liberali earn the ticket."

mlt.6.t:0 "The Maltese Elections of [GetYear]"
mlt.6.d:0 "The New Sons of Malta are well and truly dead, and the three main democratic parties here in our beautiful archipelago have each solidified around a unified position of their own. The stage is set, and the candidates and our citizens are ready for true democracy to return to our island paradise. Though we still exist in a state of relative chaos and disarray, we hope that this election shall mark the first step on our road to recovery. With the final votes being counted now, it is only a matter of time before the Repubblika ta’ Malta shall be fully reborn!"
mlt.6.a:0 "Partit Nazzjonalista secures victory, leaving the conservative majority relieved."
mlt.6.b:0 "Partit Laburista is triumphant, and the workers of Malta cheer for it."
mlt.6.c:0 "Partit Kostituzzjonali wins, marking a possible turning point for the Maltese Anglos."

mlt.7.t:0 "The Knights Make Their Move"
mlt.7.d:0 "With the shocking victory of Dom Mintoff and his Socialist Radikali who have long been infiltrating the Partit Laburista with support from the Italian Socialist Republic, the Knights of the SMOM have sprang to action to try to defend their bastion of tradition. Launching raids against the Socialist stronghold of St. Paul’s Bay, the Sovereign Order hopes to dislodge this vile threat before the SRI’s marines can land to relieve the militias and small Socialist cells. As Grand Master Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere gave the order however, reports came in that the Socialists under Mintoff and his extremist ally Carmelo Borg Pisani had invaded and fully seized the islands of Gozo and Comino, isolating the Knights to just the main island of Malta proper save for the small islands of Filfla, Cominotto, and in St. Paul’s Bay inlet, where the Knight’s standing fortresses have kept the Socialist at bay. The island is in a state of all out war, and it is only a matter of time before the dust will settle and one group stands alone."
mlt.7.a:0 "Tuitio Fidei et Obsequium Pauperum! The Knights of Malta rise again!"
mlt.7.b:0 "The Red Star of Socialism shall rise over our archipelago!"


mlt.8.t:0 "The Small, Shining Jewel of the Mediterranean"
mlt.8.d:0 "The small but stalwart archipelago of Malta has a long and storied history of constantly falling under the sway of different foreign powers. Whether it be the Sicilian Arabs of the long-gone Emirate or the French and British who both had their time as lords over this paradise within the Mediterranean, the islands rarely have been allowed to live their own way, and when they have, it was usually under the watch of the historic and heroic Knights of Malta. \n\nHowever, the Knights have fallen far from grace, and now largely exist as pro-German sycophants - a husk of their past power save for the few circles of radicals that still cling to the old ways. Led by the 76th Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere-Albani, the SMOM re-surged to national prominence as the heralds of the new German occupation following the fall of the British Empire. Allied and heavily backed by the Kaiserreich and its new Maltese Garrison, the Knights ruled as a soft military government while Germany mainly used the islands as an airstrip. This military government largely held on unopposed on the surface, but across the underground of Malta, Republican protests and Socialist agents worked to undermine their rule at every turn. Meanwhile, the infamous and perfidious New Sons of Malta worked from deeper in the shadows, pulling the strings from afar as they amassed their wealth and power in secret using a variety of dubious and black market methods. \n\nThis scheming came to a head in late 1930, when the Kaiserreich, unaware of the growing local radical tensions, decided to allow the native Maltese to form a civilian government underneath the Knights’ watch. Despite the local Nationalist-Conservative party, the ‘Partit Nazzjonalista’, winning the local elections, their rule was quickly and completely undermined when the New Sons of Malta finally played their hand. Appearing from the shadows like phantoms, they moved unseen, working with blackmail and extortion, bribery and assassination, to completely cripple both the German-Knights coalition government and the newly elected Partit Nazzjonalista cabinet. With this secret society of international elites and mysterious financiers seizing power over Malta, they have managed to rule for nearly six years, duping the German delegation and Berlin the entire time. \n\nHowever, the New Sons are far from secure in their rule, for after funding from their respective favored Italian factions and from the New Sons themselves in a bid to destabilize the German Garrison, the Democratic parties and Socialist cells within Malta have gained great power. Worse yet for them, the radical wing of the Knights have started to grow once again in popularity and Germany has begun to catch on to the New Sons’ plot, despite sedition acts passed by their puppeted facade government sending panic and disorganization through the archipelago. With these tensions rising, and the Republicans increasingly more vocal in their desire for new elections and an end to the clearly fake government’s charade, it would seem that time is ticking for the New Sons, and Malta shall soon be free to choose its destiny once again."
mlt.8.a:0 "Virtute et Constantia!"

mlt.9.t:0 "The True Knights of Malta"
mlt.9.d:0 "Serving as the liaison between Germany and Malta before the rise of the New Sons, and as our main facade now, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, or the SMOM, is currently led by 76th Grand Master Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere-Albani. Devoutly Catholic, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and ever chivalrous and stalwart, this knightly military order has faded into and out of prominence for centuries, but once again finds itself thrust into national prominence as the New Sons and their coalition collapse. Viewed by some as traitors due to their ties with the Kaiserreich, the SMOM is fiercely dedicated to Maltese nationalism and the preservation of our archipelago, declaring adamantly that their cooperation with Germany is purely seen as a necessity to preserve Maltese culture and the survival of our people. Preaching for a pious and stable Malta tied to the German Empire, the front-face of the Order hides a more independent, illustrious, and possibly deluded secret faction that holds far greater aspirations for the archipelago tied to former and long-dead glories. Regardless of their obsession with the past and that they possibly harbor far more dangerous zealots and radicals within their ranks, the Order is wholly devoted to protecting Malta in perpetuity, no matter the cost. Once the German Garrison is forced from the island in accordance with the Great Plan, the SMOM will once again play their party to ensure Maltese independence, for they are planned to become the main military of the nation, and regardless of their political aspirations, there they shall serve admirably in the defence of the nation, though we will have to keep tabs their deep ties to the Partit Nazzjonalista. No matter the outcome of the Grand Plan, the Maltese people can always rely on these knights in shining armor to save them."
mlt.9.a:0 "Tuitio fidei et obsequium pauperum!"

mlt.10.t:0 "The Republican Element"
mlt.10.d:0 "Currently forced to languish as a powerless facade under the regime of the New Sons to save face with the German Empire, the republican ‘government’ of Malta is largely non-existent, with most republicans in the nation forced into being little more than a resistance movement - one that perfectly fits into the Grand Plan. Coalescing under a provisional government until the first elections can be organized and held - if and only when our gamble pays off, the current democratic scene is mainly divided into three camps: Partit Nazzjonalista, Partit Kostituzzjonali, and Partit Laburista. \n\nThe Partit Nazzjonalista is a right-wing, conservative, and nationalist party that has rallied around Enrico Mizzi and is further divided into three subfactions all vying for influence: the Ċentristi who are mainly moderates split between either preferring cooperation with Italy or maintaining full independence, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta who seek to bring measured military rule Malta while maintaining ties to the Kaiserreich, and the Kavallieri Radikali - a secretive factions within the SMOM that seek to reestablish a government similar to the old crusader state system of the Knights. \n\nThe Partit Kostituzzjonali is the main liberal party of Malta, forming the middleground of the democratic process. They have largely rallied around Baron Gerald Strickland, an Anglo who stayed behind after the British Collapse in order to protect the remaining Anglo population left behind and has since risen to become an anti-German champion among the Maltese people. Split between a more capitalistic Konservatiivi faction and a more progressive Liberali faction, the party still largely agrees that cooperation with the Entente is the best way forward for Malta, and has pursued close ties with the Algiers Regime and Canada. \n\nThe least cemented camp is the Partit Laburista, which is currently caught in an internal rift the party hides from the public and its supporters. Paul Boffa leads the base of the party as a champion of European-style Social Democracy and non-Syndicalist labourite policies, but his position has been slowly eroded away by the Radikali led by Dominic Mintoff and Carmelo Borg Pisani. These Radikali have surged to prominence due to a large influx of funding coming from the Socialist Republic of Italy - something our organization has been hard at work trying to circumvent, and have begun to steal supporters from Boffa’s labourites in an attempt to quietly seize the party. \n\nTogether, these varied groups make up the republican elements of Malta, and with these desperate democrats in our hands, the Grand Plan is sure to succeed."
mlt.10.a:0 "Virtute et constantia!"

mlt.11.t:0 "The Socialist Vermin of Malta"
mlt.11.d:0 "For many years, the Partit Laburista has harbored a tumor. Slowly growing and metastasizing throughout the party, the cancer of radical Socialism has infected Paul Boffa’s beloved hub of social democracy. Fueled, supplied, radicalized, and influenced by the Third Internationale - and primarily Italy, these Socialsit cells have begun to take over the Partit Laburista, slowly pushing Boffa out of his own party while the rest of the nation is none the wiser. Led by Dominic Mintoff, an avowed Christian Syndicalist taking inspiration from Italy’s Alceste De Ambris and Giacomo Matteoti, and Carmelo Borg Pisani, a Maltese nationalist who greatly admires the Renaissance and emulates Bennito Mussolini’s Totalism while also pulling from Italo Balbo’s ideas, these ‘Radikali’ seek to infiltrate our democracy and tear it down from within. Though much of the nation remains unaware of these rats and their vile plot, Paul Boffa and his labourites currently are engaged in political war for the soul of the Partit Laburista and possibly for the fate of the nation. Despite their current goals and feud with the Labourites, these Socialists still have a part to play in the Grand Plan, and with our guidance and additional financial assistance, they too shall help our gamble pay off."
mlt.11.a:0 "Cancer and plague must be cut from the host, lest we all turn Red."

mlt.12.t:0 "Malta Declares Independence!"
mlt.12.d:0 "With the fallout from Black Monday continuing to wreak havoc upon both our economy and the wider empire at large, our great and mighty Kaiserreich has begun to falter; our tendrils of influence that once spread across the globe now wither and die as local groups use this time of weakness to enact their dastardly plans for independence. Across the Kaiserreich, bastions of German influence falter to native unrest and seditious activity, usurping our colonial mandates and military garrisons in the far reaches of our Kaiserreich. \n\nOne such region using this time of instability to their advantage is the New Sons of Malta, who have used their considerable fortunes to rally the local Maltese political factions under a shared banner in a semi-cohesive and barely-cooperating coalition aimed at toppling the German garrison that has held the islands since the fall of the British Empire. Though these ‘New Sons’ have vast amounts of wealth at their disposal, their influence has been vastly drowned out by the swelling tide of Maltese nationalist and nativist sentiments that have consumed the archipelago, and their ‘rule’ over Malta shall soon and assuredly fall to one of the myriad of local political factions that have temporarily set aside their differences to free their islands from our grasp. \n\nDespite being an important naval and air base for the Kaiserreich, Malta serves no larger or necessary purpose within our empire, and with Black Monday still ravaging our economy, we are in little position to stop them. It seems Malta has won its independence, at least for now."
mlt.12.a:0 "Oh no! Anyway..."

mlt.13.t:0 "The Collapse of the New Sons of Malta"
mlt.13.d:0 "Using their vast fortunes and political ties, the varied and anonymous financiers and captains of industry that make up the New Sons of Malta have saved our archipelago from the grasp of the Hun and their greedy Kaiser. By funding and supplying all political groups within the nation, ranging from the Republican elements shackled under the German Garrison to the various nationalist and socialist cells and groups that pervade these islands, the New Sons have propelled the Maltese people to carry themselves to victory. However, this situation has spiralled out of the control of the New Sons, for the very movements they once funded have swelled to be both uncontrollable and no longer beholden to these bored rich men masquerading as a secret order. \n\nShortly after the German flag was torn down over Valletta, so too was the shadow order of the New Sons, with their identities revealed and their surviving members forced to flee the island lest they face retribution. Our Malta, now freed from the grasp of both the Hun and the New Sons, is now free to pursue its own destiny, and with the ever tumultuous political landscape of our small archipelago now free to blast off in a new direction, our newly freed nation and people now stand at a crossroads as the coalition created by the New Sons collapses nearly as quickly as it formed. We must brace ourselves for the future as we move to establish a provisional government in the wake of this new shift until a more permanent direction can be established."

mlt.14.d:0 "Following the disaster that was Black Monday, the Kaiserreich was beset by numerous uprisings and revolts within nations and territories under their grasp as local populations across the German Empire attempted to stab the Global Hegemon in the back as it lay weak and exposed. Though most of these revolts proved to be fruitless wastes of human life, the same cannot be said for what has occurred in the small archipelago of Malta, which has recently secured their own independence after a local masonic order known as the New Sons of Malta supplied seperatist forces on the island and roused them to establish a temporary coalition and rebel. Now, with their financiers forced to flee the island and with the German flag over Valletta now lowered, the small island nation of Malta stands at a crossroads while the rest of the world rages around them."

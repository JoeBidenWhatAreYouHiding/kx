### Events ###
japfor.1.t: "Mantetsu Declares Record Earnings"
japfor.1.d: "Japan has had a presence in Manchuria ever since the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War, and in the years since our hold over the region has greatly strengthened. The negotiations at Shanghai in 1928 forced the world to recognize our right to a 'free hand in Manchuria', opening boundless opportunity to our citizens under the Kwantung Army's watchful eye.\n\nOur control is not absolute however, and Zhang Zuolin's' Fengtian Government is not always cooperative. It is fortunate for him that our desire to safeguard a profitable peace in Manchuria remains paramount, alongside our hope that his government will one day act as a vehicle for our greater Chinese ambitions. For these reasons, the heart of our efforts in Manchuria is the South Manchuria Railway Company, or "Mantetsu" for short, which has become responsible for developing and exploiting vast swathes of the Manchurian economy, propelling the region to become Japan's primary source of coal and steel, as well as the producer of over half the world's soy bean supply.\n\nToday, Mantetsu has announced its highest profits to date."
japfor.1.a: "Manchuria is truly a cornucopia of opportunity!"

japfor.3.t: "Japan Offers Troop Training"
japfor.3.d: "A delegation has arrived from [From.GetNameDef] today offering training for our forces, to bring us 'to the necessary level'. It's a difficult offer to refuse..."
japfor.3.a: "By all means!"
japfor.3.b: "Refuse them."

japfor.4.t: "Japan Provides Arms Facilities"
japfor.4.d: "The Japanese, obviously in an attempt to sweet-talk us, have provided us with a year's access to top-of-the-line manufacturing facilities for armaments. While we're not certain of their intentions, it's unwise to look a gift horse in the mouth..."
japfor.4.a: "How generous!"
japfor.4.b: "Turn them down."

japfor.5.t: "Japan Supports Our Offensives"
japfor.5.d: "The Japanese have approached with a tempting offer of supplies, bombardment, and ammunition in aid of our offensive operations for the next 100 days. Should we accept?"
japfor.5.a: "Of course!"
japfor.5.b: "Never!"

japfor.6.t: "Japan Provides Fighter Designs"
japfor.6.d: "The Japanese military has allowed several designs for fighters more advanced than our own to fall into our lap, with detailed instructions on how to build them efficiently. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
japfor.6.a: "Whatever we need, we get from Japan."

japfor.7.t: "Japan Supports Our Independence"
japfor.7.d: "Japanese advisers have turned up today, bringing gifts and support in our struggle against the Chinese. We are grateful for their gesture, but do we really want to accept Japanese aid so readily?"
japfor.7.a: "We will take what we can get."
japfor.7.b: "Refuse them."

japfor.8.t: "Abdurresid Ibrahim Arrives In [Root.GetNameDef]"
japfor.8.d: "An imam by the name of Abdurresid Ibrahim has today arrived in [Root.GetNameDef], as a representative of the Japanese government. He speaks very highly of their support for our cause and opposition to Chinese tyranny, as well as a desire to see all Asians unified under one anti-imperialist banner. We are honoured to receive one so learned."
japfor.8.a: "Be welcome, teacher."

japfor.9.t: "Help from the Japanese?"
japfor.9.d: "An envoy from Japan arrived today, appearing in secret and offering high quality arms made according to our specifications. Why the Japanese would wish to secretly offer such assistance to [Root.GetNameDef] he would not say, nor would he elaborate on whether there were any strings attached to this 'gift'. Perhaps the Japanese are playing some game in the region, taking advantage of our conflict with [CHN.GetNameDef]? Should we be wary?"
japfor.9.a: "We'll take their help."
japfor.9.b: "No, we don't want any part of this."

japfor.10.t: "A Mysterious Benefactor..."
japfor.10.d: "Just as it seemed our funds were running low, it seems some mysterious benefactors have seen fit to extend us fresh lines of credit. We're not complaining."
japfor.10.a: "Never look a gift horse in the mouth."

japfor.21.t: "The Tokyo Conference"
japfor.21.d: "The Japanese have sent an invitation to their 'Pan-Asian Conference' in Tokyo. Their stated aim is to promote cooperation between Asiatic nations against Western Imperialism, which is an outwardly noble aim. However, some have urged us to ignore it, claiming that this is merely a ploy to woo us into signing over our independence to the Japanese Empire, whose quest for domination of Asia is just beginning."
japfor.21.a: "Pack my best suit."
japfor.21.b: "Let's stay home this year."

japfor.22.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Attends Tokyo Conference"
japfor.22.d: "Representatives from [From.GetNameDef] have arrived in Tokyo and discussions are well under way!"
japfor.22.a: "Welcome!"

japfor.23.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] refused Attendance"
japfor.23.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] have refused to attend the Tokyo Conference we held at great expense, providing only evasive and shaky justifications when questioned about their reasons."
japfor.23.a: "A loss of face."

japfor.24.t: "Joint Condemnation of Western Imperialism"
japfor.24.d: "The summit in Tokyo today saw its first major motion come forward, a fairly uncontroversial one that aims to have all members sign a condemnation of Western colonialist exploitation of Asiatic peoples, and urges the repudiation of unequal treaties. We expect it to have major support, and to lead into the other major business."
japfor.24.a: "On the dotted line, if you would..."

japfor.25.t: "Tokyo: Condemning Western Imperialism"
japfor.25.d: "Our delegates in Japan are apparently being asked to put their names to a fairly standard declaration. It condemns 'anti-Asian racism', 'the exploitation of oppressed peoples by European powers', and 'the institutions of Unequal Treaties, through which mechanism the populations of Asia are deliberately kept disenfranchised within their own lands'. Should we join [JAP.GetNameDef] in this initiative?"
japfor.25.a: "Of course!"
japfor.25.b: "We'd rather not (drop out of the conference)"

japfor.26.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Drops Out"
japfor.26.d: "It would seem that the [From.GetAdjective] dignitaries became uncomfortable with our proposals at the Tokyo Conference, and have elected to drop out of further talks."
japfor.26.a: "Shame!"

japfor.27.t: "Tokyo: Resolution on Trade"
japfor.27.d: "... therefore the attendees of this conference agree that, in order to promote pan-Asian cooperation and brotherhood, treaties concerning trade should be set up and brought to the top of the national agenda in each nation with a view towards establishing a common Asian customs area and protecting the economies of Asiatic peoples from the predatory Western economic principles which are..."
japfor.27.a: "Perfect, they must agree!"

japfor.28.t: "Tokyo: Concerning Pan-Asian Trade"
japfor.28.d: "... therefore the attendees of this conference agree that, in order to promote pan-Asian cooperation and brotherhood, treaties concerning trade should be set up and brought to the top of the national agenda in each nation with a view towards establishing a common Asian customs area and protecting the economies of Asiatic peoples from the predatory Western economic principles which are..."
japfor.28.a: "Sounds good to me."
japfor.28.b: "How absurd (drop out of the conference)"

japfor.29.t: "Tokyo: Calls for Deeper Economic Ties"
japfor.29.d: "Asia must succeed! We are preparing a package of memoranda for the Tokyo Conference, calling for deepening economic integration between our economy and those of the attendees. Favourable trade terms, privileges for Japanese companies, currency exchange mechanisms and much more are all part of the broader plan."
japfor.29.a: "Present it to the conference."

japfor.30.t: "Tokyo: Japan Calls for Deeper Economic Ties"
japfor.30.d: "Or should that be 'Tokyo Calls For Economic Integration'? Either way, proposals have been brought before the conference detailing Japan's desire for deeper economic ties that go beyond the simple trade policies we agreed to. This could be a big step, but it could also be of greater benefit to the [From.GetAdjective] economy than our own in the long term."
japfor.30.a: "Agreed!"
japfor.30.b: "No! (drop out of the conference)"

japfor.31.t: "Final Resolution: A Military Alliance?"
japfor.31.d: "Ostensibly for anti-colonial purposes, the time is now ripe to bring the remaining conference attendees on board with a full military alliance to oppose our rivals. Far better to let the blows fall on them, after all!"
japfor.31.a: "If you wish for peace, then prepare for war."

japfor.32.t: "Tokyo: Calls For Military Action"
japfor.32.d: "The Tokyo Conference today erupted into controversy when the Japanese unveiled their true gambit: having won economic agreement with their project from us, they have now turned this into promotion of a grand military alliance against Germany and other 'Western imperialist powers'. This would, of course, see them play a leading role. Are we really content with this idea?"
japfor.32.a: "Together for all Asians!"
japfor.32.b: "They are surely mad!"

japfor.33.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Aligns With Japan!"
japfor.33.d: "It would seem the statesmen of [From.GetNameDef] have agreed that their path to prosperity and strength comes from co-operation with the pre-eminent power of Asia, [JAP.GetNameDef]. We shall be making arrangements to bring them into the formal military alliance that underpins the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere."
japfor.33.a: "Great!"

japfor.34.t: "A Japanese Alliance?"
japfor.34.d: "A communication from Japan arrived today, indicating that as part of their policy of supporting the self-determination of non-Han cultures within what is nominally Chinese territory they are willing to endorse a full military alliance with us. Should we accept?"
japfor.34.a: "Of course!"
japfor.34.b: "Of course!"

japfor.340.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Accepted"
japfor.340.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has seen the wisdom of our offer and accepted a place in our alliance."
japfor.340.a: "Excellent."

japfor.341.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
japfor.341.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has spurned our offer of alliance."
japfor.341.a: "A foolish choice."

japfor.342.t: "Joining the Japanese Sphere"
japfor.342.d: "Having indicated our interest in officially joining the Japanese military alliance at the Tokyo Conference, the Japanese have now arrived in [Root.GetNameDef] and extended their offer in person."
japfor.342.a: "It's about time!"
japfor.342.b: "We've reconsidered..."

japfor.35.t: "Germany Has Lost Europe"
japfor.35.d: "Our mortal enemy, the German Empire, has lost Europe. This may be an opportune moment to issue an ultimatum demanding all German lands in Asia. The time to cast off the yoke of Western Imperialism may be at hand!"
japfor.35.a: "Issue the ultimatum. Banzai!"
japfor.35.b: "Do Nothing."

japfor.36.t: "The Japanese have issued an ultimatum"
japfor.36.d: "The Japanese Consul in Saigon has delivered a letter from Tokyo. The news is dire; since we have lost the war and were forced to capitulate, we have lost all might and power in Asia, and the Japanese like hungry vultures are going to incorporate our Asian colonies into their Co-Prosperity Sphere."
japfor.36.a: "Submit to their demands."
japfor.36.b: "Declare War."

japfor.38.t: "The Germans have refused our Ultimatum"
japfor.38.d: "The stubborn and foolish Germans will pay for their arrogance. Let the war begin!"
japfor.38.a: "Banzai!"
japfor.38.b: "Now is not the time for war."

japfor.380001.t: "The Germans have accepted our Ultimatum"
japfor.380001.d: "Seeing they have no choice and no ability to resist, the Germans have agreed to our demands and prevent a pointless war."
japfor.380001.a: "Excellent."

japfor.41.t: "Japanese Ultimatum"
japfor.41.d: "For months already, the Japanese have expressed their aggressive ambitions towards our colonial lands as part of their expansionist policies. Today, the Japanese ambassador has presented us an ultimatum: They demand that we surrender all our territory in South-East Asia and the Pacific, or else we will face the full might of the Imperial Japanese Military..."
japfor.41.a: "Don't even bother answering."
japfor.41.b: "Agree to their demands."

japfor.42.t: "Our Ultimatum Was Ignored!"
japfor.42.d: "We did not receive any answer to our ultimatum from [From.GetNameDef]. We must mobilise for war and secure our place as the sole great power in East Asia!"
japfor.42.a: "Declare war!"
japfor.42.b: "Back down, we can't risk a war."

japfor.43.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts our Conditions"
japfor.43.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our conditions. This is not so surprising after all: they wouldn't dare face the might of the Emperor's armies!"
japfor.43.a: "Great!"

japfor.45.t: "The Japanese Envoy"
japfor.45.d: "A Japanese diplomat arrived today, seeking a meeting with [Root.GetLeader] to discuss their offer: [From.GetNameDef] will send military aid and advisers to [PRF.GetNameDef], and in exchange we will join the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. Not the military alliance part of it, at least not yet, but rather the group of nations which have pooled their economic strengths under the aegis of Japanese protection. It would benefit the [Root.GetAdjective] economy, to be certain, but there are those who worry the Japanese are merely looking for influence to eventually turn us into a colony."
japfor.45.a: "We accept their offer."
japfor.45.b: "We must politely decline."

japfor.46.t: "The Indians Accept!"
japfor.46.d: "Our generous offer to the Indians was met with warm praise and acceptance. Envoys from [From.GetNameDef] applauded Japanese magnanimity and astute work in bringing our great nations closer together. We have invited them to set up a permanent embassy in Tokyo."
japfor.46.a: "Splendid!"

japfor.47.t: "The Indians Decline Our Offer!"
japfor.47.d: "In a display of poor judgement, the diplomats in [From.GetNameDef] have declined our magnanimous offer of friendship and alliance. Japanese newspapers reacted with caricatures of scared lapdogs, mocking them for not being willing to take the steps necessary to rid the subcontinent from colonialism."
japfor.47.a: "Shame on them!"

japfor.54.t: "Tsingtau is Ours!"
japfor.54.d: "The German military harbour in East Asia has fallen to our armies. Instead of their naval ensign, now the Japanese flag flies proudly in the city. German shopkeepers watch our regiments parade through the streets with stony expression."
japfor.54.b: "A great victory!"

japfor.55.t: "Japan Threatens Us!"
japfor.55.d: "A large Japanese task force has sailed into the islands, and is threatening to attack us if we do not bow to their demand of full surrender!"
japfor.55.a: "Resist them and call for help!"
japfor.55.b: "Surrender is our only option."

japfor.56.t: "The Philippines Begs for Help!"
japfor.56.d: "Japan is pounding at the door of Philippines, and they have come to us begging for assistance. Should we respond?"
japfor.56.a: "Offer our protection."
japfor.56.b: "We cannot stretch ourselves so far."

japfor.57.t: "The Philippines Has [event_target:philippines_backer.GetAdjective] Backing"
japfor.57.d: "The Filipinos are resisting our demands, and [event_target:philippines_backer.GetNameDef] is backing their claim to independence."
japfor.57.a: "We will destroy them, regardless."
japfor.57.b: "Back down, we can return later."

japfor.5701.t: "The Japanese Back Down"
japfor.5701.d: "Apparently the Japanese were unwilling to test our mettle. They have backed down from their threats, at least for now."
japfor.5701.a: "That's a relief."

japfor.58.t: "The Philippines Resist!"
japfor.58.d: "The Philippines are resisting our demands, without any foreign backers to come to their rescue. We should make them pay for this in blood."
japfor.58.a: "We will destroy them."

japfor.59.t: "The Filipinos Surrender!"
japfor.59.d: "Seeing the might of our forces, the Philippines had no chance but to submit before the brave sons of the empire!"
japfor.59.a: "Puppet them!"
japfor.59.b: "Annex them!"

japfor.62.t: "Japan Threatens Us!"

japfor.65.b: "Back down, we can return later."

japfor.66.t: "Hawaii Resists!"

japfor.501.t: "The Legacy of the Korean Rebellion of 1925"
japfor.501.d: "Due to the disastrous economic situation and ongoing instability, Korea rebelled against our government. Luckily, the rebellion was successfully suppressed and the dissidents were executed. However, because of recent political changes, minor students protests appeared in many parts of Korea. Suppressing them in time should nip the problem in the bud, but it may also have larger repercussions."
japfor.501.a: "Arrest and execute those traitors!"
japfor.501.b: "We should leave them alone."

japfor.510.t: "The Busan Negotiations"
japfor.510.d: "As the liberalization of our government was completed, the Koreans also demand reforms on their current situation. Korean leaders and social elites have proposed a possible meeting at Busan to negotiate about the future of Korea in the Japanese Empire."
japfor.510.a: "Accept the proposal, let's see what they have to offer"
japfor.510.b: "Arienai!"

japfor.511.t: "Japanisation Policies"
japfor.511.d: "Currently we are applying a Japanisation policy on our subjects in the Korean peninsula, hoping to integrate them one day to the Japanese society. The Koreans are demanding to abolish that policy and recognize the Korean culture."
japfor.511.a: "Insist on Japanisation efforts"
japfor.511.b: "Recognize Korean culture"

japfor.512.t: "Status of Korea in the Empire"
japfor.512.d: "Korea is now a semi-autonomous region in the empire, it is neither a fully autonomous subject like the Fengtian government, but is has its own governor-general. What place will Korea have in Japan in the future?"
japfor.512.a: "Remain its colonial status"
japfor.512.b: "Incorporate it into the empire"

japfor.513.t: "Status of Korea in the Empire"
japfor.513.d: "Now that we have accepted to recognize the Korean culture, the Koreans are asking for more autonomy. They are proposing to elevate its status to an autonomous government under Japanese control"

japfor.513.c: "Establish a friendly Korean regime under loyal collaborators and let them handle their internal politics. (Play as Korea)"

japfor.82.d: "While we are not fully free, the Japanese have decided to release us from their grip as a autonomous government."
japfor.82.a: "It is a start."

japfor.514.t: "Governor-general of Korea"
japfor.514.d: "Every governor-general of Korea has been Japanese since the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910. The Koreans are demanding for their own Korean governor-general. This will probably make ruling over them easier, but it is not a small compromise..."
japfor.514.a: "Choose a Korean governor"
japfor.514.b: "Choose a Japanese governor"

japfor.515.t: "Koreans Serving in the Government?"
japfor.515.d: "As incorporating the Koreans into the Japanese people has been designated as our main long term goal, should we allow the Koreans to serve in local governments to ensure the equality between the Japanese and the Koreans?"

japfor.515.b: "They are second class citizens!"

japfor.516.t: "Democracy in Korea?"
japfor.516.d: "As democracy holds firm in mainland Japan, our Korean subjects are demanding for the same democratic rights. Should we allow partial suffrage in Korea?"
japfor.516.a: "Allow partial suffrage"
japfor.516.b: "They are second class citizens!"

japfor.517.t: "Fate of the Political Prisoners"
japfor.517.d: "Ever since the Japanese annexation of Korea, we have arrested many Korean independence movement leaders. Now the Koreans are negotiating for their release. Allowing them to go back to Korea may cause some potential threats against our rule in Korea, but it will make the Koreans satisfied."
japfor.517.a: "Release the political prisoners"
japfor.517.b: "They should stay locked up!"

japfor.518.t: "End of the Busan Negotiations"
japfor.518.yay: "The conference held between the Japanese authority and the Korean leaders was successful. Hopefully Korea shall remain in the Japanese Empire peacefully."
japfor.518.nay: "The conference held between the Japanese authority and the Korean leaders was disastrous. Unrest is rising in the peninsula, we have to prepare for the worst..."

japfor.67.t: "Korean Exiles Look for Foreign Backing"
japfor.67.d: "The Korean government-in-exile has trudged along for a long time alone building up minor support. However the growing instability in Japan may give them a chance to return to Korea.

japfor.67.a: "Troubling."

japfor.69.t: "Korea Asks for Aid"
japfor.69.d: "The Korean government-in-exile has approached our government for military and political aid in retaking their lands from Japan. This could cause much grief to the Japanese, but Japan will hardly appreciate the gesture."

japfor.69.c: "We're not interested."

japfor.74.t: "Rise of Korean Nationalism in Transamur"
japfor.74.d: "The Korean independence movement is spreading in Transamur using the large existing Korean minority and could pose a future problem if it is not contained..."
japfor.74.a: "Push them for a crackdown."
japfor.74.b: "Let it be. They can't push us out."

japfor.751.t: "Japanese Pressure"
japfor.751.d: "The rise of Korean nationalism in our state has made Japan a bit nervous and they are insisting that we crack down on this fledgling movement. Failure to do so could draw Japan's ire, but such measures will make the people restless, especially our middle class which contains a great number of Koreans."
japfor.751.a: "We have no choice..."
japfor.751.c: "We refuse."

japfor.75.t: "Transamur Refuses Our Demand!"
japfor.75.d: "Our demand for a crackdown was refused, and members of the government are taken aback by this blatant disrespect for our nation's security by our supposed younger ally, who we have protected for so long. How do we answer this insubordination?"
japfor.75.a: "Respect their independence."
japfor.75.b: "We will do it ourselves."
japfor.75.c: "How dare they, send in the troops!"

japfor.76.t: "Japanese Troops Crack Down on Koreans"
japfor.76.d: "In a show of force, Japan has deployed their forces throughout Transamur in order to begin the crackdown. It appears that Japan does not respect our rights as a nation."

japfor.76.b: "There is nothing we can do..."

japfor.77.t: "Japan Marches on Vladivostok"
japfor.77.d: "In order to force our hand, Japanese forces have marched on our capital and placed it under siege. We are not militarily strong enough to resist them in a full-on conflict."
japfor.77.a: "Capitulate and order the crackdown."
japfor.77.b: "Resist and declare independence from Tokyo!"

japfor.83.t: "Rebellion in Korea!"
japfor.83.yay: "Today several groups of Korean rebels attempted to take and hold several key points throughout the peninsula. Luckily, they had few weapons and were highly disorganised. Having failed to convince any of the local Korean garrison troops to join them, they stood no chance against our Japanese troops. Their leader, Kim Koo, has been captured and will be executed for treason. Some say with foreign backing they might have put up a stronger fight, but whatever the case, they have been crushed and the situation is under control."
japfor.83.nay: "Today several groups of Korean rebels attempted to take and hold several key points throughout the peninsula. To our surprise, they were well equipped with foreign weapons. Within hours they had taken over a number of ammunition depots and their leader, Kim Koo, was on the airwaves broadcasting his message of independence and resistance. With momentum on their side, our garrison forces collapsed to a mixture of defections and confusion. Worse still, it seems our communication lines were manned by less than loyal men leaving us unable to mount a swift counter attack.\n\nAfter several emergency meetings, the Emperor has decided to given them three days to stand down. While there is surely no chance of this happening, it does give us time to reorganise our forces."
japfor.83.a: "We are ever vigilant."
japfor.83.b: "We await their answer..."
japfor.83.c: "Maybe they are right... (Play as Korea)"

japfor.85.t: "Rebellion!"
japfor.85.d: "Things couldn't have gone better. Thanks to our foreign backing we have seized control of south Korea and our ready to fight to liberate the north from the oppressive control of Japan. Better still, the chaos forced the Japanese to offer us three days to surrender. Of course we have no intention to, but it will give us vital time to prepare our attack. Kim Koo has personally taken leadership of our forces and is already laying plans. We will fight for freedom!"
japfor.85.a: "We'll show the Japanese what we think of their peace offer!"

japfor.86.t: "The Deadline Passes"
japfor.86.d: "The deadline passed at midday today. Not only have they refused to surrender, they have launched a series of surprise attacks along the front line! Let no-one say we didn't give peace a chance, but now we must crush them totally."
japfor.86.a: "I want Kim Koo's head!"

#japfor.88.t: "Korea fights us off"
#japfor.88.d: "Korean forces have taken many key strategic positions and are forcing us off the mainland. Transamur and the Fengtian Government are noticing this and might decide to rebel as well. Should we seek peace?"

#japfor.88.b: "We must keep Korea within our grasp!"
#
#japfor.89.t: "Korea is beating Japan"
#japfor.89.d: "Against all odds, Korean forces have taken many key strategic positions from the Japanese and are forcing them off the mainland. This may be a great opportunity for us..."

#japfor.89.b: "Yes, seize the moment and attack the Japanese"
#japfor.89.c: "Yes, seize the moment and attack... Korea!"
#
#japfor.104.t: "Naval Blockade of the Korean peninsula"
#japfor.104.d: "With the Korean peninsula engulfed in the fires of revolution, many hostile nations might use this event as an opportunity to weaken our influence in the pacific by direct or indirect support of those damned revolutionaries. We can only prevent this by imposing a naval blockade around the entire Korean peninsula."
#japfor.104.a: "Impose the naval blockade!"
#
#japfor.105.t: "Japanese Naval Blockade"
#japfor.105.d: "In desperate attempt to prevent our inevitable victory, the imperial Japanese navy has set up a blockade around the entire Korean peninsula."
#japfor.105.a: "They can not stop us!"
#
#japfor.106.t: "Enforcing Naval Blockade"
#japfor.106.d: "Our glorious navy continues to maintain a complete naval blockade around the rebellious Korean peninsula, denying the rebels much needed foreign aid. But, some members of the general staff argue that the blockade has already outlived its usefulness since the rebels will be soon crushed and the blockade itself is a very costly measure..."
#japfor.106.a: "Continue the blockade!"
#japfor.106.b: "End the blockade."
#
#japfor.107.t: "End of the Naval Blockade"
#japfor.107.d: "With fighting over the Korean peninsula definitively over, it is time for our navy to end this long and costly blockade."

japfor.111.t: "Landlords in Korea Evicted!"
japfor.111.d: "We have just received word from the ports of our southern coasts that dozens of ships from Korea are arriving on our shores. These refugees from the Joseon peninsula have apparently fled in the face of angry Koreans rising up and seizing these landlords’ rightful properties. This has shocked our cabinet, as no one could have expected such a bold and defiant move from the lowly Koreans. Our administration, in the face of this absolute humiliation to our regime’s hold in Korea, has only two real options. We can either sternly warn the Koreans, imposing diplomatic and economic sanctions while also sending back the landlords under military guard, or we can simply only send the military, and let our wise and trusted generals decide how best to pacify these rowdy swine."
japfor.111.a: "Sanctions and armed guards are enough to keep them in line."
japfor.111.b: "The Grand Imperial Army of Japan will sort these ungrateful vermin out."

japfor.112.t: "Report From the Far-East"
japfor.112.d: "Our secret service reports that Japan plans to invade Russia in order to gain control over Siberia. Russia is hardly our ally and Japan has been threatening us for years, so despite this being a flagrant violation of international law, it might be best to not take action here."
japfor.112.a: "Hm? What secret service report? I heard nothing about a war..."
japfor.112.b: "Just sent them a strongly worded letter, they'll ignore it for sure."

japfor.113.t: "A Strongly Worded Letter From Germany"
japfor.113.d: "We have just received a strongly worded letter from Germany reminding us of how illegal what we are about to do is, how this could lead to loss of life and how Germany would be very displeased if we went to war with Russia."
japfor.113.a: "It's almost like they want us to go to war."

japfor.114.t: "Operation Kuma"
japfor.114.d: "Our troops are decisively positioned along the borders of our allies with Russia, and stand ready to invade. We should begin by bringing the Russian Pacific coast under our control, while simultaneously pushing toward Yakutsk and Novosibirsk."
japfor.114.a: "Onwards!"

japfor.176.t: "Japanese Demands"
japfor.176.d: "The Japanese consulate came to us this morning with a simple demand - hand over the East Indies or face the consequences. There is no way for us to face their fleets on our own, what can we possibly do?"
japfor.176.a: "Beg the Kaiser to help us!"
japfor.176.b: "Comply with their demands!"
japfor.176.c: "Ignore the demands! We can take them on!"

japfor.177.t: "The Netherlands Beg for Help!"
japfor.177.d: "Last week the Japanese have demanded Holland to give them the East Indies. The Dutch have come begging to us to protect them from the Japanese aggression. Should the Japanese get what they want they would be dangerously close to our holdings in Malaya and Papua new Guinea. What should we do?"
japfor.177.a: "We stand with our Dutch brethren!"
japfor.177.b: "We can't afford to antagonise the Japanese."

japfor.178.t: "Germany Backs the Netherlands!"
japfor.178.d: "The cowardly Dutch ran to the Germans for protection and are now part of their alliance. This insolence cannot go unpunished!"

japfor.178.b: "Back down for now."

japfor.179.t: "The Japanese Back Down!"
japfor.179.d: "After facing the threat of war with the German Empire the cowardly Japanese backed down with their demands. This is a glorious victory for all of the Reichspakt!"
japfor.179.a: "Hurrah!"

japfor.180.t: "The Germans Refuse!"
japfor.180.d: "Despite our desperate calls for help the Germans have refused to protect us from Japan. We now stand alone against the might of the Japanese empire. What should we do?"

japfor.180.b: "We must fight!"

japfor.181.t: "The Dutch Fold!"
japfor.181.d: "The pitiful Dutch have folded in the face of our glorious armies and surrendered to our demands! Insulindia is now under our full control, and the transfer of the colonial regime has started."
japfor.181.a: "Banzai!"

japfor.182.t: "The Dutch Resist!"
japfor.182.d: "The insolent Dutch have refused our demands, and are now preparing to face our mighty armies alone! We must send forth our navies and put them back in their place!"
japfor.182.a: "They won't be saying much after this...!"
japfor.182.b: "Actually, going to war wasn't our intention..."

japfor.183.t: "The Japanese Back Down!"
japfor.183.d: "A miracle has happened! The Japanese, startled by our adamant refusal have decided to withdraw their demands and leave us alone! This is cause for celebration!"
japfor.183.a: "Hurrah!"

japfor.184.t: "The Fall of Insulindia"
japfor.184.d: "The Japanese occupy the majority of our colonies in the East Indies and our colonial garrison is defeated. We can't hope to win against the Japanese navy and victory seems impossible. Some in our diplomatic corps have suggested we draft a peace treaty and surrender to the Japanese."
japfor.184.a: "We cannot win..."
japfor.184.b: "Victory is within our reach!"

japfor.185.t: "The Dutch Beg for Peace!"
japfor.185.d: "Overwhelmed by our superior army the Dutch come to us begging for peace. They offer us the entirety of their colonial possessions in Insulindia in return. How should we respond?"
japfor.185.a: "Very good! A great victory!"
japfor.185.b: "No peace until we march in Amsterdam!"

japfor.186.t: "The Japanese Refuse!"
japfor.186.d: "The Japanese refused to sign a peace treaty and have made it clear their goal is total victory! We are doomed!"
japfor.186.a: "Damn it!"

japfor.187.t: "Japanese Victory"
japfor.187.d: "The Japanese defeated our colonial garrison and now occupy both our and the Dutch colonies. While we can potentially fight them off, doing so would be very costly and would require diversion of war assets. We can offer them some land in return for peace."
japfor.187.a: "Draft a peace treaty."
japfor.187.b: "We can fight them off."

japfor.188.t: "The Germans Beg for Peace!"
japfor.188.d: "Overwhelmed by our superior army the Germans come to us begging for peace. They offer us the entirety of the Dutch colonial possessions in Insulindia and some of their own in return. How should we respond?"

japfor.190.t: "The Japanese Demands"
japfor.190.d: "We have received a message from the Japanese demanding our full surrender to their armed forces and transfer of administration of our territories to their military high command. We've received reports their navy is being deployed to our shores. There is no way we can fight them off on our own, what should we do?"

japfor.191.t: "Insulindia Begs for Help!"
japfor.191.d: "Last week the Japanese have demanded Insulindia to fully capitulate to them in formal annexation. The Insulindians have come begging to us to protect them from the Japanese aggression. Should the Japanese get what they want they would be dangerously close to our holdings in Malaya and Papua new Guinea. What should we do?"

japfor.192.t: "Germany backs Insulindia"
japfor.192.d: "The cowardly Insulindians have run to the Germans for protection and they are now part of their alliance. This insolence cannot go unpunished!"

japfor.195.t: "The Insulindians fold!"
japfor.195.d: "The pitiful Insulindians have folded in the face of our glorious armies and surrendered to our demands! Insulindia is now under our full control, and the transfer of the local administration has begun."

japfor.196.d: "The insolent Insulindians have refused our demands, and are now preparing to face our mighty armies alone! We must send forth our navies and put them back in their place!"
japfor.196.a: "Destroy them!"

japfor.199.t: "Japanese Victory"
japfor.199.d: "The Japanese defeated both our colonial garrison and the Insulindian armies and now occupy our lands. While we can potentially fight them off, doing so would be very costly and would require diversion of war assets. We can offer them some land in return for peace."

japfor.200.d: "Overwhelmed by our superior army the Germans come to us begging for peace. They offer us the entirety of Insulindia and some of their own colonies in return. How should we respond?"

japfor.202.t: "The Fengtian Silver Crisis"
japfor.202.d: "When the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank, two of the largest in our country, requested payment on their loans in quick succession, Fengtian's Central Bank defaulted due to a sudden and supposedly inexplicably insufficient silver reserve. Whether this was merely gross incompetence and mismanagement, or something more sinister, is unclear, but there is little doubt that the Fengtian Government finds itself in a dire economic situation and has requested our help.\n\nWhile our influence will ensure that both Mitsui and the Bank of Japan are paid what they are due before anything else, a failing Fengtian Government would severely upset their claims to legitimacy and our claims to benevolence. We have the option of bailing them out."
japfor.202.a: "We have no choice."
japfor.202.b: "This is of their own making."

japfor.203.t: "Fengtian Blames Us for the Silver Crisis!"
japfor.203.d: "Fengtian has loudly denounced our government, citing what they say is a deliberate plot to destabilise their government through the eruption of their recent Silver Crisis, citing the incidental requests from both the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank for repayment on loans backed by Fengtian's silver reserve. With the reserve apparently containing far less than the Fengtian government claimed, its economy has spiralled out of control as the government loses credibility by the hour, and it seems likely that this crass and foolish attempt to deflect blame is mostly a reaction to their internal political situation.\n\nAll the same, we can deny these ridiculous assertions, but can we also let this grave insolence go unpunished?"
japfor.203.a: "False accusations!"
japfor.203.b: "Punish this insolence!"

japfor.204.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Expels our Military Mission"
japfor.204.d: "[FNG.GetLeader] has expelled our military mission, giving them twenty four hours to leave the country, taking with them all equipment and other property. Contrary to our expectations, however, this was accompanied by a diplomatic letter explaining that the mission had achieved its goals, and that Fengtian is now sufficient in its command capacity. Fengtian's ambassador has also spent the last several hours attempting to convince the Foreign Ministry, in private, that this was merely a necessity of internal politics, and that no ill-will is intended toward Japan.\n\nWhile this may, or may not, be the case, there is little question as to whether this reduces our influence over Fengtian. Who is to say what the Chinese will do next?"
japfor.204.d_mantetsu: "[FNG.GetLeader] has expelled our military mission, giving its officers twenty four hours to leave the country. Contrary to our expectations, however, this was accompanied by a diplomatic letter explaining that the mission had achieved its goals, and that Fengtian is now sufficient in its command capacity.\n\nFortunately, our control over Fengtian via Mantetsu is extensive, and we can almost certainly force their government to reverse its decision. This may force the more patriotic and militaristic elements of the government to independently declare war, and the consequences of such a situation should also be considered."
japfor.204.a: "Declare war."
japfor.204.b: "Force Fengtian to reconsider."
japfor.204.c: "Punish Fengtian."
japfor.204.e: "Do nothing."

japfor.205.t: "[FNG.GetLeader] Expels our Military Mission"
japfor.205.d: "[FNG.GetLeader] has expelled our military mission, giving its officers twenty four hours to leave the country. This not only severely threatens to upset our control over the Fengtian Government, but also potentially exposes Korea and thereby Japan to attack. This is thoroughly unacceptable, both to our generals, and to the Japanese sense of honour. Surely such an act of ungrateful insubordination must be met with an appropriate response?"
japfor.205.a: "Send an Ultimatum."
japfor.205.b: "Do nothing."

japfor.206.t: "Fengtian Denounces Us!"
japfor.206.d: "The iron ore deposits at Anshan have been worked by a Japanese-owned subsidiary of Mantetsu since 1918, known as "Anshan Iron and Steel", serving as one of Japan's most valuable sources of steel outside the Home Islands. Now that the company wants to expand, it has apparently begun digging without a permit, destroying farmland in the process, and triggering protests by the native Chinese. These protests escalated into violence, and lead to some regrettable actions by our local garrison and the loss of life on the protesters' side.\n\nThe Fengtian Government has released a long-winded and not at all atypical denouncement of our actions. How should we respond?"
japfor.206.a: "Punish this insolence!"
japfor.206.b: "Denounce Fengtian."
japfor.206.c: "Stay silent."

japfor.213.t: "We Are Beaten"
japfor.213.d: "Despite our great armies and the courage of our men, Japanese troops are now bearing down on the Russian heartland. Perhaps it is time to do the unthinkable, and offer them peace."
japfor.213.a: "Send them an offer."
japfor.213.b: "We shall never surrender!"

japfor.214.t: "Russia Offers Peace"
japfor.214.d: "Russia has offered us Siberia in return for peace, it is a generous offer indeed, do we accept?"
japfor.214.a: "Enough of this war. We accept!"
japfor.214.b: "Nothing but total victory!"

japfor.215.t: "The Philippines Have Accepted Our Offer"
japfor.215.d: "The Philippines have chosen to join us, they wisely saw that resistance would be futile and instead opted to become our ally."
japfor.215.a: "That is good to hear."

japfor.216.t: "The Philippines Have Joined the Entente"
japfor.216.d: "The Philippines have chosen to join the Entente; they have snubbed out offer of friendship. This must not go unpunished, but the Entente is strong, so we must bid our time."
japfor.216.a: "Soon, soon."

japfor.217.t: "The Philippines Have Joined the Reichspakt"
japfor.217.d: "The Philippines have chosen to join the Reichspakt; they have snubbed out offer of friendship. This must not go unpunished, but the Reichspakt is strong, so we must bid our time."
japfor.217.a: "Soon, soon."

japfor.218.t: "Hawaii Has Accepted Our Offer"
japfor.218.d: "Hawaii has chosen to join us, they wisely saw that resistance would be futile and instead opted to become our ally."
japfor.218.a: "That is good to hear."

japfor.225.t: "United States in disarray"
japfor.225.d: "The civil war has erupted in the United States, tearing apart the last shreds of unity in the Union. This presents us with a chance to remove the American presence from the central Pacific by occupying the island of Guam. There is very little that the US government can do to stop us at this point."
japfor.225.a: "Seize Guam... and claim even more!"
japfor.225.b: "Seize Guam."
japfor.225.c: "Best to leave it, I think."

japfor.226.t: "Japan Seizes Guam"
japfor.226.d: "With America in turmoil, Japan has moved onto the island of Guam. There is very little that the US government can do to stop Japan at this point."
japfor.226.a: "Too bad."

japfor.227.t: "Japan Seizes Motor Companies"
japfor.227.d: "With the nation in turmoil, Japan has seized control of several American motor companies operating there. The civil war has caused many of the companies to lose contact with their parent companies and they have been struggling to get parts for their assembly lines. This is made it rather easy for the Japanese to seize control of them under the pretence of 'assistance'. While this is clearly an illegal act, we are in no position to do anything more than send a strongly worded letter to them."
japfor.227.a: "Strongly worded indeed!"

japfor.230.t: "The Fading Sun"
japfor.230.d: "This is a dark day for the Empire of the Sun. Enemy forces have ousted our men from their vital bases in Manchuria and Korea; even our most optimistic generals believe there is little chance of counter attack. If we offer terms, perhaps we may keep the Home Islands intact and keep the Emperor safe. Our top diplomats say, a two week conference in Port Arthur may be enough to broker a deal, but it is far from certain. Should we offer everything to keep our homes safe?"
japfor.230.a: "We yield only because we have no choice."
japfor.230.b: "Japan will never surrender!"

japfor.231.t: "The Fading Sun"
japfor.231.d: "After the utter defeat of the Imperial Japanese Army, our forces control huge swathes of land in Manchuria and Korea whilst the Imperial Japanese Navy are reduced to attempting mere blockades. Our spies in Tokyo report severe dissent and war weariness among the populace. In light of this, the government has called a two week conference in Port Arthur to determine our war aims."
japfor.231.a: "We will accept their terms. Let them keep their pathetic 'Home Islands'."
japfor.231.b: "Rubbish, we push for total victory!"

japfor.232.t: "Our Terms Are Answered"
japfor.232.d: "Thankfully, our terms were accepted. While we have lost much, it is not the end for us yet. Praise the Emperor, even in these dark times."
japfor.232.nopeace: "Our terms have been rejected, it will be total war until the bitter end. Let us hope we were mistaken in offering terms and that this is for the best."
japfor.232.a: "Peace at last."
japfor.232.b: "The war must go on."

japfor.233.t: "Peace With the Empire of the Fading Sun"
japfor.233.d: "The two week conference in [GetDalianName] has ended in agreements; the terms Japan offered were accepted and peace has been achieved. We have gained much and this is nothing less than a great victory."
japfor.233.a: "We fought well and deserve nothing less."

japfor.234.t: "War With the Empire of the Fading Sun"
japfor.234.d: "The two week conference in [GetDalianName] has ended in nothing; this war will be a total war. If we pushed the Japanese out of Manchuria and Korea we can surely push them out of the Home Islands."
japfor.234.a: "It'll be the same again I'm sure..."

japfor.235.t: "Japan has Surrendered!"
japfor.235.d: "Under assault from all sides, [JAP.GetNameDef] has signed a peace treaty after a two-week conference in [GetDalianName], preserving the Home Islands from enduring invasion... but also casting [Root.GetNameDef] to the winds. The Japanese alliance has crumbled, and now we must fight on ourselves."
japfor.235.a: "I thought they were stronger than that..."

japfor.237.t: "The Imperial Japanese Navy Seizes the Moment"
japfor.237.d: "Due to the army's capitulation on the mainland, the IJN has been quick to assert its greatly increased relevance to the defence of the Home Islands. Army generals and their associates in the War Ministry have raised quite a fuss, but few disagree that the navy must stand guard as Japan rebuilds. It seems certain that they will receive a greater share of Japan's national resources than they might have previously."
japfor.237.a: "The navy must become an impenetrable shield!"

# Involving Anqing #

japfor.250.t: "Anqing and Fengtian Ask Our Help"
japfor.250.d: "The Anqing Clique, which recently emerged victorious against the League due to our help, has requested our support. If we invest significant capital and aid them in reconstruction on a massive scale, they believe that an attack on Beijing is possible relatively soon. The Fengtian government agrees with Anqing and has thus relayed this request to us. What will we do?"
japfor.250.a: "We'll commit resources."
japfor.250.b: "This isn't worth it."

japfor.251.t: "Fengtian Chooses to Wait"
japfor.251.d: "The Fengtian government has decided that the value of the Anqing Clique is too great to waste immediately and so has decided that it is better to delay their Reclamation War in order to allow Anqing to recover on its own. This is most likely a wise decision, as it will allow both governments to become more stable."
japfor.251.a: "Good"

japfor.252.t: "Fengtian Wants to Strike Soon"
japfor.252.d: "The Fengtian government believes that the Beijing government is currently incredibly weak. Having the Anqing Clique on their side, even if they are in a tough position due to the recent League War, is an advantage they think should be used immediately. However, they have come to the conclusion that such a swift attack would be suicide if we do not stand behind their decision. Their operation is risky, but could potentially bring much of China under our influence in a matter of months..."
japfor.252.a: "Back them!"
japfor.252.b: "This is too risky."

japfor.253.t: "Fengtian Prepares Fast Strike"
japfor.253.d: "After receiving our approval, Fengtian relayed its message to Anqing. While their leader, Chen Tiaoyuan, was sceptical to back such a quick attack considering the high stakes, he has now agreed. Fengtian will begin preparations to strike at Beijing within months."
japfor.253.a: "It will begin soon."

japfor.254.t: "Fengtian Doesn't Change Strategy"
japfor.254.d: "Due to disagreements with us and with Anqing, the Fengtian government has not been able to determine a better strategy. So instead, they have chosen to stick to their existing timetable and hope that Anqing joins when the war starts."
japfor.254.a: "So be it."

japfor.255.t: "Anqing Begins Reconstruction"
japfor.255.d: "With our assistance, Anqing has started to reconstruct their territory and deal with the devastation the League War caused. Telegraph cables are to be repaired, houses rebuild and roads cleared."
japfor.255.a: "Good."

japfor.256.t: "Fengtian Abandons Strategy"
japfor.256.d: "The Fengtian government has abandoned its strategy, deciding it can no longer wait and has come to the defence of Shanxi. This means that its commitment to Anqing is void."
japfor.256.a: "Unexpected."

japfor.257.t: "Anqing and Fengtian Ask Our Help"
japfor.257.d: "The Anqing Clique, which recently emerged victorious against the League due to our help, has requested our help. The Fengtian government has committed to aid Anqing in its reconstruction, hoping that it will convince them to participate in the Reclamation War to retake Beijing. If we commit as well, this will surely improve their odds."
japfor.257.a: "We'll commit resources."
japfor.257.b: "This isn't worth it."

japfor.258.t: "Anqing Begins Reconstruction"
japfor.258.d: "With our assistance, Anqing has started reconstruction."
japfor.258.a: "Good."

japfor.259.t: "Anqing Abandons Reclamation"
japfor.259.d: "Anqing has broken away from the reclamation project, and Fengtian has drawn a line in the sand. We have had to stop sending them aid for their reconstruction."
japfor.259.a: "So be it."

japfor.260.t: "Anqing Abandons Reclamation"
japfor.260.d: "Anqing has broken away from the reclamation project, but Fengtian decided not to remove them from reconstruction, things seem like they are able to go on regardless."
japfor.260.a: "That's good to hear."

japfor.261.t: "Anqing Abandons Reclamation"
japfor.261.d: "Anqing has broken away from the reclamation project, and while Fengtian decided not to remove them from reconstruction, Anqing broke away of their own accord regardless."
japfor.261.a: "Well that was pointless."

### New Foreign Policy Events ###

japfor.316.t: "Japan Claims The Pacific"
japfor.316.d: "The Japanese have issued a formal statement declaring their intent to occupy our Pacific holdings, on the grounds that the chaos in America creates the need for a "safety cordon" to protect them. Quite what they need protection from, they're deliberately unclear about, but they're sending troops even as we speak."
japfor.316.a: "We don't have time for this!"
japfor.316.b: "Object to their aggression."

japfor.317.t: "The Americans Give In"
japfor.317.d: "No objections have been registered by the Americans nominally in control of the Pacific islands we mean to occupy. It must therefore be assumed we shall have our way and take control."
japfor.317.a: "Subarashi!"

japfor.318.t: "The Americans Object"
japfor.318.d: "A diplomatic protest came in today, warning us that if we carry through our plan to occupy the Pacific islands we will face grave consequences."
japfor.318.a: "Call their bluff!"
japfor.318.b: "We will back down..."

japfor.319.t: "The Japanese Call Our Bluff"
japfor.319.d: "The Japanese have apparently decided that out threat of military action if they go ahead with their plan is a bluff, and are advancing on our Pacific islands regardless. It seems we have to decide if we mean to back up our words with actions..."
japfor.319.a: "If they want war, we'll give it to them!"
japfor.319.b: "We can't afford a war right now..."

japfor.401.t: "An Invitation from [From.GetNameDef]"
japfor.401.d.conf: "At the Tokyo Conference, Japanese officials brought up the notion of deeper economic ties between their nation and ours. Now they have approached the [Root.GetAdjective] government, presenting their offer to admit us into what they consider the economic part of their 'Co-Prosperity Sphere'. They say that we are free to join or refuse, as we desire."
japfor.401.d.noconf: "The Japanese government has approached us with an offer to join the economic part of their 'Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere'. With it, we would relax the rules for Japanese investment in [Root.GetNameDef], and bring with that investment a degree of prosperity and independence from 'Western Imperialism'. Some say, however, that this would simply be exchanging Western Imperialism for Japanese Imperialism, and that we should beware opening a box we may not be able to close again."
japfor.401.a: "We agree to their offer."
japfor.401.b: "We've no need of this."

japfor.402.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
japfor.402.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has seen the wisdom and economic benefits that becoming part of our economic sphere would bring. They have agreed to our terms."
japfor.402.a: "Excellent."

japfor.403.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
japfor.403.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government, perhaps fearing our true motives, has declined our offer to join the Japanese economic sphere."
japfor.403.a: "An unwise choice."

japfor.405.t: "Increased Japanese Investment"
japfor.405.d: "With active encouragement by the [From.GetAdjective] government, investors from [From.GetNameDef] have been arriving in [Root.GetNameDef] in droves. Their presence will have some benefits, it's true, but there is a growing fear that this domination by the [From.GetAdjective] economy will ultimately see us beholden to the [From.GetAdjective] government... if we are not already."
japfor.405.a: "Investors means more money, right?"

japfor.406.t: "Investors Build Factories"
japfor.406.d: "The Japanese investors in [Root.GetNameDef] have been busy creating new factories - a measurable benefit from our participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, it seems."
japfor.406.a: "That's good!"

japfor.407.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Subservience to Japan"
japfor.407.d: "If there were concerns about Japan's continued investment in [Root.GetNameDef] leading to their domination, they can be set aside - it has already come to pass. [Root.GetAdjective] policy is already routinely made to please Japanese interests, and any thoughts we had of our independence have slowly become a polite fiction. The arrival of several 'advisers' from [From.GetNameDef] has laid to rest any idea that we may act as we wish within the Co-Prosperity Sphere."
japfor.407.a: "So be it"

japfor.408.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Ends Alliance"
japfor.408.d: "Foolishly, the [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to end its military alliance with us. It seems they feel they can make it without our assistance."
japfor.408.a: "We shall see."

japfor.409.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Withdraws from Sphere"
japfor.409.d: "Panicked by some irrational fears about us dominating it, the [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to end its participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, cutting the ties between the [From.GetAdjective] economy and ours."
japfor.409.a: "How foolish."

japfor.410.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Investments Nationalised"
japfor.410.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has taken the drastic step of forcibly nationalising the investments we've made into [From.GetNameDef], also withdrawing their place in the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the process. Perhaps they worried about the prospect of Japanese control over their economy? If so, they have handed us the excuse to invade - if we desire to take them up on their provocation."
japfor.410.a: "Leave them be."
japfor.410.b: "We shall teach them a lesson!"

japfor.411.t: "[withdraw_country.GetNameDefCap] Leaves Economic Sphere"
japfor.411.d: "Having joined the [withdraw_country.GetFactionName], [withdraw_country.GetNameDef] can no longer be considered part of our economic sphere. They will have to go."
japfor.411.a: "A foolish move on their part."

japfor.412.t: "Withdrawing from the Japanese Sphere"
japfor.412.d: "With our joining the [Root.GetFactionName], we can no longer be considered part of Japan's economic sphere."
japfor.412.a: "So be it!"

japfor.420.t: "Investors Build Dockyards"
japfor.420.d: "The Japanese investors in [Root.GetNameDef] have been busy creating new dockyards - a measurable benefit from our participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere it seems."
japfor.420.a: "Very nice!"

japfor.421.t: "Japan Sends Naval Advisors"
japfor.421.d: "As part of naval development program sponsored by Japanese Empire, group of Advisors came from Japan to aid us with our naval program. They are highly knowledgable in many aspects, so it is up to use to direct them to where would be most useful."
japfor.421.a: "Direct them to assist our engineers."
japfor.421.b: "We could use the help of their tactical expertise."
japfor.421.c: "Some practical experience from training exercises would be best."

japfor.422.t: "First Prosperity Ships"
japfor.422.d: "The Japanese engineers which came to [Root.GetNameDef] have been busy teaching our dockyard workers how to build modern Japanese cargo ships, so called "Prosperity ships" - a measurable benefit from our participation in the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere it seems."
japfor.422.a: "Great news!"

japfor.423.t: "Japan Wants Control of our Dockyards"
japfor.423.d: "The Japanese army and naval official this morning officially demanded control of all dockyards built by their companies in our country. They are reasoning that during these hard wartimes, naval production must be unified under their command."
japfor.423.a: "Very well."
japfor.423.b: "Who do they think they are?"

japfor.424.t: "Japan Returns Dockyards to Us"
japfor.424.d: "As our common threat is no more there is no legal reason for Japan to have control over our dockyards any more and as such they have returned them to us."
japfor.424.a: "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."

japfor.425.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Naval Advisors"
japfor.425.d: "This morning we received request from [From.GetNameDef] to send small number of our advisors to help in their naval development."
japfor.425.a: "A worthy request."
japfor.425.b: "Oh, I don't think so."

japfor.426.t: "Japan Denies Our Request"
japfor.426.d: "Sadly Japan has denied our request to send us naval advisors."
japfor.426.a: "A shame."

japfor.427.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Denies Control of Dockyards"
japfor.427.d: "In a truly audacious move, we have been denied control of the very dockyards we worked to create. While it would be diplomatically ill-advised to react straight away, we will not forget this betrayal. They will regret this."
japfor.427.a: "So much for being allies."

japfor.450.t: "Japan Embargoes [Root.GetNameDef]!"
japfor.450.d: "For months we have been worried about the extent of Japanese ambitions and their aggressive moves in the South Pacific, and now we have reason to be. They have stated their intent to lead their sphere of influence to immediately end trade with [Root.GetNameDef], calling us an 'outpost of European colonialism and imperialism in Asia'. The strain this could place on our economy is not to be underestimated..."
japfor.450.a: "We can endure this."
japfor.450.b: "This means a trade war!"
japfor.450.c: "We should draw closer to Japan."

japfor.451.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Retaliates!"
japfor.451.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has imposed tariffs back on us! This gives us precisely the casus belli we were hoping for!"
japfor.451.a: "Yes, but not just yet..."
japfor.451.b: "Respond with military action!"

japfor.452.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Asks for Closer Ties"
japfor.452.d: "In response to our embargo, the [From.GetAdjective] government has asked to become part of our economic sphere, clearly believing it is better to work with us than against us."
japfor.452.a: "Even better!"

japfor.453.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Does Nothing"
japfor.453.d: "The cowardly [From.GetAdjective] government has elected to do nothing in response to our embargo. They intend to simply endure it. If we wish to draw them into a war, we will have to do it the hard way."
japfor.453.a: "So be it!"

japfor.454.t: "Japan is Preparing to Attack"
japfor.454.d: "Increasingly frequent reports from Tokyo, Yokohama, and Nagasaki have begun to build a worrying picture; one of plans being laid, ships outfitted, and ammunition stocked. These are preparations for war. In a matter of weeks we may face the full force of the imperial Japanese military."
japfor.454.a: "We have precious little time to prepare"

japfor.455.t: "Japan Seems to Plan an Attack"
japfor.455.d: "We have gathered intelligence suggesting Japan is seeking to take over our colony in the Dutch East Indies. Our military experts warn that we might not be able to fend off such an invasion, considering the state of the Japanese and government navies and the size of the Japanese military. They suggest that we go to the kaiser and beg him for help: their interest, maintaining the status-quo, aligns with ours and a Japanese takeover would threaten their possessions too. This might be our best shot at maintaining our colonial possession."
japfor.455.a: "Message Berlin!"
japfor.455.b: "Surely this isn't necessary..."

japfor.456.t: "The Dutch Beg for Help"
japfor.456.d: "The Dutch discovered evidence that the Japanese are planning to invade their colony; realising that they would never be able to defend their colony with their largely overextended colonial army and limited naval assets compared to Japan. They point out however, that a Japanese takeover of their colony would severely upset our own defensive situation, and there is no doubt at all that the Japanese seek to evict us from the region as well!"
japfor.456.a: "We shall help you!"
japfor.456.b: "Clog-wearers shouldn't have colonies anyhow..."

japfor.457.t: "Germany Helps Out"
japfor.457.d: "The Germans have agreed to help protect the Dutch East Indies from our joint Japanese menace that's seeking to take our colony away."
japfor.457.a: "A toast to our friends!"

japfor.458.t: "Germany Refuses to Protect Us!"
japfor.458.d: "The Germans let us know that it would not be in their best interest to give their protection to our colonial possessions in the Indies. It seems we stand alone!"
japfor.458.a: "We can defend the Indies ourselves, right?"

japfor.459.t: "Insulindia Stands Alone"
japfor.459.d: "Unable or unwilling to get help, Insulindia now sits alone. Their military is a fraction of the size of ours and their leaders weak; nothing shall stop us."
japfor.459.a: "Banzai!"

japfor.460.t: "Insulindia Resists with German backing"
japfor.460.d: "The Germans have agreed to help protect the Dutch East Indies from us! While we still can attack, we should think carefully about if we are willing to start such a war."
japfor.460.a: "We will not be swayed."
japfor.460.b: "Perhaps now is not the time."

japfor.461.t: "Japan Pursues Divide and Conquer Strategy"
japfor.461.d: "It seems that Japan's long-standing claims to the legitimacy of our government, not to mention 'fraternal asian brotherhood', were nothing more than lip service. They are now moving towards a divide and conquer strategy for all of China. Our China. While this does signal that war with them might come sooner than we think, it has also damaged the standing of the Concordia Association, giving us more room to manoeuvre."
japfor.461.a: "They will regret this."

japfor.462.t: "Japan Pursues the Burn to Ash Strategy"
japfor.462.d: "Word of abuses by Japanese troops against Chinese civilians have made their way to our ears for some time now. The Japanese Consulate in Mukden always assured us that these were exaggerated, and that where such crimes did occur they were the fault of indisciplined troops; an exception rather than the norm. However, Japan has now done the unthinkable. It has not only signalled open support for these horrific atrocities, but it has codified them as part of an official strategy. Such unparalleled barbarism cannot be tolerated, and we cannot afford to be painted guilty by association. Fortunately the pro-Japanese Concordia Association will have a hard time explaining this one away, will lose influence in our government."
japfor.462.a: "We must seriously consider a new direction."

japfor.463.t: "Japan Reveals its Ambitions"
japfor.463.d: "Referencing unspecified 'recent events on the continent' as justification, the Japanese Government has announced its intent to begin a comprehensive colonial programme centered on the Northeast, and including all areas newly under Japanese administration. Soon, Sakura trees may line the Zhaode Dajie in Shenyang and Tiannanmen in Beijing. Our exact position in this new order is unclear, but we will not suffer the same fate as Korea; the Japanese must go, Concordia Association and all."
japfor.463.a: "Japan has made its choice."

japfor.464.t: "Japan Rewards Our Loyalty"
japfor.464.d: "In their wisdom, the Japanese government has decided to reward our loyalty, returning back to us land that is rightfully ours. While we are of course pleased at such a gesture, we must be careful; the Concordia Association has gained much support as a result, which will make it more difficult for us to oppose Japan in the future, should we wish to."
japfor.464.a: "That land should have been ours in the first place."

japfor.465.t: "The Enemy Has Overwhelming Force"
japfor.465.d: "By now it is become common knowledge that our enemies force far outnumber ours. What began as rumours from our intelligence service has now ended up coming true. While we will do what we can to keep public moral up, even our most steadfast supports are starting to question if continuing the fight is worth it; are we just prolonging the inevitable at this point?"
japfor.465.a: "There must be time to turn it around..."

japfor.466.t: "We Have Overwhelming Force"
japfor.466.d: "It has become increasingly clear to both us and Japan that our forces far outnumber theirs. As news of this has trickled down to the Japanese general public there is increasing unrest and support for their government is falling. If we maintain this advantage they will surely capitulate even sooner than we had hoped."
japfor.466.a: "What excellent news!"

### Fengtian Events ###
japfeng.1.t: "Our Influence In Manchuria"
japfeng.1.d: "For many years now we have worked to gain control of Manchuria, and in the long-run all of China, by means of a group of Pan-Asian interests known as the Concordia Association. This is a political party that seeks to promote pro-Japanese views in [FNG.GetNameDef] and keep [FNG.GetLeader] subservient. In the long-run, its goals are to extend Japanese economic control over Manchuria further in partnership with Mantetsu, and slowly bring China proper into our orbit too.\n\nStanding apart from the politics of Manchuria's civilian authorities is our own military, the notoriously ambitious Kwantung Army. For decades now the army has sought to conquer and annex Manchuria, and their preferred methods and patience for working with the likes of [FNG.GetLeader] are infamously brutal and low respectively.\n\n Recently the government's policy aims have changed, the war situation we find ourselves facing makes the political independence of [FNG.GetNameDef] less and less suitable as certain allies become more valuable.\n\nWe face a choice: do we trust in the Concordia Association and the soft power they have steadily built up, or will we let the army off its leash and bring Zhang down by any means necessary?"
japfeng.1.a: "If the bird will not sing..."

japfeng.2.t: "A Sea Change..."
japfeng.2.d: "It's hard to detect at first: coldness from officials, curt diplomatic communications, increased activity from the Kwantung garrison but no actual indication of what they are up to. All signs point to something happening in the Japanese government that bodes ill for us. Let us hope we have the strength to weather this coming storm."
japfeng.2.a: "China cannot dance to their tune forever."

japfeng.3.t: "Pushing For A Decision"
japfeng.3.d: "The time has come to decide: where do our intentions lie with the Fengtian Government we have supported this long? Their loyalty to us was always questionable. What will we do with it?"
japfeng.3.a: "... destroy it."
japfeng.3.b: "... coax it."
japfeng.3.c: "... wait for it."

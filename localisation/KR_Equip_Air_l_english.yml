 ALB_CAS_equipment_1: "Aero Vodochody A.101"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_1_short: "A.101"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_1_desc: "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
 ALB_CAS_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_2_short: "WM.231"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_2_desc: "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 ALB_CAS_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_3_short: "WM.44"
 ALB_CAS_equipment_3_desc: "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 ALB_fighter_equipment_0: "Phönix D.V"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_0_short: "D.V"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_0_desc: "Adopted by the Austrian Air Force in 1933, dozens of D.Vs were provided to Albania by the Dual-Monarchy. Basic domestic production on a small scale was also begun."
 ALB_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia B.534"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_1_short: "B.534"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
 ALB_fighter_equipment_2: "Avia B.135"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_2_short: "B.135"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
 ALB_fighter_equipment_3: "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_3_short: "B.224"
 ALB_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_1: "Avia Bf.262"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short: "Bf.262"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a licence to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_2: "Letov L.52"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short: "L.52"
 ALB_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š.328.v"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š.328.v"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "The Š.328.v was the seaplane derivative of the Š.28 series. It was armed with two forward-firing 8mm machine guns and two more in a flexible mount at the rear, and had a payload capacity of around 500kg."
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_2: "Lohner-Fokker T.VIII W/C"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short: "T.VIII W/C"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "Lohner, a company that previously made seaplanes and flying boats for the k.u.k. Seefliegerkorps during the war, acquired the rights to produce the Fokker T.VIII for the Austro-Hungarian Navy."
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.442"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.442"
 ALB_nav_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.442 is the seaplane variant of the WM.44 made for the Seefliegerkorps, intended for Adriatic and Mediterranean anti-ship operations."

 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_1: "Praga E.51"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short: "E.51"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_2: "Weiss Manfréd WM.31"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short: "WM.31"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arose over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.50"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short: "WM.50"
 ALB_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_0: "Avia F.39"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short: "F.39"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc: "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newer models were developed."
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov Š-50"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "Š-50"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero Vodochody A.300"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "A.300"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconnaissance aircraft."
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_3: "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short: "WM.311"
 ALB_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc: "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1: "Letov L.11"
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short: "L.11"
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc: "Based on a jet fighter design by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the L.11 adapted the design into a fast and light jet bomber for multiple roles, hoping to replace the Monarchy's fleet of older prop-driven tactical bombers."
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2: "Aero L.44"
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short: "L.44"
 ALB_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc: "With the reliability of jet engines increasing and competition ever-so fierce, Aero tackled the challenge to design a next-generation fast-bomber, culminating into the L.44 fast bomber."

 BUL_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Like the B-34, this model was also adopted by the Bulgarians, and unlike its predecessor, the B-534 was also adopted by the Dual Monarchy."

 BUL_fighter_equipment_2_short: "DAR 11"
 BUL_fighter_equipment_2_desc: "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire. The DAR company acquired the right to produce the craft within Bulgaria due to its impressive performance in Habsburg service. Slight modifications were made by the DAR company, but the craft remains essentially the same."

 BUL_fighter_equipment_3_desc: "When DAR chief designer Zvetan Lazarov's DAR-10A based fighter was rejected by the company in favour of a domestically modified derivative of the Avia company's B-135, he and his team went back to the drawing board entirely, ultimately designing an entirely new high-altitude fighter, the first entirely domestically-produced Bulgarian aircraft to feature a pressurised cockpit. The fighter was accepted into Bulgarian service as the DAR-12."

CRO_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecesors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."

While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead.

This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit.

GAL_CAS_equipment_1:0 "Aero Vodochody A.101"
GAL_CAS_equipment_1_short:0 "A.101"
GAL_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecesors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
GAL_CAS_equipment_2:0 "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
GAL_CAS_equipment_2_short:0 "WM.231"
GAL_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the aging fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
GAL_CAS_equipment_3:0 "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
GAL_CAS_equipment_3_short:0 "WM.44"
GAL_CAS_equipment_3_desc:0 "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

GAL_fighter_equipment_0:0 "Phönix D.V"
GAL_fighter_equipment_0_short:0 "D.V"
GAL_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would ressurect the D.IV monicker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
GAL_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Avia B.534"
GAL_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "B.534"
GAL_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
GAL_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Avia B.135"
GAL_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "B.135"
GAL_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equiped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
GAL_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
GAL_fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "B.224"
GAL_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Avia Bf.262"
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "Bf.262"
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a license to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Letov L.52"
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "L.52"
GAL_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Š.328.v"
GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Š.328.v was the seaplane derivative of the Š.28 series. It was armed with two forward-firing 8mm machine guns and two more in a flexible mount at the rear, and had a payload capacity of around 500kg."
GAL_nav_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Lohner-Fokker T.VIII W/C"

GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "E.51"
GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."

GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "WM.31"
GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arised over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."

GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "WM.50"
GAL_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short:0 "F.39"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc:0 "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newed models were developed."
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Letov Š-50"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Š-50"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Aero Vodochody A.300"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "A.300"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconaissance aircract."
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_3:0 "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "WM.311"
GAL_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."
GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Letov L.11"
GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "L.11"
GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Based on a jet fighter design by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the L.11 adapted the design into a fast and light jet bomber for multiple roles, hoping to replace the Monarchy's fleet of older prop-driven tactical bombers."
GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Aero L.44"
GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "L.44"
GAL_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the reliability of jet engines increasing and competition ever-so fierce, Aero tackled the challenge to design a next-generation fast-bomber, culminating into the L.44 fast bomber."

SLO_CAS_equipment_1:0 "Aero Vodochody A.101"
SLO_CAS_equipment_1_short:0 "A.101"
SLO_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecesors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."
SLO_CAS_equipment_2:0 "Weiss Manfréd WM.231"
SLO_CAS_equipment_2_short:0 "WM.231"
SLO_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the aging fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
SLO_CAS_equipment_3:0 "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
SLO_CAS_equipment_3_short:0 "WM.44"
SLO_CAS_equipment_3_desc:0 "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

SLO_fighter_equipment_0:0 "Phönix D.V"
SLO_fighter_equipment_0_short:0 "D.V"
SLO_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would ressurect the D.IV monicker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."
SLO_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Avia B.534"
SLO_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "B.534"
SLO_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
SLO_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Avia B.135"
SLO_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "B.135"
SLO_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equiped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."
SLO_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Avia-Ikarus B.224"
SLO_fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "B.224"
SLO_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_1:0 "Avia Bf.262"
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "Bf.262"
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Lagging behind in the development of jet fighters, Avia acquired a license to produce the Bf 262 for the Fliegerkorps, replacing the German 30mm guns with locally-produced 20mm guns in their slightly-revised design."
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Letov L.52"
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "L.52"
SLO_jet_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "When Austro-Daimler developed the U2 'Uzelac' engine, Letov produced a state-of-the-art jet fighter that would become the Monarchy's first local jet aircraft adopted into service."

SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Š.328.v"
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Š.328.v was the seaplane derivative of the Š.28 series. It was armed with two forward-firing 8mm machine guns and two more in a flexible mount at the rear, and had a payload capacity of around 500kg."
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Lohner-Fokker T.VIII W/C"
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "T.VIII W/C"
SLO_nav_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Lohner, a company that previously made seaplanes and flying boats for the k.u.k. Seefliegerkorps during the war, acquired the rights to produce the Fokker T.VIII for the Austro-Hungarian Navy."

SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "E.51"
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initially designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, it was quickly determined that the E.51 could be quickly adapted as a heavy fighter to counter strategic bombers."

SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "WM.31"
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Hungarian aviation engineer László Varga designed this 3-seat fighter around experimental gas turbine engines. However, technical difficulties arised over the engines and were replaced by two Austro-Daimler V12D instead. Notably, the WM.31 was of mixed construction."
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Weiss Manfréd WM.50"
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "WM.50"
SLO_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The WM.50 was a rather advanced designed for its time: The two engine push-pull configuration, twin-boom aircraft by Lázló Varga was designed to significantly improve the performance of two-engine fighters to counter high-altitude bombers."

SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short:0 "F.39"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc:0 "Originally developed by Fokker as a transport craft, the F.IX, the Avia company quickly saw the plane's military potential, and upon receiving a licence for the aircraft, redesigned the F.IX as a bomber, the F.39. The Dual Monarchy, lacking sufficient bombers, adopted the F.39 as a stopgap while newed models were developed."
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Letov Š-50"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Š-50"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Intending to fill the Fliegerkorps' request for a multirole two-engine, three-man crew aircraft, Letov submitted the Š-50. However, the design did not catch interest and would never be produced, with Aero's design being eventually adopted instead."
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Aero Vodochody A.300"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "A.300"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "This bomber design by Antonín Husník was, when it entered service, one of the fastest aircraft in inventory, only behind the newly-adopted B.135 fighter. Fast and with a good payload, it proved to be a versatile bomber and reconaissance aircract."
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_3:0 "Weiss Manfréd WM.311"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "WM.311"
SLO_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "The WM.31 was quickly adapted to perform the role of a fast, tactical bomber by weakening its offensive armament and improving its payload capacity."
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Letov L.11"
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "L.11"
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Based on a jet fighter design by the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the L.11 adapted the design into a fast and light jet bomber for multiple roles, hoping to replace the Monarchy's fleet of older prop-driven tactical bombers."
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Aero L.44"
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "L.44"
SLO_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the reliability of jet engines increasing and competition ever-so fierce, Aero tackled the challenge to design a next-generation fast-bomber, culminating into the L.44 fast bomber."

TRS_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecesors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."

TRS_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the aging fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."

TRS_CAS_equipment_3_short:0 "WM.44"
TRS_CAS_equipment_3_desc:0 "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers.

TRS_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would ressurect the D.IV monicker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."

TRS_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "B.534"
TRS_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."
TRS_fighter_equipment_2:0 "Avia B.135"
TRS_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "B.135"
TRS_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equiped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."

TRS_fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "B.224"
TRS_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Essentially the final evolution of Novotný's design, with help from Kosta Sivčev as well as the Illyrian Ikarus company, the B.224's engine was upgraded the excellent 1000 hp Austro-Daimler V12E and the machine guns were replaced by two Gebauer 12.7mm motor-driven heavy machine guns, increasing its speed and firepower over its predecessor. Notable is the new bubble canopy for the pilot and sleek fuselage."

The Ar 576 feautres a unique engine design whereby all four jet engines are inlaid in the wing of the aircraft; it was the jarring sound these engines make when spinning up, a sound like that of a hammer being slammed against the fuselage, that the Ar 576 earned the nickname 'hammer' among German test pilots."

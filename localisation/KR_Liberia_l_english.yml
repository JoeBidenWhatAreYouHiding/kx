### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_MOMOLU_MASSAQUOI_DESC:0 "Holding the honor of being the first African diplomat to the powers of Europe, Momulu Massaquoi has lived a long and honorable life. Being born in 1869 as heir to two kingdoms of the Vai people of Liberia and Sierra Leone, Momulu’s family had hoped he would take to reading the Koran and become a holy man like his grandfather. Instead, he was influenced by the Americo-Liberians and became a Christian. Learning Protestant ideals and English from these new settlers, Momulu went on to be educated in the United States until the death of his mother forced him to take up the mantle of her throne as he returned home to his people. Spending the next few decades traveling between the United States, Liberia, and the growing power of the Kaiserreich, Momulu built a storied and respected career on his path to develop a solid, free, and independent African civilization founded on solid Christian principles. Now, after decades of service to his people and years of service to the Kaiserreich as Liberia’s consul general to the Kaiser, Momulu has finally ascended to rule over not just the Vai people, but all of Liberia. Though his health is failing as this aging giant of a dying age reaches the end of his twilight years, King Albert as he has been called still stands as a unifying force for his people, and under his watch, Liberia will be civilized and pious!"
POLITICS_EDWIN_BARCLAY_DESC:0 "Following the rapturous scandal that enveloped True Whig Party under King’s corrupt regime, the right wing of the TWP needed a new face more than ever before, and in their need, they have found Edwin James Barclay. Born in 1882 to Barbadian immigrants, numbering among the few Afro-Caribbeans within the larger Americo-Liberian minority, Barclay spent his young life writing patriotic poetry and compositions before dipping his toe into politics. Joining up with the TWP in the 1920s while working under the King administration, Barclay has steadily risen through the ranks of the TWP’s various camps and now stands as the face of the newly reborn, post-King TWP coalition. Under Barclay, TWP dominance shall continue in Liberia, but under a softer, more agreeable, and less corrupt hand."

Under Barclay, TWP dominance shall continue in Liberia, but under a softer, more agreeable, and less corrupt hand."
POLITICS_FRANK_TOLBERT_DESC:0 "As the son of the former chairman of the TWP, Frank Emmanuel Tolbert has always had large shoes to fill. Born in 1910 into one of Liberia’s powerful Americo-Liberian families, Frank Tolbert was educated at Liberia College before easing into politics as a young man with the aid of his father and later with the help of his mentor William Tubman. Now, Tolbert stands as president of Liberia and as the new face of the True Whigs, serving as the direct leader of both the conservative wing of the party and the Masonic Order of Liberia in the wake of former-president King and his disgraceful scandal. With Tolbert at the helm and the Masonic Lodges behind him, much isn’t expected to change for Liberia, but many remain hopeful that maybe this new, young face can be the fresh start Liberia and the TWP need to cast off their tarnished reputation."
POLITICS_LOUIS_GRIMES_DESC:0 "Though he has strayed from the main party line of the TWP, Louis Arthur Grimes still stands as one of the most respected men in the nation. Despite his increasingly ‘liberal’ slant when compared to his contemporaries in the TWP like Barclay or Tubman, Grimes still stands as a titan within the TWP’s main power structure. Born in 1883, Grimes received higher education at the esteemed Liberia College that served as the alma mater for much of the TWP’s political machine, and went on to become a lawyer and later jurist, rising quickly through the ranks until becoming first Chief Justice and eventually Secretary of State under the King administration. With this meteoric career behind him, Grimes has amassed the needed political clout to be able to further distance himself from the conservative core of the True Whigs, and now seeks to steer Liberia towards the light of liberalism and fair democracy."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_TUBMAN_DESC:0 "Few politicians within Liberia have achieved the same level of prominence and influence that the now-disgraced President King have, but William Tubman is definitely one of them. Born in 1895 as William Vacanarat Shadrach Tubman to a politically active preacher for a father, Tubman learned discipline and the value of hard work at a young age. Denied education within the American South, despite desperate pleas from his well-connected mother, the young Tubman endeavored to learn as much as he could here in his home nation and not in the homeland of his freedmen parents. After receiving a Methodist education and entering military school to become an officer, Tubman briefly became a preacher as he studied law and bounced around from career to career, finding work as a court reporter, a teacher, a tax collector, and even as a militia colonel. After accumulating this vast array of varied knowledge and skills, Tubman entered the political arena and joined the TWP, winning his first local election in 1923 at age 28 and starting his climb to power from there, using his vast experience with the various groups of Liberia to bolster his ability to relate to and rule his fellow countrymen. Now, this seasoned veteran of the Liberian political landscape has finally escaped the shadow of Charles King and stands on his own as President of Liberia. Under Tubman, Liberia shall become a true land of liberty for all Liberians, both American and African in descent, to revel in."
POLITICS_GEORGE_PADMORE_DESC:0 "How and why a Trinidadian Pan-Africanist author has come to lead the Poro is a mystery to many even within our own nation, but this is now the strange reality Liberia finds itself in. Born in 1903 as Malcom Ivan Meredith Nurse in the British West Indies, Padmore worked as a reporter in his youth and received higher education in both his native land and in the United States, where he became involved with numerous Socialist organizations and notably worked alongside William Z. Foster. With the fall of the Reds in Russia and the rise of the Syndicalists in Western Europe, Padmore felt inspired by this rising tide of Socialist thought. Using his established ties with Liberian Pan-African nationalist and thinker Edward Blyden, Padmore packed his bags from Monrovia at the turn of the decade, seeing Liberia as the perfect opportunity to continue this Socialist cascade in Africa, seeing as it is one of the sole native-rule nations on the continent. Since his arrival, he has endeavored with the few other Socialists within the nation to finally let the voices of the native Afro-Liberians be heard. Using contacts within the native tribes of the Hinterlands, Padmore now stands as the face of the Poro, though their traditional power structures and hierarchies still remain in-tact behind this facade of Totalist unity. Under his stewardship, the Afro-Liberians finally have a voice, and now the nation slowly and violently lurches towards Socialist governance, for it is Liberia’s destiny to become the glowing beacon of a Socialist future for this Dark Continent."
POLITICS_CHRISTIE_DESC:0 "Lansdell K. Christie stands as Harvey Firestone’s right hand man in Liberia, and now in the wake of Firestone’s absence, it has fallen upon Christie to rule Liberia and run the Firestone Company’s local operations in the area as acting C.E.O. of the Liberia branch of the company. Born in 1903 in Brooklyn, Christie attended West Point to seek higher education and upon his graduation, he founded his own maritime transportation company to seize on New York’s growing naval commerce sector. Ever-following the scent of profit and opportunity, Christie then embarked to Liberia where he established his own mining concern with the aid of Firestone funding. Earning the attention of Firestone himself though his own savvy business techniques, Christie was taken under the again titan of industry’s wing and has since risen to the top of the Firestone Company's hierarchy. Now, as acting C.E.O, Christie seeks to implement his modernizing and innovating ‘Christie Plan’ to transform Liberia into a glowing beacon of ‘Americanism’ on this Dark Continent' for all Americans and Americo-Liberians to profit off of and prosper in."
POLITICS_GRAND_LODGE_DESC:0 "Since the first white-capped ships arrived on our shores, bringing freedmen to the Windward Coast, the True Whigs have dominated Liberian politics. However, behind them has always stood the looming and ever-present Masonic Order of Liberia. In 1822, the Freemasons that fled from the Negro lodges of the American South founded by the famed abolitionist Prince Hall found themselves on our shores, and over the initial decades of our new nation’s life, these masons conspired and schemed to take control over Liberia’s heart. Among their original numbers stood the first presidents and leaders of this new Liberian republic, and under their guidance, the Masonic Order of Liberia was established, acting as a vital and integral piece of the TWP’s hierarchy from its earliest foundations. In the decades since, Masonic influence has only spread throughout the TWP and wider Liberia, and now their machinations have finally paid off as the Masonic Order truly rules Liberia without need for facade or fronts. Under the unified front of the Lodges, Liberia will finally rid itself of the festering cancers that plague its stability, like unnecessary outside influences and untrustworthy democratic principles. Under the Masonic Order, Liberia will know stability and security at last."
POLITICS_HARVEY_FIRESTONE_DESC:0 "Born December 20, 1868 on the farm his grandfather build with his own two hands, Harvey Samuel Firestone is one of the most controversial figures in Liberia, and yet to the world at large, he is seen as simply another successful American businessman. Founding Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in 1900 to sell tires for the growing tire market in America, becoming the chief supplier of tires for Ford Motor Company. It would not be long until Firestone, seeing the need for more rubber, would open the Firestone Natural Rubber plantation in Harbel in 1926. Over the years, Firestone become a close ally of the TWP, providing valuable taxes and lining the pockets of key figures within the government to 'keep the wheels turning.' While this special relationship was almost brought into the open by Thomas Faulkner in 1930, the TWP was able to mostly fight these allegations, using resources and lawyers provided by Firestone himself. Even when Hoover suspended relations to press Monrovia into compliance, Firestone stood behind his allies in the TWP. However, with Fitzgerald breaking the news as he did, the TWP could no longer stand. With movement from radicals, Firestone used his connections and couped the TWP, finally securing his complete grip over Liberia. If Firestone will be able to maintain his grip in the face of native backlash remains to be seen."
POLITICS_HARVEY_FIRESTONE_JR_DESC:0 "Born on April 20, 1898, Harvey Samuel Firestone Jr. is in many ways a perfect reflection of his father. Jr learned the family trade from an early age, his father appointing him head of Firestone's steel products division. Jr was also one of most important people in the Liberian plantation project, pushing his father to invest more heavily on his pet project. From there, he would slowly climb the corporate ladder, gaining more and more control of Firestone until his father's death propelled him into the executive chair.  Along with taking control of Firestone proper, Harvey II has inherited his father's seat as the hidden benefactor behind the Republic of Liberia. Unlike his father however, Jr does not plan to be as coy with his use of power. Already spending considerable time within the nation, it is expected that Harvey II will be much more direct in his rule, directly wielding power instead of hiding behind a puppet government. While it is doubtful he'll completely do away with the TWP figurehead who nominally rules Liberia, what little power the government does still have will surely be stripped away. Either way,  Firestone has big shoes to fill, and it remains to be seen how he'll steer both his company and Liberia along with it."
POLITICS_CHARLES_KING_DESC:0 "Charles Dunbar Burgess King rules Liberia as one of the most controversial and divisive figures in all of Liberian history. Born in 1875 and joining politics at a young age due to his family’s political connections, King has long been a fixture within the TWP, but since becoming president, his reputation quickly morphed from being a optimistic reformer to being a cold-hearted and utilitarian demagogue. Though his economic and social reforms have been met with lukewarm responses, his presidency has been marred by one scandal after another. Winning some of the most dubious and likely fraudulent elections ever seen has allowed him to stay in power for over a decade and a half, but the recent accusations over his regime’s usage of slavery and forced labor have proven to be almost too much too handle. Now, hated by most within the nation, King must walk a delicate line if he is to stay in power here in this crumbling republic, lest he fall prey to the wolves that seek to tear down all he has built. Liberia’s future hangs in the balance within the palm of King’s hand, and only he can dictate which way this future shall play out."
POLITICS_CLARENCE_SIMPSON_DESC:0 "A true believer in the TWP’s mantra and a committed Freemason, Clarence Lorenzo Simpson, Sr., now rules over Liberia with the backing of the Masonic Lodge of Liberia. Born in 1896 to American and Vai parents, Simpson long was torn between the two halves of his identity - something he has tried to rectify all his life as seen in his policy and his unusually amicable opinion towards the native Afro-Liberians. Serving as a diplomat to the powers of the world during the peace talks that followed the Weltkrieg, Simpson proved to be a good face for the nation which helped launch his political career to new heights once he returned to Monrovia. Now, after serving as Secretary of State under King and as a speaker in the Liberian House of Representatives, Simpson has proven himself and has been given the opportunity to show this talent once more as the new face of Liberia and the new Mason-dominated TWP regime."
POLITICS_FAULKNER_DESC:0 "Born in North Carolina in 1869 and immigrating to Liberia in 1881, Thomas Jefferson Richlieu Faulkner can be, and has been, called everything from the truest patriot too the most heinous of traitors. Faulkner, prior to his introduction into politics was the very model of a self-made man. Operating an ice factory, ice cream plant and telephone system, Faulkner also owned the popular TJR Faulkner Ice Cream and Confectionery, and attempted to bring electricity to Monrovia. Running on his popularity within Monrovia, he was successfully elected Mayor, serving his term as the fires of the Weltkrieg were burning. Following his term as Mayor of Monrovia, Faulkner decided to throw his hat into the ring of national politics, running on the People's Party ticket for President during the 1927 elections. His platform was one of radical reform, most notably being increased rights for the native Afro-Liberians and calling for a decrease in presidential authority. Despite a seemingly high popularity within the nation, Faulkner stood no chance against the TWP's entrenched political machine, winning only 9,000 votes against King's 243,000 despite Liberia having fewer then 15,000 registered voters. Despite his loss, or perhaps in spite of it, Faulkner set out to bring reform to his nation from the ground up instead of the top down, as he had intended. Setting out a nation wide tour, he slowly gathered evidence and in 1930 a US commission, with aid from Faulkner, that Liberia did in fact practice a form of Slavery. While causing a great scandal, King was able to shake off these allegations with a few well placed bribes. Faulkner would once more try to run once against King in 1931, failing once again. In the aftermath of his second loss, many of Faulkner's business and factories were either seized or out right destroyed by the TWP government. Not a man to give up easily, Faulkner and his closest allies retreated to the Hinterland, to gain support among the natives or simply to avoid further repercussions, no one knew. However, following the aftermath of King's second Slavery Scandal, Faulkner finally made his move. Using tribal allies, he was able to enter Monrovia at the same time that Padmore was launching his own coup. Convincing the Legislature to appoint him president, Faulkner has finally made it to the Executive Mansion. Determined to bring reform to his beloved Liberia, Faulkner has a long journey ahead of him, even if he must pay lip service to the Third Internationale to get the aid Liberia so desperately needs."
POLITICS_FATIMA_MASSAQUOI_DESC:0 "Not many could have predicted that within a few short years, Liberia could transition from a corrupt and festering republic into a functional democratic constitutional monarchy, but history has a funny way of playing out sometimes. Born in 1912 in the Vai people’s lands in southern Sierra Leone, Fatima was educated by her father’s sister Mama Jassa until Momulu felt she was old enough to steward her himself. Pampering his favorite child, Fatima received only the best in everything, especially education. This ample opportunity coupled with her insatiable appetite for knowledge developed her already sharp and quick wit into a deeply analytical and inquisitive mind - a process that molded her into the famed academic she is today, allowing her to master a slew of fields from linguistics to sociology to anthropology and more. Now, Fatima Massaquoi, first of her name as the first Queen of Liberia, has finally returned from her strenuous and dedicated scholastic studies abroad in the United States and Germany to rule the Liberian people in her father’s stead - a final wish of a dying man. She is a beacon of modernity and progress on this blood-stained, long-corrupted strip of coast, and only under her tutelage can Liberia truly know the glory of modern civilization and fair democracy while still staying true to our native cultures and beliefs. Liberia will not lose its traditions as we strive towards modernity under Queen Fatima!"
POLITICS_ANTHONY_DASH_WILSON_DESC:0 "The new face of the TWP’s most ‘liberal’ and reform-orientated wing is the great and honorable Anthony Dashward Wilson Sr., honored statesman who has served Liberia and the TWP diligently since his entrance into politics. Born in 1898 into a massive family as one of the youngest sons of an Episcopal preacher, Wilson strove to make a name for himself apart from that of his family. Receiving his higher education at Cuttington College where he studied to become a lawyer, Wilson then broke out into the political scene working alongside William Tubman and Arthur Grimes as titans of the TWP’s more moderate wings. As he continued his law and justice work alongside his blossoming political career, Wilson further began to drift to the ‘left’ of the TWP’s spectrum, becoming something of a reformer - one particularly concerned with Liberia’s corrupt judiciary and monetary systems. Now, Wilson rules over Liberia as its President, allowing him to subject the nation to his whims as he champions his one-man crusade against corruption, kakistocracy, and self-serving interests."
POLITICS_HERB_DESC:0 "A former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and now the current President of the United States in exile, Herbert Hoover had solidified his position as one of the most hated men in American history. Despite only making the Great Depression worse during his first term, Hoover was reelected through the House of Representatives in 1932, causing widespread outrage. It's a sad reality for the President - any and all of his attempts for restoring the economy fail, his tries to calm the situation down only make it worse, and even his own party was turning away from him...\n\n That is all in the past now, however. America has fallen- no, America has been exiled, to Liberia. Destiny is a funny thing. Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same. Hoover will restore the rightful America with his Legion of exiles. The American people will remember him as the greatest president in the country’s history."

LIB_slavery_scandal_desc:0 "After losing the 1927 presidential election to Charles King, Thomas Faulkner accused many members of the True Whig Party government of recruiting and selling contract laborers as slaves. Despite the TWP’s firm denial of this heinous accusation and after refusing to cooperate in any attempt at an investigation, the United States established a commission under the leadership of British zoologist Cuthbert Christy to determine the extent of the alleged slavery ring. Then President Herbert Hoover briefly suspended relations with Monrovia to press the TWP into compliance. In 1930, the United States published the ‘Christy Report,’ which supported many of Faulkner's initial allegations and implicated many TWP officials, including Vice President Allen Yancy. It was found that forced labor, or modern slavery, was used for the construction of certain public works projects issued under the King administration, such as roads linking the Hinterland’s interiors and a rubber plantation expansion that was partially funded by Firestone. Furthermore, certain tribes still contiune practice domestic servitude that could be considered as slavery, further complicating the issue.

Our main cities; Monrovia, Marshall, Edina, Grand Bassa, Jacktown, Greenville, Nifu, Grand Cess, Garawa and Harper are where the vast majority of our Negro population is located. Beyond that there is only the Hinterland; a heavily desputed border region with National France and Westafrika full of unruly natives. Our control of this region is abysmally marginal and we as a nation effectively only exist on the coast."

LIB.1.t:0 "Welcome to Liberia, Land of the Free"
LIB.1.d:0 "At approximately the size of the state of Virginia, Liberia is an independent West African nation under the protection of the United States of America. The upper crust of society belongs to a solid voting bloc called the True Whig Party, which has won every major election since 1870. The Americo-Liberians were responsible for spreading Christianity to the natives, but have adopted some West African traditions along the way, and the local idea of Kwi, or anti-westernization, has stalled much of any potential progress. Secret Societies, such as the Poro for the lower classes and the Masonic Order of Liberia at the top ensure that the rich stay rich while the poor Afro-Liberian populations are left to govern themselves in secrecy. \n\nThe Weltkrieg was a dark and conspiratorial time for Liberia, with many key events steering the course of our fair nation, such as when the French listening post in Monrovia was nearly discovered, threatening relations with France. As the war raged, neighboring governments fell, and in its aftermath during the Revolution in Britain, Sierra Leone was occupied and then annexed by France, challenging our sovereignty, and again when borders moved during the rise of Mittelafrika and the consolidation of the French Algerian regime. The wave of Leonese refugees we took in during this turbulent time was only exceeded by the Ivorian refugees later, as Deutsche Mittelafrika seized the French colony of Cõ´te d'Ivoire in the confusion of the French Revolution, creating even more tensions. \n\nNow Liberia is engulfed by debt from failed projects, her economy in the hands of the Firestone Company, her president assailed by controversy over claims of slavery, and her future more uncertain than ever before. Will President Charles D. B. King, a legitimist in the True Whig party, be able to save Liberia from disaster, or will his demons finally catch up with him, throwing Liberia into chaos once more?"

LIB.2.t:0 "Race Relations in Liberia"
LIB.2.d:0 "Since the founding of our republic, the Americo-Liberian population, originally descended from freed black slaves from the southern United States, have held virtually all political and economic power in the country, much to the detriment of the more numerous indigenous Afro-Liberian peoples of the interior region, known as the Hinterland. Outside of the Poro, a native fraternity that started as ritualistic hunting parties that have evolved into a form of unofficial local government, the Afro-Liberian population has no representation within the Monrovian regime, and as such are largely neglected or actively oppressed by the True Whigs and the other Americo-Liberians. \n\nThe Citizenship Act of 1932 was intended to act as a tradeoff between representation and taxation, for the Liberian nation has long been in debt to foreign powers and desperately needed capital. In practice however, the Citizenship Act has been largely unenforced, with natives receiving no say in the government while being forcibly taxed at exorbitant rates. \n\nShould we force our governors to allow natives into provincial assembly halls, or are they within their rights to withhold the right to representation until the nation is once again stable?"

The Americo-Liberians at the top of society, especially members of the TWP, defer to the Masonic Order of Liberia for political advancement. At the lowest end of society, the Poro solidifies tribal identity and gives them an unofficial voice with shred of modern governance through its members’ role as tribal leaders. The propensity for secrecy in Liberia has led to a major disconnect in society, so much so we have a special word for it: Ifa Mo, or ‘do not speak it.’ We could empower members of the Poro and the Masons to join the government, and help reconstruct our economy through community service. Or we could justify banishing them from the public eye, saying that their activities are frivolous wastes of public funds."

LIB.8.t:0 "The Hut Tax Situation"
LIB.8.d:0 "The Hut tax system was used in British colonies to help stimulate the economy and to get native Africans participating in the local economy. The 1932 Citizenship Act implemented a 1 dollar Hut Tax on each native household, in return for voting rights. There is a pull towards eliminating the tax, as it resembles the hated US poll tax on African Americans. At the same time, we need all the money we can get."

LIB.9.d:0 "In the past few months, the allure and influence of Liberalism has gained steam on the Wayward Coast. Being influenced by prominent liberal champions of the African diaspora, such as Roy Wilkins, Jean Price-Mars, and even Booker T. Washington. The wave has even reached members of the TWP, with many prominent members such as Louis Arthur Grimes and even William Tubman being influenced by this wave to some degree. Clashing against not only traditional Americo-Liberian policy, but also our elders' ways, these potentially-dangerous ideas must be observed, for they could possibly spell disaster for the TWP establishment down the line. However, this sudden liberal bloom has left many Liberians wondering; could shocking ideas like pro-union policies and women's suffrage be far away, or will this all just inevitably weaken the foundations of our government?"

LIB.10.t:0 "Freemasons Abandon King"
LIB.10.d:0 "The Freemasons have always been a powerful force within Liberia, especially within the True Whig Party. With news breaking to the entire nation of the true extent of King’s corruption, detailing the dark underbelly of his regime’s hidden dealings and protection of slavery, the Masonic Lodge was quick to distance themselves from their former ally. Due to this, King has also been forced to resign as Grandmaster of the Lodge. Without the support of the Masons, King is all but doomed."

LIB.11.t:0 "The Red Tide Hits Liberia!"
LIB.11.d:0 "By some divine act or miracle, Socialism has established itself on the Windward Coast. As the Red Star of Marxism rises above Monrovia, so too has risen the ire of the Liberian people. Despite the current regime’s red roots, much of the nation is still dominated by the TWP political machine; a beast that can not simply disappear overnight. With each passing minute, the new Socialist government loses more ground and falls closer into total collapse, and a choice must soon be made if the regime is to survive at all. The leading figures of this Socialist experiment can either slip away under cover of night and set sail from the port of Monrovia to fairer shores, possibly in Paris or some other Socialist stronghold, leaving Liberia as the wolves descend upon our kinsmen and pick the carcass of our nation clean as we sail away mark free. Alternatively, we could take the less cowardly option and attempt to hold our position here. Though it will be nigh impossible and we will have to rely on massive amounts of foreign aid from friendly Internationale forces to even hold a chance at stemming the time long enough to win enough popular support with our reforms, at least it would be better than abandoning our country men to the claws and teeth of Capitalists and Nationalist scum. The choice lies with our esteemed leader [ROOT.GetLeader], with the fate of Liberia hanging in the balance."

LIB.12.d:0 "With the new Masonic-Whig government now in our control, we need to understand our own position. Just as we overthrew the weak, lenient regime that stood before us, so easily could the foreign vultures that are the American Exiles do so onto us. Since the listening outpost incident with France and the bombardment of our shored by the Germans, Liberians have largely lost all trust with outsiders, with foreigners from Europe and North America showing nothing but ulterior motives as they repeatedly attempt to subdue us. While some of our members within the Lodge may have important business ties abroad, our Grandmaster knows that this will only erode our resolve."

LIB.13.t:0 "The Red Menace"
LIB.13.d:0 "Socialism and Syndicalism have caused massive unrest in both the US and abroad. From the fall of France to this very day, the growing red threat will not abate until we crush it ourselves! One only needs to look at the disgraced Thomas J. Faulkner, who adopted Socialism to save his failing political career, to see the type of spineless snake that inhabits their ranks. The only reservation shown by the Grand Lodge in this decision is the wealth from the Americo-Liberians and American Exiles is too valuable to lose, and they would likely respond poorly to this move. Persecuting immigrants could erode their confidence in the government, and thus their economic potential along with them."

LIB.14.d:0 "For too long the True Whig Party has suppressed our ideas for a free market economy. It took an economic catastrophe to correct our single party state.

We have the USA whom we share closer ties with, but they have a long list of issues at home. Then there is the German Empire, who is in better shape than the US but far less friendly to us. Our last, and by far least, savoury option is asking the Firestone Corporation.

At least, that was the plan. It would seem that Mr. Massaquoi, now 67 years old, deems himself unfit to travel back to his homeland. He has privately approached us with a most peculiar request. His 32 year old daughter Fatima has just finished her studies at the Kaiserliche University in Hamburg and would be perfectly suited for the job. Some stuffy old Hauptmänner have objected to appointing an African woman to such a position, but considering the Liberian political machine isn't exactly going anywhere the reality of the situation is that Fatima would be little more than a figurehead for German influence over the country.  Although of course we could simply ignore his request and appoint him regardless.

As Richard is a white man and Fatima an African of Vai descent their relationship is not only seen as highly scandalous by the Americo-Liberian population but also deemed illegal on the grounds of the constitution. Liberian nationality law provides no special considerations for the non-citizen spouse of a Liberian citizen. Such a non-citizens can only acquire Liberian citizenship through the same naturalization procedure laid out for other non-citizens, which stipulates that the applicant must be 'a Negro or of Negro descent'. Naturally both the continental German administration in Berlin and the Mittelafrikan administration in Westafrika have urged us to change this law, but doing so might be considered as infringement upon fundamental Liberian liberties.

It qualifies as the major obstacle to our nation-building. Historically, the toughest resistance came from the Vai, Gola and Loma in the north-west of the country, within and to the north of Liberia’s most western coastal county, Grand Cape Mount County. In the central part of the coastal region that during the first decades of colonisation constituted the republic’s territory, the Dei, in Montserrado County, and the Bassa and Kpelle, in Bassa County, fought the Monrovia-based government. Finally, in Sinoe County and in Liberia’s most eastern coastal county, Maryland County, the Kru and Grebo resisted Americo-Liberian authority over their lands and villages.

He spoke of America, of the civil war that had ripped the country into warring statelets, sundering the great Union and sending a great many wayward sons and daughters of the States into exile like him. All the while, Firestone extolled the virtues of republicanism and a free market economy, the fruits of which, he insisted, would bring prosperity and hope to the nation of Liberia.\n\n ‘It is my hope." he exclaimed "that the American dream did not die in the fires of conflict; indeed, it is my hope and promise that, through hard work and dedication, this great state of Liberia may hold within the will of its people, the last, true bastion of American liberty; this is my promise to you, and I have no doubt in my mind that the people of Liberia are a means of achieving it.’"

Naturally, this raises many questions as to the specific nature of the Firestone Company's interests within Liberia and towards its immediate neighbors, especially given Firestone's recent rendezvous with the Prussian nobility in Lome. \n\nAs these and other more worrying reports on the activities of the Firestone Company become more public and widespread, the people of Africa have increasingly begun to grow uneasy and fill with trepidation, for none are certain what Liberia will do next."

Though not the first wave of missionaries to reach the shores of Liberia, as within this century alone our nation has been graced by visits from both Papal officials from Rome and from Pentecostal groups from the American West, they are the first groups to be openly welcomed by the ‘native’ government, now dominated by Firestone.  \n\nThese proud men of God, many of whom are African-Americans or Black African native, began a program of distributing rations to the famished, medical aid to the sick and injured, and other varied aid to the impoverished of Liberia, all the while proselytizing their unique versions of the charitable virtues of Jesus Christ. \n\n Hopefully, this will aid the new administration in bridging the gap between themselves and the African people they now share a nation with, but resistance to these measures have already been met. Within Liberia exists the native concept of Kwi, a deep distrust and distaste for the ideas of Westernization, or conformation to the ideals and cultural norms of European-descended Western Civilization. This concept of Kwi has crippled any attempts at integrating much of Liberia’s population for most of its history, but now, under Firestone, these barriers will finally be eroded by force.

Both plans have their pros and cons, so alternatively, a third possible solution has been mused over by certain, more hardline members of Hoover’s retinue. This plan calls for the complete dissolution of Liberia’s Congress, allowing President Hoover and his cabinet to act with complete impunity as practical-autocrats of the nation, removing all roadblocks to rule while also angering nearly every regular citizen in the nation.

Showing far more aptitude for managing a crisis than he ever did back in the States, Hoover has redeemed his past failures and has helped nurse Liberia’s wounds in these troubled times This success has allowed the exiles to peacefully and easily begin to merge into wider Liberian society without serious issue. \n\nAmong the largest and most obvious examples of this newfound cultural coexistence can be seen in the fast-growing American ‘enclaves’ popping up across Liberia in both major cities and within the newly settled wilds past the Hinterlands. These pockets of American settlement unify and distinguish themselves based on shared regional identities, carried on from their former lives in the New World. These new communities have a wealth of examples, from the crowded ‘Little NYC’ on the docks of Monrovia to the bustling ‘Chitown’ developing in the heart of Fish Town’s night district, these little slices of American urban life have brought a great deal of comfort to the exiles. Not only benefitting urban dwellers from the dying American giant, rural Americans from the Great Plains and Southwest have their places to call home as well, with the largest example being the expansive ‘Prairieville’, an ever-growing ranch and farm town filled with former Midwesterners, these small holdouts of pseudo-Americana remain as the last bastions of American culture not ravaged by the horrors of the 2nd American Civil War, and as such have become a focus of President Hoover’s administration.

Though he rules over this nation in the place of the honored executives of old, his rule now feels like a relic of the wartime atmosphere the civil war created, and many clamor for change. \n\nIt just so happens to be that we are in luck, for a legitimate executive of old not tainted by the horrors of our brother-war still exists. Far across the Atlantic on the Slave Coasts of Africa lies Liberia - the tiny America of the Dark Continent and at its helm sits former-president Herbert Hoover. Despite the past damage done to our nation, Hoover has steered the ship of Liberia’s democracy steadily and effectively, allowing the once corrupt backwater to blossom as a haven for Americanism.

These revered leaders and elders have congregated around the capitol building of Monrovia, bringing with them a large and gregarious retinue of priests, servants, and gifts for President Tubman.

Not out of agreement but with the thought of how Ford would never be fit for a politician with statement’s like that, yet despite all his controversy, Hoover almost thought of him as a godsent break from the life of politics and bureaucracy that he had to deal with. Ford had the strengths and qualities of a man who you knew worked his way into the suit he currently wore, a man who didn't handle half-assed work well and only aimed for a high standard of workmanship.

Of course, what few have mentioned in public is that the book is also a chance for Hoover to redeem himself in the eyes of his critics. Such critics have lambasted Hoover for years, blaming him for everything from the Civil War to the Dust Bowl to their favorite baseball team losing a game. Hoover, though not publicly responding to such accusations, has clearly been impacted by the public reception of his time in office, and has dedicated much of his book to explaining his actions as president. Importantly, Hoover dedicates several chapters to the likes of William Haywood, Huey Long, and even Douglas MacArthur, all figures that he identifies as authoritarian depsots who have betrayed their countrymen and the founding fathers. At the end of the book, Hoover details his own plan to return to America, in force if need be, in order to restore honor, reason, and brotherhood to a country that has been torn apart in his absence.

His political future aside, iit seems that the two men shared plans for what the future of America should look like in addition to their merrymaking, and it seems they agree that the stain of authoritarianism as well as the threat of unregulated democracy must be removed from the country, though neither can be forgotten.

Liberia’s military needs more bodies and more officers, and it needs them now! We shall press every able bodied man we can into service and swell the manpower pools available to our armed forces so that we may better contain these rising beasts and forces of chaos. Officers and soldiers normally too young to serve shall be pressed into higher positions as we scramble to fill out our hierarchy on this eve of civil conflict and war, for though it may cause mayhem and disorganization within our ranks, it is our only choice. \n\nHowever, not all of the young minds being pressed into service are so inept or untested. Thanks to Admiral Ford’s military mission and training efforts, a few officers have risen through our ranks and, despite their age, have shown a real aptitude for leadership and heroics. One such brave soul has been the young James Earl Carter Jr.. Born originally in Georgia, he and his family moved to the Grain Coast answering Admiral Ford’s call for more American blood in Liberia. Both he and his father entered the service upon their arrival in Monrovia, with his father taking on an administrative position in the LFF. However, this ‘Jimmy’ Carter Jr. instead found a niche as a naval auxiliary and cabin boy, and as time has gone on, he has shown an innate talent for officer duty. After being fast-tracked through the naval officer course and under the direct tutelage of Admiral Ford, Jimmy Carter has proven himself to be a fine and capable naval officer. Though he still has a long way to go before becoming a true Fleet Admiral, an officer of his skill is some of the best Liberia has to offer, and so he has been pressed into active service as a acting-’Admiral.’ He shall command men twice or even quadruple his age sure, but he will be damn good at it!"

As a young man, he attended Yale University to study law before joining in with the American Navy as the tides of chaos began to rise in the United States, riding the wave of patriotism that led many young men to volunteer with their local state militias, national guard, and other various branches of the armed forces. As the American government began to fast-track star candidates through the naval program as the nation anticipated civil strife more and more, Ford was one such star candidate passed along early. \n\nHowever, Ford would not be sent to a local naval base like he had hoped, and was instead sent to Monrovia as part of a military liaison tasked with readying Liberia for war, whenever it may come. Sent hundreds of miles from home, the young Gerald Ford clung to whatever sources of Americanism he could find in this new land, leading him to fall in with the Firestone Company. With Firestone pulling the strings of his career, and with his own skill helping him along the way, Ford has since risen to become one of Liberia’s key naval leaders and one of its only full admirals. Under his stewardship, Liberia’s navy has seen great improvements, though it is still a far cry from a modern sea-faring navy in any sense of the word. \n\nThe crowning achievement of Ford’s career so far has been the so-called ‘Ford Plan’ - an incentive scheme poised at attracting more Americans to Liberia for use in its military using funding from the Firestone Company and Lansdell K. Christie. With this plan, he has been able to attract hundreds more skilled Americans to the Windward Coast, pressing them into service within the Liberian armed forces’ hierarchy. With his sharp mind and important connections, Admiral Ford has become a model officer and perfect example of American military exceptionalism. May Liberia forever prosper with him at their side."

For just a moment, it was as if the whole city froze, anticipating a flash of light from this odd sounding thunder. When nothing immediately came, the city resumed its jovial motions, expecting this crack to be nothing more than the first trumpet of a coming storm. However, these poor souls could not be more wrong. \n\nTaking what felt like eons to travel the expanse that separated their source from their target, three metal cylinders tore their way through the sky and clouds until, in a blink, they finally met their destination. With a flash, downtown Monrovia was consumed in a maelstrom of burning chaos and raging inferno as the first shells landed, for what these innocent souls thought was just a coming storm was another rain entirely. From the heavens, explosive shells the size of a man landed upon the city, detonating and decimating block after block of Liberia’s only metropolis. The morning vibrance reduced to ash and cinder, and all traces of the idyllic morning that precipitated this hell all gone as a distant memory. \n\nMiles off-shored, through looking glasses and binoculars, the crew of the USS South Dakota cheered and jeered at their now burning enemy, unaware or uncaring to the horrors that transpired just a few clicks eastward. Lowering his spyglass, Admiral Ford smiled, thinking to himself another job well-done as the rebel city lay burning, its smoke billowing to greet the heavens.

By sending a small infiltration team, under cover of night, to the USS South Dakota, we will free our people. With aid from our Swamp Eel submarine divisions, we will attempt to strike the ship from below with torpedoes, serving as a distraction, while our troops make their way aboard and capture the Admiral.

With disorder swirling around him like a suffocating maelstrom, Admiral Ford yelled for all available support crews to rush to steal flood doors and bulkheads leading to the breach while all available deckhands were to reach the main deck and begin firing at whoever dared attack this mighty American vessel. \n\nAs the situation further unfolded and reports of firefights broke out on lower levels, the Admiral ordered his staff and crew to all necessary emergency posts on the ship, eventually leaving him to man the control room with just enough of a skeleton crew of adjutants and helmsmen to keep the ship afloat - a mistake that would soon prove to be his undoing. \n\nAs Ford tried to get a handle on the situation, his guard had dropped and all attention he had was poured into the chaotic scene unfurling around him. With a shock, he was pulled back to reality as a gun barrel was pointed squarely at his face, for standing before him were a group of Liberian marines out for blood. In the commotion, one of the attacking rebel teams had snuck their way to the command deck and now were poised to take Admiral Ford hostage. Not going down without a struggle however, Ford attempted to fight back. In a savage display, the few American sailors left in the cabin threw themselves at the Liberian ‘pirates’ in a desperate attempt to stave off the inevitable. With the roar of some rifles and a splatter of viscera however, it was over before it began. Admiral Ford lay on the ground, bleeding out and convulsing, as the rest of his crew dropped dead or writhed in agony before being put out of their misery by the Liberian borders.

While yes, we have the Declaration of Independence and Constitution within our grasp, there is one more symbol that we lack to truly call ourselves an American bastion. That symbol, of course, being the Statue of Liberty. That great green giant, standing vigil, holding high the torch of liberty, guiding lost souls to their new home. To the Americans, and to almost anyone in the world, the Statue of Liberty is the great symbol of America, and we simply must obtain this symbol if we truly wish to call ourselves American! Getting there, is the hard part.\n\nObviously, we cannot cross the Atlantic and steal the Statue, such a move, if even were possible, would be a practical suicide mission. Instead, a group of exiles close to the government has proposed an ingenious solution to our dilemma. Instead of stealing the old, we shall build our own! Using our growing navy, we could easily divert convoys carrying copper from Mittleafrika to Monrvoia. Once in port, the copper that they were carrying, along with any copper within the hulls themselves, can be used to begin construction of our Statue of Liberty. Estimates on the time to fully construct the Monrovian Statue of Liberty are about 3 years, although it could take longer or shorter, depending on how much copper we are able to get our hands on.\n\nIn order to ensure that our Statue of Liberty remains the sole light of Liberty shining upon the Atlantic, the same exile group has proposed using some of the 'redirected' ships as modern fire ships. In other words, fill one of the captured vessels with massive amounts of explosives, dock it near Liberty Island, and destroy the Statue. While clearly insane, such a move could hypothetically be easy to pull off.

Calling it ‘Jimmy Beer’ after the infamous party animal and rising star of the Liberian Navy Admiral James ‘Jimmy’ Carter, who has officially endorsed the brew and promoted its creation since inception, this new light-bodied lager is sure to rekindle the American Exiles’ love of the sweet liquid bread.

Even now, the last of the Portugueuse garrison are getting on their ships and deporting from the port of Bissau back home towards Lisbon as our brave Frontier Force marches proudly into the cities and villages of the Bissau-Gunieans; their cries and cheers of jubilation over their newfound freedom from the imperialist Europeans deafening out any other noise. With this last strip of land secured, West Africa is ours!"
libporwar.4.a:0 "Liberty finally reigns across all of West Africa."

libporwar.5.t:0 "Peace with Portugal?"
libporwar.5.d:0 "We have now more then proved ourselves, and the imperialist armies of Portugal have all but failed to protect their holdings in Western Africa. With Bissau-Guinea now under our control, many within the LFF's high command are request we send Portugal an offer for peace. After all, what use is their in shedding more blood for a small piece of land?"

libporwar.6.d:0 "The Frontier Force of the Liberian’s and their West African allies have long occupied the colony of Guinea-Bissau, and with the thunderous howl of artillery and rifle fire all but having fully ceased, the locals have begun to assimilate to their new masters. With either side, African nor Portuguese, seeking to spill any further blood, an attempt at peace has been made to end the conflict. If accepted, Portugal would fully cede Guinea-Bissau to the Liberians, and in-turn all hostilities would cease between the two nations. The people of West Africa and Portugal wait on bated breath, awaiting the results of the peace summit, and with the conference finally adjourning, it would seem that...."

libporwar.7.d:0 "Whether it was the pompous Portuguese ministers or some of the more stubborn delegates from West Africa, it can’t be said, but what is definitely apparent is that negotiations have failed. The peace talks between the Liberian and Portuguese administrations over Guinea-Bissau have entirely deteriorated, and the armed forces of both nations now gear for all-out war over this small strip of sand and jungle. The thunderous crack of artillery fire and the rumbling of motors and treads can be heard once more across this accursed coast as the people of West Africa brace themselves yet again for the coming storm."

We should extend our infrastructure into the vast expanse to promote urbanisation and make military conscription of these natives much easier. Through economic incentive, and force if necessary, we will fill the ranks of the Frontier Force!"

LIB_mil_ind_3:0 "Fortress Monrovia"
LIB_mil_ind_3_desc:0 "When that German submarine fired warning shots at Monrovia in 1921, we had nowhere to hide, for Monrovia sits exposed with its soft underbelly vulnerable to the sea.

However, not all souls are worth saving - the foreigners and Exiles that clutter our shoreline, the European and White American businessmen strangle our economy, and the Afro-Liberians wish nothing more than to topple the century-long dominance of the TWP. These snakes do not share our love of liberty, and must be dealt with at once. Liberia is for Liberians!"

LIB_no_democracy:0 "Liberty Without Democracy"
LIB_no_democracy_desc:0 "The downfall of the moderate True Whigs was not caused by corruption or political blunders, but by a failure of morals. The TWP regime of old long bent the knee to foreigners and scavengers all eager to piecemeal our nation, all in the pursuit of power and profit. Democracy has failed the Liberian people, and the former heads of the TWP have proven that. Elections in Liberia never instilled trust in the government, but instead sowed the seeds of further mistrust and chaos. We shall once again fully embrace the concept of ‘Ifa Mo’, sealing Liberia and its people away from the rest of the world as we work to undo the damage done by President King and all former presidents of Liberia before him."

We should reach out to these groups, long neglected by the ruling regime, to try and win their favor.

LIB_remove_corruption:0 "Corruption within the Frontier Force"
LIB_remove_corruption_desc:0 "The Liberian Frontier Force, officially founded in 1908, serves as the main military force of Liberia. Intended to be a symbol of freedom and respected by all, it has devolved into just another corrupt clique within our regime. Americo-Liberian officers and generals take bribes and payoffs while their recruits wallow within their barracks, only able to march or bark the anthem, with only a fraction of them even knowing how to aim and fire a rifle...pathetic. We must address this corruptio at once before the entire army decays!"

LIB_fighting_tooth_nail:0 "Fighting Tooth and Nail"
LIB_fighting_tooth_nail_desc:0 "Though proud, we must face reality: our population is small, and our army smaller. Guerrilla tactics, while not honourable, are both our only realistic option and true to our fighting tradition, drawing on the Frontier Force’s roots in the all-Black militias that initially formed following the colonization of Liberia. We will drill the men of our armed forces to fight with both tooth and nail, for if Liberia falls, so too does the last hope of freedmen everywhere."

We shall use these modern wonders against their inventors."

The Liberian Task Force shall be formed, becoming our final line of defence, with no terrain too harsh or treacherous for them to trailblaze in the pursuit of the enemies of Liberia. These brave men shall be drilled to be ready to do and die for their homeland, without question and with the utmost loyalty."

LIB_secret_societies_desc:0 "Secret Societies, whilst the subject of exaggeration in the United States, form a parallel political and legal system in Liberia. The exclusively Americo-Liberian Masonic Order of Libera wields undeniable influence within the True Whig Party, while the Poro of the Hinterland allow the disenfranchised Afro-Liberian natives to have a shred of representation within their local patriarchal tribal government. We must finally decide on Liberia's official stance to these societies."

LIB_scandal_aftermath_desc:0 "Embroiled in scandal after scandal over Liberia’s backwards economy, President King  can no longer remain in control.

LIB_totalist_2_desc:0 "Though we control the apparatus of governance within Liberia, we still do not control the entire nation. We must wipe out the rest of the TWP, who now flee to the Hinterlands with some loyalist forces that betrayed the Frontier Force. Though they seek sanctuary in those wilds, they will find only horror as they meet their end. Deep within the Hinterland, the Poro’s forces prepare to ambush these fleeing traitors to Liberia as our forces pursue them, ready to crush them between our two fronts. Soon, Liberia will be secure as the red star of Pan-African Totalism rises above Monrovia."

LIB_totalist_3_desc:0 "Since our founding, we have been slaves. For over a century, we passed from slavery at the hands of the Yanks to slavery at the hands of our fellow Liberians. This legacy of servitude and oppression ends now, finally, with the ascension of George Padmore as Head of State of Liberia and with our recent victories over the TWP. We shall now tear down the establishment and reforge Liberia into a true Totalist state; a Totalist state that benefits all Liberians, both American and African in descent. The first step on this journey is to petition the Internationale for aid in our nation building."

LIB_totalist_4_desc:0 "Though Liberia has been forged into a mighty Totalist nation, we still bear the marks and scars of the former administration as we struggle to cement Socialist ideas here on the Windward Coast. Even further, we have not magically done away with the harsh realities that plagued the former regime. We are still alone here on the African continent, with our backs to the sea and with no allies for hundreds of miles. As we endeavor to build a state that benefits all proletariat within Liberia, we must also maintain our defensive stance, for our foes in Dar-Es-Salaam and Algiers could strike at any moment."

LIB_election_radsoc_desc:0 "The road to the Executive Mansion was difficult for the People's Party. Despite the TWP's attempts to keep the best hope for Liberia out of power, the PP has at last come to it's rightful place. To secure the win, the PP had been meeting in the Hinterland, preparing to strike when the time was right. In the chaos of the Poro coup, Thomas J. Faulkner was able to convince the Legislature to appoint him President.  Though difficult, all was necessary in order to supplant the True Whig regime legally."

LIB_election_mrklib:0 "Victory of the TWP Right"
LIB_election_mrklib_desc:0 "The Center of the TWP is nothing more then lackeys to  Firestone, selling Liberia down the drain. It singed it's own death warrant due to King’s incompetence and corruption, and though well intentioned, Barclay seems to be just another King in the making . The Left is nothing better, wanting to sell our souls to the heathen natives and Firestone alike under the guise of 'Liberalism.' Wisely, Tubman the darling of the TWP's right, as been appointed following King's disgrace. With Tubman at the helm, Liberia shall steer the course she was always meant to take, as a bastion of liberty for the Americo-Liberian people."

The Hut Tax, a tax on all native dwellings which also conferred voting rights, is widely ignored, with the Poro being the Afro-Liberians’ only voice. We must decide whether to pursue collection of the Hut Tax, helping our national debt, or to abolish it in the name of true freedom as we pursue more fair avenues towards native representation."

LIB_patronize_allies_desc:0 "With our rule reinforced, we must now turn to the many allies and benefactors that made another victory for our party possible, continuing the decades of TWP dominance that have seized Liberia’s political establishment. Though we normally use large amounts of excess funds to payoff these valued allies and benefactors, the current global economic collapse has thrown a wrench in that plan, with many calling for increased aid to be given to the average Liberian. We must tread carefully, lest we sully this new term before it has truly begun."

LIB_judicial_reform:0 "Reform the Judicial System"
LIB_judicial_reform_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Supreme Court of Liberia and our bureaucracy have expanded in influence and power. The former True Whig establishment allowed this to occur, and in turn they ran wild with their new found power, throwing caution to the wind and allowing opposition to form. The Liberian judiciary must be reformed into a truly meritocratic system so that this blatant corruption does not continue to fester within our regime."

LIB_radical_reform:0 "Radical Reform"
LIB_radical_reform_desc:0 "With President Thomas J. Faulkner now in power, we can finally begin to radically reform Liberia. Entering office with a lengthy list of policy demands, President Faulkner is calling for a decrease in presidential powers, increased rights for the unassimilated indigenous population, an abolition of the hut tax, sweeping reforms to the militia, judiciary, and national finances, the establishment of a civil service, and for the nation's capital to be moved from Monrovia to the interior; a comprehensive list to modernize and equalize Liberian society."

LIB_emancipation:0 "No Concessions for Capital"
LIB_emancipation_desc:0 "President Faulkner has always been an opponent of the Firestone Deal, seeing the corporation as nothing more than slavers come to take advantage of our fair Liberia. We will stand for this no more! We will ensure that every soul in Liberia is free, and that foreign capital will not enter and defile Liberia without concession. When Liberia was founded in 1847, we were the 'Land of the Free'; it is high time we made good on this promise."

LIB_amend_constitution:0 "Amend the Constitution"
LIB_amend_constitution_desc:0 "Our constitution, framed around the American Constitution, has long served Liberia admirably, but amendments are needed to make it a truly fair and equitable document that applies to all worthy Liberians. Though many within our party begrudge the idea of amending this sanctified document, some changes will be needed so that it better services the new party line while also including as many Liberians as possible so as to secure our rule even further."

LIB_immigration:0 "Remove Immigration Limits"
LIB_immigration_desc:0 "While the United States embraced immigrants from Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, our own immigration rates have been minimal. This is because of the ridiculous requirement of being Black to become a citizen. With support from, not surprisingly, the Firestone Company, our nation has decided to remove many of the barriers to immigration that exist within our legal code, allowing far more to flock to our shores than ever before."

LIB_foreign_investment:0 "Attract Foreign Investment"
LIB_foreign_investment_desc:0 "The fools in the former TWP establishment took loan after loan in order to control the economy, borrowing from American companies, with the largest lender being Firestone. However, President Tubman has realized that the economy must be free in order for our rubber to be worth anything, and so has decided to let foreigners come and directly invest their own money into our economy and live in Liberia. We shall become a beacon of investment capitalism for the world to see and indulge in!"

LIB_holy_materialism_desc:0 "Though he called himself the prophet Elijah, and claims he spoke to the angel Gabriel, William Wadé Harris is now an ally. His idea that material possessions are a sign of God's grace is exactly what we need in Liberia. By allowing Harris into our cabinet as an economic and spiritual advisor, we shall bring the touch of God to Liberia’s economy, or at least use this wildman’s somewhat coherent ideas to our benefit."

LIB_race_mixing:0 "A Darker Shade of Pale"
LIB_race_mixing_desc:0 "Our ally, Gabriel Dennis, has come back from Brazil with a book by Joao Baptiste de Lacerda. This anthropological treatise details the flaw in denying race mixing. In fact, race mixing could be the way to increase our own status as a nation in Africa. Old laws preventing race mixing must end, for the sake of our children and our diplomatic standing with the larger powers."

LIB_legitimize_unions_desc:0 "Unions have long been vilified and degraded within Liberian society. However, with the rising power of Liberian secret societies, these unions could be just what Liberia needs. By introducing a legal form of worker and civic organization, perhaps our populace would be less inclined to turn to the Masonic Order or the Poro. Regardless, unions will still at least provide some benefit to the many low-class workers that drive our economy forward."

LIB_spread_unionism:0 "Spread the Word"
LIB_spread_unionism_desc:0 "Though it will take a while for our union initiative to take hold and provide real benefits to our working-class, we can still endeavor forward as the champions of Liberal ideals here in Liberia.

LIB_fate_of_TWP_desc:0 "The True Whig Party has dominated Liberian politics for over a century, but this era of unfettered domination is coming to an end. With Hoover’s ascension to the presidency, the question of what to do with the TWP has arisen as many seek to open up our nation’s political scene to showcase true diversity in political ideas. The nation, and more specifically our regime, must decide if the TWP shall be allowed to function after all it has done to our people."
LIB_fate_of_firestone:0 "Fate of Firestone Rubber"
LIB_fate_of_firestone_desc:0 "The rubber-producing giant that is the Firestone Company has decimated Liberia’s natural landscape and population all in the pursuit of profit, and for decades our nation has allowed this to occur just to enjoy a mere fraction of the total payout. This must end! We will approach Firestone with an ultimatum: either give us more favorable terms and deals, or face the grand American tradition of trust-busting!"
LIB_new_america:0 "The New America"
LIB_new_america_desc:0 "Here on the shores of the Windward Coast, thousands of miles away from DC and the rest of the grand United States, President Hoover and the Exiles have created a new America. Though far from the amber waves of grain and the purple mountains of majesty, this America exists because of the ideals and culture stored and shared in the hearts of our people. We shall look to the mistakes of our past and seek to correct them as we build a new, better America here on the stormy coast of Africa."

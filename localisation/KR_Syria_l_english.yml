### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ANTOUN_SADEH_DESC:0 "Born in the Beirut Vilayet, Antoun Saadeh is a man of many talents and little patience. After living half of his life abroad in the west, Antoun returned to his homeland in 1930. In the rubble the Weltkrieg had made of his homeland, Saadeh founded the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, a political party dedicated to the advancement of Social Nationalism, a refinement of the syncretism of socialist and nationalist ideas that Saadeh had developed during his time abroad. He was arrested by the Ottoman Empire in 1935, when he publicly revealed the existence of the party, but his faith in a Syria freed from the shackles of Western and Ottoman imperialism and united by the principles of Social Nationalism is unshakeable."
POLITICS_FAWZI_QUWU_DESC:0 "Captain of the 12th Ottoman corps of Mosul, Fawzi had proven his bravery to the Turks. Where many heard the call of Faisal's Arab Revolt, Fawzi heard only the commendations from General Otto von Kreiss. When the Turks were victorious, they made Fawzi a Pasha. Although showered with praise, Fawzi refused to call himself a Pasha. His current role as military governor is unique among the vilayets as he exerts considerable control over the soldiers in his command."
POLITICS_ADIB_BIN_HASSAN_SYR_DESC:0 "Sami Al Hinawi has spent his career avoiding the easy paths to power. Never renouncing his Arab name in the Ottoman Military, his loyalty earned him the right to use his birth name. The allure of the Arab Revolt never reached him during his time in the Jerusalem Vilayet. A possible alliance between his officers and the emerging SSNP was rejected on the same basis that the easy way to power is a trap. Time will tell whether this stalwart commitment will pay off."
POLITICS_SHUKRI_QUWATILI_DESC:0 "Among the several branches of Al Fatat in the Arab world, none would be as successful as Syria's. This is due to the careful manoeuvring of their leader, Shukri al-Quwatli. Despite his exile from Syria twice, he has again returned and collects his allies in preparation for a new type of Republican government. Shukri's position in Syria is an intermediary between the liberal burghers and conservative landowners that hold judicial power in Syria."
POLITICS_SULTAN_ATRASH_DESC:0 "Sultan al-Atrash is relied upon by the Syrian people not because he is a great unifier. Atrash openly admits that he seeks autonomy for his Druze people against the wishes of his own allies. This push for autonomy of Syria's minority groups is however unilateral. Atrash wishes to rebuke pan arabism and protect Syria as a nation of minorities."
POLITICS_NAZIK_AL_ABID_DESC:0 "Once exiled to Cairo in the wake of a Turkish crackdown, Nazik al Abid has pulled off an incredible achievement other Arab feminists like Tarab Abdul Hadi could only dream of; for she was elected head of state of Syria. Her work establishing the International Red Crescent and her liberal position towards veils has finally paid in dividends for her and for women across Syria, as her notoriety has put her in a prime position to lobby for their rights in the country."
POLITICS_SABRI_ASALI_DESC:0 "Sabri al-Asali began as an Arab member of the Ottoman Parliament in the capital. Where many of this contemporaries joined secret societies and stocked weapons, Al Asali knew that legislation would lead to Syria's freedom. When the pen signed Syria's independence, he was in Cairo in Hal'il meeting with heads of state. It is through the outside in that Sabri al-Asali assumed power in Syria. He may be out of touch with the common Syrian, but his commitment to economic ties with the Arab world set Sabri apart from his peers."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A Sheikh is not the first person the International expected when they asked Syria to elect their first leader among the syndicates. While it is true that Muhammad al-Ashmar's first station was a Mufti, he is now a leader of the people. His influence within the mosques in reinterpreting Islamic law and rejecting Secular syndicalism in favour of voluntary Zakat from all sets him apart from any other branch of socialism in Syria."
POLITICS_MICHEL_AFLAQ_DESC:0 "Michel Aflaq was born to a Greek Orthodox family of modest means, but showed promise in school despite the interruptions of the Weltkrieg. Sent abroad to study in Vienna, he founded an Arab Student Union where he would meet his intellectual partner Salah al-Din al-Bitar, and spent his spare time studying the works of numerous nationalist and particularist writers from throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Together with al-Bitar, Aflaq would forge the populist ideology of Ihyaism ("Revival") out of the Kemalist ideas of his adolescence and the particularist ones of his collegiate education. He left Vienna with a fire burning in his heart for Syrian independence and for an Arab nation free of colonial dominion, be it Ottoman or European."
POLITICS_DAHAM_AL_HADI_DESC:0 "Daham al-Hadi was a sheikh of the Shammar Arabs during the Weltkrieg who initially offered his support to the British. However, as the war dragged on and the British ran headlong into the Cilician Stalemate, he became convinced that the British would be unable to win and absconded to Syria with the supplies and arms they had given him, eventually settling there. Now, with the convention of the Second National Congress in Syria, and the election of the House of Hadi as the royal house of Syria, Daham's fortunes have turned, and he intends to make good on his newfound prosperity and authority for the sake of his tribe and his young nation."
POLITICS_TAWFIQ_AL_ATASSI_DESC:0 "Tawfiq al-Atassi did not expect to be king. He stood next in line to become Mufti of Homs, as the men of his family had for generations, as his elder Taher's health failed with his advanced age. But when word came from the National Congress, he understood that the crown of Syria was a higher calling than that of a ministry. Another al-Atassi would take up a post as mufti, but God had spoken through the Congress, and no true man of God would refuse His call, for He makes no mistakes."
POLITICS_HASHIM_AL_ATASSI_DESC:0 "Scion of the influential al-Atassi family of Homs, Hashim al-Atassi led the National Congress during the Weltkrieg, and gave his assent to the election of Faisal as King, but with the Central Powers' victory in the Weltkrieg and the re-establishment of Ottoman hegemony over Syria, he fled into exile, fearing for his life. Now, he has returned to an independent Syria to once again lead the National Congress in a decision that will echo through the ages; with the House of Hashim scattered to the winds, who now shall be King of Syria?"
POLITICS_MOHAMMED_ALI_TEWFIK_DESC:0 "Mohammed Ali Tewfik was heir presumptive of the Egyptian monarchy and sat as regent after King Fuad I's death until Farouk I's coronation. He has been sent to Syria as a consolation prize; the Egyptian succession goes on, but Tewfik and his line will reign over Syria regardless. Whether it is on behalf of Egypt or as a rival in the region is up to Mohammed now."
POLITICS_AHMAD_NAMI_DESC:0 "A Circassian-Turkish noble-blooded Ottoman with connections to the royal family of the Empire, Ahmad Nami was approached by French officers during the Weltkrieg to form a provisional government in Syria as they jockeyed for position with the British. When the Ottoman Empire retook control in the region, Nami went back to his life as an officer, but now with foreign interests re-established in Syria, he has found himself as King of Syria, despite barely being able to stumble through a sentence of Arabic. His heart may be in the right place, but only time will tell if he can rise above his lacking talents and the foreign domination of his new home."
POLITICS_IBRAHIM_HANANU:0 "Just when he thought he was going to lead a peaceful life managing his extensive estates, lawyer and Ottoman loyalist Ibrahim Hananu found himself appointed to the office of bey of Syria on a tide of decentralist sentiment in Constantinople. Ibrahim assumed his post with no small amount of reluctance, but nonetheless is determined to carry out the duties of his office to the highest degree; however, with tensions rising around the world and especially in the Arab world, Hananu may find his loyalties tested like never before."

### Pre-rework portraits not in the parties listed above

# Nazik al-Abid
# Female Syrian called 'Joan of Arc of the Arabs' who fought for emancipation and joined the Syrian army. The hell am I supposed to do with her? She's a nobody with 1 policy she fights for. Even a minister slot is too much for her. 

# Sabri Al-Asali
# A member of the National Bloc with little relevance until the late 50ies when he pushed for the Nasserist cause in Syria and in part caused the UAR. He's not in the top brass of the National Bloc and played second fiddle to the more important Quwaitli who also has a portrait. I guess he's useful for an election event in the 50ies?

# Muhammad al-Ashmar
# Syrian Sheikh who was a commander in the Great Syrian Revolt and the Palestinian War. Islamist fundamentalist who opposed Shukri for being 'too liberal', for some miraculous reason became a communist later in life (likely just to protest the National Bloc) despite being against basically everything communism stands for. Euh? What slot is this guy supposed to be? Maybe has potential as a general but I honestly doubt it, not that we need any more of them either

# Michel Aflaq
# Founder of the Ba'ath movement who is completely irrelevant in KR since his formative years in France don't happen and he is far too young to take over a nation in 1940 (the Ba'ath was only created otl in 1940 with the first real succes being close to 1950). No use for him

# Ibrahim Hananu
# Leader of the Hananu Revolt in Northern Syria just after the proclamation of the Mandate. After being released from jail in 1925, he became a prominent member of the National Bloc. Died otl in 1935 of tuberculosis. He could theoretically be given a sip from the Fountain of Youth and form the front of the Aleppan wing of the National Bloc...?

# Sultan al-Atrash
# Leader of the Jabal al-Druze and the Druze people living there. Didn't want any position in the Syrian government despite being offered and had as sole goal a Syria free from foreign tutelage in which the Jabal al-Druze was a de facto independent region. He would work together with al-Jazairi and al-Nashashibi but has no ambition to become HoS of Syria. Only use is perhaps as general?

### Coups ###
# Anti-Egyptian nations will support al-Za'im (IRQ, TUR, PER)
# Pro-Egyptian nations or nations that are pursuing Arab unification will support the National Bloc if Syria is democratic and Hinawi if not democratic (EGY, IRQ, HEJ)
# Iraqi socdems will support al-Za'im and al-Hourani (but withdraw this support when it becomes apparent they are a bunch of corrupt twats) (IRQ)
# If Syria is democratic, Iraq will support the Aleppan People's Party (IRQ)
# Adib Shishakli will take over with the SSNP if the nation fails to stabilise after a regime change. They could potentially receive support from Saudi Arabia but this isn't guaranteed
# The Internationale can either work together with al-Za'im if he goes after the pro-German officers or depose him through Hinawi (FRA, ENG)
# The Reichspakt can either work together with al-Za'im if he goes after the pro-German officers or depose him through Hinawi (GER)

### Focuses ###
syria_focus:0 "Syria Focus Tree"

# Maintain the Status Quo #
SYR_status_quo:0 "Maintain the Status Quo"
SYR_status_quo_desc:0 "For as long as we can remember, the region of Syria has been ruled by its cities and their powerful families. These families, taking up the key positions in both the bureaucratic and religious hierarchy serve as the patrons for those less fortuned and form the core of the Syrian tapestry. European mass politics, aimed at giving direct representation to the people is downright hurtful to the Syrians and is likely to make us all prey for rabid marxists, religious extremists or jingoist brutes."
SYR_egypt_cooperation:0 "Syrian - Egyptian Cooperation"
SYR_egypt_cooperation_desc:0 "Without the help of Egypt, we would have no free Syria to call our home. It is only right that we continue our strong relations with them and work together towards a brighter and more prosperous future!"
SYR_ban_parties:0 "Ban Political Parties"
SYR_ban_parties_desc:0 "Political parties are only a burden on the Syrian people. If we wish to be a strong and successful Arab state, it is time we disband these troubling factions."
SYR_military_directorate:0 "Found the Military Intelligence Directorate"
SYR_military_directorate_desc:0 "Expanding our military's intelligence operations will allow us to better infiltrate and destroy the rebellious factions in our nation. "
SYR_suez_damscus_rail:0 "Suez - Damascus Railroad"
SYR_suez_damscus_rail_desc:0 "Our increasing ties with Egypt have nowhere as much been felt as in the economy. Where Syria was once fully oriented towards the North and the Mediterranean, trade connections and Egyptian influence in the state monopolies have brought great change. To further strengthen their position, the Egyptians are now pushing for an expansion of the rail and road connections between our economic heartland and the Suez Canal."
SYR_integrate_military:0 "Integrate Military Command"
SYR_integrate_military_desc:0 "The Egyptian military command's intelligence and skill during the war of independence has not gone unnoticed, it is thanks to their actions that we were able to achieve freedom from the Turks. With our alliances with Egypt growing ever stronger, it is necessary that we merge our two military commands in the region. "
SYR_end_land_reform:0 "Abolish Ottoman Land Reform"
SYR_end_land_reform_desc:0 "When the Ottoman land reforms of the late 19th century were introduced in Syria, their primary aim was to weaken the influence of a quasi feudal class of landowners and pull power away from the influential Arab families to a centralising state. Scions of these families, it is our duty and promise to revert these changes and prevent further damage from being done to the state of Syria."
SYR_undercut_aleppan:0 "Undercut Aleppan Influence"
SYR_undercut_aleppan_desc:0 "While Damascus is undoubtedly the principle urban centre of Syria, it faces significant competition from Aleppo and Northern Syria as a whole. We must take steps to limit the influence this region can hold over our politics through encouraging the growth of the economy of Syria."
SYR_destroy_mudafa:0 "Destroy the Müdâfaa-i Hukuk Cemiyetleri"
SYR_destroy_mudafa_desc:0 "The terrorists of the Müdâfaa-i Hukuk Cemiyetleri represent a fundamental danger to our state, steps must be taken quickly and effectively in order to eliminate them once and for all."
SYR_sunni_dominance:0 "Uphold Sunni Dominance"
SYR_sunni_dominance_desc:0 "While many different groups make up Syria, to deny that the Sunni population make up the largest bloc would be foolish. While some may accuse of discrimination towards the minorities of our state, really we are simply recognising the reality that Syria is a Sunni nation."
SYR_abolish_mt_lebanon:0 "Abolish the Mt Lebanon Autonomous Region"
SYR_abolish_mt_lebanon_desc:0 "While the various militia groups of Lebanon served an important role during the war, they have slowly shown themselves to be more concerned with protecting their own backyard rather than Syria as a whole. Given they have shown their true colours, there is no need to continue tolerating the slight to our national integrity their autonomous region represents."
SYR_jewish_land:0 "End Jewish Land Acquisitions"
SYR_jewish_land_desc:0 "The influx of Jewish individuals to our cities may have brought prosperity, but it also adds to the already disgruntled pot of minorities in Syria. In order to stop this process in its tracks, we will place tight restrictions on the acquisition of further land by Jewish individuals."
SYR_sewcure_alawyin_mountains:0 "Secure the Alawiyin Mountains"
SYR_sewcure_alawyin_mountains_desc:0 "The terrain of the Alawiyin Mountains allow it to become a breeding ground of Alawite unrest. As long as these areas are allowed to be a rats nest, we can never hope to end those who rebel against our rule."
SYR_expand_harbours:0 "Expand the Haifa & Tripoli Harbours"
SYR_expand_harbours_desc:0 "The ports in Haifa and Tripoli, while seeing growth over the past few years, still have a lot of potential for further growth. By expanding the port facilities further, they have the potential to become major entrepots in the eastern Mediterranean."
SYR_contest_al_jazziris:0 "Contest the al-Jazairis"
SYR_contest_al_jazziris_desc:0 "The reputation wielded by the al-Jazairis is increasingly becoming less of an annoyance and more of an inconvenience, robbing us of support in the Damascus area. We must use any means we can, from tormenting their events to investment in areas loyal to them in order to win their base to our side."
SYR_centralise_authority:0 "Centralise Damascene Authority"
SYR_centralise_authority_desc:0 "The decentralist ideas professed by some will only lead to inefficiencies, it shall be through concentrating political, economic and social power that we will be able to rise to greatness. While our policies are beginning to bring this to fruition, we must create a unitary constitution in order to cement this structure once and for all."
SYR_hawran_secured:0 "Secure the Hawran"
SYR_hawran_secured_desc:0 "The Hawran, with its agricultural output will be vital to securing our new state. Through the appointment of administrators loyal to Damascus we can make sure that the region does not get any notions and remains a tool for us to wield."
SYR_hama_damascus_axis:0 "Develop the Hama-Damascus Axis"
SYR_hama_damascus_axis_desc:0 "Thanks to our policies, the region between the cities of Hama and Damascus is fast becoming the centre of the Syrian state, a core which is loyal to us. Through developing these region further we will entirely eliminate the possibility that other regions could compete with what is becoming known as the 'Damascus-Hama Axis'."
SYR_cooperate_with_nasha:0 "Cooperate with the al-Nashashibis"
SYR_cooperate_with_nasha_desc:0 "It is foolish to try to compete with the al-Nashashibis in Jerusalem, and we do not really have any interest in trying such a task. We will instead come to an understanding with the Al-Nashashibis and win them over to our side, making promises to them in exchange for support."
SYR_palestnian_railroad:0 "Eastern Palestinian Railroad Initative"
SYR_palestnian_railroad_desc:0 "In order to further transportation east of Jerusalem, we will work on creating a Railroad in Eastern Palestine. This will aim to connect Amman and other cities to the rest of Syria, providing the twin benefits of encouraging economic growth and further centralising the nation on Damascus."

# A republic of Equals #
SYR_republic_of_equals:0 "A Republic of Equals"
SYR_republic_of_equals_desc:0 "Syria is a diverse place, and while Arabs control the majority ethnicity, they are not the only ones. Kurds, Turks, Alawites and more all fall under the Syrian banner. By working together, we will be able to achieve a strong republic of equals."
SYR_1940_census:0 "The 1940 Syrian Census"
SYR_1940_census_desc:0 "With our lands consolidated, it is absolutely vital that we conduct a large census of all Syrian lands to better understand the regions of our ethic minorities."
SYR_palestinian_round_table:0 "The Palestinian Round Table Conference"
SYR_palestinian_round_table_desc:0 "As a region which has seen increasing conflict in recent years, Palestine is undoubtedly an area in which we must tread carefully. As part of this we shall establish a broad assembly of representatives from the region to come up with an agreement that guarantees future peace in the region."
SYR_jewish_investment:0 "Encourage Jewish Investment"
SYR_jewish_investment_desc:0 "The Jewish community in the levant has only grown in recent times, and while it can be convenient for some to discriminate against them, we believe this policy is short sighted. By making our position in favour of jewish investment in Syria, we will be able to bring some much needed capital into the country."
SYR_restore_mt_lebanon:0 "Restore the Mt Lebanon Autonomous Region"
SYR_restore_mt_lebanon_desc:0 "The region around Mt. Lebanon is too diverse to simply be subsumed into our nation, we must restore the autonomous region in order to allow the regional minorities to coexist."
SYR_alawite_region:0 "Create the Alawite Autonomous Region"
SYR_alawite_region_desc:0 "The mountainous areas inhabited by our Alawite citizens will never be tamed by the sword, but perhaps through the granting of Autonomy we can show them we understand their wish to protect themselves and their traditions."
SYR_kurdish_region:0 "Create the Kurdish Autonomous Region"
SYR_kurdish_region_desc:0 "Split between different nations, Syria's Kurdish community will always feel a degree of reluctance to be part of our nation, feeling themselves a separate group. By providing them with their own autonomous region we can aknowledge how we are united in our diversity, while also conveniently ending the conflict."
SYR_druze_region:0 "Create the Druze Autonomous Region"
SYR_druze_region_desc:0 "Our Druze population, while small, shall not be forgotten, we shall provide them with their own autonomous region in order to prevent discrimination and violence being committed on them again."
SYR_syrian_federation:0 "Proclaim the Syrian Federation"
SYR_syrian_federation_desc:0 "With the groundwork laid, it is time to cement our new federal system once and for all and draft a constitution proclaiming us the Syrian Federation. We will show that it is not our differences that divide us, but instead bring us together."
SYR_national_pact:0 "The National Pact Compromise"
SYR_national_pact_desc:0 "It is pointless to claim that we represent the interests of all minorities if we do not adequately represent them in governance. While it may seem artificial, and many will argue damages to our claims to meritocracy, equal representation is more important."
SYR_adana_voting:0 "The Adana Plebiscite"
SYR_adana_voting_desc:0 "While we may try to defeat the turkish rebels through force, the fact is that every insurgent we kill is a martyr, and brings ten more to their cause. We must cut our losses while we're ahead and concede to a referendum on the future of our northern territories. Hopefully this may allow us to save face."

syrrep.1.t:0 "Proclamation of the Syrian Republic"
syrrep.1.d:0 "As the main battlefield of the Levantine War, the region of Greater Syria is in complete shambles. Its political elite has been torn apart by assassinations, deportations, and executions as revenge for the Ottoman occupation is performed without mercy by guerilla groups and hard liner Arab nationalists. Even though the (predominately) Sunni caste that has ruled Syria for almost a thousand years is still in charge, many of them are cautiously trying to find their footing in this unknown landscape as the power of families, merchants and landowners is now reliant on both the Arab irregulars roaming the countryside and the Egyptian army trying to smoothen transition to a stable, yet ‘loyal’ government in Damascus.\n\nFurther aggravating the situation is the inability of the ‘central government’ to exert its control over the more rowdy territories under its curfew. In the North, Turkish & Kurdish ex-soldiers organised in so-called ‘defence organisations’ are fighting tooth and nail in opposition to the annexation of Cilicia and Kurdistan. Closer to the capital are Maronite guerillas (in some parts assisted by Druze tribesmen) fighting for their independence, having proclaimed their own country of Lebanon in the lands of the former Mutasarrifate. The border with the state of Iraq remains contentious as well, with little agreement between those in Baghdad and Damascus over its exact location as both parties see control over the Mesopotamian rivers as quintessential to their rule."

syrrep.2.d:0 "Convened by the Damascene elite under the watchful eye of Egyptian observers and with multiple additions from the exiles in Egypt, the All-Syria Congress will try to find a solution to the de facto civil war raging across Greater Syria. It has quickly however become apparent that the Syrian 'unity' from before the war is nowhere to be found as family, regional and generational conflicts are everywhere.\n\nThe older generation, Ottoman notables and for the most part Damascene elite, has organised itself into the National Bloc which sees itself as the continuation of both Al-Fatah (the Syrian resistance during the Weltkrieg) and the post-war anti-Turkish movement. Large landowners, high-ranking religious figures and proponents of the age old Middle Eastern patron-client system, they are looked at favourably by the Egyptian government but have with the departure of Turkish troops, found themselves faced with increasing animosity.\n\nSimilar to the National Bloc but opposed to its Southern Syrian focus, the industrialists and merchants of Aleppo have organised themselves into the People's Party. Even though their social class is similar to that of their Damascene colleagues, they are striving for union with Iraq and are opposed to the monopoly on power held by the elite of the capital."

syrrep.3.t:0 "The Damascene All-Syria Congress: The Second Generation"
syrrep.3.d:0 "Both of these groups however hail from an older generation, a generation whose only purpose has been to maintain the old social system and strive for autonomy from Konstantiniyye. Through the education efforts of the OHF and with massive changes on the European continent, a new generation of Syrians has arrived on the scene who don't hold the same opinion as their elders. Inspired by socialist movements in Europe, the Socialist and Communist parties of Syria are utilising the poverty and crisis caused by the economic depression and the Levantine War to strengthen their parties, with support of the Left in Europe. On the other end of the spectrum, the SSNP has taken inspiration from the Italian and Russian movements and has created a secular, militarist organisation with revolutionary ideas for the Syrian region.\n\nThe biggest threat to the National Bloc however may come in the shape of the League of National Action. Created by highly educated, second generation Arab nationalists, this group forms the moderate center supporting both the secular ambitions of the extremists and believing in the power of the ballot. Newspapers, radio broadcasts, scouts and militias form big parts of their organisation and their service during the Levantine War may prove a deciding factor.\n\nTime will tell which of these movements will achieve the highest office and which will be forever lost to the sands of time..."

Descendent of the legendary Algerian Emir Abdelkader al-Jazairi, whose role in the Lebanese Civil War has made him revered throughout the entire world as "Saint among the Princes, the Prince among the Saints". Whilst his grandson doesn't have anywhere near his credentials, his decisive action during both the Weltkrieg and the Levantine War to secure stability within Damascus has shaped his destiny as one of the city's most influential notables, further reinforced by a long tenure in the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies.\n\nAll parties, associations and groups gathered have promised to stand for open, free and fair elections and are set to return to their constituencies to run their campaigns. Even though these ideals sound nice on paper, the deeply engrained patron-client system in Syria is likely going to secure a victory for the old elite than bring a true representation of the Syrian peoples."

syrrep.5.d:0 "Despite the good intentions of the All-Syria Congress to organise fair elections, this promise seems to have been discarded just after crossing the doorstep. Reports of fraud, bribery and manipulation from all across the country have arrived in Damascus where foreign observers are looking with horror at the unfolding crisis.\n\nIn Aleppo the opposition claimed being denied access to voting stations, 'especially those in Rushdi Bey's constituency.' Rushi al-Kikhiya claimed that voter fraud and intimidation had taken place throughout the Aleppo countryside, where farmers were paid to vote against him and his allies. In one instance, two citizens tried to resist and were escorted out of the voting station at gunpoint. Merchant Abu Saleh Saadiddine and Mohammad Kheir al-Halabi of the Islamic Scholars Association officially filed complaints in Damascus. They claimed to have been beaten with clubs and kicked out of voting booths because they had shown their discontempt of the elections. National Bloc loyalists were accused of breaking into the polling stations in the Jewish quarter of town and stealing the ballot boxes. When confronted by residents, they fired gunshots in the air and set the boxes ablaze. In the rampage, one officer was killed. In Bab Srija in the Old City, sporadic fighting occurred and one citizen was shot dead. Assailants disguised as police officers responded by shooting Abdul Rahman Mekki. In downtown Aleppo, a bomb was discovered at a café that had been planted to kill Rushdi al-Kikhiya, according to the police report.\n\nThe Damascus daily al-Qabas reported that the elections are taking place 'in an atmosphere of terror' with all sides using intimidation to gain the upperhand."

syrrep.6.t:0 "The First Syrian Elections"
syrrep.6.d:0 "With intimidation from both sides running rampant and not fully demobilised militias using scare tactics in the countryside, the elections have not as much shown the desires of the Syrian people but affirmed the law of the strongest in a war-torn nation. Despite promises of equal representation for all religious and ethnic groups, it has already become clear that real power will remain with the Sunni establishment with only token representatives of the Christian minority. No Jews have been elected either as the Zionists in Palestine have boycotted the elections and proclaimed them an affront to the interests of the Jewish people whilst in cities with a large Jewish population such as Aleppo and Damascus, various ballot boxes from their neighbourhoods have been either reported 'missing' or 'invalid'.\n\nDespite high hopes for the socialist parties, their success at the ballots has remained almost entirely absent with only really Akram al-Hourani establishing himself as a key player in his constituency of Hama. The far right under Saadeh has fared equally badly with only limited victories in the urban centers of Northern Syria but without even acquiring a seat for its party leader. Both sides of the spectrum have nonetheless blamed their defeat on the fraudulent elections and call for new elections whilst their militias march through the streets waving the party flag."

syrrep.7.d:0 "Headed by the aging Hashim al-Atassi, the National Bloc has ever since the end of the Levantine War looked for a new leader to take over from al-Atassi. Whilst Hashim al-Atassi is by many seen as one of the most prominent Syrian nationalists, he has decided that with the independence of Syria achieved it is now time to pass the torch to the next generation.\n\nProminent nationalist Shukri al-Quwatli was long rumoured to be waiting in at the sidelines for his mentor to retire and has now fully taken the stage. A resistance fighter since the days of the Weltkrieg, al-Quwatli received immense popularity after being imprisoned and reportedly tortured by the tyrannous regime of Djemal Pasha. Set free, he fought back against the Allenby administration until its withdrawal from Northern Syria in 1920 after which he promptly resumed his activities against the Turkish occupier. After a few close calls with the Ottoman gendarmerie, he would ultimately be forced into exile in Cairo where he became a prominent activist amongst the Shawam, calling for the liberation of his homeland.\n\nAs such his credentials are a given within Syrian nationalist circles but nonetheless there is discontent amongst the party members concerning the age of Quwatli. Albeit younger than al-Atassi, many had hoped that his retirement would enable the next generation to take up the torch and decide the new course of Syria."

Whilst the Lebanese identity of the Beiruti hinterland has proven an issue in forming an acceptable government, the Constitutional Bloc of Bechara El Khoury has ultimately accepted a coalition offer from the National Bloc in exchange for drastic concessions to the Lebanese party.\n\nDelivering the Speaker of the House, the minister of the Navy and extra funding for the Beiruti recovery, there has been protest within the National Bloc as they see this as an insult to the unity of Greater Syria and an indirect acceptance of a seperate Lebanese identity."

Going back decades, the two men closely worked together with Sharabati functioning as al-Quwatlis liaison in Damascus during his years in exile. A student of MIT and one of Syria's most highly educated engineers, the man however has very little experience in managing an administration and many of al-Quwatlis opponents have decried the decision as nothing more but sheer nepotism."
syrrep.9.a:0 "We'll keep an eye on him"

syrrep.10.t:0 "The Sharabati Reforms"
syrrep.10.d:0 "Under the late Ottoman system, students were forced to take mandatory Turkish classes as the government decided that only through a shared language, it would be able to modernise. Whilst the reasoning may have been flawed and protested against by the Syrian population, it also led to a significant expansion of schools and colleges across the Levant which in turn greatly helped literacy in the region.\n\nNow that Syria has become an independent nation however, the need for Turkish classes has almost entirely disappeared and Sharabati has thus decided that a reform of the education system is in order. Turkish will be removed from the curriculum whilst the focus on Ottoman history is to be replaced by the study of Syria with explicit focus on the Damascene Caliphate. Furthermore there has been an increase in students sent to study abroad and bring the knowhow of the West to Syria, although global instability has caused this to be mainly limited to Egypt for now. To replace Turkish, there is however a debate raging amongst the cabinet whether it is best to instead teach the German language, the English language or stick to just Arab."

syrrep.11.d:0 "Coming as somewhat of a surprise, the National Bloc has been trounced at the ballot as reports of widespread corruption by its members tipped opinion at the last minute. An active campaign by members of the Aleppan People's Party with the indirect assistance of the Socialist Party to smear their reputation also greatly assisted whilst the promises of candidates in the minority regions for more rights and greater autonomy, caused landslide victories in their constituencies.\n\nEven though the coalition has nonetheless won the elections, there is still much disagreement on the office of the President as Emir Said al-Jazairi of the Damascene wing has the support from the Druze, Alawite and Maronite minorities whilst Rushdi al-Kikhiya has the ear of Syria's industrial capital, Aleppo. al-Kikhiya also benefits from his support amongst the League of National Action who are boycotting al-Jazairi who they believe is too old and too removed from the (young) Syrian population to represent its interests."

Many however had not expected to come this far and alliances, backdoor deals and gentleman agreements made for the elections are already sustaining severe strain as it becomes apparent that the former agreement is nothing but a few hastily drawn compromises.\n\nIn Lebanon the Reform Society is awaiting its promised autonomy whilst similar questions are being posed in the Jabal al-Druze, Kurdistan and the Alawite mountains. Across the Taurus Mountains, the Turks are increasing their protests and strikes, hoping to convince the government of the need for a referendum that will see them reunited with the rest of Anatolia."

syrrep.13.d:0 "Even though Syria was in peacetime one of the most important agricultural export regions of the Ottoman Empire, the devastation caused by the Levantine war and the displacement of tens of thousands of Syrians has had a catastrophic toll on this sector. Fields are left unattended or destroyed, orchards made into kindling and fuel for the locomotives and farms all across Syria destroyed by roaming bandits.\n\nWhilst the Egyptian government has agreed to send relief, it has proven tricky to organise as the damage to railroads, ports and roads has made it difficult to reach the Syrian interior. Various Syrian industrialists and merchants have allocated a part of their fortunes to the relief campaign whilst contact has been made with the Syrian diaspora across the world, hoping that they will be able to move their governments to action."
syrrep.13.a:0 "This is a catastrophe!"

syrrep.14.t:0 "The State of the Syrian Army"
syrrep.14.d:0 "As the Ottoman Empire largely relied on the Iraqi Arabs for military positions, both because those were seen as less influenced by Arab nationalism and due to the contempt held by the Syrian establishment towards the army, we are finding ourselves stuck in a difficult situation. The Ottoman Syrian army which was largely disbanded after the Turks were pushed back into Anatolia, forms the new backbone of our military but is infested with officers holding less than stellar opinions of the democratic government.\n\nLeading this ragtag force is the former Ottoman colonel Husni al-Za'im who mostly due to lack of better options has been appointed its first in command. The man, of Kurdish origins, is seen by many as corrupt, inadequate and a liability but holds tremendous influence amongst the troops, especially those coming from the minority regions.\n\nThis has convinced most of the government that ridding themselves of the man, whilst they barely control their own provinces, may lead to a coup toppling the young democracy and ushering in a military regime, not unlike our Iraqi neighbours."

As soldiers marched through the empty streets of the Old City, morning dew covered the trees and jasmine flowers that filled the balconies of Damascus. It was chilly before dawn. A few people were already awake, heading to work either on foot or by bicycle. Tanks and machine guns were placed at strategic points throughout the Syrian Capital.\n\nIt is the first time - but many are expecting it to be far from the last - that the word 'coup' or Inkilab was uttered in Syria.\n\nAll of the borders were closed and communication with the outside world was suspended. Telephone lines to and from Damascus were cut off. One military unit headed through the sleeping city to the president's residence in Bustan al-Rais. The soldiers easily disarmed the one guard on duty at [SYR.GetLeader]'s residence and broke in only to be confronted by the president himself. After reading out a short arrest warrant, the man was subsequently escorted out of his home at gunpoint and driven to Mezzeh Prison on a hilltop west of Damascus. "

syrrep.16.t:0 "[SYR.GetLeader] Submits His Resignation"
syrrep.16.d:0 "Only recently elected president of the Syrian Republic, [SYR.GetLeader] submitted his resignation earlier today from his prison cell: ‘I present the noble people of Syria with my resignation from the Presidency of the Republic, wishing them eternal splendour and glory.’ He made a point by addressing it to the Syrian people and not to Husni al-Za’im or to the disbanded Chamber of Deputies. Al-Za’im had it zincographed and printed in a propaganda booklet distributed by the Media Department of the Syrian Army, accompanied by testimonials showering the General with praise. Everybody of note in Syria pitched in with a word or two about his wisdom, charm and chivalry - including the friends of the deposed president.\n\nDespite all the violence - it has to be noted that not a single person was killed during the coup -, international press mentions: "‘Most Syrians, sipping coffee in the bazaars and smoking their hubble-bubble pipes, took hardly any notice of the change in government. In their 4,000-year history they had tasted the rule of Persians, Greek, Romans, Mongols and Turks. They were prepared to get used to Husni al-Za’im too". Curfews have been installed and government personnel forced to attend to their normal positions but all in all the people of Syria are too tired to put up much resistance. The next few weeks and months will likely see an increase in opposition but for now al-Za'im rules supreme."

Well aware that to legitimise his rule, he needs to enact sweeping reforms catering to all sides and above all needs to restart the crumbling Syrian economy, al-Za'im sees this only feasible through the acquisition of tremendous economic and military support from abroad for his regime.\n\nWhilst described as a brute by many of his enemies and colleagues, al-Zaim has avoided to anger supporters of either of the two European power blocs, both catering to the socialist Akram al-Hourani and the Syrian army consisting of many pro-German ex-Ottoman officers supportive of his government. If Syria is to acquire its much needed support however, it will need to take a decisive stance in the stand-off between the two blocs and rid itself of agents within the nation that may harbour support for the opposing bloc."

With little land left to the simple farmer, the socialist Akram al-Hourani was able to spread his populist rhetoric across the country, most successfully in his hometown of Hama where widespread corruption and poverty ensured him a landslide victory in the last elections.\n\nBy co-opting the plans of his friend al-Hourani, al-Za'im is both breaking the power of the great Syrian families, his main opposition, and winning the favour of the common man who is struggling to survive in the wake of the Levantine war and desperately pleads for a strong figure to restore order."

syrrep.19.d:0 "Inspired by the programs of the late Ottoman OHF and its leader Mustafa Kemal Pasha, has set his eyes on modernising the Syrian state and breaking with its traditional, religious, origins. Targeting schools, universities and courts, the cabinet of al-Za'im has arrested or replaced figures who have been identified as enemies of the regime, rewritten curricula to devalue the Arab nationalists that founded the National Bloc. Religious schools, closed by the late Ottoman regime but reopened after their departure from Syria, have been closed once more as the new generalissimo sees in the Ulemma nothing but an ancient, decrepit institution out to weaken the Syrian people from within.\n\nWith all political parties banned, the government has also embarked on a crusade against newspapers and underground political organisations to ensure that its control can not be challenged. A 24-hour propaganda broadcast on the radio waves has been set up, whilst strict control is exercised over any other stations. Despite these efforts to suppress the opposition, papers and broadcasts produced by Syrian exiles in our neighbouring countries are able to infiltrate the nation."

syrrep.20.d:0 "As promised by Husni al-Za'im when he took power, 'free' elections were held throughout Syria last week to decide on the future of the nation. That the elections would be a sham was to be expected but not many expected it to be so obvious as al-Za'im was today declared president with 117% of the votes after running unopposed, successfully finding 150.000 more votes than there were eligible voters. State newspapers were quick to congratulate the president on his astonishing victory whilst in Damascus festivities were thrown to celebrate the consolidation of power by the military establishment.\n\nIndustrialists, National Bloc supporters or intellectuals who hadn't yet left the country are now fleeing en masse, scared by the intense anger outed against their figure by student manifestations and pro-Za'im protesters. The government is doing nothing to hinder their departure but has already decreed that every enemy of the state who leaves the country shall have his possessions confiscated and redistributed (to the cronies of al-Za'im)."

syrrep.21.t:0 "Coup d'Etat in Damascus"
syrrep.21.d:0 "Much like happened only a few months ago, Syrian tanks and trucks rolled through the streets of the Old City during the early hours today as former friend and colleague of al-Za'im, Sami al-Hinawi, performed his own coup.\n\nThe Syrian dictator was abducted from his home in al-Rawda off Abu Rummaneh Street, suffering basically the same fate he had inflicted on the last democratic president. When soldiers showed up at his doorstep at 2:00 am, al-Za’im confronted them from his balcony window, having just returned from a charity ball at Bloudan Hotel hosted by the Syrian Red Crescent. They opened fire, missed, then broke in and dragged him out in his undershirt, screaming like a madman. Fadlallah Abu Mansour, one of the officers leading the coup, slapped the Syrian president across the face. ‘Don’t hit me’ snarled al-Za’im. He quickly added: ‘Listen, I have 80,000 Syrian pounds on me. Take 50,000 and give 20,000 to your troops. Just let me get out of Syria alive.’ Abu Mansour struck him again, ‘From where did you get such wealth? How did your poverty transform into wealth?’ The soldiers had already confiscated 36,000 pounds from al-Za’im’s home. By now in tears, al-Za’im muttered: "I tell you I am innocent." He then asked "Who is behind the coup?". Abu Mansour loaded his pistol and pressed it hard against his head, ‘If you don’t shut up, I will blow your brains out!’\n\nUpon reaching an abandoned plot of land in Mezzeh, near the old cemetery, al-Za’im suffered just this fate. He was executed by firing squad, along with his prime minister and adviser, Muhsen al-Barazi, in the early hours of the day, with a total of 117 bullets fired into his body."

syrrep.22.d:0 "Instigated by the People's Party in response to the insufficient measures taken by the government to combat rising grain prices, the city of Aleppo has taken to the streets to protest against their government. All bakeries and bread mills were shut down, whilst students and merchants marched through the streets. Whilst the main theme of this protest is centered around the weak economic policies of the government, it is in fact an outcry by the industrial capital of Syria against the limited influence they have in the decision making which is almost solely done by the Damascene elite."
syrrep.22.a:0 "Let them eat cake!"

syrrep.23.t:0 "Death of Saadallah al-Jabiri"
syrrep.23.d:0 "Saadallah al-Jabiri was found dead earlier this morning in his house in Aleppo. The National Bloc heavyweight and staunch defender of democracy by many seen as the unofficial leader of Aleppo was a close friend of al-Quwatli and functioned as his partner and ally in the contentious Northern Syria. It is as of now still unclear what the cause of death is but the still relatively young politician had been struggling ever after a mortar shell hit his home during the siege of Aleppo in the Levantine war. It is unlikely that rumours of murder will ever be discarded as in Muslim tradition the body has to be burried as quickly as possible.\n\nWith his passing, many Aleppines are now looking to the People's Party who formed his main opposition within the city. Their leaders, Rushdi al-Kikhiya and Nazim al-Kudsi, were however quick to mourn his passing and praised him as a paragon of virtue and Syrian nationalism."

syrrep.24.t:0 "Marada Intensify Attacks in Northern Lebanon"
syrrep.24.d:0 "Led by Pierre Gemayel and William Hawi, the Marada guerillas have intensified their attacks on military outposts in Western Syria. The group derives its name from independent communities in Lebanon and the surrounding highlands after the conquest of Syria by the Arab army in 630 CE, renown for their fierce martial prowess. It is on their legacy that the predominately Maronite militia wants to build and their goals for an independent Lebanon free from Syrian interference are non-negotiable.\n\nNot all Lebanese citizens are supportive of their actions however as many see their excessive violence and brutality versus muslims as ruining the newfound role of Lebanon within the Syrian nation. Mayor of Beirut and scion of the prominent Daouk family, Ahmad Daouk, has denounced their actions and has urgently requested Gemayel and Hawi to stand down."
syrrep.24.a:0 "They won't resist us forever!"

syrrep.25.t:0 "Unrest in the Lebanese Ranks"
syrrep.25.d:0 "Due to the special status of Lebanon in the Ottoman Empire and their fairly independent role during the Levantine War, the former Lebanese resistance has been allowed to create their own divisions and military structure within the Syrian framework. Calling themselves the "Lebanese Volunteer Army", these men fight under the leadership of their general Fuad Chehab.\n\nWith conflict still raging all across Syria, the government in Damascus is calling on all parts of the Syrian Army to assist in restoring order. The LVA however is refusing to fight outside of Lebanese territory, claiming those are Syrian problems and not Lebanese ones. This has caused quite the outrage in Damascus which denies that Lebanon is a seperate entity from Syria and has sent new orders to Chehab, deploying him and his troops to Palestine to assist in quelling Zionist cells."
syrrep.25.a:0 "How dare they refuse a direct order?"

syrrep.26.t:0 "Fuad Chehab Declares the Independence of Lebanon"
syrrep.26.d:0 "Discontent with the invasive influence and meddling of the Damascene elite in the affairs of the former Mutasarrifate, the final drop that tipped the bucket over arrived earlier this week as the incompetence of the Syrian army in quelling the various rebel cells still operating on its territory, prompted [SYR.GetLeader] to send the Lebanese division into Palestine. Citing this as blatant disregard of the Beirut Treaty which stipulated the autonomy of the Maronite community and promised that the Lebanese forces would solely be used on Lebanese territory, their general Fuad Chehab has declared the 'Syrian-Lebanese Union' to have run its time.\n\nThe Syrian public is outraged at this blatant betrayal of the Arab cause and is demanding direct military action to bring the rebelling province back into the fold. With Beirut as the most important harbour of the Levant, the economic damage is likely to be massive to the fledgling Syrian state if a solution isn't found. President [SYR.GetLeader] was quick to declare the Lebanese state illegitimate and has received support from across the Arab world in this stance with the Egyptians promising to assist Syria if need be."

syrrep.27.d:0 "Recent reshuffling of the cabinet and the blatant bias for Damascene industrialists shown by the government, has created much discontent amongst the representatives of Lebanon.\n\nAfter funding to renovate the Beiruti harbour and expand healthcare facilities within the city was granted to the company of (Minister of Education) Ahmad Sharabati, representatives from the city today stood up in the middle of the parliamentary session and left the building to protest the nepotism rife within the [SYR.GetLeader] administration."

syrrep.28.d:0 "To fulfill the wishes of the predominately Turkish population of Cilicia and put an end to the activities of the Müdâfaa-i Hukuk Cemiyetleri, the government in Damascus has finally submitted to holding a referendum in the Northern provinces of Syria. Whilst this sets a dangerous precedent for other groups willing to leave the Syrian state, the government had to admit that it was utterly incapable of defeating the irregular Turkish forces and has written out a referendum in the hopes of saving face.\n\nDaggers have already been drawn and shoes thrown in the capital as the population is striking and protesting against what they see as the death of Syria. Police and military units have been sent into the city in an attempt to stop the violence from escalating but in Damascus and cities further up North, Turkish speaking citizens are being attacked and shouted at on the streets."
syrrep.28.a:0 "We had no choice..."

syrrep.29.t:0 "Sami al-Hinawi Restores Democracy"
syrrep.29.d:0 "Although himself part of the military establishment and a close friend of the late Syrian dictator, al-Hinawi has today announced that he fully plans on giving Syria back to its people and has called on well-known Syrian nationalist Hashim al-Atassi to form a government that will lead Syria back on the right track.\n\nDespite his good intentions, the leader of the coup has made sure that his position is safe and has used his moment of power to move more privileges and influence to the head of the armed forces. The minister of defence will now also always be a member of the military to avoid in his words 'the incompetence and lack of know-how of civilian personnel'."

The manifesto has outraged the military leadership in Damascus but has gained widespread popularity amongst both members of the Lebanese volunteer Army and the Lebanese civilian population.\n\nThere have been calls to potentially sack Fuad Chehab, and appoint the more pro-Syrian officer Shawkat Shukayr to lead the Lebanese Volunteer Army into Palestine, but even Shukayr appears to be showing doubts, as his telegrams back to Damascus are taking longer and longer to arrive, with each reply. Chehab himself has supposedly taken a “leave of absence”, but has been immediately placed under close supervision by our government agents."

syrrep.31.t:0 "Lebanese Public Figures Convene at Beiteddine Palace"
syrrep.31.d:0 "General Fuad Chehab was spotted entering a car, earlier this day, alongside the prominent Lebanese politician Bechara el-Khoury and the Druze Sheikh Majid Arslan. Although our agents tracked the vehicle to the Beiteddine Palace, an old castle built in the ages of the Lebanese Emirate, they were held up by a detachment of the Lebanese Volunteer Army, who appeared to be garrisoning the Palace without any clear explanation. A somewhat tense conversation ensued, which devolved into a complicated argument over credentials and bureaucratic red tape, as the soldiers denied them entry.\n\nBefore they were forced to leave, our agents noted the presence of other political figures at this suspicious gathering. Considering Beiteddine’s location within the district of Chouf, the territory of the Druze Jumblatt Clan, it is highly likely that the young chief Kamal Jumblatt and his relatives were also in attendance.\n\nAlthough the Syrian constitution upholds the right for its citizens to hold a public assembly, the presence of both military men, politicians and tribal leaders, conversing in a palace which has been seen as a symbol of Lebanese independence, has sent a fright to Damascus."

syrrep.32.t:0 "The Jaffa Conference"
syrrep.32.d:0 "Elected on the promise of autonomy for the various Syrian minority groups, our newly elected President has called for a second All-Syria Congress in Jaffa to explore the possibilities of devolution. Enthusiasm for his plans remains low amongst the Sunni Arabs however as they fear this will greatly weaken the power of the Syrian government and hinder its potential in becoming the leader of the Arab movement.\n\nTo show their discontent, the National Bloc has spoken out against the Jaffa Conference and asked its members not to attend in the hopes of preventing any accord. Division is running rampant in both the party and the Sunni group in general however as many figures see Jaffa as a stepping stone to power in the new Syrian system. Aleppines, weary of losing power to the Damascenes and fearful that an aggressive Syrian government might wreak havoc in their primarily Turkish and Kurdish economic hinterland have already announced they will show up. Alawites, Druze and Maronites have also accepted the invitation whilst the Turks thus far have refused to participate. To immense protest of his peers in Damascus, the President has also made the curious decision to extend an invitation to David Ben-Gurion of the Yishuv, hoping that he may be able to come to an accord with the remaining Zionists that could benefit Syria."
syrrep.32.a:0 "Jaffa will break or make the new Syria..."

syrrep.33.t:0 "Restoration of the Millet System"
syrrep.33.d:0 "To provide an answer to the increasing demands of ethnic and religious minorities to receive guarantees from the government concerning their self-government, the cabinet has produced a proposal to restore the Ottoman millet system. Granting legal, religious and educational autonomy, the proposal is receiving widespread support from the non-Muslim and Druze Syrians who have by now become the main support base for the shaky regime. Nonetheless the proposal currently still holds back on granting full self governance to the affected provinces as opposition to this idea grows stronger by the day in Sunni Syria.\n\nWhilst members of the League of National Action are protesting in the streets of Damascus against the perceived weakening of the Syrian state, discontent with the policies of al-Jazairi is spreading amongst his vital Aleppine coalition partners who support the weakening of Damascene power but are weary that it may impact their influence over the Kurdish and Turkish hinterlands."
syrrep.33.a:0 "We are walking on a tightrope"

syrrep.34.t:0 "Rushdi al-Kikhiya Leaves the Coalition"
syrrep.34.d:0 "Few were expecting the anti-National Bloc coalition to last its first term in office and their predictions have become truth today as al-Kikhiya has pulled his party from the al-Jazairi coalition. The decentralist plans of the President were already causing trouble for the Aleppines but it would be the loss of Adana that put the final nail in the coffin. Feeling abandoned by their partner in what they saw as a vital issue for the city of Aleppo, al-Kikhiya told the press that the government in Damascus is not only an outdated, ineffective mess but also holds the interests of minorities and foreigners over those of the hard-working Syrian.\n\nWith the decision to bail on the progressive coalition, the President now finds himself with a minority of seats in parliament an a further enemy on the streets. The most likely move now seems new elections but some within the party have argued that it would be best to finish the work we have started through a minority cabinet, hoping that the opposition is too divided to contest the government."

syrrev.1.d:0 "With war in the Mashriq, the Damascenes have once again shown where their true loyalties lay as earlier today a Druze army marched into the capital of the Suriye vilayet and successfully overthrew, together with assistance from the local population, the Turkish garrison. All around the city Turkish shops are destroyed and Turkish citizens attacked as a new revolutionary fervour is spreading through the Arab inhabitants."

syrrev.3.d:0 "Cracked down on by the Young Turks in 1910 to assert Ottoman control over the region, the bloody repression and forced disarmament of the bedouins of the Al-Karak region have answered the call of the Druze and other Syrian movements, joining in on the Syrian revolt. As a vital station on the Hejaz railway, this move has greatly shocked Ottoman authorities further up North who now fear that their inability to quickly react to movement in the Hejaz will lead to an open insurrection in the Holy Cities themselves."

The Vilayet whose connection to Turkish Anatolia is the most solid of the whole Syrian region seems to now also abandon the Sultan in favour of self determination. Chaos rules supreme on the streets of the city as agitators are spreading as North as Iskenderun although the same signs of complete dedication to the revolt as in the Southern Vilayets remain absent for the time being, likely due to the rivalry between the various citizens and the large non-Muslim population of the city."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_PHAM_VAN_DONG_DESC:0 "In 1924, Pham Van Dong travelled to southern China. There, he met Ho Chi Minh, and quickly became one of his most trusted confidants and leaders of men. He witnessed the tragic end of Vietnamese syndicalist movement and fled to France. In exile, he developed an interest in the ideology of French Jacobins, Vanguardism. The idea of a vanguard group of disciplined intellectuals leading the revolution captured him. After the split of the League in 1931, he founded Tan Viet party and started infiltrating the colony. Most of his colleagues find him forever diligent and energetic, a reliable and loveable person as well as an ideal organiser and administrator. On the other hand, his enemy fear his ability to run the party and state machine."
POLITICS_TA_THU_THAO_DESC:0 "This young radical almost shouldn't have been the chairman of the prestigious Indochinese Revolutionary League, but he is and he is well respected by his colleagues. Ta Thu Thau became a prominent activist in Saigon in the mid-1920s and joined the League in its darkest days. After the split in 1931 gave another heavy blow to the League, Ta Thu Thau rose to power. This sharp intellectual has intentionally modelled Ho Chi Minh's leading style since his assuming of the title of Chairman, trying to calm factional tensions and strengthen solidarity. The recovery of the League from the collapse largely credited to his efforts. Now, he is determined to achieve the unfulfilled dream of the martyrs——build syndicalism in Indochina."
POLITICS_NGUYEN_AN_NINH_DESC:0 "Nguyen An Ninh is respected by most Indochinese intellectuals as the true democratic soul of Indochina. He studied in Sorbonne and participated the French Revolution in 1919. In 1922, Nguyen An Ninh, Nguyen The Truyen and Nguyen Ai Quoc (Ho Chi Minh) met in Marseille and decided to plan the liberation of their motherland. Nguyen An Ninh returned to Indochina in 1924 and was arrested by German police for radical agitation. After witness the crackdown of Indochinese syndicalism, Nguyen An Ninh decided that Indochinese revolution must rely on the spontaneous uprising of peasants. Since then, he started the Aspiration Society, modelling on traditional secret societies. He often personally travels from village to village under the disguise of a monk or herbist, selling his self-made ointment, and secretly recruit members to sow the seeds of revolution. He thus won great popularity among peasants in the Mekong Delta. While his dream of complete transforming the personality of Indochinese people might not realise in the foreseeable future, his emphasis on cultural enlightenment, autonomy and spontaneity will deeply reshape Indochinese society."
POLITICS_NGUYEN_TAI_HOC_DESC:0 "Nguyen Thai Hoc is the founding leader of the Viet Nam Quo Dan Dang, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. He was a supporter of colonial reformism, but later disappointed at the empty promises of the colonial regime and became the leader of revolutionary nationalism. Although the Yen-Bai mutiny failed, his successful escape from German police after that tragedy adds another chapter in his heroic deeds. Influenced by Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, he envisages a democratic republic truly for people's welfare."

INC_vietminh_desc:0 "The 'Viet Minh', or 'League for the Independence of Vietnam', is a broad coalition government of groups which seek the immediate independence of Vietnam.

### Events ###
viet.0.t:0 "New Indochina!"
viet.0.d:0 "Our general uprising has achieved a great victory. On the corpse of German colonial regime proudly stands our independent nation, ruled by the Vietnamese National Independence Coalition, or Viet Minh, which was established earlier this year and which coordinated the uprisings.\n\nNguyen An Ninh has been elected as the chairman of the Viet Minh. The loss of thousands of lives have already proven that the German colonial regime will not yield until the bitter end. The Viet Minh is determined to lead this national resistance war against the German bandits, and that calls for the will of all Indochinese people - Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, Muong, Tay... To sacrifice themselves in service to our just cause.\n\n(Since you have a coalition government, the popularity of your government won't be affected by the popularity of your ruling party)"
viet.0.a:0 "We will be victorious!"

viet.1.t:0 "An Indochinese Declaration of Independence"
viet.1.d:0 "As our national salvation war against German bandits begins, we are going to form an independent sovereign state. While few Cambodians and Laotian have joined us, the revolutionaries agreed that the newly established state should represent the whole Indochina and devoted to the liberation of Indochinese people.\n\nThe revolutionaries decided to draft an Indochinese Declaration of Independence. The radical revolutionaries urge an expression of our solidarity with the Internationale. Meanwhile, VNQDD and other nationalists wanted to declare Pan-Asianist ambition. While strongly devoted to internationalism, syndicalist leader Ta Thu Thau believes in the need for a tactical compromise——A moderate declaration will win the support home and abroad."
viet.1.a:0 "An Internationalist Declaration!"
viet.1.b:0 "A Pan-Asianist Declaration!"
viet.1.c:0 "A Moderate Declaration!"

viet.2.t:0 "Politics in the Viet Minh"
viet.2.d:0 "Among all the revolutionaries and patriots in the Viet Minh, four factions stand out:\n\nAfter the crackdown in 1926, Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Youth League suffered from internal split. The Indochinese Revolutionary League is its direct successor. Adhering to orthodox anarcho-syndicalism, the current leader Ta Thu Thau, recently returned from France, succeeded in organizing trade unions in Saigon and some other cities.\nInfluenced by the French Jacobins, some hard-liners broke away from the League in the 1931 Paris Conference and formed New Viet Revolutionary Party, or Tan Viet. The Tan Viet believes in the virtue of iron discipline and secret movement. As a result, they proved to be effective in infiltrating the colonial police force and garrison.\nThe VNQDD, or the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, is modeled after the Chinese Nationalist Party or KMT. This party is popular among the petit bourgeoise and wealthy farmers, especially in northern Vietnam. The failed Yen-Bai mutiny cut down many of the party's members, but also won them heroic reputation.\nIn 1928, Nguyen An Ninh, a prominent anarchist revolutionary in Indochina, founded the Aspiration Youth. Convinced that syndicalism cannot win the revolution, he modeled his movement on traditional secret societies to agitate the revolutionary spontaneity of peasants. While its anarchist ideals attracted many intellectuals, their connections to the rural area played a key role in the revolution and ensured their dominance in the Viet Minh.\n\nWhile the initial euphoria of revolution unites all factions, only time can tell whether this unity will endure the forthcoming challenges."
viet.2.a:0 "Together for Victory!"

viet.3.t:0 "Anti-Infiltration Campaign"
viet.3.d:0 "The German scum want to sabotage our glorious revolution. Spies and traitors are everywhere. While the VNQDD wants to infiltrate the enemy and launch an intelligence counter-offensive, the Tan Viet party argues that expanding our secret police is the only way to eliminate internal enemies. The Anarchists and Syndicalists urge us to create a red terror by authorizing our local militia to arrest and execute suspicious people and set up a revolutionary tribunal. Whatever we choose, we must crush the enemy!"
viet.3.a:0 "We must strengthen our intelligence."
viet.3.b:0 "Expand the secret police."
viet.3.c:0 "Red Terror is our response."

viet.4.t:0 "Land Policy"
viet.4.d:0 "If the Indochinese revolution is to prevail, it must win the hearts and minds of peasants. Nationalists argue for rent reduction for tenants but maintaining our relationship with patriotic landlords. However, radicals want a complete land reform to mobilise the peasants and eliminate the Ancien Régime in every village. The fierce debate on the land policy is splitting the coalition. Ta Thu Thau and Pham Van Dong suggested a compromise by confiscating the land of 'traitors' for now and conduct land reform in the future."
viet.4.a:0 "We will slightly reduce rent."
viet.4.b:0 "Promise land redistribution in the future."
viet.4.c:0 "Radical land reform now!"

viet.5.t:0 "German Blockade"
viet.5.d:0 "German imperialists have completely cut off our line of communication with our international friends. Now we are in dire lacking of equipment. Many of our soldiers are equipped with hatchets and spears. The Tan Viet party inherits the transnational underground revolutionary network developed by the old league in the 1920s. They suggest to focus on smuggling weapons in the gold triangle to support our troops. This trade, however, requires absolute secrecy and some amoralism..."
viet.5.a:0 "We have no other choice."

viet.5.e:0 "Keep the pace."

viet.6.t:0 "National Assembly"
viet.6.d:0 "Despite some controversy about whether counter-revolutionary suspects should be given election right, the provisional government decided that all people 18 years old or older were eligible to vote to generate the National Assembly, which is expected to be the highest organ of the state exerting both legislative and executive power. Now, the first national election in the Indochinese history, against all odds, has been conducted in such an emergent situation. A new majority emerged in the newly convened National Assembly and appointed a chairman of Assembly, also the head of state..."
viet.6.a:0 "Nguyen An Ninh's charisma conquers everyone!"
viet.6.b:0 "Ta Thu Thau secures the support of workers!"
viet.6.c:0 "The Tan Viet Party's superior organisation prevails."
viet.6.e:0 "The VNQDD's nationalist rhetoric wins over the masses!"

viet.7.t:0 "The Fate of Nguyen Thi Nam"
viet.7.d:0 "Nguyen Thi Nam is a very successful merchant in northern Vietnam, known as "the Queen of Iron". She also owned some of the largest and most modernised plantations in the North. She has been secretly funding anti-colonial movements for a long time. However, while our army was advancing, the workers in her plantations rose up and captured her. They, along with over five thousand peasants from neighbouring communes, crammed together and set up a revolutionary tribunal. Under the red banner "Overthrow the despotic landlord Nguyen Thi Nam, take back the land for the peasants!" they announced the death penalty for her. Our soldiers stopped the execution, but an immediate decision needs to be made."
viet.7.a:0 "Damn she is our hero! Suppress those bandits."
viet.7.b:0 "Confiscate her property, and leave her be."
viet.7.c:0 "Revolution is the synonym for Justice!"

viet.8.t:0 "Nationalist Conspiracy"

viet.63.t:0 "The result of land reform"
viet.63.d.a:0 "Our land reform created a rural society of small land-owners. The landlord regime in the countryside diminished. Most landlords moved to cities and start a new life with the revenue from selling land. However, Tenants and poor peasants, although received their land, are still burdened with loans. Many radicals regard this as a revolution unfinished..."
viet.63.d.b:0 "Our land reform created a mixed result: Extremists tried eradicated landlords physically. However, landholders were frightened to make concessions and in general the land reform was conducted in a peaceful manner. Most peasants now are self-sufficient and become more confident while the former landlords and gentries are very discontent with the result."
viet.63.d.c:0 "Our land reform created a very egalitarian rural society. Gentry and landlords are fundamentally eliminated. In many villages poor peasants developed a strong sense of class consciousness. However, the terrors during the land reform also left deep rift within Indochinese society.

viet.67.t:0 "Expand Redistribution Target?"
viet.67.d:0 "With the land reform expanding to the North, we encountered a rather different situation-these areas are too densly populated and impoverished that we can't find enough land from landlords to redistribute. Therefore, if we want to fulfil the promise of land to the tillers, That means many small landholders will be also the target of land redistribution..."

viet.67.b:0 "There should be other solutions."

viet.68.t:0 "Red Terror"
viet.68.d:0 "The violent Land Reform has evolved into a red terror engulfing the entire country! Many villages see mass execution of landlords.

Some believe he has a real military talent but our generals trained in France doubt it. Should we enlist this amateur into our army?"

viet.71.t:0 "Army Reform"
viet.71.d:0 "The newly born People's Army of Indochina has stood up to the baptism of fire, but it's still a very immature army.

General Van Tien Dung, representing the idea of the general staff, believes in the merit of well-planned surprise offensive. They want to create a more centralised command system. Meanwhile, General Nguyen Chi Thanh, a prestigious political officer, believes in the merit of human will and individual initiative. He and his colleagues argued that courage and tenacity of Indochinese soldiers is our greatest weapon."

viet.73.t:0 "Panzer Panic"
viet.73.d:0 "Our soldiers have reported encountering terrible steel monsters that can spit fireballs. Our officers trained in France know it is a type of armoured vessel called the Tank, or, in German, the "Panzer". However, this weapon still causes great panic among our peasant soldiers, and even those who know it is not a monster have found no methods to deal with its armour. The Panzer panic has demoralised our army and many soldiers flee from the battlefield whenever German Panzers emerge."
viet.73.a:0 "Monsters!"

viet.83.d:0 "Recently, some of our writers published a series of non-fictions and novels reflecting on our previous war.

viet.86.t:0 "Women's role in revolution?"
viet.86.d:0 "The question of women has become controversial in Indochina. Many women joined the revolution and end up in important positions, but male revolutionaries are dissatisifed with being led by women and they tend to cast women participants in support roles. Despite evidence that in prehistoric times Indochinese women enjoyed equality or even power, the norm of women taking a submissive role has long been internalized in our society and it will be hard to change."
viet.86.a:0 "They should be content with auxiliary roles."
viet.86.b:0 "Women hold up half the sky!"

viet.87.t:0 "New Four Virtues"
viet.87.d:0 "Traditionally, women are expected to behave according to the 'Four Virtues', which are wifely behaviour, wifely speech, wifely manner and wifely labor. Recently, some radical feminists published a series of essays claiming the 'Four Virtues' might be given new meanings: "behaviour" should not signify slavish obedience, but resolute commitment to the struggle for freedom and independence; "speech" is to talk boldly and eloquently to convince people to join the liberation struggle, or firmly and bluntly when telling men they were wrong; "manner" is not pleasant expressions but revolutionary anger, eagerness, and aggressiveness; and "labor" should exclude domestic works.\n\nTheir claim scared many people, including intellectuals known for supporting gender equality."
viet.87.a:0 "Sounds too radical."
viet.87.b:0 "Support them!"
viet.87.c:0 "This should equally apply to men!"

viet.88.t:0 "The Tragedies of the Youth Shock Brigade"
viet.88.d:0 "Our Youth Shock Brigade, mainly comprised of young girls and women volunteers, is an important auxiliary unit known as "our army's arm and leg". However, a recent report discovered that the tragic experiences of the "Shock Girls" sent to the front line armed with simple shovels and having no military knowledge. Food and clothing are in chronic shortage on the front line. Working hour is long and living condition is terrible. Despite the girls' courage and determination, their resistance to enemy artilleries and bombing using shovels and pickaxes is hopelessly inadequate. The report has caught wide public attention and shown a demoralising impact."
viet.88.a:0 "We should try to improve their equipments and working condition."
viet.88.b:0 "We shouldn't let women go to dangerous places."
viet.88.c:0 "Sorry but we can't do anything."

viet.91.d:0 "Buddhist sects all across Indochina recently held a meeting to found the Indochinese Unified Buddhist Sangha. Under the banner of Buddhist revival movement, they seek to reform and strengthen Buddhism in the modern age. Unlike other religions like Catholicism or Caodaism, Buddhism is deeply entrenched in Indochinese population. The government has to treat it cautiously."

viet.93.d:0 "Our recent close cooperation with the Commune of France brought a surge, or resurgence of Frencomania in Saigon. The new fashion of 'civilised' Saigon citizens is to dress like a French worker, address each other's name with 'Monsieur', and eat Banh mi.

Due to the influence of our leading intellectuals, the curatorial priorities are the works of the avant-garde artists in syndicalist countries. However, it turned out that our citizens can hardly appreciate these modernist, futurist and surrealist art..."
viet.95.a:0 "We must further drill the taste of Indochinese people."
viet.95.b:0 "Avant-garde culture seems too advanced for a place like Indochina..."

viet.96.t:0 "The spread of Sorelian influence"
viet.96.d:0 "Although Indochinese exiles in France already knew Sorelianism, it didn't become a major trend in oversea Indochinese community. However, the recent victory of Sorelianists in France brought a surge of Sorelian ideas among our students in France. Several radical Sorelian groups like 'Dai Viet Socialist Combat Team' were formed in France and started to have influence on Indochina."
viet.96.a:0 "Sounds like a new fashion."
viet.96.b:0 "Another worrisome radical ideology."

viet.97.t:0 "Battle of Hue"
viet.97.d:0 "Our troops launched a coordinated offensive to take Hue, the ancient imperial capital city of Vietnam. As expected, it's the lair of Vietnamese reactionaries. German and loyal Vietnamese troops occupied some well fortified positions in the city, including the imperial citadel. Our army was engaged in heavy house-to-house and street fighting to take the city. All the available heavy equipments are gathered and many buildings are demolished to achieve a breakthrough. The battle for the Imperial Citadel is no less brutal. Out of 160 buildings of the Imperial City only few major sites remained intact when the flag of Indochinese Union flying on the Citadel flag tower. During and after the bloody battle, thousands of die-hard reactionary civilians were switfly executed."

#viet.98.t:0 "Dumb Luck - newest Book of Vu Trong Phung"
#viet.98.d:0 "Vu Trong Phung, a talented novelist and satiricist living in Hanoi published his new novel So Do (Dumb Luck), a bitter satire of the rage for modernisation in Vietnam during the late-colonial era. The novel follows the absurd and unexpected rise within colonial society of a street-smart vagabond named Red-haired Xuan. The idiotic Xuan's use of rhetorics like 'civilisation' and 'modern citizen' allowed him ascending to intellectual society of Indochina. It also ridiculed the revolutionaries in the early 1930s. The novel, despite its popularity among common readers, turned out to be very politically provocative. This book is criticised as degenerate by some intellectuals and its revolutionary merits are questioned. The critics also claimed that a character in the book, the Cochinchinese King of Visceral Disease Treatment is ridiculing Nguyen An Ninh who sold self-made ointment when conducting revolution in the Mekong delta."
#viet.98.a:0 "Nonsense, this a good book."
#viet.98.b:0 "Support a comedy film adaptation and Nguyen An Ninh will play the King of Visceral Disease Treatment!"

viet.110.t:0 "Searching for Brother Ho"
viet.110.d:0 "Although official record states that Comrade Ho Chi Minh, or better known as Nguyen Ai Quoc back in Paris, was killed in 1926 during the German intervention, there was no solid evidence that he is dead aside from the dubious German claim. There were rumors that Ho Chi Minh actually escaped from that disaster and hid in southern China organising a guerrilla. Although it might be unlikely that he is still alive, people still wonder about Brother Ho's fate. With the help of a friendly Chinese government, it's now possible to conduct an investigation in southern China of this..."
viet.110.a:0 "It's good to have a try."
viet.110.b:0 "We already know he died."

viet.111.t:0 "We found Brother Ho's wife?"
viet.111.d:0 "During our investigation, we found a woman in Guangzhou, Tang Tuyet Minh, claiming she was brother Ho's wife. The legal witnesses of their marriage in China, Cai Chang and Deng Yingchao, confirmed the fact and we also found notes and letters written by Ho Chi Minh in her collection. However, brother Ho's celibacy has been a symbol of his dedication to the revolution. It might be embrassing to admit this marriage..."
viet.111.a:0 "Invite her to Indochina."
viet.111.b:0 "This should remain a secret, Brother Ho is only married to revolution."

viet.112.t:0 "The legend of Guangxi guerillas"
viet.112.d:0 "Our investigation of Brother Ho continues. There was a rumor in southern China that some ethnic minorities conducted a guerrilla warfare in Guangxi against local warlords in the late 1920s. Maybe it has some connections with comrade Ho Chi Minh."
viet.112.a:0 "Interesting."

viet.113.t:0 "The fate of Guangxi Guerillas"
viet.113.d:0 "We tried to find Ho Chi Minh's trace in Guangxi. It's clear that there was a guerrilla movement in Sino-Vietnamese in the late 1920s. However, it was finally suppressed by Guangxi warlord in 1932 and the leaders of the guerillas were arrested and executed. Many of the executed leaders, according to the locals, are Vietnamese. This seems to be the fate of comrade Ho Chi Minh. Should we conclude our search?"
viet.113.a:0 "Continue."
viet.113.b:0 "We already know the answer..."

viet.114.t:0 "More Evidences from Guangxi"
viet.114.d:0 "We continued our research in Guangxi and the result was out of our expectation. We discovered that some guerillas were arrested and imprisoned in Nanning due to lack of evidences. Later in 1933 they were released by Guangxi warlord under the pressure of Chinese progressives including Guangdong warlord Chen Jiongming. Among those released guerillas, one man named Hu Guang left his diary to a local intellectual who helped him during the prison time. We confirmed that the diary is actually written by Ho Chi Minh. It seems that comrade Ho managed to hid his identity and survived. The Prison Diary of Ho Chi Minh is now transfered to the Museum of Indochinese Revolution in Saigon."
viet.114.a:0 "Interesting."

viet.115.t:0 "The fate of Brother Ho"
viet.115.d:0 "We finally found a decisive evidence about Brother Ho's fate in the secret police documents of the Legation cities and now we are able to reconstruct the fate of Ho Chi Minh. After the crackdown in 1926, Ho continued to conduct guerrilla warfare in southern China. The guerrilla was suppressed by Guangxi warlords and Ho was arrested. However, the warlord didn't know who is him and released him. Comrade Ho decided to leave China for France but he was captured by the Legation city's police in Hongkong in 1933 and German secret polices figured out Ho's identity. Because Germans didn't want to repeat the mass demonstration after Phan Boi Chau's execution in 1925, Ho was secretly executed in Hongkong. This untold story will not be forgotten by Indochinese people henceforth."

Xuan Dieu is considered as perhaps the greatest romantic poet in modern Indochina. During the resistance, he became an ardent revolutionary writing to promote socialism and fighting against imperialists. However, his early works were known for their doleful and decadent style. Moreover, it's an open secret that Xuan Dieu is homosexual and wrote about 'Man's Love'. Some cultural officials urged caution against this appointment.

They argued that the Commune has done a lot to help the Indochinese people to win their independence, but the responsibility of France for her former colony does not conclude. We can and we should offer to the people there a special relation, as it passes through the present period of transition on its way to a new era - an era of pride and independence, and era of enlightenment and socialism - an era which, when contrasted with the bleak past of colonial oppression, will truly represent the ideal of socialist revolution."

#Manpower crisis
#The resistance and revolution should depend on the voluntary spirit of Indochinese people. That being said, the manpower crisis of our newly-born army is more and more severe. Introducing a draft will solve the problem, but it's worried that the new state apparatus doesn't have the ability to carry out conscription well...

#Enact conscription
#Mobilise urban population
#Focus on expanding village guerillas

#'Upgrade' system
#A new recruitment system called 'Upgrade' is being promoted all across Indochina. Under this system peasants are encouraged to be part-time and full-time militia or guerillas in their own village. After they have basic training and military experience, they will be encouraged to join regional forces, and later regular troops. Most recruits through this system are already adapted to military life when they join the regular army. This system will be able to offer a stable source of manpower for our army'
#This is how voluntary spirit works!


#Rising disertion rate
#Since the introduction of conscription, the army is suffering from demoralisation and high distion rate. Indochinese peasants in general are very reluctant to leave their homeland. In order to recruit more soldiers, the improvised recruitment committees have to used forceful methods. Many recruits are brought away from their home after a knock at the midnight. They complaint that they are very afraid being sent to remote places from their home with poor training and arms to fight the powerful enemy.
#We shouldn't push that hard!
#We need to enforce military discipline

The entire Indochinese economy relies on its agricultural production, heavily merchandised yet vulnarable. The agricultural production in general is very susceptible to climate variability, but certain decisions and changes introduced by our government or farmers themselves could also have an impact."

#Typhoon hits
#Mekong flooding
#Dike construction

#Nitrogen Fertiliser industry development
#The colonial regime never allowed investment on fertiliser and insecticides industry to make us dependent on them. Now we have built our first fertiliser factories. However, it might take some time to promote the use of chemical fertiliser among farmers.

#Production of Field Water Pump
#With the development of machine production industry, now we are able to produce field water pumping engines. The introduction of power pumps will greatly help the irrigation of rice field and improve the yield greatly.

#Study Rice cultivation methods from Japan
#Japan is the leading technology power in Asia and also the first country to apply modern science to rice cultivation. Studying rice cultivation methods from Japan will help our agricultural modernisation a lot.

#Ban Rice Alcohol production
#Producing rice alcohol is usually a good way consume rice surplus. However, in this year of poor harvest, it might be a better choice to temporarily ban rice alcohol production to save enough rice for food.

It's possible for us to expanded the capacity of distilleries produce alcohol for fuel purposes and butanol for aviation fuel. However, the project will be costly and consume a huge chunk of agricultural production."

#Reevaluate party's land policy
#Tan Viet party passed a new resolution. During the resistance era, the party decided that Indochina was still in the phase of bourgeoise democratic revolution and we must keep a united front with gentries and landlords. Now, with the independence of our motherland secured and party's leadership entrenched, it's time to start our land reform.

#The Plain of Reeds development program
#The Plain of Reeds is a sparsely populated alluvial swampy region lying astride the Siamese-Indochinese border. During the resistance war, it was a major base used by our guerillas. The Plain of Reeds has great agricultural production potential, but it will require some population resettlement and the construction of an extensive levee and drainage system to control flooding. The development of the Plain of Reeds will also deprive the are of its potential of being a guerrilla base. Should we start the development program?

ALA_REDMAN_national_populist_party_long:0 "American Indian Federation - §LFormed shortly before Elwood Towner’s pilgrimage to Alaska following the outbreak of the 2nd American Civil War, the AIF was created in the reservation halls and dive bars of the Pacific Northwest, starting a fringe group with seperatist ideas and a dream of a free state for Northwestern Amerindians. Sensing opportunity in the Last Frontier as the United States collapsed into war, Towner and the AIF fled north to further their goals. Meeting other fleeing natives from across the Lower 48, the AIF grew to encompass naties from coast to coast, influencing Towner’s Pan-Indigenous ideas further. Now at the apex of their political evolution, the AIF seeks to create a strong nationalist and militaristic state under Chief Towner, with a large emphasis being placed on native traditions from across the tribes, the supremacy of the Red Race, and on the military tradition of the First Peoples. Under the AIF, Berignia will meld ideas new and old to create a truly free state for the Red Man!§!"

His way offers an egalitarian, totalist utopia to all those of pure Red stock while offering nothing but a cold blade or searing lead to any White Devil foolish enough to stand in his way. Though ferocious and overzealous, the Young Warriors only seek to be the wings that carry the Red Race to its true and deserved destiny, and they will stop at nothing to achieve their great task.§!"

## Leader Bios ##
POLITICS_BOB_BARTLETT_DESC:0"Bob Bartlett was a University of Alaska graduate turned News Reporter until 1933, where he became the secretary of Alaskan politician Anthony Dimond. In 1934 and upwards, Bartlett served as a secretary and running-mate to Ernest Greuning. Together, both men focussed their political efforts on improving the state of Alaska’s people. Bartlett is characterized by his morals and constant servitude to Alaska, a land which he has no intention to let fall into the hands of anything but a strong, people-powered government"
POLITICS_BIRCH_DESC:0"Stephen Birch presided over Kennecott Copper, the Alaska based, largest copper production company in America. The Alaskan Syndicate member resigned as President of Kennecott in 1933, although he kept control of other mineral and transportation companies centered in Alaska. When Alaska declared independence from America, Birch and the rest of the Syndicate immediately jumped on ship with the Last Frontier, seeing their opportunity to control the frozen peaks and land. Reinstating himself as Kennecott Copper President, Birch remains on top of one of the richest and most powerful corporations in the world"
POLITICS_GUGGENHEIM_DESC:0"Simon Guggenheim of the Jewish descended Guggenheim Family is a rich Capitalist with with significant control over Alaska’s copper, salmon, and transportation industries. His Alaskan Syndicate, made to monopolize Alaskan resources and gain political power over its people, rivals Alaska’s own Legislation on terms of political pull. Upon Alaska’s break from America in 1937, Simon Guggenheim travelled to the frozen land to secure complete power over it in its unstable governmental state. Guggenheim’s plans are big, but so is the work needed to put them into action"
POLITICS_JAMES_WICKERSHAM_DESC:0"James Wickersham served as Alaskan District Judge in the years 1900 - 1908, where he ran for a spot as territorial representative to the US House of Reps, a position he held until 1933. Although technically a Republican, his personal war with the Alaskan Syndicate’s cruelly capitalistic business methods caused him to seek heavy Federal assistance for Alaska. Ultimately at the end of his terms, his pushes against the Syndicate were not assisted by the rest of the Legislation, and the situation had only gotten worse in time. Angered by the Legislations refusal to crack down on the Barons, Wickersham wants for Alaska a land where the people’s work cannot be tarnished by greedy businessmen and capitalists, but his left leaning supporters yearn for a more red set of ideals"
POLITICS_AUSTIN_DESC:0"“Alaska’s First Homegrown Millionaire” was a well known Industrialist from Seattle who, in 1895, transported goods to and from Alaska in the Klondike Gold Rush. The wealthy man owns a mining development company and numerous movie theaters, as well as a newspaper company. Opposing federal control of businesses, but fearful of Syndicate buying out, Lathrop heads the Alaska Corporate Party as a means of assisting his and other smaller scale business owners’ interests"
POLITICS_DIMOND_DESC:0"Anthony Dimond of New York came to Alaska in 1905 as a prospector. In his major Political years, he served as a US Commissioner, an Assistant Attorney, a Mayor, and a Senator, all based in Alaska. Dimond’s heavy portfolio shows him as a clear, intelligent man whose feats are only contested by his brutal anti-semetism. This trait has caused him to be at odds with the Jewish-descended Guggenheim’s, and Dimond holds a certain disdain for large and wealthy groups who attempt to lead average people"
POLITICS_SUTHERLAND_DESC:0"An Alaskan Representative to the US House of Reps from 1921 to 1931, “Fighting Dan’s” dog sled campaigning and aircraft rescuing career seemed to end after he moved to Pennsylvania. In 1937, the politician turned purchasing agent fled back to Alaska with the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, welcomed with open arms by fellow Republicans as the man who could fight to keep a conservative majority as the Last Frontier’s political climate went below zero"
POLITICS_ERNEST_GRUENING_DESC:0"Ernest Greuning, Harvard Graduate who served briefly in the Weltkrieg in field artillery, came to Alaska in 1934 as Director of the Division of Territories and Island Possessions under Herbert Hoover. Alaska’s desperate economical situation alongside America’s growing political tensions caused Greuning to stay in the Last Frontier. Upon the outbreak of the 2ACW in 1937, Greuning took the title of Alaskan President in place of Governor John Weir Troy with the goal of helping Alaska not only survive, but thrive in their intense physical and political climate"
POLITICS_LOVESTONE_DESC:0 "Jay Lovestone was born as Jacob Liebstein in Belarus. His father moved to America, and became attached to Socialist ideas, eventually joining the fledgeling American Communist Party. As Communism became overshadowed by Syndicalism, Lovestone refused to adapt, keeping true to his Communist ideas even has Communism collapsed. This gained him many enemies within the new Socialist Party of America, who he refused to support. As America broke out into Civil War, Lovestone begrudgingly supported the Combined Syndicates, however, was exiled once it was found out that he was feeding information about the government to MacArthur. With nowhere else to flee; Lovestone took a ship to the last place that would take him in, Alaska.  Now in Alaska, Lovestone has rallied other exiled to his side, and helped for the new neo-socialist ideas that were made famous in Alaska. Now in charge of Alaska, Lovestone will set out to reform the Last Frontier with new socialistic ideals. "
POLITICS_TOWNER_DESC:0 "Born in the late 1890's on the Siletz Reservation in Oregon, Elwood Towner has lived quite the interesting life. Stolen away from his people by the White Man and forced to attend the Chemawa Indian School, Towner developed a hate for his oppressors early on. Later serving in the United States Marine Corp and seeing action in Mexico and other minor American theatres of war, Towner came home a changed man. He would attend law school, focusing his study on native advocacy and would only take indigenous clients, eventually suing the boarding school that stole him from his people and forcing its closure. With this, Towner tasted victory over the White Man and he liked its flavor. He would further radicalize, being inspired by other ethnically-focused thinkers in Japan and the American South, and began forming his own ideas on how the Red Man should live moving forward. Now, with the rapid destabilization of the United States and the looming threat of civil war, Towner has seen all he needs to see to understand who the White Man truly is: savages, dogs, mongrels, or worse.  With these facts clear, Towner has marched to Alaska to set his plan in motion. Under Towner, the Red Man's days under the White boot are numbered."
POLITICS_RAND_DESC:0 "Alisa Rosenbaum had taken an interest in politics and philosophy from young age. An avid supporter of Alexander Kerensky. Rosenbaum became a mildly successful political writer before fleeing her native Russia after the turmoil of 1936. Traveling east to the land of opportunity, Rosenbaum renewed her career with Anthem until the Civil War brought it to a screeching halt. Stuck in the Last Frontier, Rosenbaum saw an opportunity to bring her ideas from paper to reality. Having now secured Alaska, only time will tell how successful her Objectivist experiment will fare..."

Thus, Franz Joseph II is planning on offering Austria a large lump sum for Vorarlberg.

Towner believes that only through the spilling of white blood can the Red Man truly be free. Under his watch, indigenous militant groups have begun springing up across Beringia who seek to cast off the yoke of the white man. Suburbs and whole city blocks to mountain passes and deep forests have all been turned into active guerilla warzones where the few Whites who are foolish enough to resist our new government hold out.

To facilitate this, Towner has opened our borders to all those of Red skin and blood in hopes that many will flee the tumult of the 2ACW to The Last Frontier.

Allowing the deal to go through could potentially lead to the Barons buying all of Alaska, while blocking the deal would enrage the Barons. Some have proposed a compromise, refunding the Barons money for land that was obtained illegally while letting the rest of the purchases go on unhindered. Others (Including a certain James Wickersham) want the deal to be stopped entirely, while some do not want to impede the Barons in any way. Wickersham has stated, that if any part of the deal were to go through, that he and his supporters would perform a general strike and march on Juneau to “Stop the oppression of workers by the Syndicate”.

Alaska.2.d:0"Any potential for working with the Legislation has been squandered by the gross overreach of power by President Gruening. As it has become clear that the government has no intention of working with us peacefully, we must take drastic measures to ensure that Alaska does not become a Syndicalist Dictatorship. Mercenaries have been dispatched to make the purchases go through; regardless of what the weak government says. We have to make it clear to the Legislation Lackeys: we own Alaska, not them."

Alaska.3.t:0"The March on Juneau"
Alaska.3.d:0"The Buyout going through has enraged Wickersham’s supporters; who see the deal going through as akin to the Barons buying the entirety of Alaska. And, as promised, workers enraged by the Barons unfair treatment have taken to the streets in a general strike, aided by Wickersham and his other allies. In a fiery speech held in Juneau, Wickersham denounced the Alaskan Syndicate and the Legislation, which he sees as being weak. In his closing remarks, he urged that a stronger hand is needed to deal with the Barons; and insinuated a Redder set of ideals. The Juneau police have taken to the streets to deal with the strike, and throughout the day the General strike grew more violent. Anarchy almost overtook the city, and some workers started actively clashing with both the police and the Territory guard. Some are even afraid that the General Strike could even dislodge the Legislation government; and with the growing violence they could very well be right."

Alaska.5.d:0"The power of the Legislation is now gone. Gruening’s Presidency is over, and the Barons are now on the path to completely control Alaska. The overstep by the Legislation was the nail in the coffin for our cooperation, and if they don’t want to respect us, we don’t see any reason why we should respect them. To save Alaska from Socialist Tyranny drastic measures must be taken, measures that will turn Alaska on its head. These actions were taken today as Mercenaries hired by the Syndicate marched on the Capital of Juneau and installed Simon Guggenheim as Provisional President. Small units of the Territory Guard showed up to defend the Capital, but they were beaten back by the Syndicate’s mercenary forces. By the end of the day, it was clear that the Barons were in control of Alaska, and that the Legislation was gone. Seeing the writing on the wall, the remaining units of the Territory Guard swore loyalty to the new Governor and the New Syndicate Government."

Alaska.6.t:0"Wickersham takes over"
Alaska.6.d:0"The Disgusting inaction by the Legislation has driven Wickersham and the Workers to radical action. The March on Juneau was a success and now Wickersham is in control. Even though Wickersham is in de facto control of Alaska, Birch, Guggenheim and the Barons have fled North and established a base in Anchorage. A Civil War in Alaska is imminent, and Wickersham has rallied Workers Militias to hunt down the Barons Leadership and secure Alaska."

Alaska.7.d:0"Today, Gruening and Wickersham both stood together and rallied in Juneau today. As the Barons continue to exercise their grip over Alaska, Gruening has made an unlikely ally with Wickersham as they both put aside their differences to take on the Alaskan Syndicate. This act of solidarity with the Socialists has enraged Guggenheim, who now is taking drastic actions to “Prevent Alaska from turning into a Socialist Dictatorship”. "
Alaska.7.a:0"The Mask comes off"

Alaska.8.t:0"The First Test"
Alaska.8.d:0"The Barons have fled North and established a provisional government in Anchorage. This comes in direct conflict with the new Socialist Government in Juneau. Syndicate funded Mercenary forces battle in the streets with Wickersham’s Workers Militias; and some fear that Alaska could fall to the Baron’s rule once again if they manage to capture Juneau. But the Mercenary forces could very well break and Anchorage could fall to Wickersham’s forces. Either one of these vital cities falling could spell a death wish for each side. "

Alaska.11.d:0"After a history of Ailing Health, James Wickersham; the guide of our Nation has passed away. With Wickersham gone, the path of our nation remains ever unclear; and with Wickersham gone a provisional council has been established in the absence of a leader. Within the temporary congress, Vanguard Communists and Bolsheviks argue with Moderate Socialists and Syndicalists over who will gain control over Alaska. A tense environment engulfs Alaska as even during Wickersham’s own funeral conflict was present. Each side politicized Wickersham’s death and each took turns talking through their teeth. Rex Beach has taken charge of Wickersham’s more moderate supporters and declared that they will be true to the late leader's ideals. While the more radical factions continue to denounce Wickersham’s ideas as “Too Moderate”. Regardless of who comes out on top, Alaska has an unclear path ahead."

Rex Beach has taken over the original base of support for Wickersham, while more hardcore Syndicalists gravitate to the Central Congress. However, the dark horse Jay Lovestone has gained large amounts of support within Alaska. His Red appeals to former communists and Exiles in Alaska have also made him quite the powerful opponent for anyone who wants leadership of Alaska."

If Canada was to assist Alaska, then Alaska must pledge loyalty to the King and the government in Ottawa; and became a Dominion with Lord George Pearkes at its head. Since we have little choice in the matter, we accepted. And with that, Canada sent some of it’s finest Generals to assist with the defense of Alaska.

The Tundra blows cold as one by one, his supporters are led out to the coast where they are lined up in a row, and one by one shot in the back of the head by a rifleman lined up behind them. Then, their limp bodies fall one by one into the ocean. As the last of his supporters are finished being executed, Wickersham sees his fate dead ahead. Yet, instead of lining up Wickersham in front of a firing squad, they simply blindfold him. Little does Wickersham know that he has just been led onto a sheet of ice jutting out into the Bering Sea. Confused, Wickersham simply stands baffled as he hears something being placed on to the ice some feet away. Little did he know what was going on. Then, just seconds later he heard a shout going “CLEAR THE AREA” ... and seconds later a deafening explosion knocked Wickersham down. As he gets to his feet again, he struggles to stay on balance; as he realizes he is on a moving surface. Little did he know that he was on a sheet of ice mindlessly floating into the Bering Strait."

Everything from oil wells to National Parks have been brought up by the Barons in the wake of Alaska’s succession from the Union. To many, this is akin to simply buying the entire State of Alaska, to some they see nothing wrong.

Hefty bets are placed on each side, and one the hour begins a crew of fishermen departs, and by the end of the 3-hour span the boats are recalled. The Judges decide a winner based on the amount of fish hauled in, and the length, width and weight of the fish.

Union Leaders, Fishermen, Canning Workers and even the Postmaster of Nome were all brought before the committee for questioning. They were asked standard questions such as “How Long have you been a resident of Alaska”, as well as “Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Socialist Party of America”, as well as questions such as “Are you receiving newspapers from the Commune of France or the Union of Britain”. Most of those who asked, responded now. And, after weeks of hearings inconclusive evidence was shown, and the committee was shut down.

The former Bolshevik ideals have blended with American Social-Patriotic ideals to form a uniquely Alaskan form of Socialism.

Just hours ago, RMA forces simultaneously cracked the enemy's fortified positions at both Juneau and Anchorage, ending Rosenbaum's control over Alaska in one final blow. With his rule established and the RMA cleaning up the last pockets of our oppressor's futile forces, Towner and the disparate First Peoples have finally carved out their own home. On this day we declare a new nation, a new home for the Red Man where we shall no longer be the White Man's burden, and we shall name it after the great sunken land that brought the ancestors of all Native Americans here: Beringia!"

Alaska.44.d:0"Elwood Towner and the American Indian Federation have been making great strides in building Beringia up to be a nation any Amerindian would be proud to call home. Infrastructure has been relocated and rebuilt to pay respect to sacred lands, agriculture and housing has been expanded to accommodate the growing population, and certain more gray avenues have been taken to ensure a healthy stock of fresh Native blood continues to flow into Beringia. Towner has outlawed birth control to artificially increases birthrates while offering government incentives for Native-blood families that have large broods. It has even been whispered that behind closed doors non-Reds have been forcibly sterilized or worse. But it is nothing to fear, for if you are of ample Red blood no harm will come of you. As the months go by and more Native Americans flee to our lands from their oppressors and more new souls are ushered into our families, Beringia may nearly be entirely Native by blood within a few years."

Across the Bering Strait, our namesake and link to the Old World, comes thousands of refugees. However, unlike before these weary faces coming to our lands are no Native Americans or fleeing whites, but Siberians. Not just Siberians, but Altaics and Buryats and Mongols and many other diverse tribal groups. They say they have heard of the majestic land of Beringia and have sought to come to our beautiful shores to start a new life; a better life free from persecution and ridicule from the groups that oppress them. These people are the sons and daughters of our oldest ancestor and must be welcomed in with open arms and open doors as honorary Red Skins.

To do this, Towner's agents will infiltrate Longist, Syndicalist, and other separatist groups across the 'Lower 48' and Canada, sowing discord and pushing heavily for pro-Native American legislation. While his operatives work to further these goals and distract his foes away from our new state, Towner himself has larger plans for Beringia as a whole..."

Alaska.47.t:0"The Question of Religion"
Alaska.47.d:0"As our population grows and our people feel more at home here, a sense of something missing has begun to emerge: spirituality. With the mass exodus of Native peoples leaving their old sacred lands, many spiritual connections have been severed. To alleviate this, some in our cabinet have proposed that we instate a state religion for the great nation of Beringia. Though as with everything in politics, a debate has formed around which specific religion to champion. The more conservative old guard of our group seeks to simply create a new syncretic Native American spiritual religion heavily steeped in the old customs, incorporating facets from all tribes and peoples to form one spiritual culture we can all follow. In deep contrast to this, many more liberal minded compatriots have expressed their desire to make a far more secular strain that would be modernized and liberalized, shedding many practices they deem to be "outdated." Finally, an initially fringe movement has been picking up great steam in recent months, partially due to Chief 'Red Cloud' Towner's proselytizing of red nationalism, known as the Beringian Grey Wolves. They seem to get their inspiration from various dubious strains of pan-Turanism and believe all Native Americans to be Altaic-Turanic by descent. The religion they seek to bring to Beringia can be described as a mixture of syncretic native spiritualism mixed with element of Tengriism and Islam. Though initially scoffed at and tossed away as a joke, the movement has seen a massive growth in popular support. Once again, it is up to Chief Red Cloud to decide the future of our people."

Tirelessly behind closed doors and in smoke-filled rooms, Towner has toiled with his agents to create the necessary "Living Space" our people so require. When all seemed hopeless after weeks with no word from any of his operatives, the phone in Tower's offices rang. "Our agents have done it!" yelled the Tlingit commando from the speaker. Somehow, against all odds, the operatives under AIF's command that were sent into Canada's northern territories have just radioed back telling us of their success. From the largest settlement of Yukon, a small but growing town called Whitehorse, friendly forces have confirmed that all information flowing in and out of the frozen north is at their fingertips; every letter, radio signal, telegraph, and whisper first goes through the eyes and ears of our contacts and associates. With this level of control, the idiots in Ottawa have no idea they have lost de-facto control over their northernmost reaches. Now that we control the information, we move to control the land itself. As of now, settlement to our new lands is fully open to all Beringian citizens of Red birth and all true frontiersmen will be generously compensated for their trouble and bravery. We have come so far, our future is all but assured."

Alaska.49.d:0"While the establishment of a new religion and the seizure of more 'living space' has been a boon to our people, something is still missing. Yes, we have created new holy sites and sacred lands for generations to enjoy, but the old lands we abandoned or that were stolen from us still scar the hearts and minds of the people. To this end, Chief Red Cloud and his associates in the AIF have created the "Red Man's Company," a new venture with which old sacred lands will be bought from the crumbling, bickering factions of the 2nd American Civil War as they grow ever more hungry for capital to fuel there seemingly endless struggle. The first of these old sacred lands to be bought back will be none other than the infamous Black Hills of South Dakota. Famously stolen from our Lakhota and Dakhota brethren at the hands of the United States, this sacred and beautiful mountain range will serve as the perfect monument to the end of Native American subjugation. A new era rises, and this one will not be steered by the White Man."

Alaska.50.t:0"Red Men in the Capital"
Alaska.50.d:0"Our foreign diplomatic office in Tokyo has received a strange visit from a peculiar looking group of men from across the Pacific. Adorned with feathers, beads, and luxurious animal-skin robes and carrying an ornately carved and decorated peace pipe, the diplomats say they come from the great state of Beringia: a newly created Native-American ethnostate carved out in what used to be Alaska by a one Chief Elwood "Red Cloud" Towner. Though normally such diplomatic gestures from small, barely recognized states would be ignored, Beringia's location on the North American mainland puts it in an quite desirable and strategic location for future Pacific endeavors. Of course recognizing such an odd nation on old United States soil could prove to be a diplomatic headache down the line, the opportunity must at least be thought on thoroughly. So, how shall we respond to Mr. "Red Cloud." and his diplomats?"

Today, the Red Man decides who is the savage and who is the civilized being! No longer shall we be the burden of a race of fools who can't even stop slaughtering each other over petty differences and childish squabbles. The era of the White Man is over. Now it will be the Red Man's Burden to civilize these backwards savages and show them the truth that has always rung soundly: the First Peoples' are the greatest of Man's races and none will stand in our way!"

Though no one ever knows for sure what lies ahead, every once in awhile a visionary comes forward; a rare person with a near-clairvoyant sight who will take the reigns of their compatriots destiny and blaze a path into the beyond. By pure luck or possibly divine intervention, our fledgling of nation has been graced with one such visionary: none other than Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum, or as she is more commonly known by her pen name, Ayn Rand. Fate could not have delivered her to us at a better time, arriving on our fair shores from her native Russia escaping some turmoil or another. Rosenbaum has become quite popular in many circles for her rather interesting ideas on economics and society. With her influence growing more and more by the day, the victorious Corporate party has petitioned the Alaskan congress to grant Rosenbaum emergency powers in order to rapidly and efficiently build up Alaska's newly independent economy. With our handily won seats in the recent elections, congress is all but guaranteed to accept our request, and Rosenbaum will be quickly sworn in as acting Governor of Alaska where she will assuredly execute her multitude of objectives that seek to revolutionize The Last Frontier."

Alaska.53.d:0"What started out as a luminous vision into a utopian future has now revealed itself for the dark and perverse cancer that it is. Our "always objective" Governor Rosenbaum's brilliant plan has failed miserably and our beautiful frontier suffers more for it by the minute. Her economic reforms have all but bankrupted nearly every poor soul in the state, her views on religion have only angered the myriad of Abrahamic and Native believers, and her policy of buying or directly seizing reservation lands for the creation of private enterprise has infuriated the recently enlarged Native American population that still continues to rise due to the fires of the 2ACW. Rosenbaum's popularity is at an all time low and Alaskans from every corner of life and creed have had it with her so-called "vision of a brighter tomorrow." Strangely, a unifying figure in the ire against Rosenbaum has been none other than Elwood Towner, infamous leader of the American Indian Federation and militant commander. Adopting the Jainist symbol of divinity and merging it with the common Native American spiritual motif of the 'medicine wheel', Towner has created a new banner behind which this anti-Rosenbaum anger can foment. With his 'Red Man's Army' at his command, Towner has begun a series of highly successful guerilla campaigns aimed at ousting the current government for one that truly listens to hearbeat of the one First People. The Alaskan armed forces are too weak from the early skirmishes with both syndicate mercenaries and syndicalist militias in the fight to preserve Alaskan democracy to stop such viscous attacks and we fear Rosenbaum's days are numbered..."

Alaska.54.d:0"With the savage 2nd American Civil War erupting in the 'Lower 48', waves upon waves of refugees are coming to our borders. This was to be expected given the horrifying nature of civil war but curiously most of the refugees fleeing north seem to be Native Americans from various tribes across the United States, almost as if someone where guiding this mass immigration of First Peoples to our lands. Some murmurs have also informed us that semi-infamous Amerindian militant groups have come in as well, using the large numbers of other natives as cover; among them being the notorious AIF currently led by Elwood Towner, or as he now goes by "Chief Red Cloud" after the famous Oglala Lakhota warchief. Despite the possible issues some rowdy redskins may cause, most of our government does not seem to care about this influx of Native Americans, and business will likely go on as usual."

Like the Battle of Little Bighorn or St. Clair's Defeat, we have achieved a crushing victory over our former oppressors. The 'True North' is now entirely in Red hands thanks to Chief [Root.GetLeader] and his loyal braves. With this conquest the dreams of heroes like Tecumseh and Sitting Bull are made manifest: the Red Man has its own sovereign, strong state. Now comes the aftermath of such a monumental land acquisition. To facilitate our civilizing mission for these savages, it is now the White Man's turn to live caged and severed on the reservations. Major cites like Ottawa and Toronto will be turned into White Man reservations while all current Native reservations will become tribal authorities and be allowed to spread across the Canadian wilderness as they see fit to establish their roots. To further divide the perfidious snakes we will work with local separatist movements, particularly in Quebec and Acadia, by granting them large amounts of autonomy in exchange for their help in crushing these Anglo-Saxon beasts. If any White Man gets too rowdy in their new pens, there are always other options as well... No matter the resistance, Towner and the People will overcome it just as they did before. This is the Red Man's Burden and, under the brilliant guidance Chief Red Cloud, Beringia will march forward proudly into its new destiny."

Alaska.58.d:0"It seems that Canada is not the only prized lands we have been able to reclaim from the White Man in our recent victories: New England too is now in the possession of its rightful and original owners. This newest addition to our nation lies within the heart of the lands originally stolen and made perverse by the White Man's desolating and vile touch. Hundreds of years ago, they came in white-capped boats and landed all along the eastern shores of our great continent: an action we have never truly been able to vindicate until this day. Now that one of the centers of their initial infestation is in the People's hands once more, we shall make it pure and "native" again in a process Chief [Root.GetLeader] and the AIF have dubbed "Nativeization." Under this new ordnance, we shall cleanse these lands of the White Man's dark taint. Lands will be renamed back to their mother tongues, Red Man's reservations will be dissolved as the land is returned to its rightful peoples, and the White New Englanders will now know what it means to live in a cage. We will return these lands to their once-beautiful and pure state, and once more prove our superiority over the White Man."

Alaska.59.d:0"We have done it! The Red Man stands triumphant once and for all, crushing the White dogs under our boots. With our true enemies defeated and peace returning to our lands once more, we must now begin to finalize the structure of our new, massively enlarged nation. Two main camps have formed in the AIF and its sister organizations on what the direction of our new indigenous state should be. The first camp are the standard nationalists, chiefly comprised of Towner loyalists, AIF militants, and other reactionary groups. This camp seeks to centralize power around Chief Towner, keeping the current system of elected chiefs, and steering the nation in a more modern, unitary direction. Their opponents in the conference are the so-called "Traditionalists" who not only seek to do away with the elected chief system in favor of inheritance over hereditary lines, but also want to elevate Chief Towner to a status equivalent to that of the European monarchs of old who ordered the destruction of our lands. This would create, in essence, a Traditionalist confederated "monarchy" under Chief 'Red Cloud' Towner that would, in theory, act as a perfect synthesis of both new and old indigenous culture and create a truly unique state in the world for the First Peoples of North America. The final choice would be argued for days but ultimately the choice lies with Chief Towner."

Indigenous citizens in the area haven't been able to truly live and cherish these grounds in centuries, and the ramifications of its return to their hands have proved wonderous for the People. Some Red blooded youth have even taken to bold demonstrations of First Peoples Pride, seen in their heroic desecration of the landmarks erected in White Man's egotistical image. Most attention grabbing of these acts have been the widespread destruction of statues and monuments of European explorers and Founding Fathers to the United States, causing widespread panic for the few remaining White civilians still allowed off their new reservations while those on the reservations are reported to be in an uproar. To alleviate these tensions, Chief [Root.GetLeader] has issued a proclamation encouraging these Red blooded displays of national and tribal pride, and has state any White Man caught publicly criticizing these patriotic acts are open to receive the Red Man's retribution..."

While the main men behind the large-scale land purchase have been the Resource Barons, a strange offer has come to the Alaskan government from the Prince of Liechtenstein. This offer based off of an old offer made by the Price of Liechtenstein during the sale of Alaska by Russia would involve the Principality of Liechtenstein purchasing Alaska for no small price and would in exchange provide funds for investments and allow the Resource Barons govern Alaska without hindrance. While the plan has little to no popular support, the House of Liechtenstein has very deep pockets, and the Resource Barons would gladly sell out Alaska for a high enough price. "

While the Alaskan Territorial Force, the Entene and the Austrian Empire have all been placed in charge of Alaskan Defense.

Alaska.115.t:0 "Jewish Immigration to Alaska"
Alaska.115.d:0 "Following the establishment of the Matanuska Valley Colony, our government has begun the second and most important step: the finding of colonists to live within the colony. With America burning, the most obvious source for colonists is effectively cut off. While some within the endless stream of refugees have the skills and mental fortitude required for the harsh life of a farmer in the Last Frontier, they are few and far between. With plans for similar colonies already being drafted, a stronger and more permanent source of potential colonists is needed, and who is a better source of those virtues than the Jewish people? Suffering oppression and scapegoating seemingly since time immemorial, the Chosen People are just the kind of people we need in Alaska. To this end, a series of international ads and promises of land, freedom, and hope have been undertaken by our government. Taking inspiration from Reinhard Heydrich's own courting of the Jewish people, we are already seeing a massive spike in immigration of Jews, and with word of the horrors being undertaken by Heydrich's regime, the Jewish people are seemingly all to happy to go to a land that will truly grant them freedom."

This immigration has been supported by the wealthy Resource Barons of Alaska, notable the Guggenheim Family which are themselves Jews. This immigration also has no shortage of opponents, notably the influential and virulently anti-Semitic Territorial Delegate Anthony Dimond, who wishes to halt the wide-scale Jewish Immigration to Alaska. Alaska has a notable lack of population, even with the large scale flood of refugees fleeing from the war, and organizing immigration will surely help remedy, will we support Jewish Immigration?"

Alaska.117.d:0 "It has been nearly a year since we first began inviting and enticing the Jewish people en masse to live and work in the admittedly harsh but truly free reaches of the Last Frontier. In that time, our population has nearly doubled due to the amount of refuges that have flooded Alaska, chief among them the Sons of Abraham. With this in mind, a newly formed advocacy group, calling themselves the Freeland League for Jewish Territorial Colonization and led by one Isaac Steinberg, has formally petitioned our government to reorganize Alaska into an official Homeland for the Jewish people. While a seemingly insane idea, as the Jewish population, while large, is still a minority within Alaskan society, there could be some merit to the idea of turning Alaska into a New Zion. For one, we would be sung as heroes to the oppressed peoples of the world, and a reputation like that could get us far. However, doing this would undoubtedly cause anger in the non-Jewish majority of our nation. Regardless, we cannot leave Steinberg unanswered forever, thus we shall..."

Alaska.118.d:0 "Long neglected and ignored by the mainland Americans since its acquisition in 1867, the great colony of Alaska long hoped for the stewardship of a more interested party to grace their shores. This wish came true with the arrival of the Liechtenstein royal family, headed by the noble Prince Franz Joseph II. Under their guidance, along with ample financial and administrative assistance from the Austrian Empire, the Principality of Liechtenstein-Alaska has rapidly blossomed into a productive, profitable colony. This near-miraculous success can be partly attributed to the shrewd, attentive overseeing done by the joint Liechtensteiner-Austrian delegation, but, admittedly, Alaska’s reportedly ‘massive’ profit margin could only be so large for a nation as small as their new suzerains. Regardless, the Alaska colony’s continued success has only emboldened the Liechtensteiners into dreaming of even more lofty aspirations. \n\nTheir latest bid to sate their ambitions has been to ask our great state to give up the far-off border region of Vorarlberg, selling this small region to the Liechtenstein government so as to allow their great nation to further grow, advance, and modernize, and arguing that a stronger Liechtenstein would prove to be a better ally to the Austrian people. Critics of this idea have been quick to call out the fact that even a region as small as Vorarlberg is still nearly four times the size of the current crownlands in Europe, not counting the massive expanse that is their colony in the Alaskan Frontier, with many times the population and speaking a different dialect. Despite these concerns, the ruling family has pressed on with their claim, with the final decision now falling in the lap of our administration. So, shall we allow the Liechtenstein to buy Vorarlberg off us, or shall we leave them to their mountainous hold around Vaduz and to the icy wastes of the Last Frontier?"

With this attempt to expand thwarted, we will have to be satisfied with our previous acquisitions in Alaska. To compensate for this loss, we must pour all spare resources into the colony, for it is now our only means of true economic prosperity free from Austrian domineering. In time, as more Liechtensteiners move for the Last Frontier and away from the grasp of Vienna, the European homeland will be less important as our people settle their roots in the New World, so who needs Vorarlberg anyway?"

The Austrian administration had accepted his bid to purchase the border-region of Vorarlberg; a plot of land nearly four times larger than Liechtenstein’s mainland, and with nearly triple the population, even when counting the citizens of the Alaskan colony. Though integrating this new territory will take much time and effort, the economic potential it could hold for the tiny microstate is near-limitless, and the Liechtensteiner government has immediately put plans to motion to transform this tiny mountainous province into a new industrial heartland for the growing Liechtenstein Empire. Counting themselves incredibly lucky in their colonial ambitions once again, Liechtensteiners have been able to acquire more land in a few short months than they have ever controlled in their history, increasing the land the control by more than a hundredfold, and now only time will tell if they can keep it together..."

Alaska.121.d:0 "With their common interests in Pan-Turanic thought, militarism, and theology pulling them together, as well as their shared disdain for the White Man, İsmail Enver and Chief Elwood ‘Red Cloud’ Towner have grown to be close compatriots. With Enver’s aid, Chief Towner has been able to apply Grey Wolf tactics and strategies to the doctrine utilized by our own Braves, increasing their potency in battle greatly. Enver has helped our Chief and the various holy men of our confederation craft our new, united, and syncretic religion to better bind together our varied peoples while still preserving the unique facets and beliefs of each tribe and their ideas. Enver has come to meet Chief Towner’s closest associates, and even the Chief's own and little-discussed family in the comfort of Towner’s massive home compound. However, despite all this comradery and kinship, Chief Towner never truly dropped his guard around this erratic and ambitious foreigner. Instead, he has drawn Enver in closer than even Towner’s right-hand man Chief ‘New Moon’ Dixon, watching and recording the disgraced and exiled Pasha’s every move, waiting for the sly insect to slip up and reveal his true intentions. \n\nChief Towner would soon receive his wish however, for agents working undercover for the Chief within the Pasha’s inner-circle recently recovered plans drafted and whispered about within Enver’s Grey Wolves. Bringing this to Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner’s attention immediately, they uncovered a treacherous plot - Enver plans to assassinate Towner and seize Beringia for himself to use as a new base for the Pan-Turanic dream. A dastardly and cowardly plot to say the least, for this so-called Pasha does not even have the balls to fight our Chief in traditional, man to man combat. Well, Towner will rectify this mistake soon enough..."

Alaska.122.t:0 "Putting Down the Great Grey Wolf"
Alaska.122.d:0 "Torrential rain and cracking thunder filled the wilds where Chief Towner had his men drag the bound and gagged İsmail Enver. Pulling the writhing Turk into the center of a flat, muddy field rounded by steep hills, the blindfold and bindings were roughly ripped and torn from Enver’s body, revealing to him the hell he now found himself in. His old ally and close friend Elwood Towner had discovered his assassination plot, and now had dragged him hundreds of miles into the Beringian wilderness to challenge him to a fight to the death. \n\nWith Enver now unbound, Chief Towner walked up to the kneeling Pasha and tossed him his traditional officer’s sabre - an heirloom from his service in the Ottoman Empire - and Enver’s sidearm with 3 rounds in the chamber. Towner himself stood armed with his bow, 3 arrows in the quiver, and his ornately carved peace pipe - a mostly ceremonial pipe-tomahawk that Towner now wielded entirely in irony, for he intended to slaughter his old friend with the pipe they once smoke opium and tobacco through with each other while debating theology or military strategy. \n\nDemanding that the exiled Pasha rise, Towner prepared himself for the coming bloodbath, and as the both men finally stood prepared, the watching holy men gave the signal for the bout to begin. Immediately pulling out his service revolver, Enver fired two of his three rounds, missing both as Towner rolled behind a downed log, firing back his own salvo of arrows. As the two arrows flew, Enver tried to roll in return, but was clipped by the second arrow in the left shoulder, sending blood streaking from his bare flesh. As Enver broke the main shaft of the arrow, leaving only the head and a small enough piece of shaft behind to block the wound, Towner closed the distance and began hacking at Enver with his peace pipe. Though Enver deftly deflected the first few blows with his blade, Towner’s rampage was far too savage and powerful to be fully countered. Catching Enver with the edge of his blade as the Turk spun to deflect a blow, Towner cleaved two deep cuts into the Pasha’s back and arm. As he recoiled in agony, Enver spun around to fire his last round, striking the Chief in his right thigh. Towner grimaced but soldiered on, stepping back to loose his final arrow as Enver scrambled for higher ground behind him, all the while the storm still raged. Flying true despite the winds and torrents, Towner’s final arrow hit Enver square in the back, piercing his right lung in the process and sending the Turk tumbling back into the mud. \n\nWalking up to the now struggling Enver, Towner was overwhelmed with pity and sorrow at the sight of his dying, pathetic, and traitorous old friend. ‘You were my brother, Enver!’ Towner exclaimed as he cleaved his tomahawk into the front hairline of Enver, splitting a 7-inch wide gash across the Turk’s battered and beaten face. With blood pouring from his multiple arrow and axe wounds, Chief Towner crouched down to the dying Pasha, who now lay in a pool of his own blood mixed with the mud, breathing raggedly as Towner’s third arrow continued to eviscerate the insides of his chest cavity. Speaking a prayer over Enver’s dying figure, Towner slit his throat before Enver could utter his final goodbyes - a last moment of mercy - before then shifting around the corpse to begin scalping his prized quarry. With his death, Towner’s Braves would have to mop up the rest of the Grey Wolves left in Beringia, but with their leader now dead, this wouldn’t be too much of an issue, and now Beringia’s internal security is well and truly safe."

### Parties ###
CSA_totalist_party:0 "Centralist Faction"
CSA_totalist_party_long:0 "Centralist Faction - §LThe Centralist Faction is a loose grouping of organizations that support more Vanguardist, Totalist and/or other Centralist ideas regarding the revolution. Oftentimes, they have a tendency towards non-democratic thought. Despite being lumped together, however, they often stand in opposition to one another and are split between William Z. Foster's Collectivists on the ultra-left, James Burnham's American Worker's party on the right, and Browder's Centralists in the center.§!"
CSA_syndicalist_party:0 "Unionist Faction"
CSA_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Unionist Faction - §LThe Unionist Faction is dominated by the IWW and traditional syndicalism which desires a government based around trade unions, with internal differences being largely based around centralization. Some wish for a comparitively centralized system, which they call "State Syndicalism". Meanwhile, those calling themselves "Orthodox Syndicalists" adopt a more mainstream approach for the ideology, and they advocate for labor unions to become the main forces in our economy. There are also those who want support "Decentralized Planning", a plan which would build on mainstream syndicalism and also see the creation of communes in cities and counties, generally having a utopian vision for the country. For now, these factions are united by famous union leader "Big Bill" Haywood, whose time in the Russian Civil War changed him and convinced him of the potential need for a revolution here as well. There are others who contend for leadership in the syndicalist faction as well. In the Centralist wing, there is legendary figure Jack Reed, who has garnered much support for the faction. There is also his disciple, James P. Cannon, the hero Arturo Giovannitti, West Coast socialist Harry Bridges, and writer Elmer Allison. In the Orthodox wing, there is fiery orator Frank T. Johns, rising star and "Rebel Girl" Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and journalist Robert "Fighting Bob" Minor. For the "Decentralized Planning" advocates, the Anarchists, there is famous writer Emma Goldman, Catholic-socialist Dorothy Day, and Russian-born Modest Stein.§!"
CSA_radical_socialist_party:0 "Nationalist Faction"
CSA_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Nationalist Faction - §LThe Nationalist Faction is largely made up of intellectuals supporting American Bellaymist ideas, which derive from the writings of the late Edward Bellamy and the earlier Nationalist Movement. Supporting a socialist, nationally planned economy and guild democracy, these utopian socialists are the most middle-class of the CSA's supporters and are largely based around the American Independence League, Nationalist Clubs, and Knights of Labor groups. These factions organize a small number of unions and, more-so, various social organizations to promote their utopian future where the population universally works towards the greater good and all are provided for. They are currently in the Social Patriot faction of Congress alongside the AFL, and help provide managerial, bureaucratic, social, and intellectual support to the CSA.§!"
CSA_social_democrat_party:0 "Federalist Faction"
CSA_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Federalist Faction - §LThe Federalists are the least radical of the various organizations within the CSA, with their critics claiming they are only aligned with the CSA due to common enemies, government crackdowns and a desire to see a union dominated America. Lead by the AFL, the Federalists support higher worker pay, greater benefits for crafts unions, union power more generally, and most importantly, an American economy recreated in their vision, which they view as representative of the worker. Their more moderate beliefs have made them popular with more conservative elements of the country, but there is no mistaking their intentions: they wish to transform America forever.§!"
CSA_social_liberal_party:0 "Progressive Party"
CSA_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Progressive Party - §LThe Progressives were seen as radicals by some in recent times, but in the CSA, they are moderates. Those who still adhere to the party and its beliefs wish to see some economic rights for workers and farmers, but they stop short of even the modest Federalist reforms that have been proposed. Their most ambitious economic plan is for a "Social Security" policy in which suffering elders won't have to be a burden on their children. The party has also contrasted itself with the Federalists by focusing more on inclusive social policies, hoping for racial integration and female inclusion in the workplace eventually. Their economic moderation and social policies appear to be what they think will win them support, at the expense of leftist parties.§!"
CSA_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
CSA_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party - §LThe Republican Party, once dominant in the Red Belt, has now been relegated to relative obscurity. However, there are still those who identify themselves as Republicans. Those supporters who live in the cities are typically upper-class or otherwise well-to-do, and advocate laissez-faire economics with some liberal social policies.§!"
CSA_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
CSA_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - §LThe Democratic Party, once dominant in the Red Belt, has now been relegated to relative obscurity. However, there are still those who identify themselves as Democrats. Those supporters who live in the countryside are generally more socially conservative, sometimes supporting policies aimed at attacking the wealthy or regulating the economy. Usually though, they are more focused on keeping traditional beliefs and attitudes. These beliefs are likely to be unpopular with the rest of the CSA, but their adherence to them is stubborn, and only time will reveal their fate.§!"
CSA_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
CSA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - §LHuey Long and his AFP have their supporters in our territory, and the populist message they advocate is especially popular with our farmers. However, it is unlikely that this faction will come to power in our government, though perhaps they could help us to negotiate with Long.§!"
CSA_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Federal Loyalists"
CSA_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Federal Loyalists - §LThere are many in the CSA who secretly harbor Federal sympathies, not for the Federalist Party, but for MacArthur and his military junta. These dissidents will likely cause trouble, and all should be done to root them out, or more constructively, persuade them to join the Revolution.§!"
CSA_national_populist_party:0 "The Black Legion"
CSA_national_populist_party_long:0 "The Black Legion - §LA powerful wing of the NDWL's "Old Klan" based out of the Midwest and Northern Urban regions, The Black Legion is infamously violent even by Klan standards, breaking away from the main organization due to viewing it as not willing to go far enough. Supporting radical white and protestant supremacy, the Legion spreads terror within the CSA whenever they can.§!"

POLITICS_CSA_CENTRAL_COMITTEE_DESC:0 "The victory of the working class is the collective victory of all true Americans. The American people of old still coalesce around the Central Committee as did the founders around the Constitutional Convention, though our goals be more noble. Here the liberators of socialism debate the future of our nation, and factions that John Reed united now form under their own visions of the future."
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_FLYNN_DESC:0 "At a dusty underground socialist club in Harlem, Elizabeth Flynn's life as an advocate began. An early organizer for the IWW in New Jersey, Flynn felt the blunt of the political wrath against forming trade unions, and was arrested ten times. Flynn helped found the ACLU, which organized legal defence for strikers in the days before the International Labor Defence. In the leadup to the civil war, Flynn helped organize the Longshoremen strike of the West Coast. Flynn's wartime speeches to the Central Committee to encourage conscription made her stand out to the numerous conscientious objectors in the Committee. Ultimately Flynn was elected to lead America as a shocking dark horse candidate. Some thought it absurd that a woman would stand at the forefront of the revolution, but the rebel girl herself had been at the spearhead all along, fighting since the founding of the IWW and now ready to build up a socialist America of her dreams."
POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "Norman Thomas has seen the highs and lows of social stature, and has remained dedicated to socialism the entire way through. From a newspaper boy to Princeton magna cum laude to conscientious objector, he has seen much and more of the world, but his time as a minister was perhaps the most important. By then an advocate of christian socialism, he decided to run for office. Prior to the Civil War, he had served as New York City's Mayor, and then as the vice-presidential candidate of Jack Reed. Inspired by the writings of Edward Bellamy, Thomas pivoted his pacifism during the war into advocacy for socialists living in the Federal lands to resist conscription and even create utopian societies for themselves. After the war, he used the experience he gained and his close friendship to Jack Reed to catapult him to prominence in the country. Preaching on behalf of the Nationalists, he lead the democratic socialists to victory in the constitutional convention. With a heart of gold and unshakable morals, Norman Thomas has ascended to the presidency."
POLITICS_EARL_BROWDER_DESC:0 "Born in Kansas, in the year of 1891, Browder became a committed socialist age 16. His adherence to the socialist party of America was unshakable, and through an early friendship with William Z Foster, he became a syndicalist. As the years passed, the two men began to drift apart. While Foster favored an authoritarian form of syndicalism, Browder began to see more and more limits with the movement. The American revolution has according to him, proven that the same beliefs and strategies used in Europe cannot be applied to America. His new economic policy has been built with inspiration from Bolshevism, reinterpretations of Maximism, and plenty of original thought. Browder also intends to end the persistent trend of industrial unionism in Congress, and to pursue lecherous religious elements within the socialist state. Browder has never abandoned the socialist party of America, but with his new authoritarian position he intends to ensure that the party will never abandon him."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_FOSTER_DESC:0 "A radical labor organizer who spearheaded the syndicalist movement in America, William Z Foster has practically become a legend on the American left. His leadership in the strikes of the early 20th century and his commitment that the Socialist Party of America adapt Syndicalist policies has cemented him as one of its chief ideologies. His famous manifesto, "Toward Syndicalist America" has served as the guidebook for every aspiring Totalist in the country, containing Foster's culminated ideals for how to rebuild the nation of America into what it is today. With the recent victories of the Vanguard movement of the Combined Syndicates, Foster was uplifted to lead the new nation. Several of Foster's older, more socially ambitious ideas now come to the fore. This includes plans to reform the socialist human being as a whole, and to re-orient American morals towards the vanguard of socialism."
POLITICS_JAMES_CANNON_DESC:0 "Personally mentored by Big Bill Haywood and well versed in the struggles of the American left, James Cannon became an unshakable presence within the socialist party of America. Although initially a fanatic adherent to Bolshevism, the failure of the Russian revolution contrasted with the triumph of the French syndicalists made Cannon adopt a more libertarian view on socialism. As a formal representative of the SPA, he spent much time abroad in France and Britain, before returning to America after the outbreak of the civil war. Helping to organize foreign volunteers and the Internationale's advisers, he cemented his reliability as a brilliant administrator. With the war won, Cannon would immediately start to build the momentum needed to run for president, and has now finally fulfilled his ambition!"
POLITICS_CARLO_TRESCA_DESC:0 "Born to an impoverished family in Italy, Tresca's emigration to America became the first major step in a tumultuous life which saw him soon emerge as Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America. Having built up a famed reputation as an anarchist, a strike organizer and a community leader among Italian immigrants, Tresca became an integral figure within the IWW. His oratory and legal skills were put to use defending men such as Sacco and Vanzetti, as well as stopping the infiltration and manipulation of trade unions by the Italian Mafia. He spent much time vocally supporting the revolution in his homeland Italy, defending the merits, accomplishments and potentials of the Italian Socialist Republic to his fellow Italian-Americans. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Carlo Tresca played a key role in the takeover and new administration of New York City, he survived multiple assassination attempts and scores of protests against his campaign for being an Italian immigrant. His prior accomplishments within the Italian Socialist Federation and the IWW has now allowed Carlo Tresca to launch a successful campaign to become President."
POLITICS_ARTURO_GIOVANNITTI_DESC:0 "Born in Abruzzi Italy, Arturo was one of the hundreds of thousands who came to the United states seeking opportunity. Arturo instead found a ripe political climate for expanding workers’ rights. Arturo was there during the 1912 Textile Strike of Lawrence, Massachusetts, where his illegal arrest and subsequent trial in a metal cage became a rallying point for the New England IWW. Arturo was acquitted of all charges, and became a socialist activist, first opposing the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, then the US's entry into the war. During the revolution, Arturo led an Italian American brigade out of New England and into the CSA territory under hostile fire. A talent for speaking and poetry elevated his campaign. Ultimately he was elected President as a true citizen."
POLITICS_MEYER_LONDON_DESC:0 "Born in Tsarist Lithuania under the grip of Russian influence. Meyer's first ambition was to become a Talmudic scholar like his father. The adverse conditions of Russia forced Meyer's family to relocate to New York City, where Meyer became a printer. Printing for Yiddish publications, Meyer had fallen into one such group of radical intellectuals that encouraged him to become a lawyer. Starting in the 1890s, Mayer joined Eugene V. Deb's Social Democratic Party, and was a leading organizer of the 1910 New York Clockmakers Strike. A coalition ticket with Progressives allowed Meyer to become the first of many socialists in Congress. Meyer opposed the U.S's entry into the Weltkrieg, and yet aided the McAdoo administration in promoting militancy. Meyer even angered Jewish labor by promoting partisan Jewish organisations above Zionist labor groups. Meyer went undercover during the Crisis of 36, and re-emerged following the war championing many of the issues he was against. Meyer the pro-Zionist war hawk was much more popular, even against protesters claiming he couldn't run for President as an immigrant."
POLITICS_UPTON_SINCLAIR_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, in Baltimore, Upton was an aspiring author from an early age. In his teens he wrote pulp magazines and poetry to make a living, eventually moving into investigative journalism. His moment in the spotlight came after he spent seven weeks disguised as a worker in Chicago's meatpacking plants, drafting a political expose on the poor labor conditions of the plants. Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry, of which he declared "I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the "End Poverty In California" campaign. E.P.I.C as it came to be known was not the roaring triumph he had expected, but gave Sinclair enough fame and recognition that he could later pursue a second political career in the new America. Now championing a E.P.I.C movement applied nationwide, Upton Sinclair has won the recent presidential election with a startling margin."
POLITICS_FRANK_LITTLE_DESC:0 "Born to a family of Oklahoma homesteaders, Frank Little moved to California in order to escape the miserable droughts that had ruined his family's land. Him and his brother both became ministers, but in 1905 Frank became a full-time organizer for the IWW. A proud wobbly, he soon struck up a friendship with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and fought alongside her for the rights of unionized workers across the whole country. Frank narrowly survived two separate attempts at lynching by strike breakers, once in Wisconsin and a second time in Montana. Two instances of nearly being murdered caused Frank Little to lay low for several years, only beginning to show his face again around the mine wars of the early 1920s. His political activism was less provocative, and he avoided any more near-death experiences until the outbreak of the civil war. Although too hold to fight personally, Frank helped organize a series of militias across the Steel Belt, and was later nominated to serve in the new government. From this position, he could launch a campaign for the presidency, which the elderly union man narrowly won."
POLITICS_HARRY_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Harry Bridges was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1901. When he turned 15, he was first introduced to radical labor politics through the Australian branch of the IWW. Emboldened by his contacts with fellow socialists, along with seeing the general deplorable conditions of the poor around the world, he participated in his first general strike in Australia in 1917. Three years later, in 1920, he would move permanently to the US due to the more plentiful work there. He settled in San Fran where he joined other local activists in reviving the then-defunct International Longeshoremens Association. In 1934 a period of month-long negotiations between the twenty local branches of the ILA and the dock owners of SF broke down when two longshore workers were murdered. Bridges, the leading negotiator for the ILA during the standoff, convinced over 100 San Francisco unions to join together in a General Strike. The ILA fought the city to a standstill, and Harry Bridges was given credit for stopping further police violence. His later Presidential campaign often faced off against protesters who defied the new Amendment giving natural born citizenship to immigrants, and prevailed against them. Using this reputation, he launched a risky but successful campaigned that has lead him to the presidency."
POLITICS_FRANK_JOHNS_DESC:0 "Initially a carpenter from Oregon, Frank Johns became the leading figure of the regional Socialist Labor Party. Running twice for congress and twice for the presidency, Johns seemed doomed to a lifetime of obscurity as a fringe party candidate. That was until he went through a near death experience in 1928, nearly drowning in an attempt to save a young boy whom had fallen in a frigid river. Forced to retire from the Socialist Labor Party in order to recover from the incident, Johns was given enough time to think and plot out a new career. He began to correspond with several members of the Socialist Party of America, and after being released from the hospital he went on to join them as a fiery orator. Emboldened by his heroism and having narrowly avoided death, Johns later threw himself into the second American civil war as a capable and courageous militia leader. Thanks to his military accomplishments and personal reputation, he has now finally been elected president, of a whole new America!"
POLITICS_SEYMOUR_STEDMAN_DESC:0 "It was incomprehensible to many that a simple janitor would go on to become one of the Socialist Party of America's most prominent activists and legal advisers. Initially balancing his job as a janitor at the Northwestern University School of Law with taking evening classes, Stedman managed to pass the bar to became a lawyer in 1891. Although he was at first a democrat, the young Stedman became inducted into socialism when he helped defend Eugene V Debs during American Railway Union's great strike. His lifelong friendship to Debs saw him chosen as the SPA's vice presidential candidate on 1920, and after Debs' death he became a close advisor to Bill Haywood. Having now outlived yet another close comrade, the old and sombre Stedman has run a successful race to become the new president, intent on honoring his old friend's utopian dreams."

POLITICS_WILLIAM_RODRIGUEZ_DESC:0 "The son of a Spanish immigrant to Illinois, William Rodriguez made his living painting houses, until he could eventually afford to pursue a legal degree. Inspired by his brother in law, a radical journalist named J. Louis Engdahl to join the American Socialist party and move to Chicago. The young Rodriguez managed to win a race for the Chicago city council as a dark horse candidate, becoming the first socialist and first Hispanic to sit on the council. He soon managed to use his newfound position to attack the city's transit companies and to seek legal reforms. Although eventually ousted by a democratic and republican unity candidate, Rodriguez did not give up on politics. He continued to practice law and ran a successfully campaign in 1933 to become a judge. Building on a lifetime of legal and political experience, his next triumph came when he ran his most recent successful presidential campaign."
POLITICS_MORRIS_HILQUIT_DESC:0 "One of the oldest political figures in the Combined Syndicates, Hillquit was born in 1869, to a Jewish family living in Latvia. After his father lost his business, the young Morris and his dad crossed the Atlantic in search of a better life. Soon settled in the slums of New York, Hillquit would go on to found the Socialist Party of America alongside Victor Berger and Eugene V Debs. He ran for the senate in 1908 from New York City, garnering 21% of the votes. Despite this failure, he would later unsuccessfully run for mayor of NYC and afterwards help organize fellow socialist Meyer London's successful bid for congress. Despite suffering from numerous bouts of tuberculosis and frequent conflicts with the growing syndicalist wing of the SPA, Hillquit endured long enough to witness the revolution finally sweep through America. Although old and sickly, his seniority and eventful life has netted him a surprising victory in the latest presidential election. His age helped to invalidate dissenters who wanted a natural born citizen as President. Although some remain uncertain if he can finish his current term, President Hillquit has sworn he will serve the interests of all of America's proletariat, no matter his age or health."
POLITICS_EUGENE_DENNIS_DESC:0 "Born under the name Francis Xavier Waldron, and spending his early life as a laborer and IWW member in California, the young Waldron was driven into exile after the Californian Criminal Syndicalist Act nearly saw him imprisoned for revolutionary political activism. Fleeing to the Commune of France and taking up work as minor union politician, he became an important link between the Socialist Party of America and the Third Internationale. In 1935 he returned across the Atlantic, now hiding under the pseudonym "Eugene Dennis", to help organize Jack Reed's campaign in the coming presidential election. His services to Reed were soon rewarded with a series of influential positions within the Combined Syndicates, which served as the stepping stones for his own eventually presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ELMER_ALLISON_DESC:0 "A self-taught radical from Missouri, Elmer Allison was a founding member of both the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. He was a leading figure in the SPA's radical Washington affiliate, spending much of his life either working in the local cedar mills or atop a soapbox in Seattle's streets. A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met Jack Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City. There he was a major figure in running Reed's numerous political campaigns and leading the SPA's entry into mainstream politics. Following the revolution, his close comradeship to Reed and his zealous socialist beliefs has made him an obvious candidate for the presidency. A candidacy he has gladly pursued!"
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_NORD_DESC:0 "Elizabeth Nord grew up as the daughter of a family of poor English coal miners, having to spend her early teenage years toiling in a silk factory. Her family departed England a few years shy of the British Revolution, settling across the Atlantic in Rhode Island. In the United States Nord spent another decade as a factory worker during which she used her political finesse and determination to rise through the ranks of her local union, being elected Chairwoman. She became one of the key leaders of the Great Textile Strike of 1934, organizing the walkout of tens of thousands of workers across the country. On the outbreak of the Second civil war, she was a political representative of her union in Washington D.C, but quickly made her way across the frontlines to the Combined Syndicates of America. Repeating the same grueling political manoeuvring that put her in charge of the Great Textile Strike, Elizabeth Nord has now risen to lead something far greater than a union or a strike, she has become the new President!"
POLITICS_DAVID_DUBINSKY_DESC:0 "Dubinsky came from the former Russian Empire to America, a Polish Jew who had spent his early life organizing bunds, leading strikes and campaigning for the Bolsheviks. These actions netted him a prison sentence in Siberia, but the young Dubinsky managed to miraculously escape back to western Russia and catch a ship to carry him across the Atlantic. Spending much time working in the factories of New York City, Dubinsky became increasingly alienated from the union bureaucracy around him, starting a long-time personal feud between him and the IWW. He initially saw unions as inherently apolitical platforms that should seek further co-operation with the right wing to uplift all workers despite political beliefs, and that compromises with the federal government and business sector were practically mandatory for a union's success. Dubinsky would change his opinion after witnessing first the Great Depression, then the steady rise of Huey Long and finally the outbreak of the American civil war. Although he never made amends with the "union bureaucrats", Dubinsky ceased to compromise with the right wing and capitalism, taking on more politically extreme views. When the civil war finally ended he had been singing the praises of the new America, and already planted the seeds for a political career. Despite his controversial past, it appears David Dubinsky has now been able to reap what he has sown, rising to the position of President in spite of protests from old nativists who resist the proclamation giving him natural born rights."
POLITICS_JOHN_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The son of Welsh immigrants whom had settled in Iowa, John Lewis grew up in a company town dominated by the coal industry. At the age of 17 he went to work as a minister, becoming more and more embroiled in his hometown’s local politics and the nationwide labor movement. In 1907 he made a failed attempt to run for mayor, and later became a full-time union advocate who travelled across the steel belt. Although he initially bickered with William Z Foster over the merits of syndicalist trade unions compared to his preferred moderate and apolitical unions, the devastation of the Great Depression saw him slowly embrace more radical beliefs. Despite having once been a liberal and a republican, Lewis could not find it in his heart to endorse President Hoover's second term. Increasingly disillusioned with competitive capitalism, Lewis struck up negotiations with the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. When the American Revolution came, he had made up his mind for which side to stand on. Although his reactionary past continued to haunt him, Lewis eventually succeeded in finding a synthesis between radical unionism and his own moderate ideology, being elected as President in the latest election."
POLITICS_LUDWIG_KATTERFELD_DESC:0 "Born in Strasbourg under the German Empire and sent away to live with family in America at just 10 years of age, where he later ran away from home, Ludwig Katterfeld had a harsh and formative upbringing. After escaping his extended family, he took up work as a farmhand in Kansas, spending his teenage years balancing hard labour with honing his impressive oratory skills and sharp intellect. The next two decades were a turbulent time for Katterfeld, seeing him become a professed socialist and move from state to state to launch new political ambitions. After graduating college in 1910 he moved to Chicago and lead his own short-lived socialist party, the "Lyceum Bureau". He became involved with the Socialist Party of Washington and in 1916 launched a failed gubernatorial bid with them. In 1922 he was the provisional secretary of the Socialist Party of America, and later a representative in their behalf to the Third Internationale. It was in Paris he met Jack Reed, whom he accompanied back to America the very next year. In 1923 both men played a key role in the brief, radical Seattle Commune. The events of the commune compelled the bitter and austere Katterfeld to go underground, breaking with Reed's desire to go into mainstream electoral politics. From there on Katterfeld worked as an independent activist, not resurfacing until the Civil War. He did not have a chance to reconnect with Reed until the closing days of the revolution, with the latter on his deathbed. Compelled to honor his old friendship to Reed and armed with a lifetime of revolutionary experience, Katterfeld has launched into the spotlight with a narrow victory in the recent presidential race."
POLITICS_HENNING_BLOMEN_DESC:0 "A son of Massachusetts born in 1910, Henning was too young to experience the horrors of the Weltkrieg, but old enough to face the American Revolution in his prime. Initially an industrial worker in Cambridge, he was one of the few who did not leave his station the moment the first gunshots of the Second Civil War could be heard. A committed pacifist, Henning Blomen instead helped organize the chemical plant he worked at into a cooperative syndicate. His efforts were greatly appreciated by his more radical co-workers, who nominated him as a Massachusetts representative to the Combined Syndicates and helped him cross the front lines to New York City. Soon climbing his way up the political ladder, Henning Blomen has continuously made a name for himself with his unshakable optimism and iron will, running over a dozen major political races in his lifetime, the most recent of which has carried him all the way to the presidency."
POLITICS_JOHN_BERNARD_DESC:0 "Initially a French immigrant, Bernard worked nearly a decade of his life in the iron mines of Minnesota, later enlisting in the army. He served along the Mexican Border during the Mexican Revolution, a year later returning to Minnesota but soon discovering himself to be blacklisted from employment because his trade union activism. Pursuing a career in firefighting, then as a politician, Bernard managed to be elected to the House of Representatives on the ticket of the Farmer-Labor Party in 1936. While in office, he became more and more aligned with Jack Reed's popular front of socialists, and began to campaign for friendlier relations between America and the Commune of France. Distinguishing himself as a diligent proletariat and cunning politician, John Bernard has gone a step further and made a successful run for presidency."
POLITICS_OAKLEY_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "A voracious reader since an early age, Oakley Johnson took up a career within academia, serving as a teacher and later principal at numerous schools in his home state of Minnesota. This lasted until his commitment to radical politics became more publicly known, and he was arrested in the middle of a seminar over having contributed money to the defence fund of arrested IWW members. Undeterred, Johnson moved to New York and became a full time activist in the Socialist Party of America, helping to promote interracial relations and the education of the proletariat. In 1936 he accepted a position of Docent at a university in Paris, spending most of the coming Civil War abroad. In Paris he helped maintain diplomatic relations between the Commune of France and his comrades home in America. Eventually making the trip to the new America, Oakley Johnson has used his diplomatic accomplishments and academic merits to woo the electorate!"
POLITICS_BAYARD_RUSTIN_DESC:0 "Born in Pennsylvania, in the year of 1912, Rustin was raised in a family deeply affiliated with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was personally acquainted with notables such as W.E.B. DuBois and James Weldon Johnson, developing left leaning beliefs at an early age. This best showed in 1936 when he organized a student strike at Wilberforce University, which he was expelled over. Cast adrift, the young Rustin moved to New York City where he joined the Young People's Socialist League and got to meet Norman Thomas and A. Phillip Randolph. With the outbreak of the civil war, Bayard Rustin became a political organizer and campaigner for the Combined Syndicates championing better race relations, increased desegregation, and the immediate overturning of Jim Crow in the newly liberated southern states. Now, decades after the revolution he has made his daring bid for the presidency despite the fact that Rustin's youth, skin color and known homosexual relationships have for long been targets of slander and ridicule. Although one might expect any one of those three to have stopped him, he has powered through regardless and been elected the first African-American head of state in American history."
POLITICS_DARLINGTON_HOOPES_DESC:0 "Darlington Hoopes came from a notable family of Pennsylvania Quakers, during his time at boarding school he augmented his religious upbringing with an interest in radical socialism, going on to identify as a Christian Socialist. His ideological beliefs soon drew him close to fellow Christian Socialist, Norman Thomas and the rest of the Socialist Party of America. In 1930, Hoopes was elected to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, where his most celebrated accomplishment was completely outlawing child labor in his home state. Much like it did to Thomas, the outbreak of the civil war disgusted Hoopes. Although he could not deny its accomplishments in hindsight, his political cause after the war was to champion reconstruction and reconciliation between Americans. This benevolent, reformative platform earned him more and more influence in the new America, allowing him to make a bid for the presidency."
POLITICS_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "Marine, General, and Senator Smedley Butler has done the unthinkable. In the revolution's darkest moment, he has overthrown the would-be usurpers and traitors in the Centralist clique, and kept the flame of liberty alive. The old general has been an invaluable warrior for the Combined Syndicates, and his latest startling victory has endeared him to the population tenfold. Although Butler has confided to friends and political allies that he is uneasy to now be in the spotlight, he has agreed to take on the job as the temporarily acting president of the new America until the scars torn open by totalism can once again be healed."
POLITICS_PRESIDENT_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "A Marine, a General, and even a Senator, Smedly Butler has not been idle in recent years. Few expected, though, that he would ascend to the presidency, but this shocking turn of events has occurred. With the war over, Butler has committed himself to the political realm, becoming the country's leader militarily as well as politically. He considers himself a part of the Nationalist faction, having been inspired by Bellamy's ideas in his earlier years, and will now work to advance their platform on the national stage. Many have likened him to George Washington, and it is certainly true that the two war heroes have led the country through the hardships of their times with immense support behind them. With this support and Butler's own determination, there is no doubt he will bring his vision to life."
POLITICS_JAMES_BURNHAM_DESC:0 "A fellow-travelor of the far-left ever since he's been politically active, James Burnham began as a starry-eyed supporter of the Russian Revolution before seeing it quashed. His hope in socialism was revitalized with the British and French Revolutions only to witness the Empires of old not only persist but reform themselves internally. Influenced by French Sorelianism and his personal readings of Machiavelli he has come to view politics as largely a power struggle between competing elites with revolutions only temporarily succeeding in nations that failed to modernize their elite into a "Managerialist" class of technocratic minds as opposed to the aristocrats and capitalists of old. Viewing imperialist expansion as an inevitable consequence of their growing bureaucracies and promotion of national myths Burnham is dismayed by what he views as the infighting and factionalism promoted by traditional syndicalism and views socialism's only hope as being the promotion of a highly technocratic-oriented leadership alongside an American Nationalism that shall glue the nation together where socialism can not. His American Worker's Party (AWP) is currently a combination of his followers who de facto left the SPA's Federalist faction with him, Lovestoneites, national-syndicalists and Howard Scott's Technocratic Movement. While the latter has questionable loyalties to socialism he has promised to place them in charge of the economy in return for allowing him to run the political sphere in the power-oriented method he views as necessary."
POLITICS_CAPONE_DESC:0"Alphonse Gabriel Capone, known more commonly as “Al Capone”, was born in New York City to Italian immigrants. His upbringing was tough, the streets of Brooklyn shaped his world views whilst his Catholic upbringing taught him that morals matter little in the modern world. Capone understood from a young age that in order to survive you have to be ruthless, the cutthroat world of business carved Capone into a prominent businessman profiteering off prohibition. Bootlegging proved successful and Capone expanded his growing empire into Chicago from where he took over failing businesses wrecked by economic stagnation. He also never forgot his roots and used his newfound wealth to set up soup kitchens for the homeless and provide honest work for the jobless. Despite accusations of involving himself with gangs and all sorts of illegal matters he developed a reputation amongst the working class as a “man of the people”. Capone became a prominent supporter of labour unions, especially the IWW, when the Second Civil War broke out Capone launched himself into politics. Aligning himself to the Centralist Faction, advocating for union control over all aspects of life he has clashed with anarcho-syndicalists who accuse him of being a potential dictator. Furthermore his gang affiliations have once again struck his credibility, accusations have emerged of Capone using the Chicago Mafia to intimidate political opponents. Now in control of the CSA, this bootlegging businessman turned defender of proletariat must decide the future of America and socialism."
POLITICS_BIG_BILL_HAYWOOD_DESC:0 "If there ever was a man to represent the power of the working class, it would be William Haywood. Haywood has seen all corners of the country and lived alongside the working man. Haywood opposed Craft Unionism, which he felt could be divided and conquered by Capital. Instead founding one union, the International Workers of the World, meant to represent all working interests.  As the founder of the IWW, 'Big Bill' has battled the enemies of the people throughout his life: The capitalist opportunists, the labor slavehandlers, and even agents of the government. Quick to anger and unafraid of action, Haywood is the Man for Labor and the Man for America."
POLITICS_HOWARD_SCOTT_DESC:0 "Ever the enigmatic figure, nicknamed ‘The Mysterious Young Man’ by many during his initial rise, Howard Scott has risen to lead a new America bathed in the crimson glow of his Technocratic dream. Born in Virginia in 1890, little else is known about Scott’s background and early life other than that he never finished high school but somehow also claims to have studied and graduated from Columbia University in New York - a claim supported by his lifelong friend and fellow Technocrat M. King Hubbert. Working in NYC in various construction camps, he picked up on-the-job engineering experience, growing into a kind of ‘Bohemian engineer.’ With newfound experience and drive, he worked together with Hubbart, and the pair worked for the IWW before they embarked to create Technocracy Incorporated, but that was after the failure of Scott’s earlier attempt at spreading his ingenious message with his defunct Technical Alliance. Now, with the Revolution under his command after the failures and tyranny of his former ally Lovestone were revealed, Director in Chief Scott shall lead this new America under the Monad of Technocracy towards an efficient and prosperous utopia supported by syncretic Socialist views and the rest of America’s non-authoritarian vanguard."
POLITICS_HOAN_DESC:0 "Daniel Webster Hoan is one of the enduring figures of the American left - born in Waukesha, Wisconsin on March 12, 1881, Hoan enrolled in the University of Wisconsin and swiftly laid out the foundation for the university's Socialist Club, back when it had a mere four members. Hoan was admitted to the state bar in 1908 and moved to Milwaukee, where the longtime Socialist Party member began working with Victor Berger, editor of The Milwaukee Leader, in advocating for radical reforms to the city: public ownership of utilities, urban development programs, free legal, medical, and educational services, and other policies widely unheard of in most of the country. Hoan decided to enter politics by running for city attorney in 1910, where he edged out a plurality against both Democratic and Republican opponents - in the same year, Emil Seidel was elected mayor of Milwaukee, the first socialist to leader to a major American city. In 1916, Hoan succeeded him as mayor, a position that he continued to hold all the way until the Second Civil War. As mayor, Hoan codified what is sometimes called 'constructive socialism', emphasising practical reforms over haughty revolutionary ideals - some more itinerant socialists derisively called the Milwaukee branch members 'sewer socialists' for their constant touting of their city's sewer system.\n\nHoan silenced most doubts to his commitment during the war, proving invaluable to organising the Milwaukee war effort. With the revolution won and the Socialist Party's factions diverging, Hoan was expected to remain loyal to the moderate party core - however, shocking some observers, the breakaway Workers' Party declared that they would nominate him as their candidate for President in the 1940 elections. More astute observers noted that Hoan had not always gotten along with other Socialists during his time with the party, and that he didn’t seem to share the remaining membership’s pacifist tendencies. Whatever the reason, Hoan provides c ...
POLITICS_ZEIDLER_DESC:0 "Frank Paul Zeidler, born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 12, 1912, has spent much of his life in poor health - an unfortunate reality that prevented him from completing his studies. Perhaps because of this, Zeidler was drawn to socialism from a young age - growing up in the throes of the Great Depression, Zeidler read extensively from left-wing writers like Norman Thomas and Eugene V. Debs. When asked about his reasons for supporting socialism in 1933, Zeidler cited the tenets of international brotherhood, the struggle for peace, equal distribution of goods, cooperation, and democratic planning. He would become active in the Socialist Party of America's youth wing, the Young People's Socialist League, and shortly before the civil war became the head of the Milwaukee branch of the Red Falcons, another SPA organisation aimed at educating children. Frank was aided in his activist work by his brother, Carl Zeidler, who would go on to volunteer for the navy of the Combined Syndicates, only to die in the effort.\n\nDespite his perpetual sickly health and the untimely death of his brother, Zeidler did what he could to support the Syndicate war effort on the home front, and attended the constitutional convention on the behalf of Milwaukee mayor Daniel Hoan. In the post-war political scene, Zeidler was seen as relatively neutral figure (outside of his disdain for the Unity League), and was tapped by the Workers' Party to be the successor to President Flynn largely for this reason - after all, the WPA holds dearly to the idea of a symbolic executive, and the martyrdom of his brother generates much sympathy among veterans of the revolution. Only 36 years old on his election, President Zeidler comes in as a symbol of the unity between the senior professional revolutionaries and a generation of young socialists that have swiftly been maturing with the new America."

Thus, we should have ruled this country for four years. Needless to say, this has not come to pass.

CSA_delay_canadian_intervention_desc:0 "We cannot prevent the Canadians from intervening in the civil war... but we can delay them. If we sponsor nation-wide strikes with a clear syndicalist connection, there is a feeling they'll be too paranoid to take action. We can only do this so many times before the Canadians figure out where the funds are coming from, however."

CSA_take_vacation:0 "Have the President Take a Vacation"
CSA_take_vacation_desc:0 "The President is in much need of a vacation in order to recover from the stress of leadership. Should we authorize a brief leave of absence? (Leads to leader picker if you deny the vacation!)"

CSA_social_revolution_desc:0 "The land of the free and the home of the brave was anything but, we have our work cut out for us to rid America of corruption, racism and chauvinism. Yet first we must tear up the very core of all these things, the capitalist system itself!"
CSA_redistribute_wealth:0 "Redistribute Wealth"
CSA_redistribute_wealth_desc:0 "We will no longer tolerate a social order wherein men who do absolutely nothing useful can amass millions of dollars, while millions of proletariats who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough to prolong a wretched existence. The end of the banks, corporations and hoarders is finally here as we dip into the wealth reserves of our enemies and redistribute them to the population."
CSA_homes_for_the_people:0 "Homes for the People"
CSA_homes_for_the_people_desc:0 "Landlords and real estate tycoons have been a plague upon this nation. Let us lift the poor and starving from their slums, now that the rich and mighty have been driven from their seats of power."
CSA_emancipation_for_all:0 "New Legal Equality"
CSA_emancipation_for_all_desc:0 "Foolish and vain is the workingman who makes the color of his skin the stepping-stone to his imaginary superiority. Proletariat of all colors and creed fought and bled to build our new America. The loyal immigrant shall also be afforded Natural Born Citizenship in the spirit of emancipation."
CSA_womens_liberation:0 "Women's Liberation"
CSA_womens_liberation_desc:0 "With the men dying on the front lines, it fell to the women to run the factories, build the munitions and feed our revolution! That's to say nothing for the many nurses, pilots and female Red Guard members who gave their all. Their sacrifices and struggles will not have been in vain."
CSA_revolutionary_education:0 "Revolutionary Education"
CSA_revolutionary_education_desc:0 "Academia has been the nurturing mother of many revolutionaries, but the education system itself is still inherently reactionary. In all of America's history, it was built to produce more obedient workers, more crooked capitalists and heartless politicians. That ends now!"
CSA_reconstruction:0 "Begin Reconstruction"
CSA_reconstruction_desc:0 "The civil war has blasted our country to pieces. Large parts of the rural country are naught but mud and ashes, while countless cities have been reduced to smoldering rubble. We shall set to work developing new housing and infrastructure as soon as possible."
CSA_deal_with_feds:0 "Deal with the Feds"
CSA_deal_with_feds_desc:0 "Since the revolution broke out, we've accumulated an extensive list of political prisoners whom are awaiting trial. Now that the war is over, the time to judge these men has finally come. Although some amongst our leadership believes in rehabilitating these captives, other more radical comrades are eagerly calling for extreme revolutionary justice."
CSA_transformitive_justice:0 "Transformative Justice"
CSA_transformitive_justice_desc:0 "Although we've firmly dealt with the old American elite, there's still a sizable popular movement opposing our new regime. We'll need to pacify any remaining counter-revolutionary cells, and make sure to track down every last infiltrator in our midst before we can finally be sure we've won."
CSA_deal_with_firsters:0 "Deal with the ODP"
CSA_deal_with_firsters_desc:0 "The ODP's foul crew of reactionary demagogues, nationalists and tyrannical generals will finally stand on trial. Although Murray himself has escaped capture, we'll eagerly dish out a fair punishment to everyone who collaborated with him."

CSA_a_new_america_desc:0 "All the world that's owned by idle drones is ours and ours alone. We have laid the wide foundations, built it skyward stone by stone. It is ours, not to slave in, but to master and to own. For the Union makes us strong!"
CSA_expanded_investments:0 "The Roads to the Revolution"
CSA_expanded_investments_desc:0 "We should invest in a new road system in this country. Creating a national highway system and hiring scores of workers to build it would help our economy immensely. Perhaps it will be enough to propel us out of our economic troubles entirely, but time will tell." 
CSA_illegalize_racism:0 "Racial Liberation"
CSA_illegalize_racism_desc:0 "We have liberated the working class, but what of the millions of abused minority citizens in our country? Anything short of criminalization of racism will fall short of what we want to achieve. Jim Crow is dead, felled by the migthy American proletariat."

### American Commonwealth Focuses ###
CSA_second_convention:0 "Second Constitutional Convention"
CSA_second_convention_desc:0 "The time has come to decide the next step in our revolutionary struggle, to find a way to unite workers behind a single cause and ideology. Although our delegates come from a wide variety of unions and communes, we hope for a consensus on the future of socialist government. Like it was, over a century ago, we shall let Philadelphia be the site of a Constitutional Convention!"
CSA_american_commonwealth:0 "Commonwealth of America"
CSA_american_commonwealth_desc:0 "We did not come this far just to fall back into tyranny, our monumental support in the Constitutional Convention has shown that Union-based Socialism will reign, and building on the nationalism of Bellamy, we will guarantee social and economic freedom for all workers and toilers of our nation!"
CSA_protect_the_working_class:0 "Protect the Working Class"
CSA_protect_the_working_class_desc:0 "While many new ideas for a better economic system have existed in theory in America, the turmoil of the civil war made putting any of them into practice a difficult endeavour.

CSA_empower_councils:0 "Townhall Democracy"
CSA_empower_councils_desc:0 "The new Commonwealth cannot be built through authoritarian means, we must pursue a better class character for our democracy.

CSA_mutal_economic_comitee:0 "Craft Union Committee"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee_desc:0 "Reforming the capitalist system will be a herculean task, and it can't merely be wished away with state quotas and economic plans. Congress now begins assembling local representatives of Craft Unions in order to determine the best fit for economic growth while protecting professional workers from obsolescence. "
CSA_councilism:0 "Councilism"
CSA_councilism_desc:0 "Maintaining America's old bureaucracy is pointless. A compromise between the Craft and Industrial Unions was in the implementation of decentralized worker councils. These Councils will allow states to exert autonomous power in how unions are organized."
CSA_federalism:0 "Federalism"
CSA_federalism_desc:0 "Even if the old United States was home to political corruption, gerrymandering and inefficient bureaucracy, its administrative system is an unshakable cornerstone of our national identity. With compromise between Craft and Industrial unions impossible, we must rely on this cornerstone as the first American revolutionaries did."
CSA_power_to_the_people:0 "Power to the People"
CSA_power_to_the_people_desc:0 "Perhaps for the first time in our nation's history, true democracy is flourishing. Not the illusion of freedom, concocted by corrupted politicians and greedy businessmen, but real direct democratic means of governing our new Commonwealth! We enshrine this power in the unassailable Amendments."
CSA_federalist_economics:0 "Business Unionism"
CSA_federalist_economics_desc:0 "Many within the Combined Syndicates mock the idea of 'Business Unionism', calling it a betrayal of the revolution. What they fail the realize is that with 200 years of Capitalism in America, we will need an intermediary economy to ease the transition into socialism. Thus, Congress has ended state-controlled pricing passed under Haywood."
CSA_mutualism:0 "Protectionist Policies"
CSA_mutualism_desc:0 "The Councils of Professional Workers have concluded that a protectionist policy towards American goods is in order, but not as drastic as the old Smoot Hawley Tariff Act. A softer approach will see increased tax breaks for unions that operate solely in the states, as well as a propaganda push to 'Buy American' as we should have done during the first Weltkrieg."
CSA_workers_cooperatives:0 "Worker's Cooperatives"
CSA_workers_cooperatives_desc:0 "The dominance of industrial unions need not mean the death of enterprise! We shall simply replace the bosses who take an unjust cut of the profits. Instead let the workers decide within their workplaces, dividing the wealth fairly amongst themselves."
CSA_social_dividends:0 "Social Dividends"
CSA_social_dividends_desc:0 "Congress has passed a law instituting a basic universal income, wherein a portion of all profit generated from state run enterprises will be divided amongst our citizens.

CSA_public_owned_enterprise:0 "Publicly Owned Enterprise"
CSA_public_owned_enterprise_desc:0 "Public Enterprises were for a long time shunned in America, as countless of our old presidents were beholden to the will of Big Business over their electorate. As we've now broken the yoke of corporations, Congress has finally legalized made use of public ownership. Rooseveltism and conservationists only hold us back!"
CSA_american_syndicalism:0 "New American Syndicalism"
CSA_american_syndicalism_desc:0 "America has finally left exploitative Capitalism behind, and entered into the first transitional period towards a brighter future. Though some in Congress still mock our idea of 'Syndicalism with American Characteristics', they cannot complain about when industries roar with energy, and our people celebrate yet unknown prosperity!"
CSA_unionist_economics:0 "Industrial Unionism"
CSA_unionist_economics_desc:0 "Although there has been some push for a synthesis between Syndicalism and Business Unionism, it’s obvious to us that there can be no compromise with the old system. Industrial labor unions must rise to become the dominant force within our economy, unions now empower every extent of the Commonwealth government."
CSA_industrial_unionism:0 "Syndicalist Dominance"
CSA_industrial_unionism_desc:0 "Whereas markets were previously decided by supply and demand, or the whims of investors, our new system will be built by and for demand side economics. Congress has declared that workers must register unions with the IWW or risk fines and loss of benefits."
CSA_workers_self_managment:0 "Worker's Self-Management"
CSA_workers_self_managment_desc:0 "A great goal of this Congress is to remove the old hierarchies which permeated American workplaces. Thus, a law illegalizes Executive Officers and preferred stockholder voting rights. Now Unions can take control over all of the means of production through common shares ownership."
CSA_industrial_democracy:0 "Industrial Democracy"
CSA_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is integral to the American identity. Yet for far too long, whatever fig leaf of democracy was left at the factory door as Americans became slaves to petty tyrants. No longer. Congress has mandated a new Industrial Democracy Committee to promote cooperation between unions towards a democratic goal."
CSA_agricultural_unions:0 "Agricultural Unions"
CSA_agricultural_unions_desc:0 "The Agricultural sector will be obliged to feed our nation, but other than that broad instruction, we can allow the farmers to operate mostly independently. Congress has extended union protection to agricultural workers, enabling them to unionize and join the IWW."
CSA_syndicalist_economics:0 "Decentralized Planning"
CSA_syndicalist_economics_desc:0 "State governments have brought forth an awakening of self-sustaining communes in the cities and even counties. Cooperating closely with their neighbors and maintaining a well-functioning social order. Although this system is nowhere near utopian, it is the first step towards a true worker's paradise!"
CSA_protect_the_revolution:0 "Protect the Revolution"
CSA_protect_the_revolution_desc:0 "Maintaining and protecting the spirit of the revolution will be vital in the coming years. We face enormous outside pressure from the reactionary powers around the world, sabotage from dissidents within our own nation, and the strife of factionalism even amongst our leadership. Our will isn't yet broken though, the struggle continues!"
CSA_general_defense_comitte:0 "General Defence Committee"
CSA_general_defense_comitte_desc:0 "Entrusting military leadership and the safety our nation to a group of elites can only end poorly. We must ensure that our Commonwealth remains meritocratic and free from corruption, as such Congress has organized a committee of union advisers and military strategists. Tomorrow there will be no shortage of volunteers, no shortage of patriots."
CSA_indepedent_media:0 "Protect Free Speech"
CSA_indepedent_media_desc:0 "The free media and the right to free speech is an unalienable right to the American people. The Court system has reaffirmed the right to free speech in spite of calls for censorship. Let the reactionaries and traitors shout what they will, their treasonous drivel be drowned out by the cries of our comrades celebrating a new age of prosperity!"
CSA_strategic_services:0 "Committee of Strategic Services"
CSA_strategic_services_desc:0 "While the General Defence Committee has proven quite effective it has also been criticized as being too open and public. It is a shame to have to conspire in secret from our citizens, but we can at least ensure that this second Congressional Committee will uphold the spirit of the revolution and be closely supervised."
CSA_the_revolution_continues:0 "The Revolution Continues"
CSA_the_revolution_continues_desc:0 "With stability brought to our democratic government, our economy and internal security, we can begin to heal. The scars from the Civil War will last many more years, but that doesn't mean our nation is infirm and weak. The struggle continues, the fires of revolution still burn, and the Commonwealth shall stand tall as a liberating force for all!"
CSA_centrist_economics:0 "Centrist Syndicalism"
CSA_centrist_economics_desc:0 "The Future of Syndicalism is one of balancing out worker's liberation with pragmatism. The worker states will need to aid in directing, and building, the economy in order to ensure a productive form of socialism, freedom and to defend against other powers."
CSA_american_syndicalist_union:0 "American Syndicalist Union"
CSA_american_syndicalist_union_desc:0 "The American Syndicalist Union is at last united, with the powers of the worker-directed state and individual unions being balanced to create an economy that feeds, and frees, every worker. The central government should start another conversation with the unions for yet another investment into construction projects to keep the populace productive."
CSA_empower_militias:0 "Empower Red Militia's"
CSA_empower_militias_desc:0 "Whereever a strong internal army an exists there is the possibility of a Bonapartist counter-coup. Militias, on the other hand, follow the will of their local people, and counter-balance the army. Therefor, the Red Militias will be delegated greater internal legal power and backing, and of course the army banned from interfering with them in their territories."
CSA_social_confederation:0 "Socialist Confederation"
CSA_social_confederation_desc:0 "We have achieved the Dreams of Marx, Kroptokin and Goldman as a free-association of voluntarist communities live amongst one another, achieving progress through shared debate. The naysayers whom desired a strong government have been debunked now that the economy has adjusted to provide each according to his need."
CSA_free_communes:0 "Free Communes"
CSA_free_communes_desc:0 "The future of socialism is not in bureaucratic labyrinths but in the people owning themselves, with naturally extends to communities, not industries. The Communes will given more autonomy, prospective communes will be immiediently empowered as such and we will shift to try to deal with communities on a more local and municipal level, making communes as influential as unions in our government."
CSA_communal_economics:0 "Gift Economy"
CSA_communal_economics_desc:0 "Enough with these half-hearted attempts to accept capitalist trade as a necessary evil! From Each according to his ability, To each according to his Need is our proper values. It is time to end the last vestiges of capitalist influence, no longer recognizing wages or a universal internal currency and instead having activists and the Red Guard help communities organize themselves into mutual aid gift economies."
CSA_empower_congress:0 "Empower Congress"
CSA_empower_congress_desc:0 "Congress must have the power necessary to enact legislation, or internal disputes will increase en masse until we are torn apart. The All-Industrial Congress will be able to pass legislation based on a majority that will direct legislative orders and deal with each union accordingly, with the Union representatives still making up Congress."
CSA_industrial_projects:0 "Industrial Projects"
CSA_industrial_projects_desc:0 "With Congress having more directing influence we must begin a series of projects in order to build our economy and satisfy the needs of the unions.

CSA_guildism:0 "American Guildism"
CSA_guildism_desc:0 "Yes, the workers must obviously be organized inorder to protect their interests, but this applies to the middle-class as well. By organizing them along profession instead of purely class we can create American Guilds, but with a democratic internal structure in which older members elect Guild leaders to remove class distinctions and have professional guilds working for the common good."
CSA_closed_shops:0 "The Closed Shop"
CSA_closed_shops_desc:0 "The old capitalists foolishly, and greedily, believed they could simply pay the worker a dime a day while outlawing unions as they popped up. This will never repeat itself, as all workers whom join a listed major or public industry are required to join a union, and hiring non-union workers is now illegal. Meanwhile, we will work with unions to ensure ease of access for the worker."
CSA_calm_moderates:0 "Calm Moderates"
CSA_calm_moderates_desc:0 "Political Moderates remain fearful of our commonwealth, believing socialists are on a campaign to destroy their rights America. We will reassure them otherwise, reassuring them that we are not out to destroy them. A series of pardons for relatively harmless moderates the Red Guards wrongfully imprisoned or exiled followed by a reassurance that the AFL stands against Collectist-Syndicalist and radical anarchist ideals will greatly help."
CSA_nationalism:0 "Nationalism"
CSA_nationalism_desc:0 "The Nationalists have come out on top! Bellamy as last will see his vision enacted in America, beginning with centralizing administrative control of the nation in opposition to the older idea of states, will be the first step towards enacting this."
CSA_economies_of_scale:0 "Economies of Scale"
CSA_economies_of_scale_desc:0 "It is obvious that part of why capitalism tends toward oligarchy is because of economies of scale making for cheaper production costs that gives an edge over the small businessman. However, we can use this to the advantage of the worker by re-organizing small, disorganized industries into socialist conglomerates, allowing for the cheaper production of goods without lowering worker pay."
CSA_department_of_production:0 "Department of Production"
CSA_department_of_production_desc:0 "With major industries now organized and centralized under the workers we can use economic calculations for production quotas so the appropriate amount needed to feed, cloth and otherwise provide for the common man may be set. Let us welcome an economy based on need, not profit!"
CSA_coop_clubs:0 "Coop Clubs"
CSA_coop_clubs_desc:0 "With industrial production properly organized we can finally implement the most popular of Bellamy ideas: The Credit Cards and Co-ops Clubs.

CSA_high_wages:0 "Fair Day's Pay"
CSA_high_wages_desc:0 "A high minimum wage and the government intervening more directly on behalf of collective bargaining will ensure high pay for hard work done, for if you can't pay it then you have no right hiring men's labor to begin with."
CSA_paid_vacations:0 "For a Fair Day's Work"
CSA_paid_vacations_desc:0 "The 8-8-8 movement understood that a man needs his leisure and rest. As such 8 hour work days and five day work weeks are now the maximum and six-week paid vacations are guaranteed by our government, creating a life of luxury for our workers."
CSA_civilian_goods:0 "Capital Investments"
CSA_civilian_goods_desc:0 "Capital Investments emphasize acquiring capital goods for industry and farming, something the government needs to be more directly involved in, especially with our high-tax rates and control over capitalists.

### Union of American States Focuses ###
CSA_usas:0 "Union of Socialist American States"
CSA_usas_desc:0 "The authoritarian is ascendant, as the petty squabbles of the Constitutional Convention have ended in favour of a strong and centrist Marxist government. The USAS will show the world that the civil war has done nothing to reduce nations strength and influence, it has merely been redirected to the new revolutionary cause of Vanguardism!"
CSA_lead_the_revolution:0 "Lead The Revolution"
CSA_lead_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Vanguardist America is a centrist nation, not subject to IWW mob rule or AFL backsliding. Thankfully our loyal Craft Unions and anti-Judiciary advocates understand this. Making sure that our new Union does not collapse into infighting, reaction will be the first agenda of our new government."
CSA_peoples_commisars:0 "People's Commissars"
CSA_peoples_commisars_desc:0 "Already during the civil war, we had many militias, communes and syndicates adopting a system of Political Commissars. These watchful and vigilant citizens kept a close eye on any potential counterrevolutionaries within our ranks. Congress has allowed these commissars under direct state control, and expanded the system nationwide."
CSA_control_townhalls:0 "Sign the Hall-Ballam Act"
CSA_control_townhalls_desc:0 "The issue of loyalty is becoming a wedge that is beginning to drive Congress apart. To fix this, Gus Hall and John Ballam have brought to the floor a Bill to require affidavits of loyalty for USAS elected officials. This law ensures the safety of all by prosecuting those in politics guilty of treason in any form."
CSA_politics:0 "Democratic Centralism"
CSA_politics_desc:0 "The concept of Democratic Centralism where once a decision is made by the Central Committee then it must be followed by those lower within the party and government.

CSA_communist_party:0 "Empowering the Executive"
CSA_communist_party_desc:0 "Despite our centralization of power, there's still some squabbling amongst Congress. We cannot progress if the IWW, AFL, KoL and all the acronyms squabble. Don't they realize the Vanguard is the centrist position, and we are the only things keeping the revolution from tearing itself apart. Thus goes the anarchistic wall to wall elections of the IWW."
CSA_proletarian_dictatorship:0 "Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
CSA_proletarian_dictatorship_desc:0 "Everything we have achieved so far has been won with violence and force, the bourgeoisie thought still clinging to America cannot be voted away, it cannot be debated or discussed away, it must simply be destroyed. How else can anything take its place, if we tolerate the past? Their actions are treason, and the Committee the judge."
CSA_fosters_economics:0 "Foster's Command Economy"
CSA_fosters_economics_desc:0 "William Z Foster has managed to successfully push through his radical policies, as outlined in his manifesto, "Toward Syndicalist America."

CSA_union_managment:0 "Protect Craft Unions"
CSA_union_managment_desc:0 "The Trade Unions perform a very important function within our economy.

CSA_collective_farming:0 "Green Fields Program"
CSA_collective_farming_desc:0 "The Committee has approved of the Green Fields Program to the millions of acres of seized land. This is seen by the public as preferable to collectivisation, as it brings back the competitive spirit in land acquisition.

CSA_decentralized_planning:0 "Socialist Self-Management"
CSA_decentralized_planning_desc:0 "The Central Committee will immediately proceed with the difficult task of creating an adequate supply of reliable technicians and managers for the industries.

CSA_nat_syndicalist_econ_desc:0 "The Proletarian revolution initiates changes more rapid and far-reaching than any in the whole history of mankind. The hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, smashing their chains of slavery, will construct a society of liberty and intelligent prosperity. Syndicalism will inaugurate a new era for the human race, the building of a new world."
CSA_browders_economics:0 "Browderism-Syndicalism"
CSA_browders_economics_desc:0 "Earl Russell Browder has managed to successfully introduce a series of policies meant to forge a stable, predictable economy. Built mainly on industrial plans and the direct control of several sectors of the economy by the state, through the use of commissariats and quotas. The Committee and the Craft Unions in Congress have received it well."
CSA_price_controls:0 "Price Controls"
CSA_price_controls_desc:0 "It is characteristic of capitalism that when its economic machinery enters a crisis, the explanation is immediately found not in lack of production, but in overproduction. We shall avoid the tragedy of burning crops we saw during the revolution through Committee-decided price limits and expropriation of unused surplus."
CSA_control_unions:0 "End Dual Unionism"
CSA_control_unions_desc:0 "The IWW, though noble in concept, had the ultimate result of isolating the class-conscious workers from the leadership of the revolution, the Vanguard Party. Their continued influence threatens not only our rule, but the entire stability of new America. The true constituents of the USAS, the people, see that Vanguardism represents their interests better."
CSA_state_farms:0 "Collective Farms"
CSA_state_farms_desc:0 "The State agriculture organization is now grouped under the Committee's Commissariat of Agriculture, and is formed into trusts for individual crops and geographical divisions of the industry. Crops are sold either directly to the government, to the cooperatives, or, in a very rapidly lessening extent, upon the open local markets."
CSA_state_quotas:0 "State Quotas"
CSA_state_quotas_desc:0 "Introducing quotas makes maximum utilization of all the productive forces, men and machinery, and constantly raises the level of performance by the systematic application of scientific principles. The Committee has refused the idea of awards for meeting quotes, stating that advancement in the economy should be a reward, not an expectation."
CSA_planned_economy:0 "Foster's Anticapitalist Society"
CSA_planned_economy_desc:0 "Foster's Committee has approved a national plan, which declares a total economic war against the forces of monarchism and reaction.

CSA_purge_reactionaries:0 "Purge Reactionaries"
CSA_purge_reactionaries_desc:0 "In no country was culture so debased by capitalism as in the United States. Essentially a gigantic effort to perpetuate the robbery of the workers.

CSA_friendly_media:0 "A Socialist Friendly Media"
CSA_friendly_media_desc:0 "The existing systems of media within the CSA and much moreso the former USA are still somewhat confused as to their relationship with the state. Allowing multiple sources of media is more than acceptable so long as they are loyal to American Socialism and our government.

CSA_american_communism_desc:0 "On both sides of the aisle, there are those who believed that a syndicalist economy striving towards a communist ideal were incompatible with Americanism. They were wrong.

CSA_commune_policy:0 "Deal with the Communes"
CSA_commune_policy_desc:0 "Communes still exist throughout the Socialist Republic but the fact they are not paying into our system while enjoying our protection or spreading hostile propaganda is a problem.

CSA_purge_the_stubborn:0 "Asserting the Apparatus"
CSA_purge_the_stubborn_desc:0 "We have built a powerful state capable of defending itself from reactionaries who would undo socialism and extremists who would undo the state.

CSA_reform_the_iww:0 "Restructure the IWW"
CSA_reform_the_iww_desc:0 "The IWW has done much to help defend the working man and establish the socialist republic, but there can be no doubt dangerous radicals and critics wish to see it destroyed or replaced with their own organizations. The IWW must be reformed into a more centralized organization, and some are whispering that it may be quietly disbanded."
CSA_industrial_build_up:0 "Strength Through Industry"
CSA_industrial_build_up_desc:0 "Browder gives the factories of the Red Belt significant credit for propelling our side to victory. Why stop there? He believes we should build industry nationwide, so that we become an industrial juggernaut that is unstoppable in war. Let us begin."
CSA_practical_trade:0 "Practical Trade"
CSA_practical_trade_desc:0 "Our politicians hold mixed views on trade. Some promote tariffs while other promote a more free trade system. Browder has decided to forge a middle ground between the two.

CSA_the_boss:0 "The Boss"
CSA_the_boss_desc:0 "Earl Browder has successfully maneuvered his way to ultimate power. This is not a bad thing; he has endeared himself to the people, so much so that they call him "The Boss".

CSA_subdue_bourgeousie:0 "Subdue the Bourgeoisie"
CSA_subdue_bourgeousie_desc:0 "The American aristocracy is a freak creation of capitalism. This country was never meant to have nobility or royalty. We should bring them to heel, and make sure they pay the taxes we demand from them. If they resist, we'll just have to ask a different way."

CSA_popular_front_desc:0 "We have prevailed over our political rivals, but Browder believes we still need their support, and more specifically, to encourage them to come to our side.

CSA_purge_other_leftists:0 "Destroy Social Capitalism"
CSA_purge_other_leftists_desc:0 "Social Capitalism is the greatest hoodwink the capitalists have come up with yet, for socialism and capitalism are not compatible, class conflict is inevitable and those attempt to preserve capitalism have chosen their side. Let us liquidate these internal threats to the revolution."
CSA_smash_americanism:0 "Strike the Superstructure"
CSA_smash_americanism_desc:0 "Remnants of the Superstructure still continue to harm class solidarity thanks to capitalist, reactionary, and nationalist rhetoric. We must order the local TUUL and Red Militias to attack the reactionary patriotism that the USA used to justify its imperialism. Instead, we will pursue a policy of dialectical materialism."
CSA_the_great_sprint:0 "Great Sprint Forward"
CSA_the_great_sprint_desc:0 "Damage done to industry during the Civil War is bad enough, but perhaps worse yet was the refusal of capitlaists to industrialize or build infrastructure in areas that were 'unprofitable'.

CSA_socialist_incentives:0 "Vanguardist Incentives"

Through careful good deeds such as providing jobs for the jobless and opening Soup Kitchens for the hungry, he has cultivated his image as a great man of the people and a Socialist savior of America. Almost all Americans have been caught up in Capone’s ploy, through fear, ignorance or genuine endowment to Capone. "

The Church has a special place in heart, and he can’t hurt or destroy it even if he is running a supposedly atheist state. But, to keep the façade running he can’t allow the church to play a major role. So, Capone has chosen to simply turn a blind eye to the Church. Neither banning it, nor empowering it. "

### Butler's Coup ###
CSA_butler_coup:0 "Butler's Coup"
CSA_butler_coup_desc:0 "Smedley Butler, seeing the destructive nature of William Foster's leadership, has decided to lead a coup against the Centralist government. He now controls the country with the help of the Red Army. For now, Butler will remain in charge, though there will still be elections on the local and state level. There are also still debates about the role of the military in the federal government, but more than anything, the country needs stability."
CSA_populist_appeals:0 "Populist Appeals"
CSA_populist_appeals_desc:0 "Butler agrees with the Nationalist faction, and to a lesser degree, the Federalists, on policy grounds. It is a natural next step, then, to demonstrate to our people that Butler is in line with their thinking. This will hopefully ease the anxious minds that have watched our coup with suspicion. In both rhetoric and policy, Butler will show the country he does not wish to destroy America, only help its suffering people."
CSA_finish_totalism:0 "Finish Centralists"
CSA_finish_totalism_desc:0 "Foster and his allies fled to various disparate locations when we took over, but we have caught many of them in the time since then. Butler greatly desires that the country be done with this sort of extremism, and has even ordered the arrest of Centralists who hated Foster, such as Earl Browder and James Burnham. It is unlikely that they will get anything more than a slap on the wrist, but it is better to be safe than sorry, and we cannot afford to let the country fall into chaos again."
CSA_savior_of_the_revolution:0 "Savior of the Revolution"
CSA_savior_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "Smedley Butler's predecessor would have ruined everything we have fought for, and that could not be allowed. Now, after his coup, Butler is widely hailed as the "Savior of the Revolution". Some of our more cynical citizens have openly questioned what differentiates Butler from MacArthur, but Butler has assured them that America will never return to that sort of tyranny and that this is Democracy. As Democratic as it may be though, the Red Army holds significant influence in the government, and this will likely only increase with time."
CSA_restore_unions:0 "Restore Unions"
CSA_restore_unions_desc:0 "The IWW, AFL, CIO, and other important unions were disbanded completely under Foster's rule. These unions were critical in the Civil War, and their restoration could give us both good publicity as well as real benefits. After all, unions are sometimes all that stand in the way of capitalist exploitation. Since our predecessor extinguished the capitalists as well, nothing will stand in the way of the restored unions, and our economy will quickly recover from the recent chaos."
CSA_humane_society:0 "Humane Society"
CSA_humane_society_desc:0 "Butler's Quaker background has instilled him with humanist values, and he genuinely wishes to take care of all his people. Healthcare is perhaps the largest policy area that we have yet to address, and it is especially relevant with our recent Civil War. Butler wishes to move forward with a universal healthcare system, and once that has been achieved, address other issues as well, such as education and vaccine research."
CSA_integrate_revolutionary_guards:0 "Integrate Revolutionary Guards"
CSA_integrate_revolutionary_guards_desc:0 "The end of Centralist rule has left us with many lasting problems that we now have to deal with. One of the largest is the problem of the Revolutionary Guards. These were Foster's closest men, but most of them sided with Butler in the coup. These men are highly trained, and bringing the Revolutionary Guard into the fold will only enhance the power of the military, and, perhaps, its effectiveness."
CSA_red_junta:0 "Red Junta"
CSA_red_junta_desc:0 "Butler's control of the country is endorsed by most politicians as a preferable alternative to Foster's rule, but he still has to reassure them that he will not take the country in the same direction. As such, Butler's closest advisors have advised him to give a speech before Congress, in which he articulates his values, the nature of his government, and his intentions in ruling the country. We will not win all of them over, for there are those who oppose military rule in principle or perhaps wish to see themselves in charge instead, but we hope to gain enough support that our country will be more stable." 
CSA_utopian_society:0 "Utopian Society"
CSA_utopian_society_desc:0 "Though we have addressed major policy areas, we should also consider what many Nationalists call a "Utopian Society". This would involve adopting many of Edward Bellamy's ideas, and though a few of them unpleasantly remind Butler of William Foster, most of them would be in line with his values. As such, we should work to weave them into the country, so that we will finally be a utopia, once and for all."
CSA_war_is_a_racket:0 "War is a Racket"
CSA_war_is_a_racket_desc:0 "One of Smedley Butler's famous quotes is that "war is a racket". Of course, some would point out that he recently fought in a war himself, and that this makes him a hypocrite. Butler disagrees, pointing out that wars are often caused by military contractors and other elites hoping to profit off the deaths of their fellow citizens. There is nothing wrong with defending a nation in war, Butler argues, but we must not seek conflict abroad. This has been heard by observers both foreign and domestic, and most are sighing with relief that Butler does not wish to pursue his predecessor's bellicose rhetoric."
CSA_special_ops:0 "Special Operations"
CSA_special_ops_desc:0 "With the military now having larger influence in the government, programs aiming to create special forces units are suddenly receiving more funding than ever before. This is not an accident. Such an investment is seen as a waste of time by some, but Butler sees it as a necessity, as we must be prepared for any scenario, and we live in a world of hostile foreign actors. Further, such special forces could be used in conjunction with our intelligence agencies to root out Centralist dissidents and other criminals."
CSA_business_return:0 "Small Business Revival"
CSA_business_return_desc:0 "Small businesses were once the heart of this country's economy, but in the wake of the Civil War and Foster's rule, most have been damaged severely.

CSA_defensive_outlook:0 "Defensive Outlook"
CSA_defensive_outlook_desc:0 "Butler has assured supporters that he will keep us out of offensive wars at all costs and that we will instead focus on building defenses in our own country.

CSA_democracy_returns_desc:0 "The system has now stabilized to such a degree that most people are comfortable relaxing again.

CSA_the_machiavellian:0 "The Machiavellian"
CSA_the_machiavellian_desc:0 "Politics of course is more about power than it's ever been about morality.

As such, we shall create a truly direct-democracy in America, where every citizen gets one vote on all major elections and referendums, effectively running the will of the Technocratic Council. However, Loeb and his higher cabinet shall maintain their executive veto, should things go awry, in order to protect and safeguard democracy from reactionary infiltration."

In its stead, a truly Socialist command economy fused with Utopian communalism and energy-credit finances, and dictated and directed by the Technocratic Council in accordance with the American people, shall rise.

However, despite their good ideas, these movements do not go far enough to save the American people from all that ails them. We must take the ideas of the New Deal and the Square Deal, elevate them and evolve them, and ensure that their benefits bless every single soul in this nation. By liberating the masses, we shall free ourselves to be able to launch into the future of true prosperity and egalitarian progress under Loeb’s ideal vision of Utopian Technocracy."

This past hell has been eradicated, brought to slaughter by the Second American Civil War and rightfully butchered and sold off by our predecessors the Combined Syndicates. The success of this Revolution, followed by our own victory over authoritarian Socialism and faux-Leftism, finally cast away this foul past life, creating a new and free America in a fiery rebirth followed by a peaceful wave of Utopian metamorphosis.

Based upon the ideas of Thoreau, Owen, Bellamy, Lermond, and more, American Utopianism and Technocratic Democracy has freed the American people from the predation of Capitalism and Reactionary thought.

According to our calculations, it would be enough for every citizen to work a cycle of four consecutive days, four hours a day, followed by three days off. By ‘tiling’ the days and working hours into seven groups, industry and services can be operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Don’t worry, we aren’t heartless. Of course they’ll get holidays too!"

All shall salute this hero as his associates do, and all shall wear the Technocratic uniform - a well-tailored double-breasted suit, gray shirt, and blue necktie and the monad Technocratic insignia on the lapel, as he wears himself.

Taking his ideas ‘energy accounting’ even further, money itself shall be done away with, replaced with energy credits and energy certificates. With the sum total of all the energy needed to produce goods known, it is possible to allocate an equal share of the production capacity to each citizen. This means that each citizen will receive Energy Certificates, which then could be used to allocate production capacity to produce goods they desire, within an ecologically sustainable context. Even planning for the future, this system accounts for technological progression, citing that the certificates could be replaced by a computer accounting system where each person’s allocation would be referred to as energy credits instead. Though many have pushed back against this idea, Scott and his loyal Technocrats know this to be the true way forward towards utopia."

### Events ###

## Constitutional Convention ###

###Syndicalists###
csa.1.t:0 "The Constitutional Convention begins"
csa.1.d:0 "Today delegates have gathered from across the country in the city of Philadelphia as the Second Constitutional Convention is convened in order to draft a new and better constitution for America. With the syndicalists victorious in the internal debates during the war, the IWW is representing many AFL-affiliates in Congress, effectively nullifying the old Social Patriots chance of coming out on top, although the remaining ones still influence votes and can act as kingmakers in ties. Other interest groups that swore allegiance to Reed have also shown up, including members of the defunct Knights of Labor, the Nationalist Independence League, and National Civic Federation, as well as James Burnhams' American Worker's Party. The most radical of these smaller Labor Federations is the Trade Union Unity League. This organization, represented by William Z. Foster, represents a resurgence of Vanguardism in the States. A small riot on the second day erupted when the International Peace Mission and Southern Tenant Farmers Union were ejected from the Convention. These unions had been neutral during the revolution, and were initially accepted due to their high percentage of black membership."
csa.1.a:0 "Loyalists to the old order are not invited!"

###Social Patriots###
csa.1000.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - Property Debate!"
csa.1000.d:0 "The Social Patriots have come out on top of our political structure, beginning a Constitutional Convention with an IWW too weak to seriously contend, and many rejecting the Congress entirely in favor of forming communes. Now though, the Social Patriots suffer from the internal division between the Nationalists under the American Independence League, who follow the philosophy of the late Edward Bellamy, and the more conventional Social Patriots lead by the AFL, now called "Laborists", who often say they want a form of capitalism that is dominated by the worker, although they sometimes call this socialism. Meanwhile, much of the SPA has been united under Earl Browder, who has adapted to Social Patriotism while still adhering to stronger syndicalist aesthetics in the hopes this will push him into victory. James Burnham, the leader of the American Workers Party, promises a technocratic socialist economy that will grant total defense against the capitalist nations. The most heated debate has occurred on the topic of private property, with the AFL wanting to defend private ownership of property so long as it excludes large businesses that can be broken up. Meanwhile, the Nationalists believe it is time for state ownership of capital while individuals own that which they use or goods they purchase, with the property itself being used for the common good. William Green and other AFL leaders have accused this of being Utopian, of course. Earl Browder has sided with the Laborists on this issue, although he insists this is out of pragmatism. He believes that a stronger socialist stance, and state for that matter, is needed, to ensure loyalty to socialism, whereas James Burnham has sided with the Nationalists."

csa.1001.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - Social Radicalism?"
csa.1001.d:0 "Yet another debate has begun, this time over so-called 'Social Radicalism', which relates to how progressive the new states' social policy should be. The Nationalists have come out as endorsing full equal rights for women, including such controversial measures as access to birth control, joining the military, representation in cabinets, and that women should be encouraged to work for equal wages alongside men. The AFL is somewhat more traditionalist and believes that while women should have greater social benefits and protections, pushing outcomes along all of these lines will only lead to social instability and lowered support among workers. When they went on to question how many women actually wanted these measures, it led to accusations of conservatism from the Nationalists. Along similar lines, the Nationalists wanted to not only disband Jim Crow but also start a full campaign against racial differences in general. Specifically, they desire constitutional measures that would denounce the concept of racial differences, make it illegal to outlaw race-mixing, as the Klan wanted to, and encouraging integration within industries, unions, and schooling, with penalties for those that violate this. The AFL agreed on disbanding Jim Crow and believed in ending violence against black workers, but said that acceptance of integration should be allowed to go at its own pace or the socialist state would lose support among the workers and encourage reactionary terrorism. They claim that forcing so much change in such a short time would yield 'ugly' results. Burnham sided with the AFL, especially on gender issues, while Browder kept a stance between the two but clearly leaned towards the Nationalists."

csa.1001.b:0 "The Nationalists succeed"

csa.1002.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - Voting Rights?"
csa.1002.d:0 "One of the most heated of all of the debates has finally occurred today over the topic of voting rights! The AFL has endorsed a traditional American structure for voting under a congressional, federalist system, noting that the workers outnumber the capitalists anyways. This means they will dominate a system that has ended unfair capitalist advantages. The Nationalists, however, believe elder members of the unions or, what they plan to make them into, guilds, should have voting rights that generally decide the direction of the economy. Likewise, a weaker Congress would be elected by retired citizens exclusively. Under their plan, the elder members of unions and craftsmen guild have both more experience and less skin in the game, allowing them to wisely choose the leaders within the industries they have worked in. The leaders of the unions will then elect a weak symbolic leader, the President, but in reality, they will share power. Naturally, a voting scheme that relies on this would strongly favor the Nationalists, who currently have more support in the craftsmen unions than the public at large. Burnham and Browder have united behind a 'Centralist Plan', in which experienced union and craftsmen get larger sway but so do experienced members of socialist political parties. Under this plan, the economy and society are directed under the President, who is entrusted by these entities with full executive authority and greater legislative authority in order to defend and direct socialism. Like the other two factions, their policy that empowers party members would likely see them dominate the upcoming election, and has endangered some outcries."

csa.1004.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - Nature of Government?"
csa.1004.d:0 "The final debate occurred today, and this time the issue was the nature of government itself. The Nationalists, believing in the idea of a centralized government, have advocated for the weakening of states. Some have even suggested abolishing the concept entirely. They argue that centralizing the government would allow greater economic and administrative efficiency, and partly attribute America's various crises to its federal system. This was of course vehemently opposed by the Federalists, who have instead advocated for maintaining the old federal system. They argue that the system of states was originally intended to grant some local autonomy to the people living in them, and give them more of a voice in their local government. Doing away with such a system would, in their eyes, open the floodgates for the same sort of tyranny that Americans fought against in the Revolutionary War and recently as well. For their parts, Browder and Burnham have largely sided with the Nationalists on this issue, advocating the abolishment of states and instead aiming to move forward with a centralized national government."

###Syndicalists###
csa.2.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - System of Government"
csa.2.d:0 "A coalition of SPA party members has made a splash in what many had expected to be a landslide victory for the IWW. What was supposed to be an easy article, that of the new Legislative Branch, has drawn controversy between centralists and orthodox syndicalists. IWW representatives argue that America should be a strictly anarcho-syndicalist government with all legislative power vested in the industrial trade unions. The TUUL is roughly in agreement but believes that dual unionism must end and a single union, namely the TUUL, should represent the workers, which Foster called a form of proletariat unity against the reactionary bourgeoisie. On the other side were James Burnham, Earl Browder, and some SPA moderates who argued that party politics should decide political representation, arguing that it made it easier for experienced leaders to lead the way and a way for those not directly in worker unions to participate in an election. A victory for them would shift politics in favor of the Centralists and give them a stronger hope of securing the later election but would only be possible if they flipped enough IWW centralists and remaining Social Patriots who did not flee or were not removed after losing the internal power struggle."

Reminding members of the Convention of the Court's track record for legalizing oppression of unions and downright reactionary laws, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn remarked that preserving an unelected position of the final legal decision could lead to authoritarianism. To the surprise of many, Earl Browder of the SPA dissented, arguing that this discrimination was the result of a corrupt party system and not an inherent flaw in the U.S. Constitution. To Browder, removing the Supreme Court would endanger the unity of the nation, and lead to more schisms as had happened in the Soviet Union instead arguing that the President and Congress should still be able to appoint the Supreme Court, but can also remove justices they and the executive find unacceptable. The AFL, Nationalists, and other Social Patriots have quietly dissented with their vanguardist cohort, and pledge to support Flynn if her resolution passes. Meanwhile, the AWP praised Browder's position for being "as socialist as it is American". William Z. Foster of course was also in favor of removing the Supreme Court, and fanatically so."

Their belief is that a president is an inherently reactionary populist position, and they will ensure that a person like Huey Long can never rise to power in the new America. Relative moderates such as Jack Reed and Robert Minor support a head of state that is beholden to Congress and is beholden to their interests. The opposition is another cooperation between Browder and Burnham who argue that a president with powers independent of Congressional authority is needed as a 'Commander in Chief', imploring us to use the practical tactics of our enemies against them as well adopt a position more Americans are familiar with. Foster merely argued against the anarchist position for the first time in their long alliance, breaking over the issue of abolishing the executive position, although he did not side with either the Centralists or the orthodox on the power of the presidency."

Several IWW delegates had implied that the AFL has been antagonistic, and would prefer a return to capitalism had they not lost the earlier debate during the war. The TUUL is in full agreement with the IWW, calling all other positions reactionary. Browder again takes the stage calling to protect craft unionism, stating that while egalitarianism should be our goal abolishing wages would weaken our economy.

This was true from the surrealists in New York shocking viewers with graphic sex on screen to the Dadaists who challenge the very concept of popular art. As part of this movement, in many parts of the country, thousands of movie theaters have been expropriated to ensure that work of this caliber is not censored by prudish theater owners. They are brightly painted and carrying on board a printing press, government complaint office, printed political leaflets and pamphlets, library books, and a mobile movie theater.

However, several revolutionary architects within the SPA wish to break away from that style and seek a more Modernist style inspired by the designs coming out of France, Italy, or Britain. The AFL has come out in force, countering that Art Deco is an American style that cannot be erased by political whims.

It began with the debate over whether union membership fees were inherently discriminatory towards black workers. Evidence on both sides appears inconclusive, and most of the unions that were rejected from the Constitutional Convention have protested in favor of a maximum union membership fee. These protesters claim to be discriminated against based on their race by the openly anti-racist IWW. Then came the union Congressmen from the newly liberated states, who are protesting that forcing integration is a violation of their union rights to collectively bargain. Ultimately the IWW have persevered in Congress, and publicly shamed the new Congressmen and protesters as reactionaries."

When interviewed, these women-only unions claim persistent systematic discrimination in the fields of science and civil service. In the aftermath of this release, the planned Womens' Caucus was canceled, as the nation begins to debate the ethical application of women's liberation. [CSA.GetLeader] has settled the debate by decrying both women-only unions and the systematic discrimination, arguing that 'there are people to blame on both sides for discrimination'."

csa.18.d:0 "One of the few things Haywood had agreed with the villainous Long on is wealth redistribution. Haywood's wartime rationing has given way to peace-time legislation to prevent the robber baronies he had fought all his life. This is enacted in the form of his final wishes to Congress, the expropriation of all assets owned by a single person in excess of $10 million USD. [CSA.GetLeader] has taken this one step further to decry the idea of corporations, and has threatened to declare the legal concept of corporations to be illegal. The very next day, the state offices were inundated with hundreds if not thousands of formal requests to dissolve corporations into their component businesses, and applications for new Consortiums in the same breath. It is obvious to [CSA.GetLeader] that this is just a ploy for the robber barons to hide their business practices from the government, and has ordered a moratorium on reclassification until wealth redistribution is over."

The land of the United States still belongs to the capitalist. The worst example being Murphy Ranch out in California, which was a hive of Silver Shirt activity during the war and took months to starve out by our forces. It has been decided by Congress to exercise expropriation on these estates. Many of the southern and western estates have been given over to the local communes and established as public housing for the people. As expected, civilian armed resistance has cost us some lives, but few would have expected our own Red Guard to be ineffective at expropriation. One particular tough nut to crack was in Montana, where the initial militia sent in turned traitor and held onto a large estate for its warlord owner for eight months before our Red Guard were forced to intervene. The program seems to be working, however, so there is no reason to reconsider."

Our more reform-minded are worried that prisons will be a breeding ground for reactionary thought, so workingmen should be diverted to work camps. There they will be able to pay back the state for what they stole from the people. The American Workers Party has put forward a proposal to make soldiers of prisoners young enough to serve to prove their loyalty to socialism. Vanguardists believe that we have been too lenient on these traitors, and must execute the traitors of the highest standing in the prisons, as a rebellion is surely about to come.

This accusation alleges that business interests in America were behind the degradation of civil politics during the revolution, and in the event of either MacArthur, the PSA, or Long winning, the Corporations would be the true power behind the presidency. The president has proposed the immediate complete dissolution and expropriation to the state of assets belonging to traitors in this grand conspiracy. Congress is taken aback, with most initially supporting this measure. The list of traitors, however, causes concern among certain members of the IWW and AFL. It appears that some of the corporations on the chopping block include large pharmaceutical companies like Merck & Co.

The director, King Vidor, has been advised by colleagues to make himself scarce, as the reaction is not what he intended. Congress has demanded Vidor to release the names of those filmed, so their crimes could be properly prosecuted.

It abolishes all impediments to marriage, the biggest one being the abolition of anti-miscegenation laws. Civil marriage is now the only legal type of marriage. The code establishes no-grounds divorce, with both spouses receiving equal division of the property at the time of divorce. Also abolished is the concept of illegitimacy. Now, all children are entitled to parental support and equal rights under the law.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the revolutionary laws regarding the family, adoption of children that were made homeless by the revolution is subsidized. The European concept of Free Love is still under consideration, to the outrage of many tradition-minded trade unionists. While our anarchist-leaning supporters support the law, it's already causing fights in Congress and strikes among many on the right and even center of the CSA. These dissidents denounce the law as anti-family, anti-union, and anti-worker, with many labeling the anarchists as 'hedonists'."

As the revolution has come to an end their struggle has taken on new heights. How this shall end, is hard to say. Though some are fearing what will happen should the other be deposed."
csa.52.a:0 "This could be bad."

csa.53.t:0 "William Foster Denounces [CSA.GetLeader]"
csa.53.d:0 "William Z. Foster has denounced President [CSA.GetLeader] in a public speech. Decrying his methods as tyrannical and called out his position of economic totalism. Calling him a revisionist and that he is turning America into a Degenerated workers' state."

csa.54.t:0 "Browder Reassigned to Europe"
csa.54.d:0 "Following Earl Browder's denounced of President Foster in a public speech, Earl Browder has been reassigned to a newly-created party position in Europe. This new position, as dictated by President Foster, entails Browder oversee furniture assembly and candlestick making unions that are so vital to our economy. Such an illustrious post demands that Browder not return until his year-long tenure is up. Unfortunately, communication to this international facility is spotty at times, so Browder will no longer be able to coordinate with his party allies back in America."
csa.54.a:0 "Monitor his telegrams as well."

csa.55.t:0 "The Arrest of Foster"

Foster is working with counter-revolutionary groups and the already executed Jack Shulman. Thanks to the Hall-Ballam Act, our government is not powerless to stop Foster.

csa.65.t:0 "Henry Wallace Testifies Against Progressives"
csa.65.d:0 "Following the end of the Syndicalist Revolution, numerous members of the Progressive Party had pledged allegiance to the USAS in a massive show of support. While the public at large was fooled by this display, the Vanguard party is not so easily deceived. President [CSA.GetLeader] has spent the last several weeks building up a case to present to Congress purporting the inherent betrayal of Progressives to the socialist ideal. A gaunt and limping Henry Wallace appeared in a political rally today to denounce the Progressives as 'social klansmen disguised to deceive the working class.' Wallace then joined [CSA.GetLeader] in announcing that he will testify in the upcoming sedition trial against the Progressives, and they assure the public that traitors of this caliber deserved death."
csa.65.a:0 "The revolution will be pure."

csa.66.t:0 "Show Trials"
csa.66.d:0 "A number of trials have been conducted of prominent members, who have shown reactionary tendencies. Most of whom are not aligned with [CSA.GetLeader] are being brought up in these trials. Counter-revolutionaries who wish to reverse the revolution have been found guilty of being the enemy of the people. The most repentant of these reactionaries are now on death row, while the stubborn few are still being pressed for information on their accomplices."
csa.66.a:0 "Reactionaries shall meet their fate."

csa.67.t:0 "Butler's Coup"
csa.67.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened. Smedley Butler has gathered supporters among the unions and marched into Washington, denouncing [CSA.GetLeader] as a tyrant and a dictator. The rest of America watches with bated breath to see what happens in Washington. [CSA.GetLeader] has responded by calling for as many allies in the military, including the Red Guards, to seize the traitorous generals before the revolution dies fighting 'another Macarthur'. The Vanguardist forces, wearing the same uniforms as Butler's forces, have engaged in a chaotic fight in the capital. Through the friendly fire and threatening mortars....."
csa.67.a:0 "Butler's Forces capture the Citadel."

csa.68.t:0 "Butler's Speech"
csa.68.d:0 "'Americans did not fight and die in the revolution to overthrow a capitalistic dictatorship only to install a socialist dictatorship. The president, however, corrupted the revolution and tainted it. I have removed him from power, not to make myself a dictator, but to stop a tyrant. A new and free election shall be held as soon as possible, assuming the country can become stable enough to do so, and I hope it can.' With these words on the radio from Smedley Butler, America was shocked to find that the government had been overthrown. Perhaps, however, some measure of freedom had been restored. All eyes are on Butler now, and nobody knows what he will do next."
csa.68.a:0 "Democracy Now, and Forever"
csa.68.b:0 "The Military must stabilize things"

csa.6800.t:0 "Butler's Government"
csa.6800.d:0 "Smedley Butler has decided to remain in power, for now, to ensure that totalism is completely eradicated and that the Revolution does not fail before it can even find its footing. To do so, however, he will need help. To that end, he has been torn between two different possibilities for what his government could look like. On one hand, he wants to restore some semblance of democracy to the government and hopes to appoint civilians to his cabinet. On the other hand, his military allies insist that they would be better able to establish stability if they had more direct power within Butler's government. Butler's closest friend, Evans Fordyce Carlson, promises to support him either way, but urges Butler to act quickly so that we do not seem weak to our totalist foes."
csa.6800.a:0 "A Democratic Cabinet"
csa.6800.b:0 "A Miliary Cabinet"

csa.6801.t:0 "Prohibition Bill?"
csa.6801.d:0 "Coming from a Quaker background, Smedley Butler was exposed to their tradition of temperance. Butler himself advocated prohibition in the early '30s, and now that he is in charge, there has been a renewed push for a form of it in Congress. However, there are also strong contingents who are against prohibition, including some leftists, and some might see Butler passing the bill as him universally enforcing his will without taking the opinions of all his citizens into account. What should we do?"
csa.6801.a:0 "Pass it"
csa.6801.b:0 "Veto the bill"`

csa.6802.t:0 "Veteran's Bill"
csa.6802.d:0 "There are millions of veterans from the recent Civil War, and whether they fought for our side or not, they are still soldiers. While there is already legislation giving benefits to our own veterans, those who fought for other factions received nothing but disdain -or worse- under the previous centralist government. Smedley Butler, as a military official himself, is widely seen as being more sympathetic to giving veterans aid, especially given recent speeches he has given in which he has mentioned the issue. Passing the bill would win us goodwill with the veterans in question, and possibly secure their support if another conflict happened in the new future. However, should we choose to give pensions and other benefits to all veterans, we could risk angering the families of deceased soldiers who fought for us. What should we do?"
csa.6802.a:0 "Aid for all veterans"
csa.6802.b:0 "Public outrage defeats the bill"

csa.6803.t:0 "A New Government"
csa.6803.d.democrat:0 "In the wake of William Foster's destruction, a new government has begun to form. Under Smedley Butler's careful guidance, the country is beginning to heal from the wounds inflicted by both Foster and the disastrous conflicts and strife of recent years. Butler has fostered close ties with the Nationalists, who have been given spots in Butler's cabinet, and allowed to run in elections in local, state, and national elections, as have many other factions of the SPA. However, the Centralists, led primarily by Foster, have been pursued relentlessly. Foster himself has fled to locations unknown, but some of his top advisors now sit in prison and await their hearings in court. For now, the country admires Butler as the man who saved the country from tyranny, and believes he is the right man to lead the nation into a new socialist age."
csa.6803.d.military:0 "In the wake of William Foster's destruction, a new government has begun to form. Under Smedley Butler's careful guidance, the country is beginning to heal from the wounds inflicted by both Foster and the disastrous conflicts and strife of recent years. Wary of further chaos, Butler has entrusted cabinet positions to military officials whom he believes he can trust. On a national level, a mix of military and civilian officials run the country. On the state and local levels, however, Butler has decided to allow elections, entrusting control of such areas to whoever may win. However, the Centralists, led primarily by Foster, have been pursued relentlessly. Foster himself has fled to locations unknown, but some of his top advisors now sit in prison and await their hearings in court. For now, the country admires Butler as the man who saved the country from tyranny, and believes he is the right man to lead the nation into a new socialist age."
csa.6803.a:0 "Ok"

csa.6804.t:0 "Relations with the Internationale"
csa.6804.d:0 "The Internationale did much to aid our cause during the war, sending us fiscal aid, equipment, and volunteers. We owe them much for their help, and now it is time for us to decide how we will repay them. Our more pacifist-minded citizens and politicians insist that we simply provide them the same materials they gave us and leave it there so that the balance is even. Butler is sympathetic to this view, but he also understands that the Internationale is in great danger and that America could stand as the lone socialist nation on the world stage if they were to fall. Many of his fellow military officials suggest that we could join the Internationale, as they have not experienced the plague the Europeans call "Totalism". Thus, joining them would not force us to compromise our own values, as we will be merely defending our natural allies from imperialist aggression. What should we do?"
csa.6804.a:0 "They cannot fall"
csa.6804.b:0 "Repay them in equipment"

csa.6805.t:0 "Relations with the Internationale"
csa.6805.d:0 "The Internationale did much to aid our cause during the war, sending us fiscal aid, equipment, and volunteers. We owe them much for their help, and now it is time for us to decide how we will repay them. Most of our pacifist-minded citizens and politicians are inclined to simply provide them the same materials they gave us and leave it there so that the balance is even. Butler is sympathetic to this view, but he is also reluctant to provide aid to nations with similar ideologies to the one that he recently overthrew. This "Totalism" is as destructive to Europeans as it was to Americans. Butler, among many others, believes that aiding them would take away any notion of moral high ground, domestically and abroad. There are whispers that we could create our own alliance on the world stage, as a competing representation of socialism. What should we do?"
csa.6805.a:0 "Go it alone"
csa.6805.b:0 "Repay them in equipment"

csa.69.t:0 "Self Determination in the Black Belt"
csa.69.d:0 "Before the revolution, there were plans by [CSA.GetLeader] to implement an autonomous region within the South for the African-American community. With the ascension of William Z Foster comes a dedication to the dream to create a more perfect union, as opposed to a greater union. Foster has drafted a plan with James W. Ford to ensure the perpetual safety and self-determination of African American minorities in the South. This plan is to create a Black Belt in the south of autonomous communities with their own representatives separate from Congress. While the ruling party as a whole supports this, several critics from other parties note that this policy would create an unequal standard for civil rights."
csa.69.a:0 "Self Determination is good for all."
csa.69.b:0 "We can't proceed without support."

csa.70.t:0 "Reactions to the Black Belt"
csa.70.d.vanguard:0 "The African-American community is split over the Black Belt. On one hand, it dramatically increased the number of black Vanguard politicians and in the country overall, as the independent communes required elected officials. On the other hand, several nonvanguard black politicians in the North have faced issues with promoting a colorblind society. They debate whether to continue seeking civil rights that would remove all racial differences in legislation, or expand the Black Belt northwards."
csa.70.d.tuul:0 "The African-American community is split over the Black Belt. On one hand, it dramatically increased the number of black Trade Union Unity League politicians and in the country overall, as the independent communes required elected officials. On the other hand, several non-TUUL black politicians in the North have faced issues with promoting a colorblind society. They debate whether to continue seeking civil rights that would remove all racial differences in legislation, or expand the Black Belt northwards."
csa.70.a:0 "We stand Firm."

csa.71.t:0 "The Great Sedition Trial of [GetYear]"
csa.71.d:0 "The only person to disgust President Browder more than Huey Long's populism, is Harry Leland Mitchell's betrayal of the unions. The USAS has strategically kept silent over the status of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union and has been slowly accruing defectors that refused to leave America. Now this long con has paid off, and a group of trusted Congressmen has smuggled Townsend back into America under the pretense of reconciliation. Townsend was immediately arrested in the first bugged hotel room he stayed in and has become the main attraction in the largest Union Trial in American history. Townsend's fate was already sealed, but this trial will hopefully discourage any more dissidents within the IWW from thinking any reactionary thoughts."
csa.71.a:0 "Good Riddance to Bad Unions."

csa.72.t:0 "The International Peace Movement disbanded"
csa.72.d:0 "The revolution against capitalism drew a line in the sand. You were either with the union or a scab, that mantra worked for William Haywood, but not for Earl Browder. It has come to his attention a despicable group of infiltrators into the new America in the form of The International Peace Movement. This dangerous group, led by a little man who thinks he's a god, has resisted conscription and collectivization. Their communes in New York and Philadelphia may be racially integrated, but their adherence to gender segregation in the name of a religious code is utterly reactionary. We have seized IPM members for de-programming, and their communes are now safely in the hands of Trade Union Unity League members."
csa.72.a:0 "You're not God, Little Man."

csa.73.t:0 "Foster dissolves the AFL"
csa.73.d:0 "The Vanguard party has finally succeeded in reforming the American Federation of Labor, by dissolving it. Foster and the Central Committee were sure that labor leaders within the AFL such as John L. Lewis were dismantling the dignity of labor by adopting industrial unionist tactics. These tactics include trying to force wall-to-wall voting on trades where expertise is clearly correlated to competence, allowing new employees to outshout veterans. The tipping point was when a mail bomb was discovered near President Foster's home, which was traced back to the AFL. All other legal means to stop the AFL leaders from despoiling their craft did not work, so the Vanguard is forced to intervene directly. Lewis, among many other AFL traitors, was arrested and will stand trial for their crimes against Labor."
csa.73.a:0 "Good Riddance to Lewis."

csa.74.t:0 "Browder purges The Daily Worker of Reactionaries"
csa.74.d:0 "After months of investigation into the editors of the Daily Worker, President Browder has called for their immediate removal. Citing numerous examples of sub-textual betrayals within the newspaper, including ghost-written opinion pieces mouthing reactionary ideas aligned with Fosterism, Collectivism-Syndicalism, Anarchism, and liberalism. Browder has come to Congress with a list of candidates to ensure the intellectual sanctity of the Daily Worker. This list includes University professors and metropolitan sophisticates, all pioneers in the social ramifications of Planned Economy. All were approved, and thus the mind of America is once again safe from pollution."
csa.74.a:0 "No more crude cartoons either."

csa.75.t:0 "River Rouge Wildcat Strike Turns Deadly"
csa.75.d:0 "The workshops of the River Rouge Plant have been a known hotbed for violent activity. It comes to no surprise that it was here where workers struck out against the United Auto Workers in a Wildcat Strike. The UAW rightly asked the Vanguard party for assistance, and boy did they deliver. After the workers were rendered inert, [CSA.GetLeader] broadcast a new policy to America banning Wildcat Strikes. No longer will mobs rule over the appointed American government."
csa.75.a:0 "It's what Haywood would have done."

csa.76.d:0 "Today Charlie Chaplin has premiered another movie, titled God Save the Kaiser, which has quickly received glowing reviews within the press. God Save the Kaiser is a political satirical comedy-drama and Chaplin's first true sound film. The film follows two principal characters, an unnamed German barber struggling to make ends meet in Germany who bears a great deal of similarity with the Tramp that Chaplin played in his other movies. The other major character is King Billy, who is a cruel but ineffective buffoon of a leader; an obvious satire of Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Throughout the film, it shows the plight of the average German worker while viciously mocking the German government and the Kaiser in particular. The film ends with the barber being mistaken for King Billy and giving a rousing speech where he extols the virtues of Goodwill and Human Brotherhood and gives a strong endorsement for Chaplin's socialist views."

Since the revolution has now been achieved a movement has cropped up to combine this conservationism with these old Progressive ideals. A number of new National Parks have been created on top of the houses of capitalism, as well as a People's Conservation Committee to guide their preservation. A top priority of the PCC is to replant trees around Oklahoma, the source of the dust storms that threaten our food supply. Though it took a lot of convincing to get Congress to fund this project, the PCC hopes that in a few years the dust storms that used to reach Washington D.C will only be a memory."

While many honor those that fought for the revolution itself, there are also ones honoring the struggles like the Haymarket Square Riot. As these memorials are made by the community, nobody was there to check whether the statue was appropriate until the press got a hold of the story. Apparently, statues were erected honoring the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing and the 1920 Wall Street Bombing. The press claim erroneously that the government approved of these memorials, and is honoring the bombers. These statues were silently taken down, and an official apology was forced out of the city councils responsible for this mean-spirited action."

csa.82.d:0 "A question has come up in regards to the Boy scouts of America. Some within congress regard it as a more reactionary organization, notable for including a pledge that scouts are loyal to their employers in the days before the revolution among other issues. To that end, a number within Congress believe that a new Pioneer organization should be created similar to the ones in socialist countries in Europe called the Pioneers of America.

In reforming and organizing public maintenance services, Hillquit showed that socialism could reorganize systems without having to redefine or destroy the foundations of the system. That principle of Sewer Socialism must be taken to the whole of the nation, now that the chains are broken.

However, people are divided as to what to do about the relief. Some believe that it should be destroyed. James Ford, in a cynical turn, wishes to chisel down the Confederates and replace them with Jemmy, John Brown, George Padmore. Diego Rivera, the artist behind the renovation of Rockefeller Plaza, suggests a cheap and honorable compromise.

csa.89.d:0 "With the onset of a new society, a new set of ethics must take the place of the old ones. What is truly ethical behavior? Waging revolution by all means. Before the revolution and during the war, life was hard for our fellow Americans. Many had to suffer the loss of a loved one, life-threatening financial insecurity during the crisis years, or persecution. This leads to behavior the old society may have deemed wrong or sinful, but our brave President Foster must look beyond traditions. For those whose souls suffered too deep an injury to carry on, we must allow them to phase out. Despite our censorship of the Daily Worker, massive protests by Christian Workers Unions, intelligentsia, and community support networks claim that Foster's 'suicide law' is merely a pretense to excuse mysterious deaths and disappearances. The more conspiratorial rightists even claim this is a plot by Foster to legalize murder so long as it looks like suicide.

csa.90.d:0 "Film montage, modernist writing, and the socialist spirit come together in John Dos Passos's new book U.S.A. The story itself is an examination of twelve Americans that lived through the depression and revolution. Passos's writing combines snippets of newspapers, propaganda, and the conversations he recalls on the streets during the terrifying months before liberation. Such unorthodox and creative writing is usually praised by the Americans Writers Congress, but they have remained silent. This is due to the book's depiction of extralegal killings that took place throughout America during the Civil War by our soldiers. To the nominal leader of the Writers Congress, Ernest Hemingway, this book amounted to treason and sedition against the socialist government. However, his decision to censor the book and detain Dos Passos was overruled by Congress."

How many of the struggling masses got to enjoy picnics or visiting the national parks when they had to work as many hours just to survive and feed their children? No longer will this be the case. The various local unions across the country, regardless of which federation they belong to have begun to take over and manage various cultural centres as well as help sponsor vacations.

As part of this program, the first groups of children have been sent to "Foster Schools" today. These new schools will emphasize the same things the old schools did but will teach the history of marxism and syndicalism, emphasize the French and Russian revolutions, and discuss the recent Civil War as well.

Ever since the Revolution, the Reds have successfully utilized their name to re-brand themselves as a symbol of the triumph of Socialism, to the point that they have become the most popular team in America. The Tigers have proven themselves to be quite the adversary, however, and have forced the series to a final decisive game with each team at three games apiece.

One such group - numbering in the tens of thousands before the final end of the war - was under the command of the charismatic and crafty Walter W. Waters. A veteran of the Banana Wars himself, Waters was no stranger to military command. Alongside his contemporaries the veterans of the Battle of Blair Mountain - the largest labor uprising in American history before our Revolution - who form the core of our general staff outside the Butler Clique, Waters led his ragtag volunteer militias to great effect outside the official command structure of the CSA, and now with our victory secured, they have come asking for recompense. \n\nReforming into what is being called the ‘Bonus Army,’ Waters has led tens of thousands of veterans on a march to the capital in order to demand financial compensation and care like the official soldiers of the Syndicalist armies are receiving. Though this mass has remained peaceful so far, they are all armed as a show of solidarity and seriousness, and are dead set on not leaving the capital empty handed. Though we could ignore their pleas, to do so would fly in the face of everything we just fought for in the Second American Revolution. We may not have the funds, but we must find some way to reward these veterans for their service, lest we be no better than the tyrants and cheats we just fought against. We can raise Waters up from mere militia leader attached to our command to being a full-fledged general in our revolutionary army, granting him the respect and recognition he deserves while also promising to pay pensions to each and every one of his men in time."

Furthermore, local animators in Detroit and Chicago have come together to animate a special short of ‘Felix the Cat’ featuring an animated Picket in a comical short poking fun at the major reactionary figures of the Second American Revolution. Picket has even become so beloved that one of the CSA’s own fighter squadrons have taken the animated version of Picket to be the mascot of their airwing, with each plane in the unit being emblazoned with that charming little cat.

Due to Capone’s connections, it would be best to distance himself from organized crime. However, the Commissars always wish to embrace tradition. And since the actions of the Mafia during the war helped save America, many view their actions as actions taken to help the Syndicate Government and not a crime.

With this monumental position of Power, Nitti has taken it on himself to seize the Military Establishment for the ROSS. As the ROSS raided the headquarters of many Military Officers deemed to be “Reactionary”, Comrade Nitti declared that to keep America safe drastic measures must be taken within the Army. The proposed reforms were quickly greenlighted by Comrade Capone, and within these reforms are provisions stating that Frank Nitti has the position of “Supreme Commander of the Revolutionary Office of Strategic Services”. This position is one higher than a General and makes it so that Comrade Nitti is only second within the army to Marshal Dillinger himself. "

People who don’t pay up are subject to Harassment and even arrest by the ROSS officials, while those who pay up can have free reign.

As they reign, they institute harsh protection rackets on citizens under their rule and take out citizens who won’t pay up with little repercussions. While Businessmen grow increasingly wealthy through Price Gouging, actively helped by the Government Policies of setting the price of everyday goods at high rates. As well, the inflatable currency value has allowed the citizens with a higher Social Credit Score to economically drain the citizens with lower Social Credit Scores.

As this celebration of the Mafia grows, people start celebrating the actions committed in the War by Capone’s allies in the Sicilian Mafia and the actions of other Gangs such as Dillinger’s or Bonnie and Clyde’s.\n\n  Memorials for Bootleggers, plaques commemorating Mobsters, and speeches and dedications to ringleaders killed in the War have all become commonplace in America. And through all of this, the symbol of a Gangster adorned in a fedora and a 3-piece suit has become a propaganda piece for the revolution. The stereotypical Mobster becoming a symbol for the new American way of life.\n\n And through all of this, the phrase “La Cosa Nostra” (or “Our Thing”) has become a phrase used by revolutionaries all throughout America and beyond. In occupied territories, La Cosa Nostra is painted on the headquarters of the occupiers while “La Cosa Nostra” is shouted by 1000s whenever Capone or his allies hold a rally.\n\n And as the Mafia cult is extended, the Gang Culture is ingrained into American life, and once common criminals become War Heroes and Revolutionary Symbols."

Capone opened soup kitchens and provided employment to the masses, and his gangs went to work stamping out the reactionaries. Were they criminals? yes, but they were breaking the reactionary laws in the name of the Revolution. And thanks to Capone’s actions in the war, he became a permanent man of the people. With his allies in the Labor Unions, he managed to become one of the heroes of a new Socialist America. And with the conclusion of the Second Constitutional Convention, he achieved the impossible; he gained control of America through completely peaceful means. And now, he is the unquestioned ruler of America. The Combined Syndicates were dissolved and one, central Syndicate under the control of the Workers has been established and Capone’s allies from the war formed the new government. Capone is the unquestioned dictator of America, not through his traditional means of force, but by cultivating his image and doing away with challenges to his power from above. Now, America is one, controlled by Capone and his Criminal Allies. And to all that tried to keep us down, we say one thing:  We will always Control America, no matter what state runs it.

When mentioned, or asked about his own well-being, he seems to be adamant that he is completely fine.

A large investigation has now come underway to determine where he is, or if he is even still alive at all. However, there is speculation that Hoffa may not have simply gone missing. Speculations run high and actual tangible facts low, but some rumors seem to indicate that Chairman Capone believed that Hoffa had become an accomplice to a plan to coup the government in charge, and remove The Boss from his position of leadership. As it is now, however, there is no proof to confirm or deny this thought. Now, only time will tell if he will be found, or simply a body, if anything at all."

The parties, while not completely out of character for Capone, have been getting more and more out of hand, and the aftermaths have been harder and harder to keep out of the sight of the public, who, upon hearing of them, may have a change of heart towards the venerable leader. These parties have been a large sink of money, but on top of that, the reports that come from the aftermaths of these parties are highly disturbing, including events such as sexual assault, regular assault, as well as some people even dying during the party due to overdoses on the exorbitant amount of drugs that are present at these parties. All of these things considered have begun to put the thought in the mind of Capone's second in commands that he has finally begun a final, irredeemable descent into total syphilitic madness thanks to the disease.

Recently, while Capone has shown a stark lack of care in the actual lives of the people of his nation, mostly working to further himself and his own party’s goals, The Boss has recently begun to have a change of heart. No longer is he being as selfish as he was, as he is now beginning to put out proposals to make life better for the nation’s citizens. While of course, the citizens have welcomed this with open arms, as well as some of the people in his party, many more see this as a threat to their own power and are concerned that he is going to continue to give away more and more of what they have earned. The fear that he may soon give away something as precious as the power they have fought so hard to solidify in their own hands is becoming reality, and many are beginning to consider what means they have at their disposal to remove him from power.

Far more than just a gangster though, Luciano's connections to high society have made him the natural choice to succeed Capone, and now that he is in power, he has plans for the country. Surprisingly to some, his first course of action has been to rid himself of any of the grandiosity of his predecessor, preferring to remain a power behind the scenes so as to not seem too imposing to other leaders. This, combined with Luciano's desire to keep the peace between all American gangs and crime families while also promoting ties with international crime syndicates, may lead to a new era of prosperity, but it is too early to tell.

Rather, he prefers using hitmen and subordinates to do the more unsavory parts of his business, leaving him to use his sharp business acumen to manage the country with relatively clean hands and no distractions.

Despite not seeming to understand that he is now the number one man in the country, and hence effectively above the law, Dillinger is a dangerous man, and his talent for warfare should not be underestimated. Despite his hatred of centralized government, it seems that his leadership is just the stabilizer the country needs in the aftermath of Capone's death, and thanks to Dillinger, we may finally have peace in America..."

As Hoffa regaled his audience on the classics of Totalist-Caponism and on the heroics of revolutionary heroes such as Reed and Haywood, before delving into the heart of his message - Hoffa called for reform and a softening of the nation’s harsh policies, hoping to soften the appearance of our Caponist state while better taking care of the people. Though many have decried this act as revisionism, causing the very factionalism Capone warned about, Hoffa is determined that nominal reform is the CSSA’s only hope at long-term survival.

While a reliable means of securing our leftist base and union support, it is little secret that Lovestone is highly ambitious, a view Lawrence Dennis' most recent report only reinforces. According to Dennis, Lovestone has been meeting with more military officials in recent days and even set up a private meeting with Earl Browder, which was clearly supposed to be a secret from us. While perhaps nothing to worry about as Lovestone may simply be playing games against his new rival Howard Scott or otherwise securing his position Dennis requests that we double down on aggressive espionage against Lovestone, although this carries the risk of turning him against us if discovered."

That he is fishing for a way to remove Lawrence Dennis' loyalists and insert his own is becoming obvious. While this is presented as a threat to Burnham as well it is possible that letting the two bicker will help keep either from getting too powerful, and even in the case of the coup succeeding, Lovestone could take Burnham's place as his right-hand man. Of course, the CSS report cautions against such notions, claiming that an outright coup against the Director himself is more likely. We could simply side with Dennis and stop Lovestone at once, demoting his newly forged CSS connections and replacing his union's leaders with our own, though this would be costly. What shall we do?"

With his location known to us, many within our administration have stressed the need to strike now and cut the head off of this snake once and for all.

The science team asks that, in exchange for asylum in this new nation, they shall continue their efforts under our new flag, eventually granting us whatever terrible devices they manage to think up and properly engineer. Though some within our nation have their doubts, viewing these new faces with suspicion and demanding that they simply return to civilian lives, Director in Chief Scott has been elated over the idea, and wishes to give Dr. Oppenheimer and his team a position within our government as they work to finish their device.

However, what should have been a simple, routine debriefing to an auditorium of his peers and political allies soon turned into an embarrassing fit as Scott fumbled over his words, stuttering and sweating like a nervous wreck. It would seem that despite his imposing, tall figure and boisterous, enigmatic personality, all of Scott’s charisma melted away before large crowds, and our beloved Director was reduced to a bright-red and sweaty, stuttering mess by the end of his speech. Met with concerned applause and murmurs that something might be wrong, Scott quickly bowed and left the stage before puking his lunch up in the backstage bathroom. Though he delivered the necessary info, the inability to speak to the masses is not a good look for a man trying to unite a continent, so the whole situation has been brushed under the rug and hidden from public attention. Perhaps we should hire a speech therapist."

Reduced to being a sweating, swaying fool just by having to speak in front of a few hundred of his peers, these doubters believe that Scott would collapse from the pressure of addressing the entire nation in person, and have instead pushed for Scott’s right hand man M. King Hubbert to be the new face of the nation. Though Scott would still lead the Council from behind the public curtain, Hubbert would be the shining, dashing face that would now rally our Technate towards cohesive and unified glory. Though this proposition has hurt Scott’s image, he is still a deeply respected figure, and many would still support him if he chose to refuse such a move. No matter what happens, Scott shall always be pulling the strings."

A self-avowed expert on engineering, science, and other rational philosophies, Scott has never been able to actually show physical proof of these accomplishments, leading to doubt among some of his loyalists in Technocracy Inc. With this doubt spreading, some decided to dig into Scott’s life, and found that although Scott did study and student-teach at Columbia University in New York City, there is no evidence that he ever graduated with any of the degrees he claims to have. \n\nAmbushing Scott during one of the Board’s routine meetings on energy accounting, these doubters attempted to reveal Scott’s apparent falsehoods, demanding to see his diplomas. However, the situation was diffused as M. King Hubbert - Scott’s right-hand man, lifelong friend, and Vice-Director in Chief of the Technate - defended his old colleague. Swearing that he studied and graduated alongside Scott decades ago, Hubbert - whose own academic achievements were well-known and easily verifiable - lambasted the doubters as charlatans and fools trying to make a power play. Hubbert even went so far as to quiz Scott on his knowledge in the field of Physics right there on the spot, and with Scott truly being a whizz at Physics despite the dubiousness of his claims, he was able to pass with flying colors, putting to rest any doubt over Scott’s expertise, at least for now."

With policies ensuring the protection of agrarian pursuits and the health of the biosphere, legislation cementing Socialist workers protections, benefits, and bargaining power, and rhetoric promoting unionism, democratic socialism on a local level, and other aspects of American Socialism into the foundation of our new Technate, we shall build a truly Socialist utopia that stands as a beacon of Leftist Unity to the wider world."

However, unlike ever before, these two have come to blows yet again, and the fate of the CCOT now hangs in the balance. Hemmy resists Loebs rapid approach to utopian reform, and seeks to further Loeb’s ideas in a more passive sense while taking a back seat to rulership himself to further delve into his own artistic and hedonistic pursuits, shifting more and more rule to the Technocratic Congress in his stead while he remains the face of the movement and while Loeb continues to run many things from the shadows.

csa.5181.d:0 "In this new America being forged by President Harold Loeb and his allies, democracy still rings true and free, but in an altered fashion. Government administrations all across the nation, from the smallest town and county governments to the Federal Government itself, have been reforged into their own democratically elected Technocratic councils. Local officials are directly nominated and vote on by individuals of that town or county, state councils are staffed by state-wide elections at the end of every term, and the two chambers of Congress, the House and the Senate, have been replaced by two large councils - one of STEM experts and one of more creative types - to serve as the guiding force and rotating legislature of the nation under the executive council made up of the President and their cabinet. \n\nThe notion of a career politician is dead, for councilmembers can only serve two terms, and are selected by their peers without the ability to make a career out of it, ensuring that serving as a representative is a service for your fellow man and not a pathway to corruption and self enrichment. The Escape has been a success, and Technocratic Utopian Democracy has been perfected, and America is now guided by an ever-rotating and directly-democratic hierarchy of experts and visionaries, ensuring that our pathway along the gold-gilded road to Utopia is smooth, fair, and egalitarian, all while being free of the corrupting forces and vices that tore down the former America that decayed before us."

With the success of our movement, many have begun to view the fires and horrors of the Second American Civil War and our following rise to power over the tyrants Burnham and Lovestone as this very Escape, for under Loeb’s guidance, we are now on the fast-track to egalitarian paradise. \n\nFor the general majority of the masses, this has just gone to prove Loeb, Hemingway, and their CCOT as sound leaders and visionaries, boosting our support and public opinion ratings across the nation. However, more diehard and zealous loyalists of Loeb have begun to regard him as a prophet and herald. Though Loeb has pushed back against these ideas, both secular and spiritual cults of personality have begun to pop up in aesthetically-charged cities and urban centers across America in small pockets of diehard fanatics, but they number in far too little numbers to be of any real effect. Regardless, Loeb’s popularity continues to skyrocket nationwide, so let us continue to ride the wave towards Utopia."

We have the means to be able to mold society to how we see fit, and we see it fit to let it evolve on its own like it was its own living and breathing organism undergoing mutation and transformation in accordance with the stimuli placed upon it by the needs, whims, and actions of the masses. \n\nThe Mysticism of Money has been uprooted, and Americans are now free of economic bondange to be able to devote their lives to other causes, and while other Revolutions have expended great effort and resources trying to dictate the lives of their masses, we shall let them live free as they choose to be, so long as they do not infringe upon the same rights all of us now share. Let them pray if they want to pray, or let them cast off religion if that is what they so choose. Let them create, and teach, and theorize; let them continue to evolve free of their former slavery. Our movement does not seek to dominate and dictate, but to free and to guide. We give our populace the tools to make their own amusement, and now they are finally free to do so.

The survivors now work throughout the new Technocratic councils across the nation, with many being within the Technocratic Congress’ two houses, or within the court system or other lower offices as elected by the people if deemed expert enough. However, one group - the Social Patriots - have put an emphasis on cooperation with our movement. Led by Norman Thomas, Meyer London, John Lewis, David Dubinsky, William Green, George Meany, Matthew Woll, Philip Murray, and others, the Social Patriots two factions work together to pursue American-style Socialist Democracy and Bellamy-inspired Realistic Utopianism, and many of their ideas mesh well with our own.

Bill Haywood accepted this offer and held an informal meeting with several trade union leaders prior. Haywood made it clear that the situation was dire, and the SPA would need to unite behind the IWW in order to survive the coming conflict. This silent agreement meant that the traditional SPA leadership would be reorganized along Industrial Unionist lines, with each union representative allowed a single vote.

Declaring that direct action against capitalist society was a vital necessity for all Americans and that the federal government's deadline must not only be ignored but defied. Telegrams from the Third International poured in to support Haywood's SPA, exciting the attendants. A vote was called to begin reforming the American capitalist economy into an anarcho-syndicalist economy. This referendum, signed by the attendants, declared the Federal Reserve null and void. The IWW was appointed the labor chamber for the new syndicalist government, and the selling of company shares was declared illegal.

In this delegation were reporters, who were allowed to watch congressmen carry safe boxes away for safekeeping in Chicago. These items are put under the trust of the IWW, who have elected Norman Thomas as their under-secretary.

From their constitutional convention, a new system has arisen, one centered around the principles of syndicalism and workers' democracy - biased as it may be, it's still democratic at its core, something which surprised many people expecting the revolution to inevitably collapse into tyranny. With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, a furious debate has broken out regarding the possibility of peaceful reunification. While our government is favorable to many of [CSA.GetNameDef]'s policies, they are also far more radical and will be negotiating from a position of strength - meaning we will be forced to accept many hard compromises. On the other hand, the [CSA.GetNameDef] has proven its resilience, with both the Federal Government and Huey Long's Union State crushed under their armies. Perhaps we should accept the inevitable and avoid more bloodshed before the victors turn their eyes towards California."

csa.165.t:0 "William Z. Foster Criticizes Election"
csa.165.d:0 "Clearly both sore and shocked by the victory of James Burnham, William Z. Foster has questioned the legitimacy of the election, wondering how a once-fringe figure within the CSA could come to prominence using legitimate means and if another election is in order. Thankfully due to the bad blood endured between him and Earl Browder near the end of the election he can not muster the political power to unite Vanguardists against Burnham. It's theorized that Foster's fears of the American Worker's Party are partly due to Jay Lovestone, who was forced out of his brief position as a leader of American Communists by Foster when he leveraged against Lovestone his early support for Leon Trotsky during the Russian Civil War and his attempts to mainstream American Communism among the public with his theory of 'American Exceptionalism'. Lovestone is one of the sub-leaders of the AWP ever since Burnham invited the "Lovestonites" into the Managerial fold. In return for promises of influence, Lovestone garnered whatever support he could among the garment unions for Burnham and gradually shifted his communism into Managerial-Communism, arguing it was compatible with his American Exceptionalism theory that American Capitalism was unique and had to be dealt with differently than in other nations. Foster had long thought his old rival was no longer a threat but now he is clearly nervous that is not just Browder he must keep an eye on."

He has proposed family units that operate more closely to traditional families by strengthening divorce laws and placing greater importance on them while also allowing "Social Unions" to exist where non-married people of draft age can legally "cohabitate" with married partners who are approved Party Members if they and their children are provided for. This can provide a compromise between more socially conservative socialists and radicals and will increase our birth rate after the Civil War depleted us of mainly fighting age men as well finding a possible solution to our male-female imbalance after the Civil War. However, it has come under attack by feminist activists as being both a cynical ploy by Burnham to placate the well-off and party loyalists by offering (largely) young women as "concubines" as the cost of turning back the clock on divorce laws pushed for by legislatures. Burnham has dismissed this as absurd but nonetheless considers having the CSS monitor those who accept 'co-habitation' to ensure abuses don't take place and requiring co-habitants to only be eligible if between 20 and 40 years old."

A gaunt and limping William Z.

As the traitors' names were read off they were walked out of Congress by armed guards. By the end of the speech most of the four-fifths of Congress that remained yelled 'Long Live the Revolution', clearly terrified.

Lovestone and angered AWP supporters want an example made and want to launch an all-out attack on the communes. Finally, while the Technocrats usually try to stay out of the political sphere in favor of economics they were clearly a bit disturbed by this suggestion and quietly stated they would simply have them pledge their allegiance to the new government and nationalize their industries but allow them to self-organize their hours and preferences.

In the aftermath of this release, the planned Women's Caucus was canceled, as the nation begins to debate the ethical application of women's liberation.

After all, the damage caused by the Founder experiencing a premature death would be irreversible to our young Republic. The simplest solution would be to lock down the White House although some say the location is still too vulnerable and conspicuous. An interesting proposal was to finish building Hearst Castle and move the President there as it would be nigh impossible to reach him although moving into the former estate of a capitalist would not make for a good appearance. A colonel proposed building a series of bunkers near Boulder Dam as finding him would be near-impossible though at the cost of being almost totally isolated from society. Finally, party member Ackerman proposed buying out the top twenty floors of the Empire State Building and keeping the Founder in a penthouse there, noting it would make it impossible to reach him or to know which floor he is on while also staying near a center of political power and reminding the citizenry of his presence."

While a man like Reagan would typically have either fled or spent the rest of his life hiding, his commitment to patriotic leftism and willingness to serve under the newly elected Chairman James Burnham gained him a place in, where he spent his days repaying his debt by serving as a radio broadcaster; relaying news and praises of the founder until eventually rising to the head of the FCC. Reagan’s commitment to Americanist Socialism, loyalty to Burnham, and personal similarities to Burnham have given him a prime position in Burnham's cabinet, serving as an important loyalist to the founder himself; a welcome juxtaposition the scheming loyalists to Scott and Lovestone ."

Along the way, Burnham has picked up two young loyalists who have grown close to him as a mentor and ideological teacher, and who help the President resist the influence of the ambitious Lovestone and the naive Technocrats, being the devoted Burnhamite Lyndon Hermyle LaRouche Jr. and the rehabilitated Federalist Progressive turned Conservative Progressive Burnhamite Ronald Wilson Reagan. While Reagan is known for his ‘neo-conservative’ Rightist Left-wing economic stances and Progressive social agenda fused with his Democratic Socialist and Technocratic-Burnhamist views, LaRouche is known for his more outlandish takes, such as the desire to build a bridge or tunnel across the Bering Strait, advocating for the Gold Standard, and for promoting Futurist socioeconomic and agrarian policies along with nuclear energy research, energy weapon research, and economic nationalization, to name a few things. However, he has also been plagued by accusations of racism, homophobia, conspiratorialism, xenophobia, and anti-semitism, among other ills that have ostracized him among some Socialist circles. Regardless, these two young politicians and intellectuals serve as the two possibilities of the Burnhamite future, and two of the likely futures for America."

csa.303.t:0 "Worker Takeover"
csa.303.d:0 "Workers must finish taking the means of production nationwide! The only question is outside of the syndicalist strongholds, how? Three plans have been put forward; the CIO and Centrist Faction would like for organizing leaders of the Combined Syndicates to more directly aid the workers by organizing the means of production along industrial lines while encouraging a worker takeover so that the economy is structured on a more "functional" national level. The mainstream of the IWW is even more traditionalist bottom-up, however, wanting for IWW to simply expand its recruitment, spread propaganda, and allowing radical unions to self-organize while being protected by the Red Militias. The Ultra-Left meanwhile views both plans as folly and instead of taking over along industrial lines thinks each municipality should decide how to restructure its own means of production along localist lines while encouraging Red Guards to aid in this mission. Which shall we do?"

csa.304.t:0 "General Defence Committee"
csa.304.d:0 "That reactionaries desire to overthrow the revolution is undeniable, but how much power the congress should have in combatting them is another question. While the Centrist Faction would like to have a General Defence Committee made up of elected military leaders and selected national industrial representatives both the orthodox syndicalists and the Ultra-Left have criticized this for being too secretive. However while the IWW syndicalists would like for the General Defence Committee to be made up of more union representatives with regular public debriefings of their activities the Ultra-Left believe both models are too authoritarian and instead the GDC should be little more than a meeting body of rebels and activists who want to be involved in anti-reactionary activity, with full transparency to those who vote for them. Likewise, attending or even being held to the "standards" of the GDC would be far more voluntary."
csa.304.a:0 "The IWW's GDC is best"

csa.304.c:0 "The Radical's GDC is most revolutionary"

csa.305.t:0 "Militia Organization"
csa.305.d:0 "It is urgent we set a clear political model for our military! The Centrists and Smedley Butler have pushed for a 'Republican' Militia that is essentially modeled after a more traditional military but with more democratic checks, such as officers needing to be elected among militants and the same applying to terms served by Generals, with the militias being basically auxiliary forces for the army. The IWW believes this is too traditional however and favors a more democratic model in which the military is even more democratic, with so-called "Generals" only serving for as long they are popularly recognized as such and being recallable by a general vote. On the ground level, the same would apply to soldiers and most military actions would be settled by a popular decision of the units rather than officers, with officers being little more than temporarily elected to administrative duties. Finally, the Ultra-Left dislikes the idea of a national military on even such a level, with the new Red Army being made up of voluntary militias from across the nation that self-organize and only voluntarily recognizes commanders, with the new national military essentially being made up of coordination between them. Which shall it be?"

csa.306.t:0 "Worker's Self-Management"
csa.306.d:0 "With Workers taking over the means of production nationwide it is time to decide how the means of production will be organized. With regards to the economic sphere, the CIO and IWW plan is fairly similar with regards to local councils of workers making up syndicates and electing union representatives to the national level. However, the CIO wants the national level of the unions, the federations, to better organize the syndicates whereas the IWW would prefer to emphasize the inherent powers of the syndicates and leave the federation in a looser form. Of course, the Ultra-Left would prefer to allow the workers of each municipality to own the means of production in their own fashion, which would place more emphasis on organizing along local lines than industrial ones. Which should we tell the Red Militias and workers to emphasize?"

csa.307.t:0 "Industrial Democracy"
csa.307.d:0 "We must decide on a system of democratic organization! The American Labor Union, CIO, and other Centrist Faction members want for a more direct relationship between the workers and their union representative with the workers' approval to represent the worker on a national level for issues deemed nationally important such as relating to free speech, media and Judicial appointments with other issues being settled by direct democracy along industrial lines. In the CIO model, these judicial appointments would largely relate to constitutional cases with this new supreme court of 5 would be slightly insulated from public opinion by serving terms instead of being recallable, serving six years before needing to be re-elected. However, the IWW has called this 'nationalistic' and a step backward and believes that workers' direct democracy should settle nearly all local issues and most national ones, with representatives there largely to help with administrative duties and negotiations. Meanwhile, each group of industrial unions would decide which organizations or actions are dangerously reactionary or not amongst themselves, with national laws being settled by direct democracy, any judges used being instantly recallable and the constitution easier to reform. As per usual the Ultra-Left believes all forms of organization should be settled locally and through direct democracy, with aid from their local Red Guard to protect them from reactionaries. As such, they oppose the establishment of any national-level Court, with smaller Federation Courts being made up communes that voluntarily join."

### AFL Leadership ###

csa.325.t:0 "AFL Leadership contest!"
csa.325.d:0 "The AFL has come out on top and now must appoint someone to the Presidency of the Combined Syndicates of America. AFL leaders William Green and John Lewis are the leading candidates, but only one can come out on top, with Lewis being more experienced and popular but also more controversial in his bombastic personality, especially due to his involvement in founding the CIO that is now considered generally more radical than him and lead him to merge part of the CIO into the AFL."

csa.326.t:0 "Radical Riots!"
csa.326.d:0 "The social radicals in the TUUL, chunks of the IWW, and anarchist associations are rioting in the streets in response to our recent policies. With Chicago and Detroit hit particularly hard, most in the cabinet want to send in the military rather than waiting for it to settle down or local authorities to step in."
csa.326.a:0 "Send the army"
csa.326.b:0 "Wait it out"

csa.327.t:0 "Absorbing the CIO"
csa.327.d:0 "The AFL and CIO have had a shaky relationship for years, with Lewis temporarily leading a merger of the organization. Ultimately, however, the CIO decided to lean towards something closer to De Leonism, whereas Lewis and the AFL preferred Social Capitalism dominated by Unions. With our electoral success, we could make some attempts to merge with the CIO, co-opting their support in the process and gaining us much-needed syndicalist support."
csa.327.a:0 "Negotiate with the CIO"
csa.327.b:0 "We don't need them"

csa.3270.t:0 "AWP offers support"
csa.3270.d:0 "The technocratic American Worker's Party is offering to support us in return for their technocrats gaining prominent positions in the economy and their militia leaders gaining more army prominence, with James Burnham stating that it would mutually beneficial. While this would give them more of a platform it would prove useful."
csa.3270.a:0 "Accept"
csa.3270.b:0 "I don't think so"

csa.328.t:0 "Fist Fight in Congress!"
csa.328.d:0 "A fistfight broke out in Congress today between AFL leader John Lewis and union boss Alexander Howat, a known communist. The disagreement was over the AFL"s embrace of welfare capitalism and 'reactionary' social policies, which devolved into a straight fistfight before the two were pulled apart. While arguments are common in Congress most were caught off guard although it oddly has made Lewis more popular among the rank-and-file who view him as a powerful leader. Of course, the radicals are furious."
csa.328.a:0 "interesting"

csa.329.t:0 "Black Support Offered"
csa.329.d:0 "While ostensibly devoted to egalitarianism many local AFL leaders are reluctant to allow Black union members in at the same rate as white workers or to internally promote them. As a result, Black Congressional and Union leaders have offered additional support for the AFL if we do a crackdown on this favoritism and push for heavier Black representation in the AFL."
csa.329.a:0 "Take their offer"
csa.329.b:0 "Decline"

### Independence League Leadership ###

csa.330.t:0 "Independence League Leadership Contest!"

csa.331.t:0 "Incorporating the AFL"
csa.331.d:0 "Our reorganization of the unions into National Guilds requires the incorporation of the AFL, our allies in the Social Patriot faction. As we organize major Departments, sometimes referred to as Guilds when referring to the workers exclusively, we could make them the controlling faction of the Craftsmen Guild, having sub-bureau's answer to them so long as they respect the new laws. Others consider this favoritism however and think they should still have to merge with other crafts unions before settling Department rules and leadership."
csa.331.a:0 "Give them an edge"
csa.331.b:0 "We must be impartial"

csa.332.t:0 "Nationalist Club Growth"
csa.332.d:0 "Throughout the country Nationalist Clubs in the ilk of the old Bellamyist ones are being created but as opposed to simply supporting the already state-ideology of Bellaymism they are hosting artistic and spiritual endeavors as well, viewing it as the highest form of being as is consistent with Bellamyist manifestos. This is a success although it appears more popular to higher-ranking members of the Industrial Army, leading to proposals to have them host more community events as well although this would dilute their current focus."
csa.332.a:0 "They are fine as is"
csa.332.b:0 "They should have broader appeal"

csa.333.t:0 "Economic Planning"
csa.333.d:0 "Our planned economy needs a goal to work towards to unite the nation, leaving two broad options, to focus on agricultural development or industrial development. The National Clubs and Independence League is split on the issue, with some approving of a focus on agriculture due to associating it with Jeffersonian freedom and naturalism while the more orthodox socialist elements would rather we prioritize industrialization."

csa.333.b:0 "Focus on Agriculture"
csa.333.c:0 "Divide between Both"

csa.334.t:0 "Great Departments Organized"
csa.334.d:0 "With the Guilds and Distributive and Productive Departments being created, ten Great Departments representing allied industries have been organized using our economies of scale, allowing us to more efficiently produce goods. It is illegal for any Department to illegalize a creation of a good that is in low-demand although they are allowed to raise the price correspondingly if it is costly to design, so long as the consumer is willing to pay for it. Each Department is headed by a Lieutenant General, elected by senior and retired guild members."
csa.334.a:0 "About time"

csa.335.t:0 "Clubhouses built"
csa.335.d:0 "Each of the Guilds is being tasked with building 'Clubhouses', namely clubhouses in which comfort and luxury are the focus and can be enjoyed in the social sphere for a limited amount of time. Likewise, vacation homes are being built which can be used by workers in the same rotation manner if they desire it. Of course, while Bellaymist manifestos suggest that the public should all enjoy the clubhouses equally this makes it a bit more difficult to organize and limit individual use, leading to suggestions that each Guild should control and manage different Clubhouses and Social Sphere benefits, with the central government only managing a certain amount itself for those falling under the unclassified grade of the industrial army and others who prefer it."
csa.335.a:0 "No, they are held in absolute common"
csa.335.b:0 "Break up management by Guild"

csa.336.t:0 "General-in-Chief Position Created"
csa.336.d:0 "The General-In-Chief position represents the elected leader of the nation and of the Guilds, and the only member of the nation higher ranking than the Lieutenant Generals of the Ten Great Departments and elected amongst them. To prevent corruption of course they can not elect one another, however, at least not unless they have been retired for at least five years. The issue is that our system is so new that we have no retired Lieutenant Generals or even many other higher ranking retirees so two suggestions have come forward, one being to simply shift the current President of the United States into this position since it is merging the positions into one anyways. The other would be to elect Nationalist war hero Smedley Butler, quite fitting since the Industrial Armies organization is heavily inspired by the militaries."
csa.336.a:0 "Keep the current President"
csa.336.b:0 "Elect Butler"

csa.337.t:0 "Appeasing the IWW"
csa.337.d:0 "While the IWW has been partially appeased by the fact that anarchist and syndicalist communes are allowed to operate outside the Guildist System, there is still some bad blood for those syndicalists who would rather the government pushed for worldwide revolution or punishment of capitalists and managers instead of their recruitment into the Industrial Army when willing and applicable. As such, we could simply offer for the IWW to make up the initial core of one of the new Industrial Guilds, recruiting the remaining bulk of their membership in the process, and even have the potential of bringing more communes in the mix. Of course, this would increase their influence as well."
csa.337.a:0 "No, treat them the same"
csa.337.b:0 "Yes, a practical compromise"

csa.338.t:0 "Collectivist Cells Attack!"
csa.338.d:0 "The Collectivist Cells are utterly disgusted by the government's gradual transformation of the nation into a National Guildist system, something they call faux-socialism and utterly reactionary. As such, with our control over Public Service Stores, Land and Production they are losing members and influence to us and have responded in kind with attacking our recruiters and local Service Stores with assassinations and bombings, a terror campaign that has only increased in recent days. They say that if we continue to try to expand over them, they will annihilate us. We could use the military to break them, or simply work around them and hope that by controlling all nearby resources they will have to bend the knee eventually. What shall we do?"
csa.338.a:0 "Destroy them"
csa.338.b:0 "Work Around them"

csa.339.t:0 "Collectivist Cells Destroyed!"
csa.339.d:0 "While the battles were bloody the Collectivist militias have been destroyed, with the leaders William Z. Foster, Eugene Dennis, and Jack Shulman going into exile in the process while being wanted. This has broken their influence and expanded our own although it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of our more pacifistic members. Meanwhile, the AFL seems ecstatic at the news and has warmed up to us as a result."
csa.339.a:0 "Had to happen"

csa.340.t:0 "Public Service Stores"
csa.340.d:0 "With our creation of distribution and production internally controlled by the government, Public Service Stores modeled on old army public service stores have been created to sell goods the government has purchased. While we hope they will eventually be organized into the massive public markets described by Bellamy, in the short term it increases our influence as only those who work for the National Guilds in some capacity are eligible, which will hopefully soon include the entire population. Although there is no requirement to join, the security and lack of alternatives we offer are simply too tempting to pass up, especially in the aftermath of the Civil War."
csa.340.a:0 "Very well"

csa.341.t:0 "The Nationalization of Land"
csa.341.d:0 "At long last, the vast majority of farmers have come under the control of the National Guilds and the Department of Agriculture can finally be created out of the various unions making it up. Farmers simply have few alternatives to our system if they wish to buy and produce goods, and already even syndicalist-leaning farm unions are agreeing to the system. However, some holdouts who wish to avoid our system of government, including hermits in the woods, exist, although it would be difficult for them to resist for long. We may even pressure them to join by specifically grabbing all territory around them as soon as possible."
csa.341.a:0 "Pressure the Remainders"
csa.341.b:0 "They will join eventually"


### Fosterism Events ###
csa.400.t:0 "Gathering the Land"
csa.400.d:0 "Currently we are gathering the land needed for collectivization from our fallen foes, the bourgeoisie, and reactionaries, as well as those believers who are registering their land for the greater good. However, there is still land needed from those who occupy an ambiguous position, either as nominal socialist supporters or those small and medium-sized farmers who were politically neutral. Two positions have been forwarded to gather their land: one is that put forward by many relative 'pragmatists' in the TUUL, especially surviving orthodox syndicalists, has been to raise the government's purchasing price in order to entice more sales. However for hardliners this is a repulsive position, as they believe the common farmer should not be exempt from the sacrifices others are required to make, that collectivization is a moral good and by avoiding collectivization they are placing their own needs above the people's, and therefor supporting forced collectivization over rewarding what they view as anti-social behavior."
csa.400.a:0 "Collectivize it now"
csa.400.b:0 "Raise the purchasing price"

csa.401.t:0 "Production Debate"
csa.401.d:0 "As we must produce a large number of agricultural goods to support the revolution, we are once again left with a debate on how to go about it. While some want experts such as mathematicians and economists to be placed in charge of managing production, loyal TUUL members insist they should be rewarded for their loyalty to these positions. Furthermore, they claim these technocrats are ideologically untrustworthy and that they can produce more than they can. While appointing them would leave Foster with more influence it's unclear if they're telling the truth."
csa.401.a:0 "Appoint technical experts"
csa.401.b:0 "Appoint TUUL hardliners"

csa.402.t:0 "Export Debate"
csa.402.d:0 "There is a debate within our government over exporting food from the states to nations that support socialism, especially within the Internationale. Foster's traditional supporters desire for the food to be sent to the Internationale at once to support international socialism against imperialism and believe their shortages can be alleviated by our aid. Of course many even within the TUUL are nervous about this and believe we should focus internally, stating that the food consumption required for rebuilding the states means we can not afford to do this. Of course, this sentiment has been accused of being reactionary and thinking in terms of nationalism instead of international struggle but even some of Foster's advisors would like for him to consider it."
csa.402.a:0 "Export it"
csa.402.b:0 "We can't afford it"

csa.403.t:0 "Anger over TUUL Expansion"
csa.403.d:0 "Us ending dual unionism has proven to be an unpopular policy despite our promises to let the IWW continue their normal processes under the TUUL umbrella, although they still register nonetheless. Even our own ultra-radical allies dislike the policy and some communes are refusing to be integrated. Perhaps in the short-term we should allow the communes to go about their business and just gradually pressure them to integrate later?"
csa.403.a:0 "We can be patient"

csa.404.t:0 "A needed sacrifice"

csa.405.t:0 "Food Shortage"
csa.405.d:0 "As farmers attempt to destroy their own goods to avoid our collectivization policies, our enemies claim that our policies have left America with a food shortage. While we should bounce back shortly, there is no doubt some damage has been done."
csa.405.a:0 "Damn!"

csa.406.t:0 "American Famine!"
csa.406.d:0 "A so-called 'American Famine' has begun, with farmers burning or abandoning their crops in the face of forced collectivization and party members over-reporting and stockpiling our resources for political points, which were then sent abroad to the cause. As such, many are calling for the TUUL to end their policies, and Foster's vision of America is under serious assault from political opponents."
csa.406.a:0 "Unfortunate"

csa.407.t:0 "Browderist-Fordist Line Destroyed!"
csa.407.d:0 "With our policy of removing reactionary influences repressing minority communities from within, the Browderist-Fordist line has been hunted down and executed. Named for Browder's ally in the black community James W. Ford, they were found guilty of social capitalist influences although James W. Ford remains alive and out of reach. This has managed to silence many remaining Browderists."
csa.407.a:0 "Good"

csa.408.t:0 "Under the Table deals"
csa.408.d:0 "With our advent of the total planned economy, party officials in different regions have reported an increasing tendency of workers to deal 'Under the table'. Examples include workers purchasing excess lumber from farmhouses using either existing goods or our monetary currency. Given that this robs the central planners of potential resources and reinforces the very extortionist capitalist pricing system that allows extraction of profit from surplus labor and extortion this is unacceptable and party officials are wondering how to respond, with potential policies ranging from death for engagement in 'minor capitalism' to political rehabilitation via pressure and confessions, alongside some fees."

Further, professors who insist on teaching Darwinian evolution are being attacked by some youth wings for teaching a 'reactionary' ideology that opposes collective cooperation and has reinforced racism. As such some in the cabinet such as Eugene Dennis are requesting we try to calm them down from such excesses, although others think that such extremes in the short-term could result in a quicker path to a truly revolutionary culture."

csa.410.t:0 "IWW Liquidations"
csa.410.d:0 "As the IWW Centrist Faction is increasingly liquidated we have to settle the issue of the anarchists and Orthodox syndicalists, some of whom have also been liquidated for counter-revolutionary tendencies. Some believe we should simply finish off the remaining members of Congress who have not fully jumped ship to the TUUL while others view the more radical anarchists and syndicalists as still supportive."

csa.411.a:0 "Excellent"

csa.412.t:0 "Worker uniformity"
csa.412.d:0 "With the TUUL dominant all workers are now required to join the TUUL so that they can be represented fairly and so they more easily contribute to the common good. This will massively aid our census data and make coordination much simpler. However, an argument has flown up about whether they should be registered to the central TUUL only or to their sub-regional TUUL, giving local union bosses more power. While so far the TUUL has been relatively decentralized in its political organization there is an argument to be made that this is an opportunity to take some control out of their hands."

csa.414.t:0 "AFL Purged"
csa.414.d:0 "At long last the so-called Social Patriots, the AFL, and the Independence League, are being purged as the treacherous and social capitalist Klan sympathizers in their faction are being arrested. John Dewey, Jack Reed, and William Green are amongst the most recent names put to a public trial in which spectators watched as they were denounced for collaboration with capitalist powers. Remaining members are either in exile or attempting to join the TUUL to show their loyalty to the new order, attempting to join our National Textile Workers Union and Metal Workers Industrial Union in particular."

csa.415.d:0 "While reactionaries are being purged across the nation, the Klan bases of South Carolina and Indiana are being hit particularly hard, with anyone affiliated with the organization being either executed or arrested. Our Southern organizational leaders however believe we should slow down on attacking family members of the Klan members who can't be outright proven to be members or supporters, thinking the purge would be so large it would damage the economy, although hardliners want to keep it up. A middle-ground option would be to take their children away from them to avoid potential reactionary indoctrination while keeping those we aren't certain of alive for now."

csa.415.c:0 "The Middle ground option"

csa.416.t:0 "SPA dissolved"
csa.416.d:0 "While his election meant that Foster was essentially the figurehead of the SPA and the CSA, he has always been an outsider to the organization as he is reliant on the TUUL for support and criticizes party politics factionalism. As such, the SPA has been formally dissolved and replaced with wings of the TUUL where applicable, with those not replaced being for all purposes politically purged."
csa.416.a:0 "Excellent"

csa.417.t:0 "Class Traitors arrested"
csa.417.d:0 "There are members of the middle-class who were not bourgeoise but decided to work for them against the worker, then later attempted to side with the social patriots. As such, the TUUL Red Militias have undertaken a class traitor initiative, targetting largely members of the middle-class and some socially conservative workers who supported the social patriots. However as well still need them for potential labor perhaps we should sentence the lesser offenders to imprisonment as opposed to execution."

csa.418.t:0 "Removing Distinctions"
csa.418.d:0 "As a consistent follower of the Marxian communist ethos, Foster has denounced differences between rural and urban regions. He has considered them backward distinctions used by members of the middle and upper class to isolate themselves from rural people or cramp workers in small areas in cities, separating their shared class consciences in the process. As such he wants to go forward with his plan to destroy the distinction between the two, relocating workers to more spacious regions and building into rural areas to avoid urban sprawl.  His cabinet is reluctant to endorse the position, however, claiming it would be costly."

csa.419.t:0 "Foster's call to foreign workers"
csa.419.d:0 "William Z. Foster has called on foreign workers to rise up against their masters if possible and, if not, to cease reproducing and passively destroy industrial equipment to bleed the capitalists of their economic power. The speech was heard by very few in foreign nations of course due to censorship, outside of militant left cells, although while it invigorated hardliners at home it was also found to be 'bizarre' by others, albeit rarely said aloud."

csa.420.d:0 "With pointless and unhealthy capitalist consumerism and junk being removed en masse, our local union heads are increasingly pushing for fitness in order to have a maximally fit nation that can battle capitalist armies and have a healthy workforce. An issue has arisen over our Tobacco Workers Industrial Union, however, as this is at odds with their interests and the more martial of our supporters such as Shulman would have us outlaw tobacco for non-medicinal reasons and retrain or move these workers into new industries."
csa.420.a:0 "Retrain them"
csa.420.b:0 "Tobacco will be tolerated"

### Browder Events ###

csa.430.t:0 "Radio Chats"
csa.430.d:0 "With the cultivation of socialist media, we are enjoying an increased radio presence in the homes of average Americans. With this, it has been suggested that Browder should give more personalized speeches to the people via radio in what Party members are jokingly referring to as 'The Browder Hour'. This would have to be used sparingly so that it is not taken for granted but if used properly would be effective in gaining support."
csa.430.a:0 "Very well"
csa.430.b:0 "No, scarce appearances are better"

csa.431.t:0 "Dealing with Burnham"
csa.431.d:0 "Leader of the AFP James Burnham has had a mixed-relationship with Browder, flipping between working with him while praising his Americanist Socialism and criticizing him for being unrealistic, vague, and inconsistent. However, even the American Worker's Party has taken note of the SPA Centralists' victory and many are defecting, though some increasingly nervous AWP members remain under Burnham. Shall we recruit Burnham's AWP and their technocrats and pressure them into joining in return for political clout or simply purge their leadership and force the remainders into joining?"
csa.431.a:0 "Recruit Burnham"
csa.431.b:0 "Purge them"

csa.432.t:0 "Standard Oil Managers?"
csa.432.d:0 "With the West under our control we have captured many of the oligarchs who formally ran the territory. While many of the top members of the PSA leadership are being purged, some of the managers for Standard Oil could be potentially useful in helping us manage the now nationalized western oil reserves. Of course, their loyalty is questionable. What shall we do?"
csa.432.a:0 "Use them"
csa.432.b:0 "Purge them"

csa.433.t:0 "Jack Shulman Dead!"
csa.433.d:0 "Foster's top man in the military, Jack Shulman, has been found guilty of conspiring against the state and alongside his inner circle has been sentenced to death. Decrying Browderism as 'ahistorical reaction' Shulman cursed the court that judged him before he and his cohorts were shot today."
csa.433.a:0 "Great!"

csa.434.t:0 "Fate of the IWW"
csa.434.d:0 "The IWW has been gutted of its most ardent anti-Browderist activists, with Elizabeth Nord and Dorothy Day being forced to retire and many IWW anarchists being arrested, including Emma Goldman's circle. Now of course a new leader must be decided with the shell IWW officially being under the SPA umbrella and many workers have already defected from the organization into the SPA, with Robert Minor being a potentially workable syndicalist who is friendly to Browderism or Gus Hall if we wish to use a more hardline but inexperienced loyalist."
csa.434.a:0 "Gus Hall"
csa.434.b:0 "Robert Minor"

csa.435.t:0 "Wage Setting"
csa.435.d:0 "While we allow workers to engage in some monetary trade and wage-setting with one another, at least in the small and some medium-scale workers industries, the amount of autonomy they should have is still heavily debated by the SPA cabinet. Some believe we should only allow them to set a very limited amount of room to set wage differences while others believe in allowing relatively more wage autonomy so long as they do not attempt to own private property, accumulate too much wealth, or question larger industries. What should be the default?"
csa.435.a:0 "Greater Autonomy"
csa.435.b:0 "Limited Autonomy"

csa.436.t:0 "Competing Funding"
csa.436.d:0 "With all of Popular Front and its various interest groups now needing to answer the SPA Centralists and, more particularly, Browder, it appears there is some competition for funding between the various Farmer's Union now organized under the Socialist Party Farmer's Union and the Industrial Industries. While some SPA operatives view the former as more fundamental to an independent economy and that we have and are going to spend enough time on industry we should divert more funds to Farmers, while many others in the Browder circle argue industry is too fundamental to divert funds from even now."
csa.436.a:0 "Pay off the Farmers Unions"
csa.436.b:0 "Focus on Industry"

csa.437.t:0 "President Empowered"
csa.437.d:0 "With the victory of the SPA Centralists, they have accumulated enough support from Centrist, Orthodox, and national syndicalists to pass Executive Empowerment, which coincided with Fosterists being increasingly displaced from positions of power and increased street brawls between pro-government factions and the anarchists and Collectivists. With the Executive Empowerment Act, Browder now has the position of both Chairman of the SPA and the President, with both positions being embodied by a single individual and greater power being given over economic affairs and the right of the President to order arrests. Supports are hopeful this will create stability while opponents are angered at this 'authoritarianism'."
csa.437.a:0 "A Step Forward"

csa.438.t:0 "Anarchists Angered!"
csa.438.d:0 "The Anarchist factions of Congress, particularly the Goldmanites and various societies, have become increasingly angered by Browder's behavior and policies and are now refusing to pay manpower and other forms of aid from the communes while continuously blocking our acts. With the anarchists organizing protest marches against our policies, shall we try to sabotage them with the aid of the Socialist Party Centralist intelligence leader John Abt?"
csa.438.a:0 "Not yet"
csa.438.b:0 "Yes, counter-intelligence"
csa.438.c:0 "Break up protests"

csa.439.t:0 "Chicago Brawl!"
csa.439.d:0 "Anarchists marching on Chicago got into a brawl with the Red Guards and Army under our control today. While a bloody disaster in the short-term it has given us an excuse to arrest an array of our critics who can be blamed for inciting the riot, although our critics in Congress are now causing an even larger headache than before."
csa.439.a:0 "Good and Bad"

csa.440.t:0 "Surveillance Created"
csa.440.d:0 "With our enemies being purged many are still suspicious of Congress's remaining members despite them now being wholly under the thumb of the Centralists. Gil Green has been assigned to plant bugs in the phones of Congressmen and to have them monitored by the newly formalized Socialist Party Security Section made up of John Apt's intelligence wing of the faction, relaying all information directly to Browder. As such we have the means to arrest any members who are attempting a coup."
csa.440.a:0 "Excellent"

csa.441.t:0 "Accusations of Social Capitalism"
csa.441.d:0 "Our recent policies have been met with the accusation of 'Social Capitalism' by the Collectivists, anarchists and even some syndicalists who are attempting to block our bills, with Eugene Dennis, in particular, calling us 'traitors of the highest sort'. As such we are losing some public support even as we gain members of the middle-class to our cause."
csa.441.a:0 "Damn"

csa.442.t:0 "Farmer's Union"
csa.442.d:0 "With our recent foray into agriculture, we have increased control over the various farmers' unions, with unregistered farmers needing to sign up for the Social Party Farmer's Union. As the Union is now the largest in agriculture we are moving for all agricultural unions to be subsumed into the group, either directly or as a subgroup. Competition is fierce for leadership of the group with the competition being between our loyalist William Schneiderman and Bernard Ades who is more acceptable to orthodox syndicalists."
csa.442.a:0 "Schneiderman"
csa.442.b:0 "Ades"

csa.443.t:0 "The National Parks?"
csa.443.d:0 "The National Parks of the United States were essentially nature reserves but now we must decide what to do with them, with the centrally-controlled economy having proponents who think that the forests can be put to use in industrializing the country. However, this would lose us some moderate support."
csa.443.a:0 "Use the Parks"
csa.443.b:0 "Maintain the Parks"

csa.444.t:0 "Black Market Opens"
csa.444.d:0 "While we have accepted compromises on the economy this has left us with a small problem of too much economic activity to keep track of on a small scale. As such a small black market has opened to gain goods that are not taxed or restricted by the central government, egged on by former gangsters in our territory such as the Five Families. As such, the Party and our militias are preparing a mass purge of these gangs with Browder's permission."
csa.444.a:0 "Signed"

csa.445.t:0 "Funneling Funds"
csa.445.d:0 "A large number of funds have been diverted by the Centralist Faction to appease allies such as James W. Ford and Centrist Syndicalists who jumped ranks. While we have turned a blind eye to this it is becoming increasingly costly, leading to a suggestion from Gus Hall to purge the widely hated and famously opportunistic H. M. Wicks and his faction of Oregon Socialists so that we no longer need to make payouts to them while also creating an example that will allow us to not be openly questioned if we lower funds for another faction."
csa.445.a:0 "No, the payouts are worth it"
csa.445.b:0 "Purge Wicks and lower funds"

csa.446.t:0 "Universal SPA Membership"
csa.446.d:0 "SPA membership has become nearly universal as virtually all workers and citizens are provided for in some capacity, our economy experiences stable and popular growth, and our only true foes have been gutted creating a stable environment in which the SPA is truly dominant. As such the AFL and Independent League members are being pressured to resign or join the SPA, and virtually all workers are members. To finish the job there is a proposal by Browder's right-hand man Gus Hall to make all Americans official members of the SPA and (now officially) subject to its regulations."
csa.446.a:0 "Approved"
csa.446.b:0 "No, slow but steady expansion"

csa.447.t:0 "Communes Annexed"
csa.447.d:0 "The communes that have refused to pay tribute to Browder have been annexed at long last thanks to the efforts of the Red Army despite the outcries of anarchists, which thankfully gave us an excuse to arrest some anarchist militants and weaken the anarchists in Congress. However, those communes that did not refuse to stop being allies have requested they still be allowed to operate independently although hardliners would like to 'offer' them annexation as well, with the difference we would pardon those that agree of any crimes they may have committed as opposed to the oppositional commune militants."
csa.447.a:0 "Annex Them"
csa.447.b:0 "Allow Autonomy"

Found slumped over on the floor of his study, piss running down his leg and hand on his chest, it is assumed Burnham had a heart attack while smoking a cigar and drinking brandy as he was listening to a newly pressed recording of the Glenn Miller Orchestra. How the two guards stationed outside his room did not hear the commotion of his death, it is not known, though many suspect they simply feared to disturb the President on penalty of punishment. The suddenness of his passing has aroused some suspicion among Party officials, with some whispering that he may have been poisoned by a would-be successor, but any talk of this is quickly hushed as lies under penalty of arrest or death. \n\nWith the passing of Burnham, a new titan must rise to take his place, someone trusted by the former President and intune with his vision for America. The main candidates, and the pair some suspect may have been behind Burham’s possibly early passing, are Jay Lovestone, a committed Communist who seeks to sideline Technocratic power in order to build his own Market Socialist Communist State based around his position and the concept of Socialism in One Nation, and his rival James P. Cannon, devoted International Communist and former ally of the disgraced Trotsky. The main opposition to this titan of American Leftism are the rehabilitated Ronald Reagan and Bunrham’s own student Lyndon LaRouche - two young proteges of the late Burnham, representing two halves of the late President’s political identity. LaRouche, a young firebrand that believes in an odd fusion of Leftist Technocracy and National Socialism mixed with some Far-Right views and prejudices, represents the core loyalists of Burnham, and promises to honor Burnham’s vision for the nation. Reagan, the moderate young politician, navy man, and actor, is a rehabilitated former Federalist that has since fallen in line with our national doctrine and who fell under the wing of Burnham. He represents the de-radicalizing, Conservative, and socioeconomically Progressive ideas Burnham began to drift towards in his later years, standing as the herald of new Burnham thought. Only one can rise to lead however, so who shall succeed the great President Burnham?"

CSA_SMEDLEY_BUTLER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 30, 1881, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W In 1898 'The Fighting Quaker' Smedley Darlington Butler lied about his age and enlisted in the Marine Corps to join the American force in the Spanish-American war. Due to his high education level, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and would be transferred to the recently captured Guantanamo following basic training. He didn't manage to see combat as his company would soon return to the US, where he was reassigned to the USS New York, becoming a first lieutenant in April 1899.\n\nHe was later transferred to the Philippines, where he mainly did garrison duty, although he took part in some engagements against the Insurrectos. In 1900, he'd accompany Littleton Walker during the Boxer Rebellion, taking part in the Battle of Tianjin and the Gaselee Expedition, being wounded in the thigh while trying to rescue a fellow marine, for which he earned a brevet promotion to captain.\n\nAfterwards, Butler would take part in the Banana Wars, first in Honduras to defend the American consulate in 1903 and then in Nicaragua between 1909 and 1913, where he took part in breaking the siege of Granada, in the battle of Masaya, and the capture of Coyote Hill. He took part in the occupation of Veracruz in Mexico in 1914, earning his first Medal of Honor in combat and was promoted to Major. He'd be transferred to Haiti, where he earned his second Medal of Honor for fighting the Caco rebellion. He'd be transferred back to the United States, where he served garrison duties until being promoted to Brigadier General in 1921. In 1927 he was sent to China to take charge of the Marine Expeditionary Force in the Legation Cities, earning his promotion to Major General, returning to America in 1929, and then competing and winning the role of Commandant of the USMC in 1931. He earned the rank of General in 1935, amidst the rising tension in the Hoover administration. When the situation started to deteriorate, Butler decided to resign from his post and presented his services to the Socialist Party, becoming the highest-ranking military official to join the Red Guard and earning the rank of Field Marshal."
CSA_EVANS_CARLSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 26, 1896, in Sidney, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a Congregationalist minister, Evans Carlson began his military career in 1912 when he left High School and signed up for the US Army as a private, serving in the Philippines and Hawaii, and finishing his four years of service in 1916 as a Sargeant. He then rejoined the Army right during the start of the Punitive Expedition where he took up a garrison job in Mexico. He then signed up for an officers' course, from where he graduated as a Second Lieutenant in 1917, and even did a short term in the Artillery Corps, becoming an Artillery Captain in 1918. However, he was unsatisfied with his army positions, so he signed up in the Marine Corps in 1922 as a private, regardless of his previous postings. He was quickly promoted to Second Lieutenant and served in a Marine outpost in Quantico, Virginia. He then sailed towards Culebra, Puerto Rico, in 1924 and remained there five months before being ordered to the West Coast for duty with the Pacific Fleet. Applying for aviation training in 1925, he went to Pensacola, Florida, for instruction, but subsequently returned to duty with ground units. He served another tour of foreign shore duty from 1927 to 1929 in Shanghai, China. He later returned to America and was quickly sent to Nicaragua to fight against Sandino's insurgency, earning a navy cross after facing around 100 rebels with just 12 marines. He also received a commendation after the 1931 earthquake and for his work as Chief of Police of Occupied Nicaragua. He returned to the US in 1933 and was sent to Shanghai, to the Marine Detachment in the American Legation in the Legation Cities, serving as Adjutant and studying Chinese. He returned to Quantico in 1936, attending the Marine Corps Schools while also taking a course on International Law and Politics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. As the Nation spiraled into chaos, Smedley Butler began probing the Marine Corps for signs of dissenting opinions and quickly found an ally in Evans. When the time finally came to join the Chicago Syndicalists in their fight, even despite being severely torn, Carlson decided to follow Butler and is now one of our Highest Ranking officers, and Butler's most trusted General."
CSA_MAURICE_ROSE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 26, 1899, in Middletown, Connecticut, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Maurice Rose, born into a Jewish family, lied about his age to enlist in the Colorado National Guard in 1916 with the hopes of being able to join Pershing's Punitive Expedition to Mexico but was discharged six weeks later for being underage. He worked with his brother in a meatpacking plant until he came of age, after which he enlisted and was selected to officer training, graduating from the Officer Candidate School in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He reached the rank of Captain in 1923 and would start the Infantry Company Officer Course, graduating in 1926. With the growing schism between the pro-mechanization officers and the traditionalists, Rose joined the former, meeting higher ranking officers like Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton, who instilled some of their theoretical armored warfare knowledge into him. He'd undergo the Cavalry Officer Course in 1928, graduating in 1931, and then joining the Command and General Staff College, where he was still undergoing the final stages of his training when the Civil War was about to break out.\n\nRose's career had unfortunately been plagued with discrimination because of his Jewish origin, both from his commanding officers and fellow colleagues, most notably from General George Van Horn Moseley and Pedro Augusto del Valle, who are even said to have held his promotions back because of his background.\n\nAs a reaction to his treatment, Rose began to be seduced by the promises of social equality by the Socialist Party of America and when the situation finally seemed unsalvageable, Rose decided to defect northwards, where he joined the Red Guard. After having been recognized by Butler, he was promoted to the rank of General, and is widely considered the main mechanized warfare expert in the Syndicates' army\n\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He hasn't pledged his allegiance to any of the CSA political factions, and he's rumored to only be in our army in order to fight the anti-semitic officers of the AUS who once hindered his career."
CSA_MILTON_WOLFF_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 7, 1915, in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Milton 'Milt' Wolff, born into a Lithuanian-Hungarian immigrant family and previously an art student, joined the Red Guard as soon as it formed. Despite holding more Vanguardist views, he was accepted into the ranks and became quite popular amongst his peers for his leadership during the clashes against the AFP militias in late 1936 and early 1937.\n\nOnce Bill Haywood announced the Revolution, it became immediately apparent there was a major lack of command staff available to the CSA, and it was in this void that Wolff was promoted to General following a vote held by his peers and colleagues who saw him as a good fit for the role. However, his ability to lead large armies has yet to be put to the test.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Centralist Faction, aligned mostly with Browder."
CSA_EDWARD_CARTER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 26, 1916, in Los Angeles, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Edward Allen Carter Jr. was born to a Black American father and an East Indian mother, who shortly after his birth moved to India. With the collapse of the British Empire and the proclamation of the Bharatiya Commune, Carter came into contact with socialism for the first time as a child, although it was short-lived as his parents would move again in 1932, this time to Shanghai, where he tried to join the local American garrison, only to be rejected on account of his young age.\n\nWith the American Civil War brewing in the distance, he traveled to America as a stowaway in one of the Legation's transports, reaching Seattle and joining the local branch of the Red Guard. As their numbers discreetly mobilized eastwards to start the revolution, Carter slowly became popular amongst the soldiers, retelling the stories of bravery and revolution he had seen in his infancy in East India. When the Revolution finally started, Carter was voted in as a General, becoming one of the only black members of the CSA staff along with Oliver Law.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Federalist Faction."
CSA_GEORGE_H_CANNON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 5, 1915, in Webster Groves, Missouri\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Ham Cannon attended the Culver Military Academy before entering the University of Michigan in 1934 to become a Mechanical Engineer. In Michigan, he joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps program, with the specific purpose of joining the Marine Corps. It was there he further developed his knowledge of warfare. However, the outbreak of the civil war disrupted his training and his studies. With many of his fellow classmates being recruited by the Syndicate Red Guards, Cannon decided to follow them into the Red Guard. As the officers were voted to fill the staff of the syndicates, Cannon was chosen as a CO of Michigan's divisions. After a short inspection of the available candidates by Smedley Butler, Butler selected Cannon personally to be promoted to General and has been trying to help the young officer perfect his Marine officer training."
CSA_BENJAMIN_KATINE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 7, 1912, in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Benjamin Katine, a mechanic and electrician of some renown in New York, joined the Industrial Workers of the World militias as soon as they started recruitment. Becoming popular amongst the automobile unions, he was voted as an officer in February 1937 and was chosen by the Central Staff as a general. Despite the Automotive unions backing his position, Katine still has a lot to learn before becoming a valuable general for the CSA\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Unionist Faction."
CSA_JAMES_PATRICK_MURPHY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 9, 1901, in San Francisco, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W James Patrick Murphy graduated from the California State University in 1926 as a Radio Engineer and moved to San Francisco. While he was unremarkable in the major unrest of the 1930s, he joined the Red Guard after the 1936 election, where his mechanical expertise with radios allowed him to connect the workers of California with those of Chicago. As the workers were discreetly mobilized into Chicago, Murphy was assigned to several cities across what now is the Syndicalist stronghold, improving radio communications between the Red Guard detachments. For his service, he was granted the rank of General within the Red Guard, but even many within the CSA General Staff doubt this Radio Engineer will be capable of leading vast armies across the American landscape."
CSA_JOHN_TISA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 6, 1914, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W John Tisa comes from a Cuban-Italian immigrant family. Previously working mostly as a factory worker and as an amateur writer in his spare time, Tisa joined the Red Guard on the 31st of December, 1936. Since then, he has earned the respect of the Syndicalist soldiers in New Jersey and was voted as their CO at their staff elections. Tisa was then promoted to general, where, for better or worse, he will have to learn from scratch the art of warfare if he hopes to come out ahead of the enemy during the revolution."
CSA_HERBERT_HOLDRIDGE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 6, 1892, in Wyandotte, Michigan, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Herbert Charles Heitke was born in a German immigrant family, and would sign up for West Point in 1913, graduating in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He was first assigned to the Quartermaster Corps of the Army's Reserve in Georgia, reaching the rank of First Lieutenant in 1920 and Captain in 1923. In 1925, while he was still in the Reserve Corps, he transferred to the Cavalry Corps and was assigned as Assistant Professor of History and Social Sciences at West Point. In late 1929, he was transferred to the Army's Cavalry School at Fort Riley, and remained in this position until early 1937, earning the promotion to Colonel in 1934. As soon as street violence began escalating, Heitke decided to resign and move back to New York with his family, signing up for the local Red Guard, where his military experience granted him a promotion from Smedley Butler himself. Now a General of the Syndicalist Army, Heitke has become, along with Maurice Rose and Smedley Butler, one of the few military generals of the US Army to join the revolution."
CSA_OLIVER_LAW_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 23, 1900, in Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Oliver Law enlisted to the US Army in 1919 as a private, serving with the 24th Infantry regiment stationed on the Mexican Border. He left the military in 1925 after being refused any kind of promotion on the basis of his skin color, moving first to Bluffton, Indiana, where he worked at a cement plant and then shortly thereafter to Chicago where he drove a cab for the Yellow Cab Company. When the Great Depression hit, Law was left unemployed for years, until he managed to become a stevedore and joined the International Longshoremen's Association. With his savings, he tried to open a restaurant in 1932 but ultimately failed and unemployed once more, he joined the International Labor Defence. With a Civil War looming over the United States, Law was amongst the first to volunteer for the Red Guard. Because of his military background and leadership skills, he was quickly voted in as an officer by his fellow soldiers, before later reaching the rank of General thanks to the sponsoring of the National Negro Congress.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Loyal Member of the Unionist Faction, and he is rumored to keep close relations with both Bayard Rustin and Asa Philip Randolph."
CSA_ROBERT_H_MERRIMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 17, 1908, in Eureka, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a lumberjack, Robert Hale Merriman grew up in a poor family hit hard by the Depression. Forced to take odd jobs to continue his education after graduating from high school, he ended up joining the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) branch at the University of Nevada, where he graduated in 1932, marrying his wife Marion, also a student, on their graduation day. After this, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a master's degree in economics. With the Depression's grip worsening in America and fascinated by French and British economic structures, he and Marion moved to Paris for a year to study at the Sorbonne. Returning to California in 1935, he finished his master's degree and was accepted to the University of Chicago's Ph.D. program in 1936, drawn to the growing revolutionary activity in the city.\n\nAs MacArthur's deadline loomed over Haywood's conference, Merriman, with his background in the ROTC, began teaching students of all ages the rudimentary military training he had learned half a decade ago. Though he was not a devoted syndicalist, Merriman was outraged by the widespread political repression and authoritarian tenancies demonstrated by the American government in the summer of 1936, and with his warm personality and commanding figure he was elected to lead the University's branch of the Red Militia.\n\nUnlike many of the other young officers voted into command by their peers, Merriman's military training and educated background made him stand out to Smedley Butler, who hand-picked the young man for higher command and began to nurture what he saw as his strong talent for leadership and command.\n§YImportant Notes:§W-It is unclear where exactly Merriman's political loyalties lie within the greater CSA Party Congress. He has an academic interest in Syndicalist economic policy, but his distaste for authoritarianism has alienated him from the more centralist faction of the Congress lead by Browder."
CSA_DAVID_SHOUP_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L Born December 30, 1904, in Battle Ground, Indiana, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L David Shoup was born in an impoverished family in the heart of the steel belt. From an early age, Shoup leaned politically to the left - having been moulded by the progressive ideas of Indiana politicians fighting against Wall Street's big businesses. Excelling in academics and extracurriculars such as wrestling and football, he joined the United States Marine Corps for financial reasons. In the Marine Corps, Shoup was recognised for his athletics, marksmanship, and leadership skills - impressing his commanders and subordinates for his ability to keep morale with his sense of humour. From 1927 to 1934, Shoup served in China, protecting American interests in the war-torn country, a mission he was personally opposed to seeing his actions as simply an imperialist exploitation of the Chinese people. As the nation began to spiral into chaos, Shoup's anti-imperialist stance and personal beliefs made him a staunch supporter and ally of fellow Marine Corps General Smedly Butler. When the time came for revolution, Shoup committed himself to the syndicalist cause and Butler, bringing the experience and leadership the Second Continental Army desperately needed."
CSA_ROBERT_ALLEN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L Born July 14, 1900, in Latonia, Kentucky, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Robert S. Allen was born Herman Greenberg until his father officially changed his name as the Weltkreig raged on to avoid connections to Germany and to pick a real \"American\" last name. Lying about his age, Allen joined Pershing's expedition to seek out Pancho Villa after which he graduated from the University of Wisconsin and took up reporting. It was in Wisconsin, one of the key hotbeds of American socialism that Allen became dedicated to Reed's cause. As racial tensions seeped into American society with the ongoing economic crisis, Allen used his investigative journaling skills to successfully infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. A foreign correspondent with the Christian Science Monitor, Allen's dissatisfaction with the Hoover administration compelled him to write an anonymous expose "Washington Merry Go-Round." Disillusioned with MacArthur's military clique in Washington and Hoover's incompetence brought Allen more and more committed to the vision of America held by the SPA. A proponent of speed and armor due to his experiences in the Pershing Expedition, Allen has pledged himself to the worker's cause in the wake of the civil war."

### Parties ###
CSA_totalist_party:0 "Centralist Faction"
CSA_totalist_party_long:0 "Centralist Faction\n§gThe Centralist Faction is a loose grouping of organizations that support more Vanguardist, Totalist and/or other Centralist ideas regarding the revolution. Oftentimes, they have a tendency towards non-democratic thought. Despite being lumped together, however, they often stand in opposition to one another and are split between William Z. Foster's Collectivists on the ultra-left, James Burnham's American Workers Party on the right, and Browder's Centralists in the center.§!"
CSA_syndicalist_party:0 "Unionist Faction"
CSA_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Unionist Faction\n§gThe Unionist Faction is dominated by the IWW and traditional syndicalism which desires a government based around trade unions, with internal differences being largely based around centralization. Some wish for a comparitively centralized system, which they call "State Syndicalism". Meanwhile, those calling themselves "Orthodox Syndicalists" adopt a more mainstream approach for the ideology, and they advocate for labor unions to become the main forces in our economy. There are also those who want support "Decentralized Planning", a plan which would build on mainstream syndicalism and also see the creation of communes in cities and counties, generally having a utopian vision for the country. For now, these factions are united by famous union leader "Big Bill" Haywood, whose time in the Russian Civil War changed him and convinced him of the potential need for a revolution here as well. There are others who contend for leadership in the syndicalist faction as well. In the Centralist wing, there is legendary figure Jack Reed, who has garnered much support for the faction. There is also his disciple, James P. Cannon, the hero Arturo Giovannitti, West Coast socialist Harry Bridges, and writer Elmer Allison. In the Orthodox wing, there is fiery orator Frank T. Johns, rising star and "Rebel Girl" Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and journalist Robert "Fighting Bob" Minor. For the "Decentralized Planning" advocates, the Anarchists, there is famous writer Emma Goldman, Catholic-socialist Dorothy Day, and Russian-born Modest Stein.§!"
CSA_radical_socialist_party:0 "Nationalist Faction"
CSA_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Nationalist Faction\n§gThe Nationalist Faction is largely made up of intellectuals supporting American Bellaymist ideas, which derive from the writings of the late Edward Bellamy and the earlier Nationalist Movement. Supporting a socialist, nationally planned economy and guild democracy, these utopian socialists are the most middle-class of the CSA's supporters and are largely based around the American Independence League, Nationalist Clubs, and Knights of Labor groups. These factions organize a small number of unions and, more-so, various social organizations to promote their utopian future where the population universally works towards the greater good and all are provided for. They are currently in the Social Patriot faction of Congress alongside the AFL, and help provide managerial, bureaucratic, social, and intellectual support to the CSA.§!"
CSA_social_democrat_party:0 "Federalist Faction"
CSA_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Federalist Faction\n§gThe Federalists are the least radical of the various organizations within the CSA, with their critics claiming they are only aligned with the CSA due to common enemies, government crackdowns and a desire to see a union dominated America. Lead by the AFL, the Federalists support higher worker pay, greater benefits for crafts unions, union power more generally, and most importantly, an American economy recreated in their vision, which they view as representative of the worker. Their more moderate beliefs have made them popular with more conservative elements of the country, but there is no mistaking their intentions: they wish to transform America forever.§!"
CSA_social_liberal_party:0 "Progressive Party"
CSA_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Progressive Party\n§gThe Progressives were seen as radicals by some in recent times, but in the CSA, they are moderates. Those who still adhere to the party and its beliefs wish to see some economic rights for workers and farmers, but they stop short of even the modest Federalist reforms that have been proposed. Their most ambitious economic plan is for a "Social Security" policy in which suffering elders won't have to be a burden on their children. The party has also contrasted itself with the Federalists by focusing more on inclusive social policies, hoping for racial integration and female inclusion in the workplace eventually. Their economic moderation and social policies appear to be what they think will win them support, at the expense of leftist parties.§!"
CSA_market_liberal_party:0 "Republican Party"
CSA_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Republican Party\n§gThe Republican Party, once dominant in the Red Belt, has now been relegated to relative obscurity. However, there are still those who identify themselves as Republicans. Those supporters who live in the cities are typically upper-class or otherwise well-to-do, and advocate laissez-faire economics with some liberal social policies.§!"
CSA_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
CSA_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party\n§gThe Democratic Party, once dominant in the Red Belt, has now been relegated to relative obscurity. However, there are still those who identify themselves as Democrats. Those supporters who live in the countryside are generally more socially conservative, sometimes supporting policies aimed at attacking the wealthy or regulating the economy. Usually though, they are more focused on keeping traditional beliefs and attitudes. These beliefs are likely to be unpopular with the rest of the CSA, but their adherence to them is stubborn, and only time will reveal their fate.§!"
CSA_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
CSA_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party\n§gHuey Long and his AFP have their supporters in our territory, and the populist message they advocate is especially popular with our farmers. However, it is unlikely that this faction will come to power in our government, though perhaps they could help us to negotiate with Long.§!"
CSA_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Federal Loyalists"
CSA_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Federal Loyalists\n§gThere are many in the CSA who secretly harbor Federal sympathies, not for the Federalist Party, but for MacArthur and his military junta. These dissidents will likely cause trouble, and all should be done to root them out, or more constructively, persuade them to join the Revolution.§!"
CSA_national_populist_party:0 "The Black Legion" 
CSA_national_populist_party_long:0 "The Black Legion\n§gA powerful wing of the NDWL's "Old Klan" based out of the Midwest and Northern Urban regions, The Black Legion is infamously violent even by Klan standards, breaking away from the main organization due to viewing it as not willing to go far enough. Supporting radical white and protestant supremacy, the Legion spreads terror within the CSA whenever they can.§!"

CSA_totalist_centralist_party:0 "American Workers Party"
CSA_totalist_centralist_party_long:0 "American Workers Party\n§gThe American Workers Party formed in 1933 and was once headed by pacifist A.J. Muste, seemingly destined to fuse with James Cannon’s Trotskyists in the CLA before being supplanted by the Trotskyist-turned-Social Nationalist and Conservative Socialist James Burnham. Now walking its own path, the AWP advocates for a syncretic mixture of shackled Technocratic and Nationalized economics supporting an Americanist breed of militarist Socialist Nationalism that borders on outright Populist Conservatism at times while desiring a loyal Managerial class to work on behalf of the Revolution while the Vanguard around Burnham focuses on the destiny of America, free from day to day worries as our elevated and supreme executive. Burnham’s AWP further pursues the creation of a greater American popular state supported and expanded by a form of red pseudo-imperialism pursued for the good of the American people and the wider Revolution, despite outcries from their rivals across the Left that call them reactionaries in sheep’s clothing. Under James Burnham and his strange views, his wide coalition of varied Leftists, Populists, Imperialists, Nationalists, and Conservatives, and his growing military-industrial complex, Burnham has created the New World’s first true breed of ‘Neo-Socialism’ that the AWP now brings to the entire nation in a questionable triumph of American Totalism.§!"

CSA_totalist_lovestone_party:0 "AWP(l)"
CSA_totalist_lovestone_party_long:0 "American Workers Party (Lovestoneite)\n§gThe farthest left wing of the AWP, represented by the new Director-in-Chief Jay Lovestone and his supporters, aims to ensure that the Socialism practiced in America truly matches the exceptional quality of its people. Merging elements of Bukharinite inspired Market Socialism, rabid anti-Syndicalist stances, and certain elements of Burnhamite Thought, Lovestonites have become the majority within the American Workers Party after the death of James Burnham. While still holding to his authoritarian managerial style of rulership and the concept of Socialism in One Nation, sometimes even on One Continent, Lovestoneism advocates have also taken a harsh stance on Technocrats run mad, hoping to subjugate them so they can be ensured to benefit Socialism and the neverending Revolution above all.§!"

CSA_totalist_browder_party:0 "CPA"
CSA_totalist_browder_party_long:0 "Communist Political Association\n§gThe Communist Political Association represents the Earl Browder group of American Communists born out of the failure of the Bolshevik Revolution and the split in the CPUSA between faithful Browderites and Fosterite faction eager to embrace the newly successful European Syndicalism. While many other members of what came to be known as 'American Totalists' scoff at Browder's relatively center communist stance the members of CPA know that true revolution and the liberation of the American worker can be only ensured by moderation within the theses laid out by Marx and Lenin, making sure that Communism becomes as American as apple pie and is upheld by a wide popular front of socialists.§!"

CSA_cannon_party:0 "CLA"
CSA_cannon_party_long:0 "Communist League of America (Opposition)\n§gFounded in 1928 by James P. Cannon, Max Shactman, and Martin Abern after their expulsion from the CPUSA before it was later torn apart by the bitter rivalry between Foster and Browder, the Communist League of America (Opposition) is the predominant - and only surviving - Trotskyist party in America. Dedicated to ideas of Left Internationalism in pursuit of the Permanent World Revolution due to America’s unique place in the world as a new Socialist power untethered to previous power structures, freeing the nation to pursue the global revolutionary struggle without hindrance, the CLA is dedicated to their singular goal despite the failings of their ideological namesake, but are much maligned by their fellow Leftist across the spectrum and across America, finding few allies outside of major urban centers like New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, and other hubs of Slavic emigres within America, though they have found some purchase within the IWW and the AWP. Under Cannon and his Internationalist coalition in the CLA, America shall embrace what they perceive to be the true form of Bolshevism as they prepare to take up the torch of Global Communism.§!"

CSA_technocracy_inc_party:0 "Technocracy Inc."
CSA_technocracy_inc_party_long:0 "Technocracy Incorporated\n§gTechnocracy Inc. has long served in the shadow of Burnham and then Lovestone, but are now in a position of power of their own accord, ready to reshape society according to their technocratic ideals. Led by Director Howard Scott, supported by his friend, famous geophysicist and long-time right-hand man Marion King Hubbert, and a clique of loyal experts including Walter Rautenstrauch, Seymour Melman, Edward Condon and J. Robert Oppenheimer. The movement is not without a certain factionalism, however, as evidenced by the existence of the so-called 'Green' faction, led by Benton MacKaye and Leland Olds, calling for a form of agrarian and environmentalist technocracy, and the 'Red' faction of Stuart Chase and Alice Barrows, supporting the mixing of technocratic ideals with certain Communist, Syndicalist or Georgist ideas. Some technocrats also doubt Scott's oratory and leadership skills, and even question his technical competence...§!"

CSA_technocrac_council_party:0 "PCTR"
CSA_technocrac_council_party_long:0 "Provisional Circuit of the Technocratic Revolution\n§gAfter the Technocrats took power and toppled the tyrant who had tried to enslave them, a Temporary Council was set up to ensure the day-to-day governance of the former Lovestonite state. Howard Scott's Technocracy Incorporated and Harold Loeb's Continental Committee on Technocracy are the two organizations making up this supposedly non-partisan council. Although both indisputably technocratic, the CCT and Technocracy Inc. argue about many issues, the CCT promotes what they consider to be a more 'democratic' form of Technocracy where councils would be established for local governance, and support the aesthetic side of the Revolution, highlighting the contribution of artists and writers. Scott denounced these ideals as contradictory to the technocratic system and as partisan-politics enabling, and instead promote a system where the Continental Board and its sub-agencies, based on a model of internal democracy, would be given the bulk of decision-making powers always based on logic and rationality. They are, however, unified on most points, such as the organization of society on a technocratic model, a government made up of experts in their field, the promotion of technical and scientific knowledge, and the organization of society into functional sequences.§!"

CSA_technocrac_council_party_loeb_long:0 "Integrated Circuit of the Technocratic Revolution\n§gIn order to put an end to the internal dissension that was becoming increasingly apparent, the position of Continental Director was abolished and the Integrated Circuit of the Technocratic Revolution was given its powers. The non-partisan Council now directs our utopian revolution, juggling the demands of the various CCT factions to ensure the stability of our technocratic utopia and its future.§!"

CSA_utopian_technocrat_party:0 "CCT"
CSA_utopian_technocrat_party_long:0 "Continental Committee on Technocracy\n§gWhere Technocracy Incorporated was in the shadow of Burnham and Lovestone, the Continental Committee on Technocracy was in the shadow of Techocracy Incorporated. The two most prominent figures in the technocratic Futurist organization are famous writers Harold Loeb and Ernest Hemingway, both personal friends, yet the CCT is in essence a conglomerate of different organizations such as the Technical Alliance, the New Machine and the Utopian Society of America, divided on many issues but unified in their pursuit of an aesthetic, democratic and artistic technocratic revolution. A Futurians faction led by activist David Lasser also exists, aboborating internationalist socialist and utopian technocratic ideals. Although the movement is unified, certain dissensions exist, including between Loeb and Hemingway themselves, with the latter encouraging a more gradual approach to societal transformation, where Loeb's approach is much more rapid.§!"

POLITICS_CSA_CENTRAL_COMITTEE_DESC:0 "The victory of the working class is the collective victory of all true Americans. The American people of old still coalesce around the Central Committee as did the founders around the Constitutional Convention, though our goals be more noble. Here the liberators of socialism debate the future of our nation, and factions that John Reed united now form under their own visions of the future."
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_FLYNN_DESC:0 "At a dusty underground socialist club in Harlem, Elizabeth Flynn's life as an advocate began. An early organizer for the IWW in New Jersey, Flynn felt the blunt of the political wrath against forming trade unions, and was arrested ten times. Flynn helped found the ACLU, which organized legal defence for strikers in the days before the International Labor Defence. In the leadup to the civil war, Flynn helped organize the Longshoremen strike of the West Coast. Flynn's wartime speeches to the Central Committee to encourage conscription made her stand out to the numerous conscientious objectors in the Committee. Ultimately Flynn was elected to lead America as a shocking dark horse candidate. Some thought it absurd that a woman would stand at the forefront of the revolution, but the rebel girl herself had been at the spearhead all along, fighting since the founding of the IWW and now ready to build up a socialist America of her dreams."
POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "Norman Thomas has seen the highs and lows of social stature, and has remained dedicated to socialism the entire way through. From a newspaper boy to Princeton magna cum laude to conscientious objector, he has seen much and more of the world, but his time as a minister was perhaps the most important. By then an advocate of christian socialism, he decided to run for office. Prior to the Civil War, he had served as New York City's Mayor, and then as the vice-presidential candidate of Jack Reed. Inspired by the writings of Edward Bellamy, Thomas pivoted his pacifism during the war into advocacy for socialists living in the Federal lands to resist conscription and even create utopian societies for themselves. After the war, he used the experience he gained and his close friendship to Jack Reed to catapult him to prominence in the country. Preaching on behalf of the Nationalists, he lead the democratic socialists to victory in the constitutional convention. With a heart of gold and unshakable morals, Norman Thomas has ascended to the presidency."
POLITICS_EARL_BROWDER_DESC:0 "Born in Kansas, in the year of 1891, Browder became a committed socialist age 16. His adherence to the socialist party of America was unshakable, and through an early friendship with William Z Foster, he became a syndicalist. As the years passed, the two men began to drift apart. While Foster favored an authoritarian form of syndicalism, Browder began to see more and more limits with the movement. The American revolution has according to him, proven that the same beliefs and strategies used in Europe cannot be applied to America. His new economic policy has been built with inspiration from Bolshevism, reinterpretations of Maximism, and plenty of original thought. Browder also intends to end the persistent trend of industrial unionism in Congress, and to pursue lecherous religious elements within the socialist state. Browder has never abandoned the socialist party of America, but with his new authoritarian position he intends to ensure that the party will never abandon him."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_FOSTER_DESC:0 "A radical labor organizer who spearheaded the syndicalist movement in America, William Z Foster has practically become a legend on the American left. His leadership in the strikes of the early 20th century and his commitment that the Socialist Party of America adapt Syndicalist policies has cemented him as one of its chief ideologies. His famous manifesto, "Toward Syndicalist America" has served as the guidebook for every aspiring Totalist in the country, containing Foster's culminated ideals for how to rebuild the nation of America into what it is today. With the recent victories of the Vanguard movement of the Combined Syndicates, Foster was uplifted to lead the new nation. Several of Foster's older, more socially ambitious ideas now come to the fore. This includes plans to reform the socialist human being as a whole, and to re-orient American morals towards the vanguard of socialism."
POLITICS_JAMES_CANNON_DESC:0 "Personally mentored by Big Bill Haywood and well versed in the struggles of the American left, James Cannon became an unshakable presence within the socialist party of America. Although initially a fanatic adherent to Bolshevism, the failure of the Russian revolution contrasted with the triumph of the French syndicalists made Cannon adopt a more libertarian view on socialism. As a formal representative of the SPA, he spent much time abroad in France and Britain, before returning to America after the outbreak of the civil war. Helping to organize foreign volunteers and the Internationale's advisers, he cemented his reliability as a brilliant administrator. With the war won, Cannon would immediately start to build the momentum needed to run for president, and has now finally fulfilled his ambition!"
POLITICS_CARLO_TRESCA_DESC:0 "Born to an impoverished family in Italy, Tresca's emigration to America became the first major step in a tumultuous life which saw him soon emerge as Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America. Having built up a famed reputation as an anarchist, a strike organizer and a community leader among Italian immigrants, Tresca became an integral figure within the IWW. His oratory and legal skills were put to use defending men such as Sacco and Vanzetti, as well as stopping the infiltration and manipulation of trade unions by the Italian Mafia. He spent much time vocally supporting the revolution in his homeland Italy, defending the merits, accomplishments and potentials of the Italian Socialist Republic to his fellow Italian-Americans. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Carlo Tresca played a key role in the takeover and new administration of New York City, he survived multiple assassination attempts and scores of protests against his campaign for being an Italian immigrant. His prior accomplishments within the Italian Socialist Federation and the IWW has now allowed Carlo Tresca to launch a successful campaign to become President."
POLITICS_ARTURO_GIOVANNITTI_DESC:0 "Born in Abruzzi Italy, Arturo was one of the hundreds of thousands who came to the United states seeking opportunity. Arturo instead found a ripe political climate for expanding workers’ rights. Arturo was there during the 1912 Textile Strike of Lawrence, Massachusetts, where his illegal arrest and subsequent trial in a metal cage became a rallying point for the New England IWW. Arturo was acquitted of all charges, and became a socialist activist, first opposing the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, then the US's entry into the war. During the revolution, Arturo led an Italian American brigade out of New England and into the CSA territory under hostile fire. A talent for speaking and poetry elevated his campaign. Ultimately he was elected President as a true citizen."
POLITICS_MEYER_LONDON_DESC:0 "Born in Tsarist Lithuania under the grip of Russian influence. Meyer's first ambition was to become a Talmudic scholar like his father. The adverse conditions of Russia forced Meyer's family to relocate to New York City, where Meyer became a printer. Printing for Yiddish publications, Meyer had fallen into one such group of radical intellectuals that encouraged him to become a lawyer. Starting in the 1890s, Mayer joined Eugene V. Deb's Social Democratic Party, and was a leading organizer of the 1910 New York Clockmakers Strike. A coalition ticket with Progressives allowed Meyer to become the first of many socialists in Congress. Meyer opposed the U.S's entry into the Weltkrieg, and yet aided the McAdoo administration in promoting militancy. Meyer even angered Jewish labor by promoting partisan Jewish organisations above Zionist labor groups. Meyer went undercover during the Crisis of 36, and re-emerged following the war championing many of the issues he was against. Meyer the pro-Zionist war hawk was much more popular, even against protesters claiming he couldn't run for President as an immigrant."
POLITICS_UPTON_SINCLAIR_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, in Baltimore, Upton was an aspiring author from an early age. In his teens he wrote pulp magazines and poetry to make a living, eventually moving into investigative journalism. His moment in the spotlight came after he spent seven weeks disguised as a worker in Chicago's meatpacking plants, drafting a political expose on the poor labor conditions of the plants. Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry, of which he declared "I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the "End Poverty In California" campaign. E.P.I.C as it came to be known was not the roaring triumph he had expected, but gave Sinclair enough fame and recognition that he could later pursue a second political career in the new America. Now championing a E.P.I.C movement applied nationwide, Upton Sinclair has won the recent presidential election with a startling margin."
POLITICS_FRANK_LITTLE_DESC:0 "Born to a family of Oklahoma homesteaders, Frank Little moved to California in order to escape the miserable droughts that had ruined his family's land. Him and his brother both became ministers, but in 1905 Frank became a full-time organizer for the IWW. A proud wobbly, he soon struck up a friendship with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and fought alongside her for the rights of unionized workers across the whole country. Frank narrowly survived two separate attempts at lynching by strike breakers, once in Wisconsin and a second time in Montana. Two instances of nearly being murdered caused Frank Little to lay low for several years, only beginning to show his face again around the mine wars of the early 1920s. His political activism was less provocative, and he avoided any more near-death experiences until the outbreak of the civil war. Although too hold to fight personally, Frank helped organize a series of militias across the Steel Belt, and was later nominated to serve in the new government. From this position, he could launch a campaign for the presidency, which the elderly union man narrowly won."
POLITICS_HARRY_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Harry Bridges was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1901. When he turned 15, he was first introduced to radical labor politics through the Australian branch of the IWW. Emboldened by his contacts with fellow socialists, along with seeing the general deplorable conditions of the poor around the world, he participated in his first general strike in Australia in 1917. Three years later, in 1920, he would move permanently to the US due to the more plentiful work there. He settled in San Fran where he joined other local activists in reviving the then-defunct International Longeshoremens Association. In 1934 a period of month-long negotiations between the twenty local branches of the ILA and the dock owners of SF broke down when two longshore workers were murdered. Bridges, the leading negotiator for the ILA during the standoff, convinced over 100 San Francisco unions to join together in a General Strike. The ILA fought the city to a standstill, and Harry Bridges was given credit for stopping further police violence. His later Presidential campaign often faced off against protesters who defied the new Amendment giving natural born citizenship to immigrants, and prevailed against them. Using this reputation, he launched a risky but successful campaigned that has lead him to the presidency."
POLITICS_FRANK_JOHNS_DESC:0 "Initially a carpenter from Oregon, Frank Johns became the leading figure of the regional Socialist Labor Party. Running twice for congress and twice for the presidency, Johns seemed doomed to a lifetime of obscurity as a fringe party candidate. That was until he went through a near death experience in 1928, nearly drowning in an attempt to save a young boy whom had fallen in a frigid river. Forced to retire from the Socialist Labor Party in order to recover from the incident, Johns was given enough time to think and plot out a new career. He began to correspond with several members of the Socialist Party of America, and after being released from the hospital he went on to join them as a fiery orator. Emboldened by his heroism and having narrowly avoided death, Johns later threw himself into the second American civil war as a capable and courageous militia leader. Thanks to his military accomplishments and personal reputation, he has now finally been elected president, of a whole new America!"
POLITICS_SEYMOUR_STEDMAN_DESC:0 "It was incomprehensible to many that a simple janitor would go on to become one of the Socialist Party of America's most prominent activists and legal advisers. Initially balancing his job as a janitor at the Northwestern University School of Law with taking evening classes, Stedman managed to pass the bar to became a lawyer in 1891. Although he was at first a Democrat, the young Stedman became inducted into socialism when he helped defend Eugene V Debs during American Railway Union's great strike. His lifelong friendship to Debs saw him chosen as the SPA's vice presidential candidate on 1920, and after Debs' death he became a close advisor to Jack Reed. Having now outlived yet another close comrade, the old and somber Stedman has run a successful race to become the new president, intent on honoring his old friend's utopian dreams."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_RODRIGUEZ_DESC:0 "The son of a Spanish immigrant to Illinois, William Rodriguez made his living painting houses, until he could eventually afford to pursue a legal degree. Inspired by his brother in law, a radical journalist named J. Louis Engdahl to join the American Socialist party and move to Chicago. The young Rodriguez managed to win a race for the Chicago city council as a dark horse candidate, becoming the first socialist and first Hispanic to sit on the council. He soon managed to use his newfound position to attack the city's transit companies and to seek legal reforms. Although eventually ousted by a democratic and republican unity candidate, Rodriguez did not give up on politics. He continued to practice law and ran a successfully campaign in 1933 to become a judge. Building on a lifetime of legal and political experience, his next triumph came when he ran his most recent successful presidential campaign."
POLITICS_MORRIS_HILQUIT_DESC:0 "One of the oldest political figures in the Combined Syndicates, Hillquit was born in 1869, to a Jewish family living in Latvia. After his father lost his business, the young Morris and his dad crossed the Atlantic in search of a better life. Soon settled in the slums of New York, Hillquit would go on to found the Socialist Party of America alongside Victor Berger and Eugene V Debs. He ran for the senate in 1908 from New York City, garnering 21% of the votes. Despite this failure, he would later unsuccessfully run for mayor of NYC and afterwards help organize fellow socialist Meyer London's successful bid for congress. Despite suffering from numerous bouts of tuberculosis and frequent conflicts with the growing syndicalist wing of the SPA, Hillquit endured long enough to witness the revolution finally sweep through America. Although old and sickly, his seniority and eventful life has netted him a surprising victory in the latest presidential election. His age helped to invalidate dissenters who wanted a natural born citizen as President. Although some remain uncertain if he can finish his current term, President Hillquit has sworn he will serve the interests of all of America's proletariat, no matter his age or health."
POLITICS_EUGENE_DENNIS_DESC:0 "Born under the name Francis Xavier Waldron, and spending his early life as a laborer and IWW member in California, the young Waldron was driven into exile after the Californian Criminal Syndicalist Act nearly saw him imprisoned for revolutionary political activism. Fleeing to the Commune of France and taking up work as minor union politician, he became an important link between the Socialist Party of America and the Third Internationale. In 1935 he returned across the Atlantic, now hiding under the pseudonym "Eugene Dennis", to help organize Jack Reed's campaign in the coming presidential election. His services to Reed were soon rewarded with a series of influential positions within the Combined Syndicates, which served as the stepping stones for his own eventually presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ELMER_ALLISON_DESC:0 "A self-taught radical from Missouri, Elmer Allison was a founding member of both the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. He was a leading figure in the SPA's radical Washington affiliate, spending much of his life either working in the local cedar mills or atop a soapbox in Seattle's streets. A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met Jack Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City. There he was a major figure in running Reed's numerous political campaigns and leading the SPA's entry into mainstream politics. Following the revolution, his close comradeship to Reed and his zealous socialist beliefs has made him an obvious candidate for the presidency. A candidacy he has gladly pursued!"
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_NORD_DESC:0 "Elizabeth Nord grew up as the daughter of a family of poor English coal miners, having to spend her early teenage years toiling in a silk factory. Her family departed England a few years shy of the British Revolution, settling across the Atlantic in Rhode Island. In the United States Nord spent another decade as a factory worker during which she used her political finesse and determination to rise through the ranks of her local union, being elected Chairwoman. She became one of the key leaders of the Great Textile Strike of 1934, organizing the walkout of tens of thousands of workers across the country. On the outbreak of the Second civil war, she was a political representative of her union in Washington D.C, but quickly made her way across the frontlines to the Combined Syndicates of America. Repeating the same grueling political manoeuvring that put her in charge of the Great Textile Strike, Elizabeth Nord has now risen to lead something far greater than a union or a strike, she has become the new President!"
POLITICS_DAVID_DUBINSKY_DESC:0 "Dubinsky came from the former Russian Empire to America, a Polish Jew who had spent his early life organizing bunds, leading strikes and campaigning for the Bolsheviks. These actions netted him a prison sentence in Siberia, but the young Dubinsky managed to miraculously escape back to western Russia and catch a ship to carry him across the Atlantic. Spending much time working in the factories of New York City, Dubinsky became increasingly alienated from the union bureaucracy around him, starting a long-time personal feud between him and the IWW. He initially saw unions as inherently apolitical platforms that should seek further co-operation with the right wing to uplift all workers despite political beliefs, and that compromises with the federal government and business sector were practically mandatory for a union's success. Dubinsky would change his opinion after witnessing first the Great Depression, then the steady rise of Huey Long and finally the outbreak of the American civil war. Although he never made amends with the "union bureaucrats", Dubinsky ceased to compromise with the right wing and capitalism, taking on more politically extreme views. When the civil war finally ended he had been singing the praises of the new America, and already planted the seeds for a political career. Despite his controversial past, it appears David Dubinsky has now been able to reap what he has sown, rising to the position of President in spite of protests from old nativists who resist the proclamation giving him natural born rights."
POLITICS_JOHN_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The son of Welsh immigrants whom had settled in Iowa, John Lewis grew up in a company town dominated by the coal industry. At the age of 17 he went to work as a minister, becoming more and more embroiled in his hometown’s local politics and the nationwide labor movement. In 1907 he made a failed attempt to run for mayor, and later became a full-time union advocate who travelled across the steel belt. Although he initially bickered with William Z Foster over the merits of syndicalist trade unions compared to his preferred moderate and apolitical unions, the devastation of the Great Depression saw him slowly embrace more radical beliefs. Despite having once been a liberal and a republican, Lewis could not find it in his heart to endorse President Hoover's second term. Increasingly disillusioned with competitive capitalism, Lewis struck up negotiations with the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. When the American Revolution came, he had made up his mind for which side to stand on. Although his reactionary past continued to haunt him, Lewis eventually succeeded in finding a synthesis between radical unionism and his own moderate ideology, being elected as President in the latest election."
POLITICS_LUDWIG_KATTERFELD_DESC:0 "Born in Strasbourg under the German Empire and sent away to live with family in America at just 10 years of age, where he later ran away from home, Ludwig Katterfeld had a harsh and formative upbringing. After escaping his extended family, he took up work as a farmhand in Kansas, spending his teenage years balancing hard labour with honing his impressive oratory skills and sharp intellect. The next two decades were a turbulent time for Katterfeld, seeing him become a professed socialist and move from state to state to launch new political ambitions. After graduating college in 1910 he moved to Chicago and lead his own short-lived socialist party, the "Lyceum Bureau". He became involved with the Socialist Party of Washington and in 1916 launched a failed gubernatorial bid with them. In 1922 he was the provisional secretary of the Socialist Party of America, and later a representative in their behalf to the Third Internationale. It was in Paris he met Jack Reed, whom he accompanied back to America the very next year. In 1923 both men played a key role in the brief, radical Seattle Commune. The events of the commune compelled the bitter and austere Katterfeld to go underground, breaking with Reed's desire to go into mainstream electoral politics. From there on Katterfeld worked as an independent activist, not resurfacing until the Civil War. He did not have a chance to reconnect with Reed until the closing days of the revolution, with the latter on his deathbed. Compelled to honor his old friendship to Reed and armed with a lifetime of revolutionary experience, Katterfeld has launched into the spotlight with a narrow victory in the recent presidential race."
POLITICS_HENNING_BLOMEN_DESC:0 "A son of Massachusetts born in 1910, Henning was too young to experience the horrors of the Weltkrieg, but old enough to face the American Revolution in his prime. Initially an industrial worker in Cambridge, he was one of the few who did not leave his station the moment the first gunshots of the Second Civil War could be heard. A committed pacifist, Henning Blomen instead helped organize the chemical plant he worked at into a cooperative syndicate. His efforts were greatly appreciated by his more radical co-workers, who nominated him as a Massachusetts representative to the Combined Syndicates and helped him cross the front lines to New York City. Soon climbing his way up the political ladder, Henning Blomen has continuously made a name for himself with his unshakable optimism and iron will, running over a dozen major political races in his lifetime, the most recent of which has carried him all the way to the presidency."
POLITICS_JOHN_BERNARD_DESC:0 "Initially a French immigrant, Bernard worked nearly a decade of his life in the iron mines of Minnesota, later enlisting in the army. He served along the Mexican Border during the Mexican Revolution, a year later returning to Minnesota but soon discovering himself to be blacklisted from employment because his trade union activism. Pursuing a career in firefighting, then as a politician, Bernard managed to be elected to the House of Representatives on the ticket of the Farmer-Labor Party in 1936. While in office, he became more and more aligned with Jack Reed's popular front of socialists, and began to campaign for friendlier relations between America and the Commune of France. Distinguishing himself as a diligent proletariat and cunning politician, John Bernard has gone a step further and made a successful run for presidency."
POLITICS_OAKLEY_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "A voracious reader since an early age, Oakley Johnson took up a career within academia, serving as a teacher and later principal at numerous schools in his home state of Minnesota. This lasted until his commitment to radical politics became more publicly known, and he was arrested in the middle of a seminar over having contributed money to the defence fund of arrested IWW members. Undeterred, Johnson moved to New York and became a full time activist in the Socialist Party of America, helping to promote interracial relations and the education of the proletariat. In 1936 he accepted a position of Docent at a university in Paris, spending most of the coming Civil War abroad. In Paris he helped maintain diplomatic relations between the Commune of France and his comrades home in America. Eventually making the trip to the new America, Oakley Johnson has used his diplomatic accomplishments and academic merits to woo the electorate!"
POLITICS_BAYARD_RUSTIN_DESC:0 "Born in Pennsylvania, in the year of 1912, Rustin was raised in a family deeply affiliated with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was personally acquainted with notables such as W.E.B. DuBois and James Weldon Johnson, developing left leaning beliefs at an early age. This best showed in 1936 when he organized a student strike at Wilberforce University, which he was expelled over. Cast adrift, the young Rustin moved to New York City where he joined the Young People's Socialist League and got to meet Norman Thomas and A. Phillip Randolph. With the outbreak of the civil war, Bayard Rustin became a political organizer and campaigner for the Combined Syndicates championing better race relations, increased desegregation, and the immediate overturning of Jim Crow in the newly liberated southern states. Now, decades after the revolution he has made his daring bid for the presidency despite the fact that Rustin's youth, skin color and known homosexual relationships have for long been targets of slander and ridicule. Although one might expect any one of those three to have stopped him, he has powered through regardless and been elected the first African-American head of state in American history."
POLITICS_DARLINGTON_HOOPES_DESC:0 "Darlington Hoopes came from a notable family of Pennsylvania Quakers, during his time at boarding school he augmented his religious upbringing with an interest in radical socialism, going on to identify as a Christian Socialist. His ideological beliefs soon drew him close to fellow Christian Socialist, Norman Thomas and the rest of the Socialist Party of America. In 1930, Hoopes was elected to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, where his most celebrated accomplishment was completely outlawing child labor in his home state. Much like it did to Thomas, the outbreak of the civil war disgusted Hoopes. Although he could not deny its accomplishments in hindsight, his political cause after the war was to champion reconstruction and reconciliation between Americans. This benevolent, reformative platform earned him more and more influence in the new America, allowing him to make a bid for the presidency."
POLITICS_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "Marine, General, and Senator Smedley Butler has done the unthinkable. In the revolution's darkest moment, he has overthrown the would-be usurpers and traitors in the Centralist clique, and kept the flame of liberty alive. The old general has been an invaluable warrior for the Combined Syndicates, and his latest startling victory has endeared him to the population tenfold. Although Butler has confided to friends and political allies that he is uneasy to now be in the spotlight, he has agreed to take on the job as the temporarily acting president of the new America until the scars torn open by totalism can once again be healed."
POLITICS_PRESIDENT_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "A Marine, a General, and even a Senator, Smedly Butler has not been idle in recent years. Few expected, though, that he would ascend to the presidency, but this shocking turn of events has occurred. With the war over, Butler has committed himself to the political realm, becoming the country's leader militarily as well as politically. He considers himself a part of the Nationalist faction, having been inspired by Bellamy's ideas in his earlier years, and will now work to advance their platform on the national stage. Many have likened him to George Washington, and it is certainly true that the two war heroes have led the country through the hardships of their times with immense support behind them. With this support and Butler's own determination, there is no doubt he will bring his vision to life."
POLITICS_JAMES_BURNHAM_DESC:0 "A fellow-travelor of the far-left ever since he's been politically active, James Burnham began as a starry-eyed supporter of the Russian Revolution before seeing it quashed. His hope in socialism was revitalized with the British and French Revolutions only to witness the Empires of old not only persist but reform themselves internally. Influenced by French Sorelianism and his personal readings of Machiavelli he has come to view politics as largely a power struggle between competing elites with revolutions only temporarily succeeding in nations that failed to modernize their elite into a "Managerialist" class as opposed to the aristocrats and capitalists of old. Viewing imperialist expansion as an inevitable consequence of their growing bureaucracies and promotion of national myths Burnham is dismayed by what he views as the infighting and factionalism promoted by traditional syndicalism and views socialism's only hope as being the promotion of a highly technocratic-oriented leadership alongside an American Nationalism that shall glue the nation together where socialism can not. His American Workers Party (AWP) is currently a combination of his followers who de facto left the SPA's Federalist faction with him, Lovestoneites, national-syndicalists and Howard Scott's Technocratic Movement. While the latter has questionable loyalties to socialism he has promised to place them in charge of the economy in return for allowing him to run the political sphere in the power-oriented method he views as necessary."
POLITICS_CAPONE_DESC:0"Alphonse Gabriel Capone, known more commonly as “Al Capone”, was born in New York City to Italian immigrants. His upbringing was tough, the streets of Brooklyn shaped his world views whilst his Catholic upbringing taught him that morals matter little in the modern world. Capone understood from a young age that in order to survive you have to be ruthless, the cutthroat world of business carved Capone into a prominent businessman profiteering off prohibition. Bootlegging proved successful and Capone expanded his growing empire into Chicago from where he took over failing businesses wrecked by economic stagnation. He also never forgot his roots and used his newfound wealth to set up soup kitchens for the homeless and provide honest work for the jobless. Despite accusations of involving himself with gangs and all sorts of illegal matters he developed a reputation amongst the working class as a “man of the people”. Capone became a prominent supporter of labour unions, especially the IWW, when the Second Civil War broke out Capone launched himself into politics. Aligning himself to the Centralist Faction, advocating for union control over all aspects of life he has clashed with anarcho-syndicalists who accuse him of being a potential dictator. Furthermore his gang affiliations have once again struck his credibility, accusations have emerged of Capone using the Chicago Mafia to intimidate political opponents. Now in control of the CSA, this bootlegging businessman turned defender of proletariat must decide the future of America and socialism."
POLITICS_BIG_BILL_HAYWOOD_DESC:0 "If there ever was a man to represent the power of the working class, it would be William Haywood. Haywood has seen all corners of the country and lived alongside the working man. Haywood opposed Craft Unionism, which he felt could be divided and conquered by Capital. Instead founding one union, the International Workers of the World, meant to represent all working interests.  As the founder of the IWW, 'Big Bill' has battled the enemies of the people throughout his life: The capitalist opportunists, the labor slavehandlers, and even agents of the government. Quick to anger and unafraid of action, Haywood is the Man for Labor and the Man for America."
POLITICS_HOWARD_SCOTT_DESC:0 "Ever the enigmatic figure, nicknamed ‘The Mysterious Young Man’ by many during his initial rise, Howard Scott has risen to lead a new America bathed in the crimson glow of his Technocratic dream. Born in Virginia in 1890, little else is known about Scott’s background and early life other than that he never finished high school but somehow also claims to have studied and graduated from Columbia University in New York - a claim supported by his lifelong friend and fellow Technocrat M. King Hubbert. Working in NYC in various construction camps, he picked up on-the-job engineering experience, growing into a kind of ‘Bohemian engineer.’ With newfound experience and drive, he worked together with Hubbart, and the pair worked for the IWW before they embarked to create Technocracy Incorporated, but that was after the failure of Scott’s earlier attempt at spreading his ingenious message with his defunct Technical Alliance. Now, with the Revolution under his command after the failures and tyranny of his former ally Lovestone were revealed, Director in Chief Scott shall lead this new America under the Monad of Technocracy towards an efficient and prosperous utopia supported by syncretic Socialist views and the rest of America’s non-authoritarian vanguard."
POLITICS_HOAN_DESC:0 "Daniel Webster Hoan is one of the enduring figures of the American left - born in Waukesha, Wisconsin on March 12, 1881, Hoan enrolled in the University of Wisconsin and swiftly laid out the foundation for the university's Socialist Club, back when it had a mere four members. Hoan was admitted to the state bar in 1908 and moved to Milwaukee, where the longtime Socialist Party member began working with Victor Berger, editor of The Milwaukee Leader, in advocating for radical reforms to the city: public ownership of utilities, urban development programs, free legal, medical, and educational services, and other policies widely unheard of in most of the country. Hoan decided to enter politics by running for city attorney in 1910, where he edged out a plurality against both Democratic and Republican opponents - in the same year, Emil Seidel was elected mayor of Milwaukee, the first socialist to leader to a major American city. In 1916, Hoan succeeded him as mayor, a position that he continued to hold all the way until the Second Civil War. As mayor, Hoan codified what is sometimes called 'constructive socialism', emphasising practical reforms over haughty revolutionary ideals - some more itinerant socialists derisively called the Milwaukee branch members 'sewer socialists' for their constant touting of their city's sewer system.\n\nHoan silenced most doubts to his commitment during the war, proving invaluable to organising the Milwaukee war effort. With the revolution won and the Socialist Party's factions diverging, Hoan was expected to remain loyal to the moderate party core - however, shocking some observers, the breakaway Workers' Party declared that they would nominate him as their candidate for President in the 1940 elections. More astute observers noted that Hoan had not always gotten along with other Socialists during his time with the party, and that he didn’t seem to share the remaining membership’s pacifist tendencies. Whatever the reason, Hoan provides c ...
POLITICS_ZEIDLER_DESC:0 "Frank Paul Zeidler, born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 12, 1912, has spent much of his life in poor health - an unfortunate reality that prevented him from completing his studies. Perhaps because of this, Zeidler was drawn to socialism from a young age - growing up in the throes of the Great Depression, Zeidler read extensively from left-wing writers like Norman Thomas and Eugene V. Debs. When asked about his reasons for supporting socialism in 1933, Zeidler cited the tenets of international brotherhood, the struggle for peace, equal distribution of goods, cooperation, and democratic planning. He would become active in the Socialist Party of America's youth wing, the Young People's Socialist League, and shortly before the civil war became the head of the Milwaukee branch of the Red Falcons, another SPA organisation aimed at educating children. Frank was aided in his activist work by his brother, Carl Zeidler, who would go on to volunteer for the navy of the Combined Syndicates, only to die in the effort.\n\nDespite his perpetual sickly health and the untimely death of his brother, Zeidler did what he could to support the Syndicate war effort on the home front, and attended the constitutional convention on the behalf of Milwaukee mayor Daniel Hoan. In the post-war political scene, Zeidler was seen as relatively neutral figure (outside of his disdain for the Unity League), and was tapped by the Workers' Party to be the successor to President Flynn largely for this reason - after all, the WPA holds dearly to the idea of a symbolic executive, and the martyrdom of his brother generates much sympathy among veterans of the revolution. Only 36 years old on his election, President Zeidler comes in as a symbol of the unity between the senior professional revolutionaries and a generation of young socialists that have swiftly been maturing with the new America."

CSA_social_revolution:0 "Social Revolution"
CSA_social_revolution_desc:0 "The land of the free and the home of the brave was anything but, we have our work cut out for us to rid America of corruption, racism and chauvinism. Yet first we must tear up the very core of all these things, the capitalist system itself!"
CSA_redistribute_wealth:0 "Redistribute Wealth"
CSA_redistribute_wealth_desc:0 "We will no longer tolerate a social order wherein men who do absolutely nothing useful can amass millions of dollars, while millions of proletariats who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough to prolong a wretched existence. The end of the banks, corporations and hoarders is finally here as we dip into the wealth reserves of our enemies and redistribute them to the population."
CSA_homes_for_the_people:0 "Homes for the People"
CSA_homes_for_the_people_desc:0 "Landlords and real estate tycoons have been a plague upon this nation. Let us lift the poor and starving from their slums, now that the rich and mighty have been driven from their seats of power."
CSA_emancipation_for_all:0 "New Legal Equality"
CSA_emancipation_for_all_desc:0 "Foolish and vain is the workingman who makes the color of his skin the stepping-stone to his imaginary superiority. Proletariat of all colors and creed fought and bled to build our new America. The loyal immigrant shall also be afforded Natural Born Citizenship in the spirit of emancipation."
CSA_womens_liberation:0 "Women's Liberation"
CSA_womens_liberation_desc:0 "With the men dying on the front lines, it fell to the women to run the factories, build the munitions and feed our revolution! That's to say nothing for the many nurses, pilots and female Red Guard members who gave their all. Their sacrifices and struggles will not have been in vain."
CSA_revolutionary_education:0 "Revolutionary Education"
CSA_revolutionary_education_desc:0 "Academia has been the nurturing mother of many revolutionaries, but the education system itself is still inherently reactionary. In all of America's history, it was built to produce more obedient workers, more crooked capitalists and heartless politicians. That ends now!"
CSA_reconstruction:0 "Begin Reconstruction"
CSA_reconstruction_desc:0 "The civil war has blasted our country to pieces. Large parts of the rural country are naught but mud and ashes, while countless cities have been reduced to smoldering rubble. We shall set to work developing new housing and infrastructure as soon as possible."
CSA_deal_with_feds:0 "Deal with the Feds"
CSA_deal_with_feds_desc:0 "Since the revolution broke out, we've accumulated an extensive list of political prisoners whom are awaiting trial. Now that the war is over, the time to judge these men has finally come. Although some amongst our leadership believes in rehabilitating these captives, other more radical comrades are eagerly calling for extreme revolutionary justice."
CSA_transformitive_justice:0 "Transformative Justice"
CSA_transformitive_justice_desc:0 "Although we've firmly dealt with the old American elite, there's still a sizable popular movement opposing our new regime. We'll need to pacify any remaining counter-revolutionary cells, and make sure to track down every last infiltrator in our midst before we can finally be sure we've won."
CSA_deal_with_firsters:0 "Deal with the ODP"
CSA_deal_with_firsters_desc:0 "The ODP's foul crew of reactionary demagogues, nationalists and tyrannical generals will finally stand on trial. Although Murray himself has escaped capture, we'll eagerly dish out a fair punishment to everyone who collaborated with him."
CSA_destroy_jim_crow:0 "Destroy Jim Crow"
CSA_destroy_jim_crow_desc:0 "Ridding ourselves of the southern terrorists will not just be a matter of military might.

CSA_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "The crimes of this guilty nation seem to finally have been washed away, even if it took blood and fire to break the old system. We have brought to birth a new world from the ashes of the old. A land of free, equal and prosperous laborers!"
CSA_a_new_america:0 "A New America"
CSA_a_new_america_desc:0 "All the world that's owned by idle drones is ours and ours alone. We have laid the wide foundations, built it skyward stone by stone. It is ours, not to slave in, but to master and to own. For the Union makes us strong!"
CSA_expanded_investments:0 "The Roads to the Revolution"
CSA_expanded_investments_desc:0 "We should invest in a new road system in this country. Creating a national highway system and hiring scores of workers to build it would help our economy immensely. Perhaps it will be enough to propel us out of our economic troubles entirely, but time will tell." 
CSA_illegalize_racism:0 "Racial Liberation"
CSA_illegalize_racism_desc:0 "We have liberated the working class, but what of the millions of abused minority citizens in our country? Anything short of criminalization of racism will fall short of what we want to achieve. Jim Crow is dead, felled by the mighty American proletariat."

### American Commonwealth Focuses ###
CSA_second_convention:0 "Second Constitutional Convention"
CSA_second_convention_desc:0 "The time has come to decide the next step in our revolutionary struggle, to find a way to unite workers behind a single cause and ideology. Although our delegates come from a wide variety of unions and communes, we hope for a consensus on the future of socialist government. Like it was, over a century ago, we shall let Philadelphia be the site of a Constitutional Convention!"
CSA_american_commonwealth:0 "Commonwealth of America"
CSA_american_commonwealth_desc:0 "We did not come this far just to fall back into tyranny, our monumental support in the Constitutional Convention has shown that Union-based Socialism will reign, and building on the nationalism of Bellamy, we will guarantee social and economic freedom for all workers and toilers of our nation!"
CSA_protect_the_working_class:0 "Protect the Working Class"
CSA_protect_the_working_class_desc:0 "While many new ideas for a better economic system have existed in theory in America, the turmoil of the civil war made putting any of them into practice a difficult endeavour. Now though, we have ample time and opportunity to build the working man's democracy through Amendments protecting worker rights."
CSA_empower_councils:0 "Townhall Democracy"
CSA_empower_councils_desc:0 "The new Commonwealth cannot be built through authoritarian means, we must pursue a better class character for our democracy. Through laws empowering grassroots engagement and town hall meetings, political decisions will no longer be a distant murmur on Capitol Hill, they will be right amongst the workers!"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee:0 "Craft Union Committee"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee_desc:0 "Reforming the capitalist system will be a herculean task, and it can't merely be wished away with state quotas and economic plans. Congress now begins assembling local representatives of Craft Unions in order to determine the best fit for economic growth while protecting professional workers from obsolescence. "
CSA_councilism:0 "Councilism"
CSA_councilism_desc:0 "Maintaining America's old bureaucracy is pointless. A compromise between the Craft and Industrial Unions was in the implementation of decentralized worker councils. These Councils will allow states to exert autonomous power in how unions are organized."
CSA_power_to_the_people:0 "Power to the People"
CSA_power_to_the_people_desc:0 "Perhaps for the first time in our nation's history, true democracy is flourishing. Not the illusion of freedom, concocted by corrupted politicians and greedy businessmen, but real direct democratic means of governing our new Commonwealth! We enshrine this power in the unassailable Amendments."
CSA_federalism:0 "Federalism"
CSA_federalism_desc:0 "Even if the old United States was home to political corruption, gerrymandering and inefficient bureaucracy, its administrative system is an unshakable cornerstone of our national identity. With compromise between trade unionism and radical thought impossible, we must rely on this cornerstone as the first American revolutionaries did."
CSA_unite_unskilled_labour_in_flus:0 "Unite Unskilled Labor in FLUs"
CSA_unite_unskilled_labour_in_flus_desc:0 "With our victory, the task of quickly organizing the American workforce falls upon us. While traditional craft unions have presented little issue, industrial unions have become a focal point. The craft union base has long resisted industrial unionism, leading to the split with the CIO. However, now it is time for these sectors to be incorporated. To achieve this, Federal Trade Unions have been planned as a middle ground, ensuring that we stay rooted in our principles while also not allowing these workers to be seized by radicals."
CSA_nation_united_in_brotherhoods_guilds_and_unions:0 "United in Brotherhoods, Guilds and Unions"
CSA_nation_united_in_brotherhoods_guilds_and_unions_desc:0 "The iron chains of One Big Unionism are doomed to fall apart under the stress of its own despotism and the IWW with it. The many different groups that built our union are held together by the fragile ties of federalism, allowing each industry enough autonomy to organize according to its needs. The bond between the different guilds, industrial organizations, and unions that built our great union have only been fortified by war and their own shared commitment to collective bargaining."
CSA_resolve_bscp_and_wtul_pressure:0 "Resolve BSCP and WTUL Pressure"
CSA_resolve_bscp_and_wtul_pressure_desc:0 "During the Civil War, the SPA under Haywood witnessed the entry of women and black workers into the workforce and the army without the restrictions ever seen before. Now, with workers returning from the front, the AFL faces the question of how to address the organized workforce of those who had been excluded from mainstream craft union organization since the birth of trade unionism on this land."
CSA_business_unionism_enforced_by_delegates:0 "Business Unionism Enforced by Delegates"
CSA_business_unionism_enforced_by_delegates_desc:0 "Many within the Combined Syndicates mock the idea of 'Business Unionism', calling it a betrayal of the revolution. What they fail to realize is that with 200 years of Capitalism in America, we will need an intermediary economy to ease the transition into socialism. Thus, Congress has ended state-controlled pricing passed under Haywood."
CSA_syndicalism_without_radicalism:0 "Unionized Politics Stripped of Radicalism"
CSA_syndicalism_without_radicalism_desc:0 "Dubinsky has struggled against the radical stream since his first position of power in the executive of the ILGWU. Now, as the president, he faces a renewed and stronger front than ever seen before. With infiltration being met with expulsions, the progressive balance of the AFL will not be unbalanced by outside influence."
CSA_labour_rewards_its_friends:0 "Labor Rewards its Friends"
CSA_labour_rewards_its_friends_desc:0 "\"As one voice labor must speak - to reward its friends and punish its enemies.\"Lewis is Renowned for his firm stance in resolving disputes, once withholding the nation's coal supply during negotiations. To ensure Lewis that Industrial unions maintain their dominance over the old craft unions, a combination of diplomatic rhetoric and unwavering resolve will be used."
CSA_maintain_craft_union_primacy:0 "Maintain Craft Union Primacy"
CSA_maintain_craft_union_primacy_desc:0 "Despite President Green's own misgivings, the AFL was founded on the principles of craft unionism. While we may adopt some measures to appease the CIO, along with the newly registered federal labor unions, such as allowing them the vote, we will not deviate from our course. The executive will remain in craft union hands."
CSA_establish_jurisdiction_departments:0 "Establish Jurisdiction Departments"
CSA_establish_jurisdiction_departments_desc:0 "There has been a mass of union raiding the affiliates and radicals seeking to carve up the working men of this nation for support. Whether against rival trade unions inside the AFL or radicalized unions this state of affairs will not continue. AFL affiliates will no longer be permitted to raid others under penalty of being disaffiliated, and justice departments will be set up to determine which union has a claim to particular workplaces."
CSA_nationalize_public_utilities:0 "Nationalize Public Utilities"
CSA_nationalize_public_utilities_desc:0 "Public Enterprises were for a long time shunned in America, as countless of our old presidents were beholden to the will of Big Business over their electorate. As we've now broken the yoke of corporations, Congress has finally legalized mass use of public ownership, allowing the nationalization of many utilities and certain linked industries as well as the creation of publicly owned enterprises. Rooseveltism and conservationists only hold us back!"
CSA_protectionism_for_the_american_labourer:0 "Protectionism for the American Laborer"
CSA_protectionism_for_the_american_labourer_desc:0 "The Councils of Professional Workers have concluded that a protectionist policy towards American goods is in order, but not as drastic as the old Smoot Hawley Tariff Act. A softer approach will see increased tax breaks for unions that operate solely in the states, as well as a propaganda push to 'Buy American' as we should have done during the first Weltkrieg."
CSA_high_wages:0 "Fair Day's Pay"
CSA_high_wages_desc:0 "A high minimum wage and the government intervening more directly on behalf of collective bargaining will ensure high pay for hard work done, for if you can't pay it then you have no right hiring men's labor to begin with."
CSA_paid_vacations:0 "For a Fair Day's Work"
CSA_paid_vacations_desc:0 "The 8-8-8 movement understood that a man needs his leisure and rest. As such 8 hour work days and five day work weeks are now the maximum and six-week paid vacations are guaranteed by our government, creating a life of luxury for our workers."
CSA_gompers_legacy:0 "Gompers' Legacy Enshrined"
CSA_gompers_legacy_desc:0 "Gompers' vision, rooted in the principles of labor rights and federalism, remains influential in contemporary governance, informing our response to challenges like the failures of the IWW. As we navigate complex societal issues, his legacy serves as a beacon of wisdom. Elevating his honor in society underscores the enduring importance of his ideals and their impact on shaping our collective consciousness. "
CSA_foster_moderate_support:0 "Foster Moderate Support"
CSA_foster_moderate_support_desc:0 "Political Moderates remain fearful of our commonwealth, believing socialists are on a campaign to destroy their rights in America. We will reassure them otherwise, reassuring them that we are not out to destroy them. A series of pardons for relatively harmless moderates the Red Guards wrongfully imprisoned or exiled followed by a reassurance that the AFL stands against Collectivist-Syndicalist and radical anarchist ideals will greatly help."
CSA_the_closed_shop:0 "Enforce the Closed Shop"
CSA_the_closed_shop_desc:0 "The old capitalists foolishly, and greedily, believed they could simply pay the worker a dime a day while outlawing unions as they popped up. This will never repeat itself, as all workers who join a listed major or public industry, or one of the scattered but blossoming workers' co-ops, are required to join a union, and hiring non-union workers is now illegal. Meanwhile, we will work with unions to ensure ease of access for the worker."
CSA_publicly_guided_investment:0 "Popularize Union-Owned Banks"
CSA_publicly_guided_investment_desc:0 "Capital Investments emphasize acquiring capital goods for industry and farming, something the government needs to be more directly involved in, especially with our high-tax rates and control over capitalists. Investments, imports and research should aid in this after the Treasury is tasked with it. Expanding existing union owned banks like Sidney Hillman's amalgamated bank will ensure that the great depression will never happen again."
CSA_distribute_union_media:0 "Expand the American Federationist"
CSA_distribute_union_media_desc:0 "Outlets like the Philadelphia Tocsin, Haverhill Labor, the Brooklyn Labor Press, the Denver Labor Enquirer, and the Forward have had their coffers swelled. Many of our chartered unions have opened outlets of their own. This new voice we use to speak to the nation will be used in concert to further the national interest. We need to remind Americans that we and they are patriots, willing to defend their nation! A recruitment campaign will emphasize the role in the military and the pro-American unions that are quintessential in this."
CSA_protect_the_workers_right_to_drink:0 "Protect the Workers Right to Drink"
CSA_protect_the_workers_right_to_drink_desc:0 "Disguised as progressivism, the prohibition movement has consistently undermined workers, criminalizing bartenders and brewers while fostering crime. It also violated basic freedoms by denying individuals the right to drink. It's time to repeal these archaic laws nationwide and restore personal liberties and workers' rights ripping its vile tendrils out of local and state enforcement."
CSA_democracy_rights_trade_unionism:0 "Human Rights and Trade Unionism"
CSA_democracy_rights_trade_unionism_desc:0 "With the passing of the torch, a new generation leads the union. Veterans of the struggles during the Great Depression and the civil rights movement, they represent the youthful spirit of the new America.

Firmly rooted in the trade unionist traditions that built this nation, it has been reshaped as a hub of industry. Emerging from the scars of war, a new social contract between classes has been forged. Though the journey was marked by years of struggle, the outcome is evident in every household, where the fear of want no longer looms over Americans' minds."

CSA_broad_appeals_to_the_lost_generation_desc:0 "Ernest Miller Hemingway's unexpected election as the presidential face of the union marks a significant shift toward a broader political base. Although undoubtedly a socialist, Hemingway transcends mere political labels, embodying the cultural essence of the lost generation of the Civil War. His writing and ideals epitomize rugged masculine individualism intertwined with paternalistic socialism, resonating across old battle lines and garnering widespread support."

CSA_incumbent_stays_the_course_desc:0 "Given the continued political dominance of our union and the popularity of its president, it would be idiotic to elect a new face. While it's unprecedented for a president to hold office for more than two terms, even in the reactionary republic of old it was legal. Our union stands on the backbone of the people's will, and with their support, the president's agenda will persist for another four years, solidifying their vision of trade unionism even further."

CSA_workers_self_managment_desc:0 "A great goal of this Congress is to remove the old hierarchies which permeated American workplaces.

CSA_economies_of_scale_desc:0 "It is obvious that part of why capitalism tends toward oligarchy is because of economies of scale making for cheaper production costs that gives an edge over the small businessman.

CSA_lead_the_revolution:0 "Lead The Revolution"
CSA_lead_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Vanguardist America is a centrist nation, not subject to IWW mob rule or AFL backsliding. Thankfully our loyal Craft Unions and anti-Judiciary advocates understand this. Making sure that our new Union does not collapse into infighting, reaction will be the first agenda of our new government."
CSA_peoples_commisars:0 "People's Commissars"
CSA_peoples_commisars_desc:0 "Already during the civil war, we had many militias, communes and syndicates adopting a system of Political Commissars.

Congress has allowed these commissars under direct state control, and expanded the system nationwide."
CSA_control_townhalls:0 "Sign the Hall-Ballam Act"
CSA_control_townhalls_desc:0 "The issue of loyalty is becoming a wedge that is beginning to drive Congress apart.

This law ensures the safety of all by prosecuting those in politics guilty of treason in any form."
CSA_politics:0 "Democratic Centralism"
CSA_politics_desc:0 "The concept of Democratic Centralism where once a decision is made by the Central Committee then it must be followed by those lower within the party and government.

CSA_communist_party:0 "Empowering the Executive"
CSA_communist_party_desc:0 "Despite our centralization of power, there's still some squabbling amongst Congress. We cannot progress if the IWW, AFL, KoL and all the acronyms squabble. Don't they realize the Vanguard is the centrist position, and we are the only things keeping the revolution from tearing itself apart. Thus goes the anarchistic wall to wall elections of the IWW."
CSA_proletarian_dictatorship:0 "Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
CSA_proletarian_dictatorship_desc:0 "Everything we have achieved so far has been won with violence and force, the bourgeoisie thought still clinging to America cannot be voted away, it cannot be debated or discussed away, it must simply be destroyed.

CSA_union_managment:0 "Protect Craft Unions"
CSA_union_managment_desc:0 "The Trade Unions perform a very important function within our economy.

CSA_collective_farming:0 "Green Fields Program"
CSA_collective_farming_desc:0 "The Committee has approved of the Green Fields Program to the millions of acres of seized land. This is seen by the public as preferable to collectivisation, as it brings back the competitive spirit in land acquisition.

CSA_price_controls:0 "Price Controls"
CSA_price_controls_desc:0 "It is characteristic of capitalism that when its economic machinery enters a crisis, the explanation is immediately found not in lack of production, but in overproduction. We shall avoid the tragedy of burning crops we saw during the revolution through Committee-decided price limits and expropriation of unused surplus."
CSA_control_unions:0 "End Dual Unionism"
CSA_control_unions_desc:0 "The IWW, though noble in concept, had the ultimate result of isolating the class-conscious workers from the leadership of the revolution, the Vanguard Party. Their continued influence threatens not only our rule, but the entire stability of new America. The true constituents of the USAS, the people, see that Vanguardism represents their interests better."
CSA_state_farms:0 "Collective Farms"
CSA_state_farms_desc:0 "The State agriculture organization is now grouped under the Committee's Commissariat of Agriculture, and is formed into trusts for individual crops and geographical divisions of the industry.

CSA_state_quotas:0 "State Quotas"
CSA_state_quotas_desc:0 "Introducing quotas makes maximum utilization of all the productive forces, men and machinery, and constantly raises the level of performance by the systematic application of scientific principles.

CSA_state_media_desc:0 "The Daily Worker, Hollywood, and now the radio have all been seized by the Artists' Congress by the CC's graces. Under the tutelage of such illuminary socialist thinkers such as Hemingway, Welles, and Hughes, all the world will know of the American Socialist revolution."

CSA_friendly_media:0 "A Socialist Friendly Media"
CSA_friendly_media_desc:0 "The existing systems of media within the CSA and much moreso the former USA are still somewhat confused as to their relationship with the state. Allowing multiple sources of media is more than acceptable so long as they are loyal to American Socialism and our government. We have our agents privately inform them of those willing to listen and quietly shut down those opposed to the American worker's new government."
CSA_presidential_socialism:0 "Centralized Socialism"

CSA_american_communism:0 "Apple Pie Communism"
CSA_american_communism_desc:0 "On both sides of the aisle, there are those who believed that a syndicalist economy striving towards a communist ideal were incompatible with Americanism. They were wrong. We will teach American students that communism is a continuation of the American Revolution and have state sponsored holidays that will be socialized variants of existing American traditions."
CSA_commune_policy:0 "Deal with the Communes"
CSA_commune_policy_desc:0 "Communes still exist throughout the Socialist Republic but the fact they are not paying into our system while enjoying our protection or spreading hostile propaganda is a problem.

CSA_purge_the_stubborn:0 "Asserting the Apparatus"
CSA_purge_the_stubborn_desc:0 "We have built a powerful state capable of defending itself from reactionaries who would undo socialism and extremists who would undo the state.

CSA_reform_the_iww:0 "Restructure the IWW"
CSA_reform_the_iww_desc:0 "The IWW has done much to help defend the working man and establish the socialist republic, but there can be no doubt dangerous radicals and critics wish to see it destroyed or replaced with their own organizations.

CSA_industrial_build_up:0 "Strength Through Industry"

CSA_practical_trade:0 "Practical Trade"
CSA_practical_trade_desc:0 "Our politicians hold mixed views on trade. Some promote tariffs while other promote a more free trade system. Browder has decided to forge a middle ground between the two.

CSA_the_boss:0 "The Boss"
CSA_the_boss_desc:0 "Earl Browder has successfully maneuvered his way to ultimate power. This is not a bad thing; he has endeared himself to the people, so much so that they call him "The Boss".

CSA_subdue_bourgeousie_desc:0 "The American aristocracy is a freak creation of capitalism. This country was never meant to have nobility or royalty. We should bring them to heel, and make sure they pay the taxes we demand from them. If they resist, we'll just have to ask a different way."

CSA_popular_front_desc:0 "We have prevailed over our political rivals, but Browder believes we still need their support, and more specifically, to encourage them to come to our side.

CSA_purge_other_leftists:0 "Destroy Social Capitalism"
CSA_purge_other_leftists_desc:0 "Social Capitalism is the greatest hoodwink the capitalists have come up with yet, for socialism and capitalism are not compatible, class conflict is inevitable and those attempt to preserve capitalism have chosen their side.

CSA_smash_americanism:0 "Strike the Superstructure"
CSA_smash_americanism_desc:0 "Remnants of the Superstructure still continue to harm class solidarity thanks to capitalist, reactionary, and nationalist rhetoric.

CSA_the_great_sprint:0 "Hasten the Grand Reconstruction"
CSA_the_great_sprint_desc:0 "Damage done to industry during the Civil War is bad enough, but perhaps worse yet was the refusal of capitalists to industrialize or build infrastructure in areas that were 'unprofitable'.

CSA_socialist_incentives:0 "Vanguardist Incentives"

CSA_seavey_victory:0 "Seavey Sets Sail with the Libertalian Idyll"
CSA_seavey_victory_desc:0 "Surprising many within the Caponeist Congress as the radical and sea-soaked newcomer to the stage, ‘Roaring’ Dan Seavey - leading admiral of the Scarfaces’s Navy, storied pirate captain of the Great Lakes, former U.S. Marshal, and expert thief, human trafficker, poacher, smuggler, hijacker, and sailor - has taken the helm of the revolution with the help of his allies in the Red Navy, commanding the Caponeist regime like a stalwart yet salty and unpredictable captain commands his mighty ship. With few allies within the traditional Caponeist power structure but a dear friend and loyalist to the late Scarface nonetheless, Captain Seavey seeks to create a form of ‘Neo-Caponeism’ that keeps his old captain’s final wishes intact while putting a nautical spin on things, gearing up the nation to become the dominant naval power on the planet while creating an egalitarian pirate’s paradise based on the Libertalian myths of old."

CSA_nautical_shift:0 "A Nautical Course Correction"
CSA_nautical_shift_desc:0 "Taking his life as a pirate and sailor to heart in his new position at the helm of the Caponeist revolution, Captain ‘Roaring’ Dan Seavey shall shift the Organization’s focus towards the Seven Seas and beyond as the nation begins to focus on the endless and untapped bounty of maritime crime and seaborne profits, through both piracy and Seavey’s other criminal ventures like human trafficking, smuggling, nautical hijackings, impressment, prostitution, bootlegging, and so much more, and more legitimate ventures like aquaculture, fishing, and shipbuilding. Despite this nautical change in course, Seavey is dedicated to his old friend and business partner Scarface, and shall otherwise stay largely loyal to the Caponeist ideology put forth by our late patriarch."

Aimed at becoming the greatest, largest, and most advanced fleet in the world with dedicated flotillas for maritime and submarine piracy and even aeronautical smuggling thanks to innovations in fleet-borne aircraft, in addition to more traditional roles and operations fitting of a national fleet, the Great Red Fleet shall become the main arm of the Caponeist dream and Seavey’s wild ambition, protecting our domestic, foreign, and criminal interests in waters across the planet without fear of being matched or outgunned."

CSA_maritime_freedom:0 "Bring Maritime Freedom to Shore"
CSA_maritime_freedom_desc:0 "The high seas and international waters are known for their free atmosphere and general lack of enforceable laws, especially for pirates and other nautical criminals, along with a far more relaxed, uninhibited, and open social culture as well. With influences from Left Libertarianism as well from this reputation of the lawless and wild high seas, we shall bring these freedoms and the wider sailor culture to the shores and farthest interiors of America, giving all a taste of the unshackled and unburdened life a seaman lives while out on the Seven Seas. "

CSA_roaring_dan:0 "Roaring Dan's Own Cult of Personality"
CSA_roaring_dan_desc:0 "With a massive ego all his own to rival even Capone’s, Roaring Dan has moved to elevate himself to an equal position relative to the late Big Fella as he seeks to create his own pirate-themed and nautically-based cult of personality around himself to rival Scarface’s while cementing himself not only as Capone’s ‘loyal’ successor, but also as his equal. Overexaggerating his many exploits at sea while likening himself to a modern Black Beard, James Mission, or Henry Morgan, but with Robin Hood-esque qualities and a knack for organized crime, Captain ‘Roaring’ Dan Seavey shall move heaven and earth to make himself truly larger than life, no matter the cost, in order to ensure his rule and enshrine his legacy."

CSA_red_jolly_roger_desc:0 "Like the egalitarian pirate paradise Libertalia, or Libertatia, purported to once exist on the isle of Madagascar, this new America under Captain ‘Roaring’ Dan Seavey and his coalition of loyal Caponeists, nautical union workers, navy veterans, and private sailors has created a utopia fit for any true pirate worth their weight in salt, citrus, and rum. At the head of the Great Red Fleet, the Jolly Red Roger of Admiral Seavey flies high for the world to sea as all must learn to fear and pay tribute to a world populated by ingenious and effective pirates once again. Though the Seavey has changed the goals and outlook of the state, the core Caponeist principles and idyll remains intact as his criminal empire only continues to grow and diversify towards new profit margins and new shores, all for the good of the Organization, and for Seavey’s own pile of plunder and booty in this red thalassocracy of his own design."

CSA_bonnie_clyde_victory:0 "Bonnie and Clyde Set Caponeism Free"
CSA_bonnie_clyde_victory_desc:0 "The dynamic duo of inseparable lovebirds and jailbirds Bonnie Elizabeth Parker and Clyde Chestnut Champion Barrow - better known simply as Bonnie and Clyde - have seized control of the revolution by utilizing growing dissent with the Party that has risen over the regime’s over-reliance on totalitarianism and pseudo-policing that flew in the face of the original promise of a free criminal paradise, and now they seek to truly set Caponeism free as was always planned, but with the glories of Illegalist Anarchism and Libertarian Socialism based on criminal activity instead of the faux-Communism Capone tried to shove down America’s throat. Working with their new ally, the French Illegalist exile Rene Belbenoit, these Texas-borne radicals and infamously expert bank robbers will break the totalitarian chains that bound the American people and replace it with the bloody, beautiful, and freeing vacuum of total statelessness, along with all the lawless freedom that comes with their particular breed of lovely Anarchism, creating a new, isolated, and free Wild West-like atmosphere divorced from authoritarianism and state tyranny to support the purified Caponeist dream - that is unless Belbenoit and his Egoist allies in the Third Internationale don’t shatter this isolationist dream first."

Seeking to free society from all forms of tyranny perpetrated by the State, by society, or by the culture or zeitgeist of modern civilization, while emphasizing the individual and their will over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems, and promoting individual freedoms and rights over all other pursuits, all maintained at the barrel of Bonnie and Clyde’s tommy guns."

Breaking from the isolationist ideas of Bonnie and Clyde while infusing the Egoist ideas of Max Stirner and the Bonnot Gang of Jules Bonnot into the Anarchist system, Belbenoit shall create a new criminal state that treats individual self-interest, and the other self-fulfilling ambitions and desires of each individual and equal person as the absolute foundation of morality, one’s own existence, and one’s own place in wider society, creating a lawless state thriving on survival of the fittest and the whims of each individual, all totally free to do as they please in a barely contained system free of state tyranny and most oversight - the only such oversight coming from Belbenoit and his engorged gang that shall absorb and take the place of the old Caponeist regime."

Propaganda of the Deed, or Propaganda by the Deed, is the political stance that believes that direct revolutionary action shall be exemplary to others and serve as a catalyst for spontaneous mass actions and revolution, while Individual Reclamation states that all those involved in the revolution must perform the direct action of individual theft and retribution against the elites and other individuals that have wronged you in the past in order to truly enact revolutionary justice against those pigs that deserve it the most, again furthering the goals of the anarchist dream. With these two principles being taught to the masses through exemplary direct action and public awareness campaigns, we shall involve each and every true American and Caponeist in on the action as we transform society into an Anarchist utopia."

We shall prove to the masses that Capone believed in our Illegalist message one way or another in order to get the surviving Caponeists on our side at last as we co-opt Scarface’s personality cult for our own purposes, removing all opposition to the creation of our network of autonomous Illegalist criminal communities and private communes without having to kill every former mobster bureaucrat and mafioso leader that knows how to run a semi-functioning society."

### Butler's Coup ###
CSA_butler_coup:0 "Butler's Coup"
CSA_butler_coup_desc:0 "Smedley Butler, seeing the destructive nature of William Foster's leadership, has decided to lead a coup against the Centralist government. He now controls the country with the help of the Red Army. For now, Butler will remain in charge, though there will still be elections on the local and state level. There are also still debates about the role of the military in the federal government, but more than anything, the country needs stability."
CSA_populist_appeals:0 "Populist Appeals"
CSA_populist_appeals_desc:0 "Butler agrees with the Nationalist faction, and to a lesser degree, the Federalists, on policy grounds. It is a natural next step, then, to demonstrate to our people that Butler is in line with their thinking. This will hopefully ease the anxious minds that have watched our coup with suspicion. In both rhetoric and policy, Butler will show the country he does not wish to destroy America, only help its suffering people."
CSA_finish_totalism:0 "Finish Centralists"
CSA_finish_totalism_desc:0 "Foster and his allies fled to various disparate locations when we took over, but we have caught many of them in the time since then. Butler greatly desires that the country be done with this sort of extremism, and has even ordered the arrest of Centralists who hated Foster, such as Earl Browder and James Burnham. It is unlikely that they will get anything more than a slap on the wrist, but it is better to be safe than sorry, and we cannot afford to let the country fall into chaos again."
CSA_savior_of_the_revolution:0 "Savior of the Revolution"
CSA_savior_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "Smedley Butler's predecessor would have ruined everything we have fought for, and that could not be allowed. Now, after his coup, Butler is widely hailed as the "Savior of the Revolution". Some of our more cynical citizens have openly questioned what differentiates Butler from MacArthur, but Butler has assured them that America will never return to that sort of tyranny and that this is Democracy. As Democratic as it may be though, the Red Army holds significant influence in the government, and this will likely only increase with time."
CSA_restore_unions:0 "Restore Unions"
CSA_restore_unions_desc:0 "The IWW, AFL, CIO, and other important unions were disbanded completely under Foster's rule. These unions were critical in the Civil War, and their restoration could give us both good publicity as well as real benefits. After all, unions are sometimes all that stand in the way of capitalist exploitation. Since our predecessor extinguished the capitalists as well, nothing will stand in the way of the restored unions, and our economy will quickly recover from the recent chaos."
CSA_humane_society:0 "Humane Society"
CSA_humane_society_desc:0 "Butler's Quaker background has instilled him with humanist values, and he genuinely wishes to take care of all his people. Healthcare is perhaps the largest policy area that we have yet to address, and it is especially relevant with our recent Civil War. Butler wishes to move forward with a universal healthcare system, and once that has been achieved, address other issues as well, such as education and vaccine research."
CSA_integrate_revolutionary_guards:0 "Integrate Revolutionary Guards"
CSA_integrate_revolutionary_guards_desc:0 "The end of Centralist rule has left us with many lasting problems that we now have to deal with. One of the largest is the problem of the Revolutionary Guards. These were Foster's closest men, but most of them sided with Butler in the coup. These men are highly trained, and bringing the Revolutionary Guard into the fold will only enhance the power of the military, and, perhaps, its effectiveness."
CSA_red_junta:0 "Red Junta"
CSA_red_junta_desc:0 "Butler's control of the country is endorsed by most politicians as a preferable alternative to Foster's rule, but he still has to reassure them that he will not take the country in the same direction. As such, Butler's closest advisors have advised him to give a speech before Congress, in which he articulates his values, the nature of his government, and his intentions in ruling the country. We will not win all of them over, for there are those who oppose military rule in principle or perhaps wish to see themselves in charge instead, but we hope to gain enough support that our country will be more stable." 
CSA_utopian_society:0 "Utopian Society"
CSA_utopian_society_desc:0 "Though we have addressed major policy areas, we should also consider what many Nationalists call a "Utopian Society". This would involve adopting many of Edward Bellamy's ideas, and though a few of them unpleasantly remind Butler of William Foster, most of them would be in line with his values. As such, we should work to weave them into the country, so that we will finally be a utopia, once and for all."
CSA_war_is_a_racket:0 "War is a Racket"
CSA_war_is_a_racket_desc:0 "One of Smedley Butler's famous quotes is that "war is a racket". Of course, some would point out that he recently fought in a war himself, and that this makes him a hypocrite. Butler disagrees, pointing out that wars are often caused by military contractors and other elites hoping to profit off the deaths of their fellow citizens. There is nothing wrong with defending a nation in war, Butler argues, but we must not seek conflict abroad. This has been heard by observers both foreign and domestic, and most are sighing with relief that Butler does not wish to pursue his predecessor's bellicose rhetoric."
CSA_special_ops:0 "Special Operations"
CSA_special_ops_desc:0 "With the military now having larger influence in the government, programs aiming to create special forces units are suddenly receiving more funding than ever before. This is not an accident. Such an investment is seen as a waste of time by some, but Butler sees it as a necessity, as we must be prepared for any scenario, and we live in a world of hostile foreign actors. Further, such special forces could be used in conjunction with our intelligence agencies to root out Centralist dissidents and other criminals."
CSA_business_return:0 "Small Business Revival"
CSA_business_return_desc:0 "Small businesses were once the heart of this country's economy, but in the wake of the Civil War and Foster's rule, most have been damaged severely. However, with Butler's reforms and a more stable country, businesses are beginning to recover and even experience a revival."
CSA_defensive_outlook:0 "Defensive Outlook"
CSA_defensive_outlook_desc:0 "Butler has assured supporters that he will keep us out of offensive wars at all costs and that we will instead focus on building defenses in our own country.

CSA_democracy_returns:0 "Military Democracy"
CSA_democracy_returns_desc:0 "The system has now stabilized to such a degree that most people are comfortable relaxing again.

With the sum total of all the energy needed to produce goods known, it is possible to allocate an equal share of the production capacity to each citizen. This means that each citizen will receive Energy Certificates, which then could be used to allocate production capacity to produce goods they desire, within an ecologically sustainable context. Even planning for the future, this system accounts for technological progression, citing that the certificates could be replaced by a computer accounting system where each person’s allocation would be referred to as energy credits instead.

CSA_artillery_training_desc:0 "Artillery is a deadly weapon that we plan to use to our advantage, but without officers, it will mean nothing.

We will hit our enemy in their most vulnerable positions, and despite what our rivals may expect, we will not miss."
CSA_revolution_arms:0 "Revolution in Combined Arms"
CSA_revolution_arms_desc:0 "We have made a breakthrough in our military doctrine. Our theorists believe that if we can combine tanks, artillery, airplanes, and infantry in coordinated attack plans, we can eviscerate the enemy. Our bombers will soften them, our tanks and artillery will flatten them, and our infantry will do the rest. Alone, these forces are ineffective, but together, we can turn our army into a truly explosive fighting force."
CSA_modernized_army:0 "Professional Red Army"
CSA_modernized_army_desc:0 "The Red Army has become a well-oiled machine. Our explosive firepower alone gives us an edge over our rivals, and our army is now also a professional fighting force.

CSA_socialist_support:0 "Militia Support Auxiliaries"
CSA_socialist_support_desc:0 "Our country has a tradition of militia forces. Just as Americans joined militias in the last Revolution, so too will we utilize militias in this one.

Our workers will never be shackled again."
CSA_radical_training:0 "Radicalized Training Programs"

CSA_red_officers_desc:0 "Butler is sensitive to the criticisms the Red Army has received from within and without. He is aware that it has been derided as a rag-tag force with no discipline. To this end, he has pushed for the training of a new officer class, one that is well-trained, disciplined, and can thoroughly embarrass our enemies. With these officers in our military, we will outthink and outfox our enemies."
CSA_red_scouts:0 "The Red Scouts"
CSA_red_scouts_desc:0 "Now that we have a militia force, we can turn some of these men into specialized scouts for our army.

We should not rely on this numbers advantage; instead, we are making sure no matter how many enemies we face, we can overcome them with superior preparation and planning."
CSA_red_marines:0 "The Red Marines"
CSA_red_marines_desc:0 "We cannot afford to neglect our marines. Just because have a small coastline now does not necessarily mean this will be the case later on, and we need to make sure we have soldiers specialized in warfare involving rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This way, we can be better prepared for any scenario we could encounter. Butler tells us these marines will be important later, if not imminently. The Red Marines will fight on the beaches just as our soldiers fight on land."
CSA_red_republican_army:0 "The Red Republican Army"
CSA_red_republican_army_desc:0 "Our army is no longer something to be sneered at. We are a force to be reckoned with, and our coordination and planning will give us the ability to out plan our foes on the battlefield.

We are one step closer to having a truly professional army."
CSA_production_quotas:0 "Military Production Quotas"
CSA_production_quotas_desc:0 "We can't afford to be at a disadvantage in equipment production. We will set quotas for production in our factories to make sure that doesn't happen. Certain numbers of equipment will need to be produced on a daily and weekly basis, to keep our military alive. Our workers will be hard at work, and slacking will not be tolerated. Now is not the time to let up, and one bullet, shell, or bomb could make the difference between victory and defeat."

CSA_bring_the_complex_west_desc:0 "With most of the Military-Industrial Complex in the East, the Civil War has devastated the old munitions and weapons factories that made up America's war industry as they became high-value targets for bombings and a preferred hiding spot of persistent enemy defenders.

CSA_gi_bill:0 "The G.I. Bill"

CSA_the_second_draft:0 "The Second Draft"
CSA_the_second_draft_desc:0 "We need more pilots for our air missions. Some have suggested the possibility of drafting women into the military as well.

CSA_the_traditional_army:0 "Air Force Traditionalism"
CSA_the_traditional_army_desc:0 "If we are to improve our air force, we should focus on training men who are already pilots and adding in recruits as well.

CSA_revolutionary_naval_industry:0 "Revolutionary Naval Industry"
CSA_revolutionary_naval_industry_desc:0 "The superiority of the old U.S fleet was not only in our commanders but also in Fleet size. Although we still do not have as many shipyards and factories as the United States had before the war, we can focus on specific ships and simplify production."

CSA_new_american_dockyards:0 "New American Dockyards"
CSA_new_american_dockyards_desc:0 "Most shipyards were damaged or lost their workers during the Second Revolution.

CSA_american_peoples_navy:0 "American People's Navy"
CSA_american_peoples_navy_desc:0 "With the Civil War over, some politicians say that our current need is to protect the American people.

CSA_recreate_continental_marines:0 "Recreate the Continental Marines"
CSA_recreate_continental_marines_desc:0 "In the past, the Continental Marine Corps proudly fought against the British oppressors. Many of the soldiers of its successor, the U. S.

CSA_navy_of_new_age_desc:0 "The second revolution almost destroyed the navy, and none of us expected that we could recreate the old American fleet.

To the north, imperialists reign supreme, eager to retake their "birthright". To the south, there is great turmoil, and we will have to proceed with care. Across both oceans, mighty nations seek to dominate their neighbors. Where is our place in all of this?"

CSA_demand_new_england_desc:0 "New England's place under the Canadian boot is an intolerable state of affairs, but they are obviously opposed to returning it.

CSA_defend_the_front_desc:0 "Our military should be focused on defensive rather than offensive capabilities, reducing both the incentive of capitalist countries to attack us and the fears of our citizens.

CSA_pacifist_propaganda:0 "Pacifist Education"
CSA_pacifist_propaganda_desc:0 "Hardliners would have our education include a strong martial aspect in order to protect socialism. However, this is the opposite of moral, and would only result in an aggressive population with a favorable view of applying military solutions where they do not belong. A pacifist education, on the other hand, will give a stronger moral case for socialism while simultaneously reducing violence internally."

CSA_invest_in_the_future_desc:0 "With our resources turned inward and our military not receiving the expansion aggressive syndicalists and socialists had hoped for, we can invest in our own population and set a positive example for socialism worldwide.

We have no need of an empire: our own workers shall pave the way to a new American century."
CSA_peace_through_socialism:0 "Peace through Socialism"
CSA_peace_through_socialism_desc:0 "Finally, we can expand the Peace League and formally denounce war, now that we have made the moral superiority of socialism utterly obvious.

However, there are still many among us who think it natural for us to protect our native hemisphere from foreign encroachment. Not only that, but they also say we must also protect these regimes from one another. Let us reinstitute some of the old Monroe Doctrine ideas and start to promote the growth of new regimes in Latin America. Doing so will eliminate the need for the imperialism of old, as we will instead control these countries through political leverage and economic power. The Revolution shall spread across the Western Hemisphere!"
CSA_logistics_management:0 "American Logistics Department"

This is not Western Europe, where small countries make it easy to conduct wars on that scale.

## Constitutional Convention ###

###Syndicalists###
csa.1.t:0 "The Constitutional Convention begins"
csa.1.d:0 "Today delegates have gathered from across the country in the city of Philadelphia as the Second Constitutional Convention is convened in order to draft a new and better constitution for America. With the syndicalists victorious in the internal debates during the war, the IWW is representing many AFL-affiliates in Congress, effectively nullifying the old Social Patriots chance of coming out on top, although the remaining ones still influence votes and can act as kingmakers in ties. Other interest groups that swore allegiance to Reed have also shown up, including members of the defunct Knights of Labor, the Nationalist Independence League, and National Civic Federation, as well as James Burnhams' American Workers Party. The most radical of these smaller Labor Federations is the Trade Union Unity League. This organization, represented by William Z. Foster, represents a resurgence of Vanguardism in the States. A small riot on the second day erupted when the International Peace Mission and Southern Tenant Farmers Union were ejected from the Convention. These unions had been neutral during the revolution, and were initially accepted due to their high percentage of black membership."

###Social Patriots###
csa.1000.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - Property Debate!"
csa.1000.d:0 "The Social Patriots have come out on top of our political structure, beginning a Constitutional Convention with an IWW too weak to seriously contend, and many rejecting the Congress entirely in favor of forming communes. Now though, the Social Patriots suffer from the internal division between the Nationalists under the American Independence League, who follow the philosophy of the late Edward Bellamy, and the more conventional Social Patriots lead by the AFL, now called "Laborists", who often say they want a form of capitalism that is dominated by the worker, although they sometimes call this socialism. Meanwhile, much of the SPA has been united under Earl Browder, who has adapted to Social Patriotism while still adhering to stronger syndicalist aesthetics in the hopes this will push him into victory. James Burnham, the leader of the American Workers Party, promises a technocratic socialist economy that will grant total defense against the capitalist nations. The most heated debate has occurred on the topic of private property, with the AFL wanting to defend private ownership of property so long as it excludes large businesses that can be broken up. Meanwhile, the Nationalists believe it is time for state ownership of capital while individuals own that which they use or goods they purchase, with the property itself being used for the common good. William Green and other AFL leaders have accused this of being Utopian, of course. Earl Browder has sided with the Laborists on this issue, although he insists this is out of pragmatism. He believes that a stronger socialist stance, and state for that matter, is needed, to ensure loyalty to socialism, whereas James Burnham has sided with the Nationalists."

csa.1001.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - Social Radicalism?"
csa.1001.d:0 "Yet another debate has begun, this time over so-called 'Social Radicalism', which relates to how progressive the new states' social policy should be. The Nationalists have come out as endorsing full equal rights for women, including such controversial measures as access to birth control, joining the military, representation in cabinets, and that women should be encouraged to work for equal wages alongside men. The AFL is somewhat more traditionalist and believes that while women should have greater social benefits and protections, pushing outcomes along all of these lines will only lead to social instability and lowered support among workers. When they went on to question how many women actually wanted these measures, it led to accusations of conservatism from the Nationalists. Along similar lines, the Nationalists wanted to not only disband Jim Crow but also start a full campaign against racial differences in general. Specifically, they desire constitutional measures that would denounce the concept of racial differences, make it illegal to outlaw race-mixing, as the Klan wanted to, and encouraging integration within industries, unions, and schooling, with penalties for those that violate this. The AFL agreed on disbanding Jim Crow and believed in ending violence against black workers, but said that acceptance of integration should be allowed to go at its own pace or the socialist state would lose support among the workers and encourage reactionary terrorism. They claim that forcing so much change in such a short time would yield 'ugly' results. Burnham sided with the AFL, especially on gender issues, while Browder kept a stance between the two but clearly leaned towards the Nationalists."

csa.1002.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - Voting Rights?"
csa.1002.d:0 "One of the most heated of all of the debates has finally occurred today over the topic of voting rights! The AFL has endorsed a traditional American structure for voting under a congressional, federalist system, noting that the workers outnumber the capitalists anyways. This means they will dominate a system that has ended unfair capitalist advantages. The Nationalists, however, believe elder members of the unions or, what they plan to make them into, guilds, should have voting rights that generally decide the direction of the economy. Likewise, a weaker Congress would be elected by retired citizens exclusively. Under their plan, the elder members of unions and craftsmen guild have both more experience and less skin in the game, allowing them to wisely choose the leaders within the industries they have worked in. The leaders of the unions will then elect a weak symbolic leader, the President, but in reality, they will share power. Naturally, a voting scheme that relies on this would strongly favor the Nationalists, who currently have more support in the craftsmen unions than the public at large. Burnham and Browder have united behind a 'Centralist Plan', in which experienced union and craftsmen get larger sway but so do experienced members of socialist political parties. Under this plan, the economy and society are directed under the President, who is entrusted by these entities with full executive authority and greater legislative authority in order to defend and direct socialism. Like the other two factions, their policy that empowers party members would likely see them dominate the upcoming election, and has endangered some outcries."

csa.1004.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - Nature of Government?"
csa.1004.d:0 "The final debate occurred today, and this time the issue was the nature of government itself. The Nationalists, believing in the idea of a centralized government, have advocated for the weakening of states. Some have even suggested abolishing the concept entirely. They argue that centralizing the government would allow greater economic and administrative efficiency, and partly attribute America's various crises to its federal system. This was of course vehemently opposed by the Federalists, who have instead advocated for maintaining the old federal system. They argue that the system of states was originally intended to grant some local autonomy to the people living in them, and give them more of a voice in their local government. Doing away with such a system would, in their eyes, open the floodgates for the same sort of tyranny that Americans fought against in the Revolutionary War and recently as well. For their parts, Browder and Burnham have largely sided with the Nationalists on this issue, advocating the abolishment of states and instead aiming to move forward with a centralized national government."

###Syndicalists###
csa.2.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - System of Government"
csa.2.d:0 "A coalition of SPA party members has made a splash in what many had expected to be a landslide victory for the IWW. What was supposed to be an easy article, that of the new Legislative Branch, has drawn controversy between centralists and orthodox syndicalists. IWW representatives argue that America should be a strictly anarcho-syndicalist government with all legislative power vested in the industrial trade unions. The TUUL is roughly in agreement but believes that dual unionism must end and a single union, namely the TUUL, should represent the workers, which Foster called a form of proletariat unity against the reactionary bourgeoisie. On the other side were James Burnham, Earl Browder, and some SPA moderates who argued that party politics should decide political representation, arguing that it made it easier for experienced leaders to lead the way and a way for those not directly in worker unions to participate in an election. A victory for them would shift politics in favor of the Centralists and give them a stronger hope of securing the later election but would only be possible if they flipped enough IWW centralists and remaining Social Patriots who did not flee or were not removed after losing the internal power struggle."

Reminding members of the Convention of the Court's track record for legalizing oppression of unions and downright reactionary laws, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn remarked that preserving an unelected position of the final legal decision could lead to authoritarianism. To the surprise of many, Earl Browder of the SPA dissented, arguing that this discrimination was the result of a corrupt party system and not an inherent flaw in the U.S. Constitution. To Browder, removing the Supreme Court would endanger the unity of the nation, and lead to more schisms than necessary, instead arguing that the President and Congress should still be able to appoint the Supreme Court, but can also remove justices they and the executive find unacceptable. The AFL, Nationalists, and other Social Patriots have quietly dissented with their vanguardist cohort, and pledge to support Flynn if her resolution passes. Meanwhile, the AWP praised Browder's position for being "as socialist as it is American". William Z. Foster of course was also in favor of removing the Supreme Court, and fanatically so."

On one side is the IWW, whose plan for a totally anarcho-syndicalist government requires there essentially not to be an executive officer and they instead be a purely symbolic power with more sway over diplomacy or internal negotiations. Their belief is that a president is an inherently reactionary populist position, and they will ensure that a person like Huey Long can never rise to power in the new America. Relative moderates such as Jack Reed and Robert Minor support a head of state that is beholden to Congress and is beholden to their interests. The opposition is another cooperation between Browder and Burnham who argue that a president with powers independent of Congressional authority is needed as a 'Commander in Chief', imploring us to use the practical tactics of our enemies against them as well adopt a position more Americans are familiar with. Foster merely argued against the anarchist position for the first time in their long alliance, breaking over the issue of abolishing the executive position, although he did not side with either the Centralists or the orthodox on the power of the presidency."

The core of the IWW has galvanized into a stricter dogma that pushes for the remaining articles to protect against the tyranny of a central government. Demanding protection through the lifetime assurance of union membership and abolishment of traditional wages as we know it. Several IWW delegates had implied that the AFL has been antagonistic, and would prefer a return to capitalism had they not lost the earlier debate during the war. The TUUL is in full agreement with the IWW, calling all other positions reactionary. Browder again takes the stage calling to protect craft unionism, stating that while egalitarianism should be our goal abolishing wages would weaken our economy. Once again James Burnham has endorsed Browder's stance although he clarifies that he merely sees it as a step in the right direction rather than a good end in-and-of-itself."

These protesters claim to be discriminated against based on their race by the openly anti-racist IWW.

As expected, civilian armed resistance has cost us some lives, but few would have expected our own Red Guard to be ineffective at expropriation.

csa.20.d:0 "Nobody could have expected our crime and punishment system would become so overstuffed as to require this decision. The numerous small schisms in the SPA have left our government with its fair share of detractors, as well as the expected resistance. Thousands upon thousands are being fed, clothed, and housed on our dime for their crimes against the people. Our more reform-minded are worried that prisons will be a breeding ground for reactionary thought, so workingmen should be diverted to work camps. There they will be able to pay back the state for what they stole from the people. The American Workers Party has put forward a proposal to make soldiers of prisoners young enough to serve to prove their loyalty to socialism. Vanguardists believe that we have been too lenient on these traitors, and must execute the traitors of the highest standing in the prisons, as a rebellion is surely about to come. The Catholic Workers Movement strongly disagree, and claim that exile and life elsewhere is the most Christian thing to do."

In Dewey's eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. In particular, he emphasizes that schooling must include hands-on learning famously stating 'if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind'. Dewey's detractors, notably the Catholic Workers Movement, claim his polities are antagonistic to religious education. Ultimately [CSA.GetLeader] has decided to endorse Dewey's reforms."

csa.22.t:0 "The President Uncovers the Greater Business Plot"
csa.22.d:0 "[CSA.GetLeader] and the Attorney General appeared to Congress today to allege that they uncovered a connection between the corporations that supported Huey Long, MacArthur, and the Pacific States. This accusation alleges that business interests in America were behind the degradation of civil politics during the revolution, and in the event of either MacArthur, the PSA, or Long winning, the Corporations would be the true power behind the presidency. The president has proposed the immediate complete dissolution and expropriation to the state of assets belonging to traitors in this grand conspiracy. Congress is taken aback, with most initially supporting this measure. The list of traitors, however, causes concern among certain members of the IWW and AFL. It appears that some of the corporations on the chopping block include large pharmaceutical companies like Merck & Co. Many Congressmen worry that punishing the medical profession will harm the life expectancy of the CSA. An alternate proposal for these corporations to be collectivized and their members rehabilitated and let free."

csa.23.d:0 "In an attempt to observe the changes in society that socialism is building. Congress has approved of a roaming documentary to film the new America, so that the world may know our progress. The film was shown to Congress to shock and revulsion, with scenes of government propaganda defaced, continued social barring of women from workplaces, and a union representative charging a black worker nearly five times the going rate for union membership. The director, King Vidor, has been advised by colleagues to make himself scarce, as the reaction is not what he intended. Congress has demanded Vidor to release the names of those filmed, so their crimes could be properly prosecuted. A minority of Congressmen came to defend the film, claiming that this shows the systematic difficulty in enforcing such revolutionary acts throughout the nation. These unpopular Congressmen were then ejected from the building."

csa.24.t:0 "Family Code of [GetYear]"
csa.24.d:0 "With the social revolution in full swing, Congress has passed the Family Code of [GetYear]. The Family Code is a revolutionary code that is driven by an ideological desire to wither away the capitalist model of the family to be replaced by a socialist model of the familial free unions based on mutual love and respect, as well as decriminalizing homosexual behaviour.\n\nThus to that end the code included a number of revolutionary changes. It abolishes all impediments to marriage, the biggest one being the abolition of anti-miscegenation laws. Civil marriage is now the only legal type of marriage. The code establishes no-grounds divorce, with both spouses receiving equal division of the property at the time of divorce. Also abolished is the concept of illegitimacy. Now, all children are entitled to parental support and equal rights under the law.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the revolutionary laws regarding the family, adoption of children that were made homeless by the revolution is subsidized. The European concept of Free Love is still under consideration, to the outrage of many tradition-minded trade unionists. While our anarchist-leaning supporters support the law, it's already causing fights in Congress and strikes among many on the right and even center of the CSA. These dissidents denounce the law as anti-family, anti-union, and anti-worker, with many labeling the anarchists as 'hedonists'."

To do so, however, he will need help. To that end, he has been torn between two different possibilities for what his government could look like. On one hand, he wants to restore some semblance of democracy to the government and hopes to appoint civilians to his cabinet. On the other hand, his military allies insist that they would be better able to establish stability if they had more direct power within Butler's government.

While there is already legislation giving benefits to our own veterans, those who fought for other factions received nothing but disdain -or worse- under the previous centralist government. Smedley Butler, as a military official himself, is widely seen as being more sympathetic to giving veterans aid, especially given recent speeches he has given in which he has mentioned the issue. Passing the bill would win us goodwill with the veterans in question, and possibly secure their support if another conflict happened in the new future.

Butler is sympathetic to this view, but he also understands that the Internationale is in great danger and that America could stand as the lone socialist nation on the world stage if they were to fall. Many of his fellow military officials suggest that we could join the Internationale, as they have not experienced the plague the Europeans call "Totalism".

Butler is sympathetic to this view, but he is also reluctant to provide aid to nations with similar ideologies to the one that he recently overthrew. This "Totalism" is as destructive to Europeans as it was to Americans. Butler, among many others, believes that aiding them would take away any notion of moral high ground, domestically and abroad.

Ford to ensure the perpetual safety and self-determination of African American minorities in the South.

Now this long con has paid off, and a group of trusted Congressmen has smuggled Townsend back into America under the pretense of reconciliation.

This dangerous group, led by a little man who thinks he's a god, has resisted conscription and collectivization.

The tipping point was when a mail bomb was discovered near President Foster's home, which was traced back to the AFL. All other legal means to stop the AFL leaders from despoiling their craft did not work, so the Vanguard is forced to intervene directly.

csa.76.d:0 "Today Charlie Chaplin has premiered another movie, titled God Save the Kaiser, which has quickly received glowing reviews within the press. God Save the Kaiser is a political satirical comedy-drama and Chaplin's first true sound film. The film follows two principal characters, an unnamed German barber struggling to make ends meet in Germany who bears a great deal of similarity with the Tramp that Chaplin played in his other movies. The other major character is King Billy, who is a cruel but ineffective buffoon of a leader; an obvious satire of Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Throughout the film, it shows the plight of the average German worker while viciously mocking the German government and the Kaiser in particular. The film ends with the barber being mistaken for King Billy and giving a rousing speech where he extols the virtues of Goodwill and Human Brotherhood and gives a strong endorsement for Chaplin's socialist views."

A number of new National Parks have been created on top of the houses of capitalism, as well as a People's Conservation Committee to guide their preservation. A top priority of the PCC is to replant trees around Oklahoma, the source of the dust storms that threaten our food supply.

As these memorials are made by the community, nobody was there to check whether the statue was appropriate until the press got a hold of the story. Apparently, statues were erected honoring the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing and the 1920 Wall Street Bombing. The press claim erroneously that the government approved of these memorials, and is honoring the bombers. These statues were silently taken down, and an official apology was forced out of the city councils responsible for this mean-spirited action."

In reforming and organizing public maintenance services, Hoan and his wife Agnes Bernice Magner and her Catholic Knights of Pythias/Women's Internatonal League for Peace and Freedom, among other sewer socialists like Victor and Meta Berger, Meyer London, Emil Seidel, Jasper McLevy, and Frank Zeidler - and progressives supported by the sewer socialists like George L. Tews and the La Follettes - showed that socialism could reorganize society and systems without having to redefine or destroy the foundations of American society with dastardly revolution, for electoralism and the mandate of the people trump all. That principle of Sewer Socialism must be taken to the whole of the nation, now that the chains are broken. Many cities such as Pittsburgh and Chicago are filled with pollution that fills the skies, but now that the revolution is over, cities all across the country shall be cleaned up and modernized. We hope the international community can appreciate a clean sewer as much as it does a shiny new skyscraper."

However, Capone himself has given a none-too-subtle hint as to what choice he desires for his nation, being his favorite song - Roses of Picardy. Commonly associated with the trenches of the Great War and its aging veterans, being the biggest hit of 1916 when it was released to global acclaim during the fires of the Weltkrieg, this heartbreakingly beautiful British ballad about a mysterious girl as lovely as a rose captured the secretly soft heart of Scarface as well. Allegedly being an immensely sad and death-obsessed man when alone or in private with his family despite his brash and larger-than-life persona he shows to the public or the steely hard facade he keeps towards the Organization, Capone has held a conscious recognition of the fundamental sadness of life, and a life-long looming sense of dread that despite all his successes and a desire to do good, he would ultimately end up badly regardless of his best efforts, leading him to adopt the song as a sort of personal anthem. A tragic song for a tragic man and a tragic nation, perhaps it is the best choice after all?"

However, people are divided as to what to do about the relief. Some believe that it should be destroyed. James Ford, in a cynical turn, wishes to chisel down the Confederates and replace them with Jemmy, John Brown, George Padmore. Diego Rivera, the artist behind the renovation of Rockefeller Plaza, suggests a cheap and honorable compromise.

Before the revolution and during the war, life was hard for our fellow Americans. Many had to suffer the loss of a loved one, life-threatening financial insecurity during the crisis years, or persecution. This leads to behavior the old society may have deemed wrong or sinful, but our brave President Foster must look beyond traditions. For those whose souls suffered too deep an injury to carry on, we must allow them to phase out. Despite our censorship of the Daily Worker, massive protests by Christian Workers Unions, intelligentsia, and community support networks claim that Foster's 'suicide law' is merely a pretense to excuse mysterious deaths and disappearances. The more conspiratorial rightists even claim this is a plot by Foster to legalize murder so long as it looks like suicide.

The story itself is an examination of twelve Americans that lived through the depression and revolution. Passos's writing combines snippets of newspapers, propaganda, and the conversations he recalls on the streets during the terrifying months before liberation. Such unorthodox and creative writing is usually praised by the Americans Writers Congress, but they have remained silent. This is due to the book's depiction of extralegal killings that took place throughout America during the Civil War by our soldiers. To the nominal leader of the Writers Congress, Ernest Hemingway, this book amounted to treason and sedition against the socialist government.

Ever since the Revolution, the Reds have successfully utilized their name to re-brand themselves as a symbol of the triumph of Socialism, to the point that they have become the most popular team in America. The Tigers have proven themselves to be quite the adversary, however, and have forced the series to a final decisive game with each team at three games apiece.

One such group - numbering in the tens of thousands before the final end of the war - was under the command of the charismatic and crafty Walter W. Waters. A veteran of the Banana Wars himself, Waters was no stranger to military command. Alongside his contemporaries the veterans of the Battle of Blair Mountain - the largest labor uprising in American history before our Revolution - who form the core of our general staff outside the Butler Clique, Waters led his ragtag volunteer militias to great effect outside the official command structure of the CSA, and now with our victory secured, they have come asking for recompense. \n\nReforming into what is being called the ‘Bonus Army,’ Waters has led tens of thousands of veterans on a march to the capital in order to demand financial compensation and care like the official soldiers of the Syndicalist armies are receiving. Though this mass has remained peaceful so far, they are all armed as a show of solidarity and seriousness, and are dead set on not leaving the capital empty handed. Though we could ignore their pleas, to do so would fly in the face of everything we just fought for in the Second American Revolution. We may not have the funds, but we must find some way to reward these veterans for their service, lest we be no better than the tyrants and cheats we just fought against. We can raise Waters up from mere militia leader attached to our command to being a full-fledged general in our revolutionary army, granting him the respect and recognition he deserves while also promising to pay pensions to each and every one of his men in time."

Furthermore, local animators in Detroit and Chicago have come together to animate a special short of ‘Felix the Cat’ featuring an animated Picket in a comical short poking fun at the major reactionary figures of the Second American Revolution. Picket has even become so beloved that one of the CSA’s own fighter squadrons have taken the animated version of Picket to be the mascot of their airwing, with each plane in the unit being emblazoned with that charming little cat.

They are truly some of the most loyal and competent in America, and worthy of Capone’s inner circle. But with America’s Façade of a Socialist state, the Mafia’s old managers are beginning to get a bad rap. And some in America question if Capone is true to Socialist ideas based on the company he keeps.

The highest of these promotions were handed out to Capone’s closest allies and fighters who were not recognized for their struggles. Among them was John Dillinger, whose brigade terrorized the Reactionary Police and Banks of the Old America. Along with the team of resistance fighters who brought the South to its knees, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, aided by their Western ally Charles Arthur 'Pretty Boy' Floyd and his crew.

During the day, Chairman Mussolini and Comrade Luciano met several times to discuss politics and diplomacy. As the day grew longer, Chairman Mussolini and Comrade Luciano held an official state dinner. And even though Chairman Mussolini despised Pasta, a traditional meal of Spaghetti was served to Chairman Luciano in an attempt to firm up cultural ties with America.

Due to Capone’s connections, it would be best to distance himself from organized crime. However, the Commissars always wish to embrace tradition. And since the actions of the Mafia during the war helped save America, many view their actions as actions taken to help the Syndicate Government and not a crime. As in their minds, Criminal Actions taken under the old Federal Government did not count as crimes, as they were resisting a reactionary state through any means.

As the ROSS raided the headquarters of many Military Officers deemed to be “Reactionary”, Comrade Nitti declared that to keep America safe drastic measures must be taken within the Army. The proposed reforms were quickly greenlighted by Comrade Capone, and within these reforms are provisions stating that Frank Nitti has the position of “Supreme Commander of the Revolutionary Office of Strategic Services”. This position is one higher than a General and makes it so that Comrade Nitti is only second within the army to Marshal Dillinger himself. "

People who don’t pay up are subject to Harassment and even arrest by the ROSS officials, while those who pay up can have free reign.

While Businessmen grow increasingly wealthy through Price Gouging, actively helped by the Government Policies of setting the price of everyday goods at high rates. As well, the inflatable currency value has allowed the citizens with a higher Social Credit Score to economically drain the citizens with lower Social Credit Scores.

As this celebration of the Mafia grows, people start celebrating the actions committed in the War by Capone’s allies in the Sicilian Mafia and the actions of other Gangs such as Dillinger’s or Bonnie and Clyde’s.\n\n  Memorials for Bootleggers, plaques commemorating Mobsters, and speeches and dedications to ringleaders killed in the War have all become commonplace in America. And through all of this, the symbol of a Gangster adorned in a fedora and a 3-piece suit has become a propaganda piece for the revolution. The stereotypical Mobster becoming a symbol for the new American way of life.\n\n And through all of this, the phrase “La Cosa Nostra” (or “Our Thing”) has become a phrase used by revolutionaries all throughout America and beyond. In occupied territories, La Cosa Nostra is painted on the headquarters of the occupiers while “La Cosa Nostra” is shouted by 1000s whenever Capone or his allies hold a rally.\n\n And as the Mafia cult is extended, the Gang Culture is ingrained into American life, and once common criminals become War Heroes and Revolutionary Symbols."

As two of his own minor league teams - the Algerians and the Dundees, named after himself and a team Al played on as a kid with his older brother Ralph, respectively - played a friendly practice match, the crowd distracted by a home run, two gunmen leapt out from the stands and shot multiple rounds at Capone's VIP box, but luckily their shots went wide, narrowly missing Capone’s personal guest to the game Mayor Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. of New York City, striking nothing but a few unimportant bystanders and bodyguards instead. Within seconds of the shootings, Scarface himself charged the men responsible with his bodyguards, brutishly beating them to death in broad daylight before returning to his seat and yelling to the players to resume their game before relighting his cigar. \n\nThe two gunmen were later identified as Anton Cermak, the disgraced former mayor of Chicago that was thrown out of office due to his fierce opposition to Scarface which led to Cermak becoming destitute and hellbent on revenge, and Giuseppe Zangara, a mentally ill Italian immigrant settled in New Jersey that lied about his mob connections when Cermak hired him to help him with the hit. With both gunmen dead, and with no players injured, Capone was able to continue his leisure time relatively undisturbed, but would mark down the occasion as further reasoning to up his security and crack down on any potential sources of retributionary violence, especially among the Polish-American community of which Capone has made a few prominent enemies from such as Cermak or his old rival Hymie Weiss."

Capone opened soup kitchens and provided employment to the masses, and his gangs went to work stamping out the reactionaries. Were they criminals? yes, but they were breaking the reactionary laws in the name of the Revolution. And thanks to Capone’s actions in the war, he became a permanent man of the people. With his allies in the Labor Unions, he managed to become one of the heroes of a new Socialist America. And with the conclusion of the Second Constitutional Convention, he achieved the impossible; he gained control of America through completely peaceful means. And now, he is the unquestioned ruler of America. The Combined Syndicates were dissolved and one, central Syndicate under the control of the Workers has been established and Capone’s allies from the war formed the new government. Capone is the unquestioned dictator of America, not through his traditional means of force, but by cultivating his image and doing away with challenges to his power from above. Now, America is one, controlled by Capone and his Criminal Allies. And to all that tried to keep us down, we say one thing:  We will always Control America, no matter what state runs it.

A large investigation has now come underway to determine where he is, or if he is even still alive at all. However, there is speculation that Hoffa may not have simply gone missing. Speculations run high and actual tangible facts low, but some rumors seem to indicate that Chairman Capone believed that Hoffa had become an accomplice to a plan to coup the government in charge, and remove The Boss from his position of leadership.

The parties, while not completely out of character for Capone, have been getting more and more out of hand, and the aftermaths have been harder and harder to keep out of the sight of the public, who, upon hearing of them, may have a change of heart towards the venerable leader. These parties have been a large sink of money, but on top of that, the reports that come from the aftermaths of these parties are highly disturbing, including events such as sexual assault, regular assault, as well as some people even dying during the party due to overdoses on the exorbitant amount of drugs that are present at these parties. All of these things considered have begun to put the thought in the mind of Capone's second in commands that he has finally begun a final, irredeemable descent into total syphilitic madness thanks to the disease.

Recently, while Capone has shown a stark lack of care in the actual lives of the people of his nation, mostly working to further himself and his own party’s goals, The Boss has recently begun to have a change of heart. No longer is he being as selfish as he was, as he is now beginning to put out proposals to make life better for the nation’s citizens. While of course, the citizens have welcomed this with open arms, as well as some of the people in his party, many more see this as a threat to their own power and are concerned that he is going to continue to give away more and more of what they have earned. The fear that he may soon give away something as precious as the power they have fought so hard to solidify in their own hands is becoming reality, and many are beginning to consider what means they have at their disposal to remove him from power.

His final hours were spent in his office, where he suffered a final heart attack that ultimately killed him. Capone’s inner circle has temporarily put aside their differences to stabilize America and prepare for Capone’s extravagant state funeral, even though they all plan to stab each other in the back during the coming Caponeist Congress that shall decide on Scarface’s eventual successor.

For years, Paul Ricca has been the quiet mastermind behind Capone’s criminal empire, taking on more and more responsibility behind the scenes long before King Al even had a chance to lead this new America, and Nitti has only enabled this reality for years - himself notable for off-loading his work onto others and delegating to the extreme as a man infamous for hating to get his own hands dirty. This relationship of a national father too mentally inept to truly lead on his own coupled with a right-hand man that refuses to step up to the plate and do his duties himself have allowed Ricca to become one of the richest and most powerful men in North America if not the world, all without having to put his own reputation or face on the line as he dictates his parasitic shadow fiefdom behind the scenes. \n\nWith Nitti, allied to the other Capone loyalists like Dillinger and Pretty Boy Floyd, and Ricca, tied to Hymie Weiss - the one man Capone feared - and a growing number of anti-Caponeist and anti-Communist elements, now openly vying for dominance, the internal hierarchy of the Chicago Outfit has been thrown into utter chaos once again, and only one of these two titans of criminality can truly win to guide the Organziation towards its destiny."

However, Luciano has hit numerous roadblocks already, and the road ahead does not look any clearer as many loyalists to Capone among the leading dons and among the masses resist his good-natured idea aimed at lasting peace and prosperity for all. In order to relieve this resistance, many within Luciano’s Five Families and the National Crime Syndicate have suggested that Luciano step down in favor of a more widely-respected face - that of Papa Johnny Torrio. A veteran of the old crime wars the gave rise to the modern criminal scene that became dominated by the likes of Scarface, Torrio is one of the original gangsters of 20th century America, but was chased out of Chicago and fled to New York after barely surviving an assassination attempt on his life after it was leaked that Torrio was behind the killing of Al Capone’s older brother Salvator ‘Frank’ Capone in 1924. Though this act has villainized Torrio in the eyes of Capone’s surviving family like his widow Mea Capone or his other criminal brother Ralph Capone that stands loyally with Nitti and Dillinger, this act has been all but forgotten by the wider public, and is largely forgiven by most dons and made-men for the hit was carried out over a decade ago without breaking any common mobster etiquette or Omerta rules. As such, Torrio would likely be a more widely-accepted figure, but would also take Luciano’s dream in a mostly non-ideological and slightly Capitalist direction despite Luciano still running most of the operation from the sidelines.

However, all is not well in our gangsters’ paradise, for the Big Fella only grows more erratic, unhinged, and unfit as the syphilis that has been eating at his mind since he was 18 runs its natural course. Refusing treatment for decades, the King of Chicago is now a grown man in his 40s enfeebled with the rapidly decaying mind of a toddler aging in reverse, wracked by constant seizures and strokes when not babbling like a baby or raging like a crazed madman. \n\nHis psyche all but shattered, the man that once held all of America in the palm of his hand now delegates virtually all of his work and duties to his closest associates like Nitti, Dillinger, Hoffa, and Ricca, but not everyone can be so easily trusted. Many within this inner circle - primarily Paul Ricca and his associate Hymie Weiss - believe that Capone should be forced into retirement in order to save the country, the regime, and Caponeism’s image, while the Big Fella’s more loyal friends like Nitti and Dillinger urge for Capone to hold on for as long as possible as the face of the nation while they take on most of his former responsibilities behind closed doors, waiting until Capone finally gives up the ghost naturally to finally deal with the succession crisis that is already brewing. However, rumors abound that certain parties will not wait for Capone’s decision or death regardless, with Big Al being sent anonymous death threats by what is believed to be disgruntled associates of the Organization, though no one can be sure."

csa.3555.d:0 "With his refusal to secretly step down as the true authority within the Party, Al Capone has signed his own death warrant without ever being aware of it. On his way home late one night from the most recent meeting of the Organization’s leading dons and closest confidants, guarded by a cavalcade of bodyguards and heavily assisted by his army of nurses and medical support staff, Capone began to throw one of his nearly-regular fits induced by the degenerative disease slowly decaying his dying brain, forcing his limo at the center of the convoy to come to a stand-still. However, unlike any other time that the Big Fella needed quick medical aid, the rest of the convoy moved on - bodyguards, nurses, and all - leaving ol’ Snorky alone in his royal carriage with no one else but his driver. \n\nUnbeknownst to almost anyone in the nation, this was the exact moment Paul Ricca the Rat and Hymie Weiss - the one man Capone truly feared - had been waiting years for. Long tired of Capone’s arrogance and ego bringing the nation to ruin - as he sees it at least, Ricca the Rat conspired with Weiss and other dissidents throughout the Organization, eventually bribing the convoy and medical staff with a exorbitant sum so that they would leave Capone unattended and say they simply dropped him off at his mansion in Chicago’s South Side like usual before going home for the day. With their cover safe and an alibi secured, Weiss was secretly planted to be the driver, allowing him a rare moment alone with King Al so that they could finally ‘free’ America from Capone. \n\nAs Capone lay in the back seat seizing and nearly biting his tongue in two, Weiss moved in for the kill. At first he attempted to strangle Capone, but his advanced illness and failing health had created a neck too fat and greasy to truly be wrung. As a plan b, Weiss removed the small L-pill he kept hidden under the lapel of his suit, and shoved the small capsule full of potassium cyanide down Capone’s fat gullet. As the poison worked its way into his wriggling half-dead corpse, Weiss quietly drove Capone the rest of the way home before dumping his body in the backyard grounds of King Al’s estate, leaving him lying casually on a sun chair near his pool as if he died from one of his common seizures while tanning and drinking the night away, and waiting for the next shift of bodyguards and nurses to find him in the morning so that they can tell the nation and be blamed for the death of our patriarch. With that, the bloody ballad of Scarface has come to an end as Ricca and Weiss commit a near-perfect crime, secretly ‘saving’ America and propelling the nation and Caponeism towards an uncertain future."

csa.3556.d:0 "Matching all the ego, flashiness, and gravitas he had in life, the funeral of Alphonse Capone is perhaps the biggest and most lavish (or gaudiest) ceremony in American history. In a fusion of Americanized Italian funerary traditions mishmashed with the strict Omerta code and rites of the Organization and the pseudo-Communism of Caponeist ideology, the whole of Chicago has been decorated in gold, red velvet, and black marble to honor the Big Fella. A motorcade filled with cars and floats adorned with his face and symbols drove the body of Capone to the Mount Carmel Catholic Cemetery in the Hillside suburb of Chicago - a final resting place for many of Chicago’s biggest gangsters and most devout Catholics, and was accompanied by thousands upon thousands of mourners following on foot. During the ceremony, his widow Mae Capone, his young son Albert Francis Capone, and even his two surviving brothers - fellow criminal Ralph Capone and black sheep of the family Richard James ‘Hart’ Capone - all gave speeches in honor of our fallen titan. However, the funeral itself was not without hiccups as the hall where Capone’s body was located before final burial so that the public may see him erupted into a cluttered and crowded mess. With Capone’s coffin flanked by his closest allies like Hoffa, Dillinger, Nitti, Seavey, Ricca, and more, all quietly arguing amongst themselves on matters of succession, the centerpiece of this hallowed event became a sparring ground for Capone’s would-be heirs as overly-large flower displays blocked doors thanks to bumbling laborers, inept guards dealt with Capone’s overly-drunk family members causing ruckus and ruckus, and the heat in the room rising well past comfortable levels as the funeral became a carefully, quietally, and barely maintained maelstrom of chaos, only made even worse when the various Catholic bishops still on good terms with the Caponeist regime entered the hall swinging their censors and chanting their psalms as their incense and oils only added to the chaotic cacophony. \n\nAfter the ceremony finally ended, feasts were held in his honor across America with Chicago becoming a boisterous center for the celebration of Capone’s life (or death in many cases), accompanied with feasts of fine Italian cuisine like spaghetti, casseroles, wines, cannoli, tiramisu, and so much more as fanciful Sicilian music played throughout the city. Though he may be gone, and though the nation is now chucked into uncertain and dangerous new waters, the King of Chicago Alphonse Capone will never be forgotten...for better or for worse."

Others include Luciano, Torrio, Lansky, and the rest of the Five Families and wider American Mafia of New York City, the Barrow Gang and their varied cadre of Illegalist bandits and Anarchist rouges under the Texan duo Bonnie and Clyde with their new Internationale ally Jules René Lucien Belbenoît, and more political neutral loyalists like Pretty Boy Floyd and his gang of Robin Hood-esque humanitarian bank robbers, Bugsy Siegel and his paramilitary Murder, Inc., Big Bill Dwyer and his Irish Mob, and more including Tony Accardo, Frank Costello, Anthony Aresso, and Big Bill Lias to name just a few of the hundreds of varied crime bosses in attendance. Despite their constant infighting and even with the death of a few representatives already being tallied, these kingpins, along with the various other Black Hand and White Hand extortion groups, minor mobs and mafias, pirate bands, and whatever other criminal groups have jumped onto the Caponeist dream, now hold the weight of America’s future on their shoulders, and now they must debate until they are all long in the tooth, and without killing each other, for a successor for Scarface must be chosen now!"

Ruling with a velvet-lined iron fist, Luciano seeks to usher in his idea of Mobster Populism - an idea akin to a criminally-backed, slightly-democratic true welfare state forged in the bloody streets of NYC in order to reduce infighting, maximize mass popularity, and the death of innocents while increasing profit and longevity of our organized operations. Relatively popular with the masses thanks to his humanizing reforms aimed at making good on the promises of criminal Socialist utopia Capone failed to fully deliver on despite his tenuous relationship with most orthodox Caponeist loyalists like Nitti and Dillinger, Luciano shall keep organized crime and the actions of the Organization on a leash in order to provide for our new, slightly-democratized society without harming it, even if this must be achieved at the business end of a tommy gun.

This event, along with Weiss’ continued reputation as a bloodthirsty, unpredictable, violent, and animalistic crime boss, led Capone to be wary of the pious madman that now stands as the new king of crime. Tearing out every last vestige of Socialism, Communist-Caponeism, and the former welfare state created by the Big Fella, America now exists as a truly non-ideological state entirely focused on profit and power as projected and generated by organized crime centered on the Organization, now purged of Capone loyalists and staffed entirely with yesmen, consiglieres, and other mafiosos entirely loyal to Weiss, with figures like Johnny Torrio being rehabilitated for Weiss’ purposes.

With this union-focused shift and large increase in corruption, especially with monetary corruption and especially by Hoffa himself, the new ‘President’ also brings a more agrarian-focused shift as Hoffa laments over all the fertile fields in what was once the breadbasket of the Western Hemisphere having grown fallow in recent years as the organized crime-focus of Communist-Caponeism accelerated into high gear. With this increased rural and agricultural focus will surely come more agricultural and rural crime to match, further driving the Caponeist system as Hoffa makes sweeping promises and miniscule changes that have little drastic effect on the actual ideology of Caponeism. \n\nSpecifically fond of Syndicalism, Hoffa has recently gone on to publicly postulate that unions and unionism, guilds, craft bunds, communes, and other earlier labor organizations were and always will be a racket, and that Syndicalism is only a more ideologically-developed version of organized crime, even uplifting the original Syndicalists like Fernand Pelloutier and even medieval guilds as some of the first organized criminals, and as such are worthy of study and praise.

With their visit escalating in a fist fight between the two as the stunned and appalled y Glais could only look on in quiet horror before getting clocked in the eye by an errant fist and going out like a light, Hoffa had a stressful blast but little of worth was actually accomplished while the relations between Ukrainian and Russian Leftists only came out worse.

An infamous dread pirate of the Great Lakes involved heavily in timber piracy, smuggling, poaching, human trafficking, coastal raiding, ship plundering, press ganging, hijacking, and more, Helmsman ‘Roaring’ Dan is a veteran of a thousand conflicts and one of the most experienced naval officers in the world when it comes to ship-to-ship combat and more subtle, sneaky tactics, bringing all this experience to bear as he expands our nautical operations and retools the nation to become as profitable and devious at sea as we are already at land thanks to orthodox Caponeism’s empire of organized crime. \n\nMuch of Seavey’s own ideology aside from general organized crime and piracy stems from his fascination with Libertalia (also called Libertatia), a pirate utopia of legend and probable myth ‘created’ in Madagascar by the famed Captain James Misson in the late 17th century. Though it is debated, and highly doubtful, that Libertalia truly was founded and then lost to time, its legacy of an egalitarian pseudo-Socialist pirate’s utopia built on cooperation and crime has always fascinated Seavey and now forms the foundation of his politics. Despite his advanced age of about 80 years old, Seavey’s mind and will are as sharp as ever, and although he may not personally command his fleet from the bow of his own flagship, sabre in hand and roaring like a true pirate as often as he used to, he is still the greatest pirate of the New World’s modern age, and is still able to shut down any open talk of his possible retirement as he infuses his nautical and Libertalian ideas into the Caponeist regime as foundational aspects equal to Capone’s own legacy before his eventual passing. Regardless, our new Helmsman must still decide on how best to frame this new era of our Neo-Caponeist state."

As Seavey’s America primes itself to become this nautical superpower and absolute master of piracy, he is aided along the way not only by the orthodox Caponeists like Nitti, Dillinger, and even Hoffa that have come to support his new government, but also extensively by the loyal dockworkers and shipbuilders’ unions that Seavey has corrupted and worked with for years like the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the International Longshoremen’s Association, the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America, the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, and his various other allies that splintered from the IWW and AFL-CIO.

csa.3580.d:0 "Dan Seavey has no love for the Coast Guard, or what their predecessors used to be called, The Revenue Cutter Service. These High Riders of the sea’s have always been used to prevent Seavey and his crews from gaining a buck in the Great Lakes, and thus can be viewed as the bourgeois enforcement of these lakes and rivers. This view certainly wasn’t helped by the fact they often were sent out at the behest of freighting companies who held monopolies, to pursue both the pirates, and the small time freighters themselves, who often had to resort to smuggling due to the sheer amount of regulations put onto the waters by lobbied hands. Even with the dissolution of the Cutter Service and reformation into the technical military branch of the Coast Guard, it’s use by the Hoover administration as a tool of law enforcement did not change the status quo of the Great Lakes, which remained monopolized and off limits to the dock workers which might have envisioned a life of their own sailing the wild streams and currents throughout America.\n\nSo now that all of America is able to be shaped to Seavey’s vision, the former enemies of his past are on the chopping block. Seavey is beyond a doubt in his efforts to get rid of these lawmen of the lakes, as Capone had promised an America that was lawful, but without the presence of the Law. This promise seems to have been overlooked when it came to the Guard, who due to their mask of being a military branch, managed to remain in a stasis like Limbo during Scarface’s reign. Thus, with the boss's orders now being formally passed in writing to his skippers that do his bidding, the Coast Guard ceases to exist. Being sure not to miss the chance to get popular support for this, especially when it comes to the practical prospect of releasing men from their jobs, Seavey has swelled up the support with images and memories of all those stop and seizure actions done by the Guard and Revenue Service on the sea’s, stopping many a sea-faring American from living out the same ideals of freedom and property, on the water. And certainly, not all of it was just done for optics and petty revenge either. Dan’s ambitions of a red flotilla, like that of Jefferson’s fascination with the early U.S Navy, shall be America’s pride on the great oceans around the world, as even with the love of Libertalian, or ‘pirate utopian’ ideals, he wishes for the presence of a grand fleet to see through the protection and projection of this reincarnation of a revolutionary land as home to the red sea goer. So, Seavey has done the sensical option of recruiting lower enlisted and crew from the Coast Guard, and bringing them into the foundations of his new fleets, thus ensuring some experience onto his great project, and to give a chance to those sons who might have joined the Guard not because they were whipped boys who wished for the power that law brings, but to get a stable job and meal."

Long having a soft spot for the timber industry from his dreaded career as a timber pirate stealing fluming logs downriver from logging operations he then later sold on the black market, as well as for big game hunting, prostitutes, prospecting, leisure sailing, and fishing, ol’ Roaring Dan has worked to incorporate these beloved pastimes and exploits into the culture and economy of this Neo-Caponeist era we now found ourselves in. Subsidizing new shipbuilding start-ups and logging/timber companies and processors, expanding national and state parks and other legal hunting grounds, passing new legislation in support of the fishermen unions and other nautical industries in the form of better working conditions and greater benefits and pay, granting protections and health care for sex workers, and much more, Helmsman Seavey acts as the paternalistic populist Capone always strived to be, but free of Scarface’s erratic insanity, instead replaced with a sharp wit and a true passion for leaving this nation better off than how he found it, if only also slanted in his seaborne and timber-biased direction."

Before Weiss and Ricca even caught wind of the fact that their duplicitous plotting had been discovered, Seavey already had Nitti, Dillinger, and their boys over at the ROSS slapping cuffs on these traitorous cockroaches before throwing them in the back of the paddywagon and taking them to be processed and tried before meeting their makers. However, despite the Organization already having procedures and established customs for how to deal with traitors, ol’ Roaring Dan Seavey had his own plans for true justice in mind. \n\nSitting on the deck of his flagship in a lounge chair taking in the sunny rays and salt air as he drank his rum, Seavey hummed a bouncy shanty to the steady, meaty beating coming from down below. Just below Seavey’s scenic overlook at the bow of the ship, on the main deck, Ricca was receiving the rhythmic beating of a lifetime as a massive hulk of a simple-minded sailor wailed away at the Rat’s back with a genuine cat o’ nine tails, stripping the flesh and sinew from Ricca’s spine in time with Seavey’s dulcet tones until there was no life left in him. Far below them, tied in a loop to the underside of the ship's hull at the middle of a long length of rope wrapped around the vessel, was Weiss the Pole being keelhauled; his body going limp and motionless in the icy waters of Lake Michigan hours ago aside from the battering of the frigid waves; his bodied covered in deep gashes caused by scraping against razorclams and barnacles affixed to the hull and his head caved in from banging into the keel below. After his men had had their fun and after both Ricca and Weiss were surely dead, Seavey had their bodies collected and impaled on large stakes before being left at the Chicago docks for all to witness as they dry and rot in the sun to become prey for the carrion birds and hungry gulls. \n\nIt is not known who suffered more of the two, but it is undeniable that Helmsman Seavey has done both the nation and the late Capone a great service here today. However, it seems it shall not be the last bout of justice like this to come. Enjoying the time he had with this righteous example of retribution, Seavey has called for a new sweep of the country in order to search for other traitors of the Neo-Caponeist state so that we may enact Capone’s justice. And with Seavey bringing back the usage of archaic forms of pirate or nautical execution like execution dock hangings, mutilation, clapping in irons, sweating, plank walking, blowing from a deck gun, live-burial at sea, cement-shoes, and more, it would seem that ‘justice’ is about to get a whole lot more interesting..."

Yesterday evening, our great Chairman, Alphonse Gabriel Capone, leader of the Union of Socialist Syndicates of America, had sadly passed away. Al Capone, the charismatic father of America, known for His bold persona and strategic acumen, has left an irreplaceable void in the nation's history. \nHis passing reverberates through the annals of time, reminding us of a complex figure who left an indelible mark on the course of American politics and society. Al Capone's story is one that embodies the American spirit of ambition and resilience. From His humble beginnings to His meteoric rise, He exemplified the notion of the self-made man. \nCapone's keen understanding of power dynamics and His ability to navigate the complexities of a rapidly changing society propelled Him to the forefront of American politics. Capone's legacy extends beyond the realm of politics. He played a pivotal role in shaping the nation's economic landscape, implementing ambitious policies and spearheading infrastructure projects that revitalized cities and stimulated growth. He had a bold vision for a prosperous America. \nAs we grapple with the legacy of Al Capone, we also consider the implications of His passing for the nation and the potential power struggles that may arise among His closest allies. They find themselves now at a crossroads. The shifting dynamics within His inner circle may influence the course of American politics for the coming years. The power vacuum left by Capone's absence is significant, and His subordinates will be vying for positions of influence and authority. \nThe choices They make in this critical juncture will shape the future trajectory of the nation. His passing ends a chapter in American history and also opens the door for a new generation to change the reality we live in and hopefully make America better."

What was not expected however is the large and growing subset of American youths that have dangerously misinterpreted the works of Max Stirner and others like him, like Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre. These misguided teenagers, pre-teens, and young adults take these ideas of Existentialism, Egoism, Nihilism and more as excuses for them to walk about as unproductive, useless louts that pretend to despise the world and life in order to seem complex, intelligent, or otherwise esoterically enlightened.

Catching the fleeing pair near Sailes, Bienville Parish deep in northern Louisiana where they were preparing to head further south to the Gulf of Mexico to escape the nation by sea, Bonnie, Clyde, and the rest of the Barrow Gang rode up on Ricca and Weiss in their motorcade - Bonnie and Clyde themselves taking point in their infamous 1934 Ford Model 40 B Fordor Deluxe sedan that the gang has used for years as their roving symbol of terror while the rest of the Barrow Gang and their mafioso entourage headed by Nitti and Dillinger followed behind - as they prepared to deliver their final, violent justice. \n\nCornering the Rat and the Polack as they hid in a drainage ditch near the side of the road a few hundred feet from their abandoned, broken-down car, the Barrow Gang hogtied the two scoundrels, carried them back to their vehicle, and sat them back up in their seats before walking a few dozen paces away from the wreck. Finally, in an unspoken unison, the 8 or so members of the Barrow Gang that had come, along with Nitti, Dillinger, and Pretty Boy Floyd, all aimed their tommy guns, or ‘sub-guns’ as Bonnie likes to call them in her own poetry like in ‘the Story of Suicide Sal’, and opened fire at Weiss and Ricca. For over 6 minutes, the group fired dozens of magazines-worth of lead and brass into the hunk of steel, splattering blood and other viscera across the rusted metal of the car and the dusty road around them. Once the cacophonous symphony of the Chicago typewriters finally came to an end, the Barrow Gang and the rest of their entourage quietly packed up and drove away, heading back to the capital, leaving the corpses of Ricca the Rat and Hymie the Pole to rot in the sun as the vultures and other scavengers pick away at their corpses, denied a proper burial in a way fitting for the traitorous fiends they are."

The first truly infamous and widely-known outlaw biker group is aptly named the Outlaws Motorcycle Club, founded in 1935 in McCook, Illinois just a short drive outside of Chicago. Largely seen as the first true group of their kind, Outlaws MC has spread their activities all across the Midwest and towards the Eastern Seaboard, though they are not alone in their actions, famously having a bloody arch-rivalry with the up-and-coming Hells Angels coming out of California and the Southwest. Already having some friendly ties to the Organization thanks to Capone using them for occasional smuggling and intimidation jobs or as hired extra muscle, Outlaws MC is beginning to become a respected group of associates, and many believe that we should fully incorporate them into the Organization in order to utilize their talents. However, others argue that they are just competition and a future headache waiting to happen if they get too powerful thanks to their innate distrust of whatever is seen as mainstream and government-mandated, such as our Post-Caponeist ideology.

In order to drum up popular support for the bill, a new advertising campaign was launched, colorfully telling the scared masses to purchase tommy guns for home defense to ward off counter-revolutionary threats until order can be fully restored by the mafiosos and gangsters within the Organization, the ROSS, and the Red Army. \n\nHowever, this plan secretly has an additional purpose aside from letting the masses protect themselves while also allowing the state to make a quick buck, for all firearm purchases shall be logged, ammunition sales will be tracked, and background checks will be launched into each and every buyer so that we can monitor our populace more closely. With this sort of honey-pot trap, we will be able to catch would be counter-revolutionaries as they purchase large amounts of ammo or weaponry, while also allowing us to frame enemies of the state more easily with planted firearms and falsified evidence, or by enticing possible bad actors to purchase worryingly large amounts of weaponry in order to give the state justification for search, seizure, and arrest.

Regardless of who rises to the top, they are forever linked as close allies with a friendship forged over many long years as Nitti ran the ROSS with Dillinger at his side as his most effective agent and officer while Dillinger simultaneously ran the Red Army and served as its liaison to Nitti’s secret police.

Though his oldest brother James was ostracized from the rest of his family following his decision to follow a career in law enforcement and ranching and his brother Frank - a fellow mobster in Chicago - was killed on the orders of Papa Torrio in 1924 - Capone left behind another skilled mobster brother, Ralph ‘Bottles’ Capone, and a son. Born in 1918 to Capone’s Irish wife Mae Coughlin, Albert Francis Capone has suffered from partial deafness and minor developmental disorders due to being born with congenital syphilis due to his father, but took to the family business nonetheless, following in his father’s footsteps as a skilled bootlegger and con-man despite his mothers wishes for him to stay out of that life. Largely raised by other members of the Organization like Nitti and Dillinger, it is no wonder the kid has an attraction to organized crime and Caponeism. \n\nHowever, now that this young man has grown into a force to be reckoned with, the powers at be must decide on what to do with the Son of Scarface. \n\nShould he be kept out of this violent, hard life and swept away to live on his uncle James’ ranch in the Southwest, should he be kept under close supervision as a minor don within the Organization, or should the true heir of Capone finally stand up and seize his birthright, thought this would likely lead to his just being a puppet for the true powers that control the Chicago Outfit like Nitti and Dillinger?"

Though he would make a sound leader, allowing us to rule without obstacles or public scrutiny from behind his facade, some doubt his loyalty to true Caponeist philosophy, but is that an issue when he is truly of Capone’s own flesh and blood?

A Georgia boy alien to Chicago at first, Floyd made a name for himself as the Robin Hood of the Cookson Hills, robbing banks across the South and Midwest while burning mortgage, loan, and debt papers along the way to free local citizens of their monetary woes, becoming a sort of folk hero to many. Upon arriving in Chicago, Capone took a rare liking to him and the two became fast friends before Capone’s mind was entirely lost to his illness. Despite his popularity with both Capone and the wider masses, Floyd has never been one to jockey with the others like Dillinger and Hoffa for prominence, instead preferring to stay out of a position of power and free to do as he please for the good of the Organization and the people of this beautiful country under Capone. \n\nWith Capone now gone, and with Floyd’s own friend and ally [csa.getleader] in power, perhaps now could be different. Despite his insistence on staying out of any prominent position, a growing group of loyalists see Pretty Boy Floyd as the perfect successors - unbiased, level-headed, anti-totalitarian, cunning, widely-adored, and committed to the Caponeist idyll of creating a true mobster-run welfare-supported utopia. Could this perfect embodiment of the Robin Hood archetype, and most loyal Caponeist that has long worked to further Capone’s ideas of true humanitarian Socialism brought to life on the back of our criminal enterprise and empire without falling to the allure of totalitarian corruption like his contemporaries, be the real deal, or should we just stay the course but keep Pretty Boy Floyd on as a trusted advisor to the regime?"

Despite all his goodwill however, he cannot get the masses to listen to him on one thing - his name. It has long been held within public opinion that Dillinger is the rugged, handsome rogue of the Organization while Bonnie and Clyde have the best story as star-crossed lovers turned criminal dynamic duo, but the public has always maintained that Pretty Boy had the best nickname - a nickname given to him out of spite by others and a moniker he has always despised but beloved by the community, especially as he continues his goal of driving through every community in Capoenist America in order to see what can be done to improve the livelihood of each and every one of his people.

Recarving and resculpting the surface to his liking, the skilled team shall replace the visage of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Thomas J. ‘Stonewall’ Jackson riding on horseback with a new trio, being Capone himself riding in his beloved Series 452 Imperial Sedan being flanked on either side by his old mentor Paul Kelly - born Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli - who founded the old Five Points Gang that got Capone started in this great thing of ours, and by Charles Arthur ‘Pretty Boy’ Floyd who stands as Capone’s least biased and most loyal protégé, especially when it comes to following in Capone’s Robin Hood-esque activities and gangster humanitarianism, with both riding in their own Cadillacs as well. Angering the few surviving ODP members and Confederate loyalists left in decaying Dixie, Capone cares not as he eyes up his next target - the complete demolition and remodeling of Mount Rushmore at the Black Hills in South Dakota which is planned to replace the heads of some dusty old former presidents with his own face alongside the faces of his beloved wife Mea, mother Teresina, and son Albert Francis ‘Sonny’ Capone Jr., or perhaps he could even do it with just four versions of his own face - I guess only time and Capone’s erratic mood will tell."

Opening new soup kitchens, free clinics, and orphanages in every major city with help from his own mother Teresina and wife Mea along with the expanding Robin Hood-esque humanitarian relief and redistribution network headed by Pretty Boy Floyd, spreading secretly corrupt union practices to every workforce with the help of Hoffa, stealing the hearts and souls of the masses using mass charity, social teachings, and distributism with the help of Nitti and his ties to American Christendom, cracking heads and building safe stability with the suave, suited armies of Dillinger, and eliminating banditry and the last shreds of ideological rebellion with the roving militia hordes of Bonnie and Clyde, the Family Capone has come together to full heal America with the strange, syncretic, and often contradictory genius of Caponeism. And all along the way he has spread the seeds of his criminal enterprise as well, ensuring that not only will all of America be indebted to Scarface and his kindness, but they shall always continue to provide for the state as time marches on while the Organization grows from within nationwide, becoming a symbiotic and vital part of the American Dream all with the okay of the naive public."

csa.3612.d:0 "With the shining city of San Francisco now under our control, a question has arisen within the Chicago Outfit on what to do with the famed Rock, aka the old United States Penitentiary on Alcatraz Island. Located 1.25 miles off the city’s coast, Alcatraz (meaning ‘The Gannet’ in Spanish) is the site of an old fort that was later repurposed into one of the most infamous maximum security prisons in the old United States, standing alongside other famed jailhouses housing America’s worst offenders like Sing Sing, San Quentin, Leavenworth, or Folsom. Though most of Alcatraz’s inmates are little more than human refuse, there are some inmates that could prove useful, such as Robert Stroud aka the Birdman of Alcatraz, Alvin Karpas aka the first Public Enemy #1, Mickey Cohen - Kingpin of the Jewish Mafia, James ‘Whitey’ Bulger the Robin Hood of Massachusetts, or Roy Gardner the Smiling Mail Train Bandit - America’s last train robber. However, the inmates that have captured Capone’s attention most are the Kellys. \n\nBorn George Kelly Barnes, the patriarch of the Kelly family is known far and wide by his pseudonym Machine Gun Kelly, though this blood-steeped moniker has changed to Pop Gun Kelly since being incarcerated on account of him now lacking his famed tommy gun. Together with his wife and partner in crime Kathryn Thorne Kelly - herself an accomplished black widow, murderer, and gangster in her own right - the two pulled off one of the greatest crime sprees in American history, culminating in their botched attempt to abduct and ransom the famed oil tycoon Charles F. Urschel. Earning over $200,000 in ransom money, the duo were caught and arrested while on the run and hiding away at Kathryn’s mother Ora’s house outside Memphis - funnily enough on the same night that the Dillinger Gang broke out of prison in Indiana which stole much of the limelight of their capture. Arrested alongside Ora and her husband, Kathryn and Machine Gun Kelly have rotted in Alcatraz ever since, but could be just the experienced sort of gangster we need to serve as officers in our military of delinquents. \n\nCapone has already left many old foes and potential competitors to rot in the various prisons our forces have already liberated - such as his old arch-rival George ‘Bugs’ Moran whom Capone waged a successful crime war against dubbed the Bootleg Battle of the Marne, and who still languishes away in Leavenworth even after the rest of the prison was drafted into our criminal militias, as if Moran losing most of his gang in the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre on Capone’s orders wasn’t punishment enough - so leaving the Kellys and the rest of these freaks locked up too wouldn't be out of character for our beloved Scarface. However, they could still be of use to us so long as we do not let them rise too high in the pecking order. So should we give ol’ Pop Gun Kelly his Machinegun back, or shall these failed gangsters be resigned to rot away on Alcatraz for the remainder of their days?"

Despite the deaths and sudden disappearances of many minor members, the Congress has continued and its main stars are already in play. \n\nJimmy Hoffa leads the moderate semi-Syndicalist faction dominated by his teamsters and unions, and dogged by corruption allegations, while Capone’s personal enforcer John Dillinger leads the hardliners with the aid of the OSS, the Red Army, and the various mafioso militias. Frank Nitti, as Capone’s chosen heir and life-long best friend is the favorite to win, but is known to be spineless, averse to leadership roles while preferring to delegate instead, and is possibly being blackmailed by famous hitman and anti-Socialist Paul ‘Ricca the Rat’ De Lucia, while ‘Roaring’ Dan Seavey of the Red Navy seeks to keep Caponeism relatively unchanged while infusing some Left Libertarian ideas and pivoting towards piracy and the pursuit of a criminal thalassocracy he dubs ‘Neo-Caponeism’. \n\nOn the fringes of the Congress, the Illegalist Anarchists Bonnie and Clyde seek to ‘free’ Caponeism with their Anarchist philosophy, but many are wary of their ally Rene Belbenoit and his shady Third Internationale contacts, and Charles ‘Lucky’ Luciano returns from New York City in order to seize control of his old rival’s empire in order to pursue total criminal unity and peaceful coexistence supported by his own idea of mobster populism.

Far more than just a gangster though, Luciano has big plans for America, and has managed to dominate the Post-Caponeist world thanks to the help of his allies from New York City like the Five Families, Murder Incorporated, and other less centralized Northeast crime figures like Big Bill Lias, Anthony Soprano Sr., and Nucky Thompson. Surprisingly to some, his first course of action has been to rid himself of any of the grandiosity of his predecessor, preferring to remain a power behind the scenes so as to not seem too imposing to other leaders within the Organization and his own inner-circle the Commission like his close allies Papa Johnny Torrio and Meyer Lansky. This, combined with Luciano's desire to keep the peace between all American gangs and crime families while also promoting ties with international crime syndicates, may lead to a new era of prosperity, but it is too early to tell.

Now that Nitti is in charge, he shall continue the will of Capone to the letter, believing this to be essential to the long term well-being of the country. Despite his nickname of 'the Enforcer' earned during his days as a capo and head of the ROSS, Nitti rarely kills anyone himself. Rather, he prefers using hitmen and subordinates, especially his close ally and friend John Dillinger, to do the more unsavory parts of his business, leaving him to use his sharp business acumen to manage the country with relatively clean hands and no distractions. Through this management, and with Nitti's position more than secure, perhaps the order established by Capone will remain intact after all..."

His wild and unpredictable behavior has made it difficult for his subordinates to form any semblance of organized government regardless, and it seems that the man nicknamed the 'Red Marshal' plans to run the country with the help of his fellow generals, hoping that their personal loyalty to him will be enough to keep him out of prison. Despite not seeming to understand that he is now the number one man in the country, and hence effectively above the law, Dillinger is a dangerous man, and his talent for warfare should not be underestimated. Despite his hatred of centralized government, it seems that his leadership is just the stabilizer the country needs in the aftermath of Capone's death, and thanks to Dillinger, we may finally have peace in America..."

As Hoffa regaled his audience on the classics of Marxist-Caponeism and on the heroics of revolutionary heroes such as Pretty Boy Floyd, ‘Roaring’ Dan Seavey, Bonnie and Clyde, and the surviving brother of Capone Ralph and Capone’s own son Albert before delving into the heart of his message - Hoffa called for reform and a softening of the nation’s harsh policies, hoping to soften the appearance of our Caponeist state while better taking care of the people, but in all likelihood this is but a mask for Hoffa’s true intentions as a known corrupt fiend and master kleptocrat among his union and teamster allies and enemies. Though many have decried this act as revisionism, causing the very factionalism Capone warned about, Hoffa is determined that nominal reform is the CSSA’s only hope at long-term survival.

While a reliable means of securing our leftist base and union support, it is little secret that Lovestone is highly ambitious, a view Lawrence Dennis' most recent report only reinforces. According to Dennis, Lovestone has been meeting with more military officials in recent days and even set up a private meeting with Earl Browder, which was clearly supposed to be a secret from us. While perhaps nothing to worry about as Lovestone may simply be playing games against his new rival Howard Scott or otherwise securing his position Dennis requests that we double down on aggressive espionage against Lovestone, although this carries the risk of turning him against us if discovered."

That he is fishing for a way to remove Lawrence Dennis' loyalists and insert his own is becoming obvious. While this is presented as a threat to Burnham as well it is possible that letting the two bicker will help keep either from getting too powerful, and even in the case of the coup succeeding, Lovestone could take Burnham's place as his right-hand man. Of course, the CSS report cautions against such notions, claiming that an outright coup against the Director himself is more likely.

Recent reports from our scouts in the field indicate that Scott and his group are currently hiding out in Wisconsin, right next to the Canadian border on a resupply mission.

With his location known to us, many within our administration have stressed the need to strike now and cut the head off of this snake once and for all. However, Lovestone is hesitant - almost paranoid - that Scott is one step ahead of him like he was back in Chicago, and has shown hesitation towards acting now.

Though Scott would still lead the Council from behind the public curtain, Hubbert, or Oppenheimer would be the shining, dashing face that would now rally our Technate towards cohesive and unified glory. Though this proposition has hurt Scott’s image, he is still a deeply respected figure, and many would still support him if he chose to refuse such a move.

A self-avowed expert on engineering, science, and other rational philosophies, Scott has never been able to actually show physical proof of these accomplishments, leading to doubt among some of his loyalists in Technocracy Inc. With this doubt spreading, some decided to dig into Scott’s life, and found that although Scott did study and student-teach at Columbia University in New York City, there is no evidence that he ever graduated with any of the degrees he claims to have. \n\nAmbushing Scott during one of the Board’s routine meetings on energy accounting, these doubters attempted to reveal Scott’s apparent falsehoods, demanding to see his diplomas. However, the situation was diffused as M. King Hubbert - Scott’s right-hand man, lifelong friend, and Vice-Director in Chief of the Technate - defended his old colleague. Swearing that he studied and graduated alongside Scott decades ago, Hubbert - whose own academic achievements were well-known and easily verifiable - lambasted the doubters as charlatans and fools trying to make a power play. Hubbert even went so far as to quiz Scott on his knowledge in the field of Physics right there on the spot, and with Scott truly being a whizz at Physics despite the dubiousness of his claims, he was able to pass with flying colors, putting to rest any doubt over Scott’s expertise, at least for now."

However, unlike ever before, these two have come to blows yet again, and the fate of the CCT now hangs in the balance. Hemmy resists Loebs rapid approach to utopian reform, and seeks to further Loeb’s ideas in a more passive sense while taking a back seat to rulership himself to further delve into his own artistic and hedonistic pursuits, shifting more and more rule to the Technocratic Congress in his stead while he remains the face of the movement and while Loeb continues to run many things from the shadows.

csa.69696.d:0 "A colleague of Scott’s during their time together in James Burnham’s diverse political camp before the outbreak of the Civil War, Lawrence Dennis has come knocking on Scott’s door once again as Technocracy, Inc rises to dominate the American Dream. Nicknamed ‘America’s Number 1 Intellectual Techno-Corporatist in the press, Dennis has long and loudly professed the apparent ‘inevitability’ of Technocratic ideas in America and the wider world while pulling from his diverse French influences from groups on both sides of the Mediterranean like the Right Technocrats of François Lehideux within his Synarchic Empire Movement, the Left Technocrats of Marcel Déat and his allies in X-Crise, as well as loosely from the centralized National Syndicalism of the Charterists - all influences picked up from his past career as a military policeman in France during the Great War and his time in the Foreign Legion following the Paris-Algeriers split - ideas further expanded and cemented after his later tours of duty in the American interventions in Latin America. A devoted anti-capitalist with allies and friends all across the farthest reaches of the American Far Right, a lawyer once suspected of sedition turned into an advisor to one of the largest banking trusts in the New World under Seligman, a firebrand journalist famous for scathing exposés against hives of capitalist excess, a moderate anti-semite massively in favor of centralized government and authoritarian politics as a means to an end for the betterment of the nation, and a curiously olive-skinned intellectual from Georgia that curiously refuses to publicly talk about America’s racial issues outside of a tacit and aloof indignation towards the so-called ‘odious comparisons’ that uphold outdated segregation, Dennis is your semi-typical Right Technocrat and Corporatist, besides his one not so well kept secret - that he is half Black. \n\nA mixed race youth from Atlanta born so pale he could easily pass for White, Lawrence Dennis has lived his life as a lie, pretending to be a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant to all his associates, friends, allies, and even family since he was a young teenager, with his own wife and children not even knowing of his true race. With many friends being members of White Nationalist circles and other racially-charged groups, this secret contradiction is bizarre at best but it seemingly works for Dennis, although it may not be so secret after all, for many of those close to Dennis probably know the truth and just keep it to themselves, for his devotion to their shared cause is matched by few, if any at all. A useful idiot to darker powers or a true colleague independent enough to stand in his own moderate little zone of compromise and cooperation, it is not known, but Dennis serves as the bridge between Scott’s movement and the Far-Right, should we choose to take it."

csa.5181.d:0 "In this new America being forged by President Harold Loeb and his allies, democracy still rings true and free, but in an altered fashion. Government administrations all across the nation, from the smallest town and county governments to the Federal Government itself, have been reforged into their own democratically elected Technocratic councils. Local officials are directly nominated and vote on by individuals of that town or county, state councils are staffed by state-wide elections at the end of every term, and the two chambers of Congress, the House and the Senate, have been replaced by two large councils - one of STEM experts and one of more creative types - to serve as the guiding force and rotating legislature of the nation under the executive council made up of the President and their cabinet. \n\nThe notion of a career politician is dead, for councilmembers can only serve two terms, and are selected by their peers without the ability to make a career out of it, ensuring that serving as a representative is a service for your fellow man and not a pathway to corruption and self enrichment. The Escape has been a success, and Technocratic Utopian Democracy has been perfected, and America is now guided by an ever-rotating and directly-democratic hierarchy of experts and visionaries, ensuring that our pathway along the gold-gilded road to Utopia is smooth, fair, and egalitarian, all while being free of the corrupting forces and vices that tore down the former America that decayed before us."

With the success of our movement, many have begun to view the fires and horrors of the Second American Civil War and our following rise to power over the tyrants Burnham and Lovestone as this very Escape, for under Loeb’s guidance, we are now on the fast-track to egalitarian paradise. \n\nFor the general majority of the masses, this has just gone to prove Loeb, Hemingway, and their CCT as sound leaders and visionaries, boosting our support and public opinion ratings across the nation. However, more diehard and zealous loyalists of Loeb have begun to regard him as a prophet and herald. Though Loeb has pushed back against these ideas, both secular and spiritual cults of personality have begun to pop up in aesthetically-charged cities and urban centers across America in small pockets of diehard fanatics, but they number in far too little numbers to be of any real effect. Regardless, Loeb’s popularity continues to skyrocket nationwide, so let us continue to ride the wave towards Utopia."

csa.5183.d:0 "’Not only would the concept of property and the incentive of effort be different in a Technocracy, but religion, education, amusement, art, sport, culture, and every other human institution and expression would undergo transformations more or less radical.’ In his own words, Loeb predicted the societal upheaval and metamorphosis that would come with the ascension of Technocracy and The Escape, but now we do not have to wonder what forms such expressions will assume! We have the means to be able to mold society to how we see fit, and we see it fit to let it evolve on its own like it was its own living and breathing organism undergoing mutation and transformation in accordance with the stimuli placed upon it by the needs, whims, and actions of the masses. \n\nThe Mysticism of Money has been uprooted, and Americans are now free of economic bondage to be able to devote their lives to other causes, and while other Revolutions have expended great effort and resources trying to dictate the lives of their masses, we shall let them live free as they choose to be, so long as they do not infringe upon the same rights all of us now share. Let them pray if they want to pray, or let them cast off religion if that is what they so choose. Let them create, and teach, and theorize; let them continue to evolve free of their former slavery. Our movement does not seek to dominate and dictate, but to free and to guide. We give our populace the tools to make their own amusement, and now they are finally free to do so.

The survivors now work throughout the new Technocratic councils across the nation, with many being within the Technocratic Congress’ two houses, or within the court system or other lower offices as elected by the people if deemed expert enough. However, one group - the Social Patriots - have put an emphasis on cooperation with our movement. Led by Norman Thomas, Meyer London, John Lewis, David Dubinsky, William Green, George Meany, Matthew Woll, Philip Murray, and others, the Social Patriots two factions work together to pursue American-style Socialist Democracy and Bellamy-inspired Realistic Utopianism, and many of their ideas mesh well with our own.

csa.150.d:0 "The state legislature of Illinois has invited the IWW to discuss the current crisis and the looming deadline issued by the federal government. Bill Haywood accepted this offer and held an informal meeting with several trade union leaders prior. Haywood made it clear that the situation was dire, and the SPA would need to unite behind the IWW in order to survive the coming conflict. This silent agreement meant that the traditional SPA leadership would be reorganized along Industrial Unionist lines, with each union representative allowed a single vote. The SPA immediately and unanimously pledged their support for a social revolution through direct action, not diplomacy."

Declaring that direct action against capitalist society was a vital necessity for all Americans and that the federal government's deadline must not only be ignored but defied. Telegrams from the Third International poured in to support Haywood's SPA, exciting the attendants. A vote was called to begin reforming the American capitalist economy into an anarcho-syndicalist economy. This referendum, signed by the attendants, declared the Federal Reserve null and void. The IWW was appointed the labor chamber for the new syndicalist government, and the selling of company shares was declared illegal.

The Red Guard has ordered an evacuation of lower Manhattan, in order to both seize the gold in the Federal Reserve Bank as well as dismantle Wall Street. In this delegation were reporters, who were allowed to watch congressmen carry safe boxes away for safekeeping in Chicago. These items are put under the trust of the IWW, who have elected Norman Thomas as their under-secretary. Several SPA politicians were arrested in Washington D.C for meeting outside the Eccles Building, ordering the Federal Reserve Chairman Eugene Black to hear their petitions."

csa.153.t:0 "Deadline Looms"
csa.153.d:0 "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Across the part of the country controlled by Haywood's supporters, Red Guards have been raised in large numbers and a growing determination to see the country remade in a syndicalist image by force has taken hold. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they see no path to compromise."

csa.154.t:0 "Reconcile with the CSA?"
csa.154.d:0 "Against all odds, [CSA.GetNameDef] has triumphed against all opposition, radically transforming America overnight. From their constitutional convention, a new system has arisen, one centered around the principles of syndicalism and workers' democracy - biased as it may be, it's still democratic at its core, something which surprised many people expecting the revolution to inevitably collapse into tyranny. With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, a furious debate has broken out regarding the possibility of peaceful reunification. While our government is favorable to many of [CSA.GetNameDef]'s policies, they are also far more radical and will be negotiating from a position of strength - meaning we will be forced to accept many hard compromises. On the other hand, the [CSA.GetNameDef] has proven its resilience, with both the Federal Government and Huey Long's Union State crushed under their armies. Perhaps we should accept the inevitable and avoid more bloodshed before the victors turn their eyes towards California."

However, it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they have bitterly denounced the Revolutionary Congress as a hollow mockery of democracy, no better than the tyrants in Washington, Atlanta, and New Orleans it had replaced. It seems that once again, force will be needed to reunite the shattered pieces of the country."

csa.165.t:0 "William Z. Foster Criticizes Election"
csa.165.d:0 "Clearly both sore and shocked by the victory of James Burnham, William Z. Foster has questioned the legitimacy of the election, wondering how a once-fringe figure within the CSA could come to prominence using legitimate means and if another election is in order. Thankfully due to the bad blood endured between him and Earl Browder near the end of the election he can not muster the political power to unite Vanguardists against Burnham. It's theorized that Foster's fears of the American Workers Party are partly due to Jay Lovestone, who was forced out of his brief position as a leader of American Communists by Foster when he leveraged against Lovestone his early support for Leon Trotsky during the Russian Civil War and his attempts to mainstream American Communism among the public with his theory of 'American Exceptionalism'. Lovestone is one of the sub-leaders of the AWP ever since Burnham invited the "Lovestonites" into the Managerial fold. In return for promises of influence, Lovestone garnered whatever support he could among the garment unions for Burnham and gradually shifted his communism into Managerial-Communism, arguing it was compatible with his American Exceptionalism theory that American Capitalism was unique and had to be dealt with differently than in other nations. Foster had long thought his old rival was no longer a threat but now he is clearly nervous that is not just Browder he must keep an eye on."

It can be organized in such a way that there is always a class of workers being productive for four hours a day, four days a week which they boast would avoid the "weekend effect" in traditional economies.

Hardliners, Jay Lovestone, and some impatient armed forces research directors support using the equipment on death-row prisoners who will be granted clemency if they survive in whatever war they serve in, already nicknaming them "Iron Brigades".

csa.176.d:0 "In the face of radical proposals redefining the family President Burnham would like to maintain some semblance of the nuclear family. He has proposed family units that operate more closely to traditional families by strengthening divorce laws and placing greater importance on them while also allowing "Social Unions" to exist where non-married people of draft age can legally "cohabitate" with married partners who are approved Party Members if they and their children are provided for. This can provide a compromise between more socially conservative socialists and radicals and will increase our birth rate after the Civil War depleted us of mainly fighting age men as well finding a possible solution to our male-female imbalance after the Civil War. However, it has come under attack by feminist activists as being both a cynical ploy by Burnham to placate the well-off and party loyalists by offering (largely) young women as "concubines" as the cost of turning back the clock on divorce laws pushed for by legislatures. Burnham has dismissed this as absurd but nonetheless considers having the CSS monitor those who accept 'co-habitation' to ensure abuses don't take place and requiring co-habitants to only be eligible if between 20 and 40 years old."

A gaunt and limping William Z. Foster was brought in front of Congress to admitting to leading a conspiracy with a group of dissatisfied "Galleanist" anarchists and began reading off names of would-be coup members in Congress, all of whom were known critics of the President. As the traitors' names were read off they were walked out of Congress by armed guards. By the end of the speech most of the four-fifths of Congress that remained yelled 'Long Live the Revolution', clearly terrified.

Lovestone and angered AWP supporters want an example made and want to launch an all-out attack on the communes. Finally, while the Technocrats usually try to stay out of the political sphere in favor of economics they were clearly a bit disturbed by this suggestion and quietly stated they would simply have them pledge their allegiance to the new government and nationalize their industries but allow them to self-organize their hours and preferences.

A national poll has shown the number of women-only unions has quadrupled in the past year. When interviewed, these women-only unions claim persistent systematic discrimination in the fields of science and civil service. In the aftermath of this release, the planned Women's Caucus was canceled, as the nation begins to debate the ethical application of women's liberation. [CSA.GetLeader] has settled the debate by decrying the systematic discrimination, arguing that women-only unions are not only a proper response but an inevitable one to "radical gender integrationist" ideas.

After all, the damage caused by the Founder experiencing a premature death would be irreversible to our young Republic. The simplest solution would be to lock down the White House although some say the location is still too vulnerable and conspicuous. An interesting proposal was to finish building Hearst Castle and move the President there as it would be nigh impossible to reach him although moving into the former estate of a capitalist would not make for a good appearance. A colonel proposed building a series of bunkers near Boulder Dam as finding him would be near-impossible though at the cost of being almost totally isolated from society. Finally, party member Ackerman proposed buying out the top twenty floors of the Empire State Building and keeping the Founder in a penthouse there, noting it would make it impossible to reach him or to know which floor he is on while also staying near a center of political power and reminding the citizenry of his presence."

Efforts towards integration started with collaborators being propped up in key gubernatorial positions and assisted with American settlers moving in the territory and subsequently assimilating the residing Canadian population through the spread of cultural and social values of our Red Columbia. These strategies have borne fruit, and now Canadian Identity has faltered to the point where ‘Canada’ is a strange and alien concept to the populace.

They have performed numerous strategic bombings and attacks on our soldiers when given the opportunity, with the most concerning part that their numbers are growing with each passing day.

In addition to destroying roads along the former border, the CLF has used dynamite to blow up passages in the Rocky Mountains, preventing American Soldiers from accessing much of the former Canadian Provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. In practice, this has allowed many small mountain towns such as Banff and Jasper to devolve into lawless chaos, with members of the former Royal Canadian Mounted police taking refuge in these so-called ‘Safe Zones’. Solutions to this persistent issue have ranged from the extravagant, including the destruction of the Rocky Mountain range with Nuclear Weapons, to the practical, including using incendiary weapons on these so-called ‘Safe-Zones’. Of course, a middle ground to these options is to simply starve them out, as these zones are inaccessible by supply caravans without the Rocky Mountain roads."

These supporters of the long-dead British Empire have used our restructuring of former Canadian Governments, most notably in Ontario to claim that we are attacking Anglophone Culture. Leaders of former British Officers and rightist activists in the area are doing whatever they can to oppose our efforts, including mass protests and guerilla attacks. One notable example is former rightwing leader Rotha Lintorn-Orman fleeing to the desolate land of Northern Ontario to conduct raids on friendly settlements. The members of the so-called ‘Rotha’s Raiders’ consist mainly of former members of the now-defunct ‘Imperial Unity Party’, with its ranks including members of the former English Mistery and the party’s former leader Adrien Arcand. Others such as J.F.C. Fuller and John Ross Taylor are labeled as ‘Missing’, with some reporting sightings of Fuller in the Northwest Territories; others claim he fled the country with the King once Canada fell. While they are unable to achieve their final aim of Canadian and British Liberation, they are a sizable thorn in our side; what shall be done with them? Some have suggested appealing to the bitterness of former-Canadians who felt ignored and oppressed by the former Exiles, using them as a means to sabotage their operations. Others have warned against this, saying that even the Anti-Imperialist Canadians can’t be trusted. "

Canada’s identity, already weak from almost a century of interconnectedness with the United States, has now begun falling apart, as the concept of Canada’s ‘Identity’ has become a popular punchline in American Media. Comic Books showcasing the brutality of Canadian Resistance, Television Shows with the CLF as the main antagonists, and comedic routines ridiculing the concept of ‘Canada’ have all greatly aided in the destruction of Canadian identity. Popular Canadian colloquialisms such as the tendency to say ‘Eh’ have also been subject to popular ridicule, leading to many Canadians attempting to hide their Canadian-ness.

But Canabal's atheistic devotion was not limited to simple mockery, for multiple cloisters, convents and churches have felt the warm embrace of the revolutionary's bombs.

Under [CSA.GetLeader]’s watch, we have built up our resource-gathering Technates, transforming this once barren land of ice and snow into a thriving center of industry! The new West is a bastion of goods that can be put to full use for American Socialism.

The disregard for former Canadian borders is a powerful signal that the days of Canada’s recognition as a distinct entity is coming to an end. The identity of the Maritime Provinces is fading away, and with it a new American Identity it deserves. These former Canadian territories have now become the beautiful territories America deserves, and there is a suggestion we use southern Nova Scotia as a resort area so hard-working employees and high-ranking officers can be rewarded with vacation homes in the area. Others have rejected this proposal as a gaudy and lavish display of cronyism, and have suggested using the former Province of Prince Edward Island as a giant military training ground and Labour Camp, where dissidents will be put to work in PEI’s vast potato farms.

It has been a policy to erase any sort of Canadian ‘Identity’ that may spring up, a policy that has been begrudgingly accepted by many Quebeckers due to their resentment of the Canadian Government. The milquetoast acceptance of American Rule has proven to be short lived however, as Quebecois compatriots have found themselves targeted under the same Anti-Canadian laws in effect throughout Canada. The ‘Enemy of my Enemy’ principle would lead some to believe the solution is to ease restrictions in Quebec, allowing them to maintain a distinct identity under American Watch.

While a man like Reagan would typically have either fled or spent the rest of his life hiding, his commitment to patriotic leftism and willingness to serve under the newly elected Chairman James Burnham gained him a place in, where he spent his days repaying his debt by serving as a radio broadcaster; relaying news and praises of the founder until eventually rising to the head of the FCC. Reagan’s commitment to Americanist Socialism, loyalty to Burnham, and personal similarities to Burnham have given him a prime position in Burnham's cabinet, serving as an important loyalist to the founder himself; a welcome juxtaposition the scheming loyalists to Scott and Lovestone ."

Along the way, Burnham has picked up two young loyalists who have grown close to him as a mentor and ideological teacher, and who help the President resist the influence of the ambitious Lovestone and the naive Technocrats, being the devoted Burnhamite Lyndon Hermyle LaRouche Jr. and the rehabilitated Federalist Progressive turned Conservative Progressive Burnhamite Ronald Wilson Reagan. While Reagan is known for his ‘neo-conservative’ Rightist Left-wing economic stances and Progressive social agenda fused with his Democratic Socialist and Technocratic-Burnhamist views, LaRouche is known for his more outlandish takes, such as the desire to build a bridge or tunnel across the Bering Strait, advocating for the Gold Standard, and for promoting Futurist socioeconomic and agrarian policies along with nuclear energy research, energy weapon research, and economic nationalization, to name a few things. However, he has also been plagued by accusations of racism, homophobia, conspiratorialism, xenophobia, and anti-semitism, among other ills that have ostracized him among some Socialist circles.

Seeking to gut anti-American sentiment and counter-revolutionary tendencies the world over, Burnham envisions the creation of a hegemonic global hierarchy, instead of any weak and malleable balance of power, where America stands at the top of the heap as the true and only scion of purified Internationalism set free from the failures of the Trotskyite and Syndicalist past. A single World Federation - or a World Empire as he plainly calls it - initiated and led by we master managerialists in America, secured by our monopoly on the global atomic weapon supply and by our immense natural and material wealth, creating a system where we Americans would hold a preponderance of decisive material power over all the rest of the world, and rightfully so. Such a plan would likely begin through linking we Americans with the lands of the Anglosphere with common citizenship and ease of travel first, though Burnham dreams of such a federative empire to one day stretch to every corner of the globe, should it be feasible, as a true realization of the Internationalist dream once failed by the Bolsheviks and the Third Internationale, but now possibly and finally redeemed by American grit and determination.

The mainstream of the IWW is even more traditionalist bottom-up, however, wanting for IWW to simply expand its recruitment, spread propaganda, and allowing radical unions to self-organize while being protected by the Red Militias.

However while the IWW syndicalists would like for the General Defence Committee to be made up of more union representatives with regular public debriefings of their activities the Ultra-Left believe both models are too authoritarian and instead the GDC should be little more than a meeting body of rebels and activists who want to be involved in anti-reactionary activity, with full transparency to those who vote for them.

The IWW believes this is too traditional however and favors a more democratic model in which the military is even more democratic, with so-called "Generals" only serving for as long they are popularly recognized as such and being recallable by a general vote. On the ground level, the same would apply to soldiers and most military actions would be settled by a popular decision of the units rather than officers, with officers being little more than temporarily elected to administrative duties. Finally, the Ultra-Left dislikes the idea of a national military on even such a level, with the new Red Army being made up of voluntary militias from across the nation that self-organize and only voluntarily recognizes commanders, with the new national military essentially being made up of coordination between them.

In the CIO model, these judicial appointments would largely relate to constitutional cases with this new supreme court of 5 would be slightly insulated from public opinion by serving terms instead of being recallable, serving six years before needing to be re-elected. However, the IWW has called this 'nationalistic' and a step backward and believes that workers' direct democracy should settle nearly all local issues and most national ones, with representatives there largely to help with administrative duties and negotiations. Meanwhile, each group of industrial unions would decide which organizations or actions are dangerously reactionary or not amongst themselves, with national laws being settled by direct democracy, any judges used being instantly recallable and the constitution easier to reform. As per usual the Ultra-Left believes all forms of organization should be settled locally and through direct democracy, with aid from their local Red Guard to protect them from reactionaries. As such, they oppose the establishment of any national-level Court, with smaller Federation Courts being made up communes that voluntarily join."

Black and fellow unskilled workers, who were organized en masse by the CIO, now find themselves in limbo as the executive deliberates on how to address them, exacerbating anxieties.

Swiftly centralizing control, loyalists were installed into leadership positions through ballot stuffing, red baiting, and armed force.

To balance this shift, craft unions have pushed through controversial reforms, stripping certain voting rights and forms of representation from industrial unions, despite their larger sizes.

With more than 200,000 women laborers starting work the automotive industry and other wartime industries became the epicenter of social progress. While many of these industries resisted this change, with the hiring of women workers being met with strikes from their male counterparts, the reality of total war settled any dispute. The UAW, which once pushed women off heavy machinery, now saw 108 women delegates elected along with collaboration with the NAACP to organize black women in war industries. The CSA’s National War Labor Board passed revolutionary bills expanding women's right to work and protections, and with the fear of more radicals organizing the new workforce, the AFL acted and began organizing en masse. \n\nBefore the war, the main representation of women in the AFL was the Women's Trade Union League, Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. The WTUL is a middle-class feminist organization whose economic support was utilized to support fights for protective legislation and funding industrial actions of the often-poor working-class rank and file. These women backed organizing efforts, provided education support, and walked picket lines, though often they were disconnected from the women they supported due to their wealth. ACWA and the ILGWU, headed by Sidney Hillman and David Dubinsky, are based on the organization of women, with the ILGWU being made up of 3/4s women. These unions, while a major point of support for further organization of women, have had problems of executive power being unrepresentative of their female workforce, with only one woman being a member of the ILGWU's executive.\n\n Despite all the advancements in the Civil War for working women's rights, the men have come home, and the question of seniority has been raised.

In response, industrial unions launch Operation Dixie, aiming to dismantle the conservative stronghold that has oppressed Southern workers since the nation's inception.

Her dedication to social reform began in the Young Women's Christian Association, where she advocated for state labor laws promoting safer workplaces, an end to child labor, and fair wages. As Virginia chairwoman of the Women in Industry Committee under Gompers' AFL, she played a pivotal role in Operation Dixie's expansion, leveraging her social status to achieve where others faltered. She was instrumental in persuading the Southern Baptist Convention to acknowledge labor rights and fostered interfaith and interracial coalitions dedicated to labor advocacy. Known for her straightforward speech, calm yet resolute demeanor, and ability to bring civil liberties violations to federal attention, Mason embodies the spirit of progress in the face of adversity.\n\n Despite facing relentless opposition, including shootings, lynchings, and bombings targeting organizers and unionists, the remnants of southern resistance persist.

While working in a garment factory, he participated in a spontaneous strike and swiftly emerged as its leading spokesman, leading to the formation of Local 39 of the United Garment Workers. During this time, Hillman encountered his wife and numerous progressive reformers, shaping his ideology of industrial democracy. Following the incompetence of the UGW, Hillman was elected president of the splintering Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in 1914. He instituted a policy of constructive cooperation with employers, and throughout the 1910s and 20s, the union burgeoned as the largest in the male garment industry, representing 177,000 workers. Amidst the Great Depression, Hillman continued to rally support for the workers he represented, establishing social programs, educational systems, and a low-cost cooperative housing policy, in addition to founding the Amalgamated Bank. When the CIO emerged in opposition to the craft union executive, Hillman was elected vice president.

csa.616.d:0 "As we progress our own moderated form of this reformation-revolution that has swept America, the AFL-CIO has not-so-quietly argued behind closed doors on various matters, but these days the biggest debate is on welfare. Although any honest member of the AFL-CIO supports the concept of social welfare on paper, the specific form such a system should take in  our newly united states has been the topic of heated discussion to say the least. The most far left among our numbers, like the market socialists of George Meany, push for the idea of social dividends - or direct payments to each citizen derived from the property income generated by publicly owned enterprises that tap into natural resources and capital assets owned collectively by society - in order to create a more blatantly and fully Socialist economy built on mass collective ownership, though many are wary on such radical ideas as Meany's clique are slandered as Bukharinite Bolshevists in disguise. Their rivals in this have been the bulk of the AFL-CIO's center who all support a system of universal basic income in some form or another as based upon and adapted from the works of past American and English theorists on the subject like Thomas Paine and his rival Thomas Spence, Henry George, and Thomas More. Competing against these groups are the most moderate socialists and social democrats among us, along with those few holdouts still tied to ideas of pink capitalism and those who are too corrupt to care, all of whom push for more standard concepts of social welfare, for one reason or another, on a platform pulling from ideas similar to those posited by the old Progressive Party of George Norris, the Square Deal of Teddy Roosevelt, and the other varied works of welfare politicians like Philip La Follette, Fiorello La Guardia, and the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt Sr., among others. Which faction should have their plan implemented going forward?"
csa.616.a:0 "Social dividends will carry us towards true Market Socialism."
csa.616.b:0 "Follow Paine's legacy with universal basic income."
csa.616.c:0 "Stick to more standard social welfare practices."

csa.617.t:0 "The Spread of Hemingway’s Cats"
csa.617.d:0 "As our concept of the true Revolution sweeps across this united America, a curious breed of feline creatures has been spread across this healing nation as well, all thanks to Ernest Hemingway. A friend to most Leftists within our clique, Hemingway has been able to get many Leftist political leaders and celebrities at home and abroad to adopt his favorite type of cat - polydactyl cats. Born with a congenital physical anomaly called polydactyly that causes extra toes to grow on their paw(s), these types of cats have long fascinated Hemingway, loving them more than nearly anything else in the world while breeding them at care centers like the one back on his private island home in the Florida Keys after a ship captain gifted him a six-toed cat named Snowball. The supportive little things that this titan of the Revolution has needed to keep his darker thoughts at bay, as Hemingway has privately struggled with depression throughout most of his life, these joyful little cats have now been spread far and wide to bring the same love  to any friend of the Revolution. Frequently being used as new union mascots and strike cats, Snowball and the rest of his extra-toed kind are sure to be a staple of bodegas and households across America for generations to come."

csa.330.d:0 "The Independence League has arisen victorious but now a leader must be settled on, with each of the candidates being known social activists for the Bellaymist Nationalist Clubs and Independence League in general."

csa.331.t:0 "Incorporating the AFL"
csa.331.d:0 "Our reorganization of the unions into National Guilds requires the incorporation of the AFL, our allies in the Social Patriot faction. As we organize major Departments, sometimes referred to as Guilds when referring to the workers exclusively, we could make them the controlling faction of the Craftsmen Guild, having sub-bureau's answer to them so long as they respect the new laws. Others consider this favoritism however and think they should still have to merge with other crafts unions before settling Department rules and leadership."
csa.331.a:0 "Give them an edge"
csa.331.b:0 "We must be impartial"

csa.332.t:0 "Nationalist Club Growth"
csa.332.d:0 "Throughout the country Nationalist Clubs in the ilk of the old Bellamyist ones are being created but as opposed to simply supporting the already state-ideology of Bellamyism they are hosting artistic and spiritual endeavors as well, viewing it as the highest form of being as is consistent with Bellamyist manifestos. This is a success although it appears more popular to higher-ranking members of the Industrial Army, leading to proposals to have them host more community events as well although this would dilute their current focus."
csa.332.a:0 "They are fine as is"
csa.332.b:0 "They should have broader appeal"

csa.333.t:0 "Economic Planning"
csa.333.d:0 "Our planned economy needs a goal to work towards to unite the nation, leaving two broad options, to focus on agricultural development or industrial development. The National Clubs and Independence League is split on the issue, with some approving of a focus on agriculture due to associating it with Jeffersonian freedom and naturalism while the more orthodox socialist elements would rather we prioritize industrialization."

csa.333.b:0 "Focus on Agriculture"
csa.333.c:0 "Divide between Both"

csa.334.t:0 "Great Departments Organized"
csa.334.d:0 "With the Guilds and Distributive and Productive Departments being created, ten Great Departments representing allied industries have been organized using our economies of scale, allowing us to more efficiently produce goods. It is illegal for any Department to illegalize a creation of a good that is in low-demand although they are allowed to raise the price correspondingly if it is costly to design, so long as the consumer is willing to pay for it. Each Department is headed by a Lieutenant General, elected by senior and retired guild members."
csa.334.a:0 "About time"

csa.335.t:0 "Clubhouses Built"
csa.335.d:0 "Each of the Guilds is being tasked with building 'Clubhouses', namely clubhouses in which comfort and luxury are the focus and can be enjoyed in the social sphere for a limited amount of time. Likewise, vacation homes are being built which can be used by workers in the same rotation manner if they desire it. Of course, while Bellaymist manifestos suggest that the public should all enjoy the clubhouses equally this makes it a bit more difficult to organize and limit individual use, leading to suggestions that each Guild should control and manage different Clubhouses and Social Sphere benefits, with the central government only managing a certain amount itself for those falling under the unclassified grade of the industrial army and others who prefer it."
csa.335.a:0 "No, they are held in absolute common"
csa.335.b:0 "Break up management by Guild"

csa.336.t:0 "General-in-Chief Position Created"
csa.336.d:0 "The General-In-Chief position represents the elected leader of the nation and of the Guilds, and the only member of the nation higher ranking than the Lieutenant Generals of the Ten Great Departments and elected amongst them. To prevent corruption of course they can not elect one another, however, at least not unless they have been retired for at least five years. The issue is that our system is so new that we have no retired Lieutenant Generals or even many other higher ranking retirees so two suggestions have come forward, one being to simply shift the current President of the United States into this position since it is merging the positions into one anyways. The other would be to elect Nationalist war hero Smedley Butler, quite fitting since the Industrial Armies organization is heavily inspired by the militaries."
csa.336.a:0 "Keep the current President"
csa.336.b:0 "Elect Butler"

csa.337.t:0 "Appeasing the IWW"
csa.337.d:0 "While the IWW has been partially appeased by the fact that anarchist and syndicalist communes are allowed to operate outside the Guildist System, there is still some bad blood for those syndicalists who would rather the government pushed for worldwide revolution or punishment of capitalists and managers instead of their recruitment into the Industrial Army when willing and applicable. As such, we could simply offer for the IWW to make up the initial core of one of the new Industrial Guilds, recruiting the remaining bulk of their membership in the process, and even have the potential of bringing more communes in the mix. Of course, this would increase their influence as well."
csa.337.a:0 "No, treat them the same"
csa.337.b:0 "Yes, a practical compromise"

csa.338.t:0 "Collectivist Cells Attack!"
csa.338.d:0 "The Collectivist Cells are utterly disgusted by the government's gradual transformation of the nation into a National Guildist system, something they call faux-socialism and utterly reactionary. As such, with our control over Public Service Stores, Land and Production they are losing members and influence to us and have responded in kind with attacking our recruiters and local Service Stores with assassinations and bombings, a terror campaign that has only increased in recent days. They say that if we continue to try to expand over them, they will annihilate us. We could use the military to break them, or simply work around them and hope that by controlling all nearby resources they will have to bend the knee eventually. What shall we do?"
csa.338.a:0 "Destroy them"
csa.338.b:0 "Work Around them"

csa.339.t:0 "Collectivist Cells Destroyed!"
csa.339.d:0 "While the battles were bloody the Collectivist militias have been destroyed, with the leaders William Z. Foster, Eugene Dennis, and Jack Shulman going into exile in the process while being wanted. This has broken their influence and expanded our own although it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of our more pacifistic members. Meanwhile, the AFL seems ecstatic at the news and has warmed up to us as a result."
csa.339.a:0 "Had to happen"

csa.340.t:0 "Public Service Stores"
csa.340.d:0 "With our creation of distribution and production internally controlled by the government, Public Service Stores modeled on old army public service stores have been created to sell goods the government has purchased. While we hope they will eventually be organized into the massive public markets described by Bellamy, in the short term it increases our influence as only those who work for the National Guilds in some capacity are eligible, which will hopefully soon include the entire population. Although there is no requirement to join, the security and lack of alternatives we offer are simply too tempting to pass up, especially in the aftermath of the Civil War."
csa.340.a:0 "Very well"

csa.341.t:0 "The Nationalization of Land"
csa.341.d:0 "At long last, the vast majority of farmers have come under the control of the National Guilds and the Department of Agriculture can finally be created out of the various unions making it up. Farmers simply have few alternatives to our system if they wish to buy and produce goods, and already even syndicalist-leaning farm unions are agreeing to the system. However, some holdouts who wish to avoid our system of government, including hermits in the woods, exist, although it would be difficult for them to resist for long. We may even pressure them to join by specifically grabbing all territory around them as soon as possible."
csa.341.a:0 "Pressure the Remainders"

### Fosterism Events ###
csa.400.t:0 "Gathering the Land"
csa.400.d:0 "Currently we are gathering the land needed for collectivization from our fallen foes, the bourgeoisie, and reactionaries, as well as those believers who are registering their land for the greater good. However, there is still land needed from those who occupy an ambiguous position, either as nominal socialist supporters or those small and medium-sized farmers who were politically neutral. Two positions have been forwarded to gather their land: one is that put forward by many relative 'pragmatists' in the TUUL, especially surviving orthodox syndicalists, has been to raise the government's purchasing price in order to entice more sales. However for hardliners this is a repulsive position, as they believe the common farmer should not be exempt from the sacrifices others are required to make, that collectivization is a moral good and by avoiding collectivization they are placing their own needs above the people's, and therefore supporting forced collectivization over rewarding what they view as anti-social behavior."
csa.400.a:0 "Collectivize it now"
csa.400.b:0 "Raise the purchasing price"

csa.401.t:0 "Production Debate"
csa.401.d:0 "As we must produce a large number of agricultural goods to support the revolution, we are once again left with a debate on how to go about it. While some want experts such as mathematicians and economists to be placed in charge of managing production, loyal TUUL members insist they should be rewarded for their loyalty to these positions. Furthermore, they claim these technocrats are ideologically untrustworthy and that they can produce more than they can. While appointing them would leave Foster with more influence it's unclear if they're telling the truth."
csa.401.a:0 "Appoint technical experts"
csa.401.b:0 "Appoint TUUL hardliners"

csa.402.t:0 "Export Debate"
csa.402.d:0 "There is a debate within our government over exporting food from the states to nations that support socialism, especially within the Internationale. Foster's traditional supporters desire for the food to be sent to the Internationale at once to support international socialism against imperialism and believe their shortages can be alleviated by our aid. Of course many even within the TUUL are nervous about this and believe we should focus internally, stating that the food consumption required for rebuilding the states means we can not afford to do this. Of course, this sentiment has been accused of being reactionary and thinking in terms of nationalism instead of international struggle but even some of Foster's advisors would like for him to consider it."
csa.402.a:0 "Export it"
csa.402.b:0 "We can't afford it"

csa.403.t:0 "Anger over TUUL Expansion"
csa.403.d:0 "Us ending dual unionism has proven to be an unpopular policy despite our promises to let the IWW continue their normal processes under the TUUL umbrella, although they still register nonetheless. Even our own ultra-radical allies dislike the policy and some communes are refusing to be integrated. Perhaps in the short-term we should allow the communes to go about their business and just gradually pressure them to integrate later?"
csa.403.a:0 "We can be patient"
csa.403.b:0 "Make the communes register now"

csa.407.t:0 "Browderist-Fordist Line Destroyed!"
csa.407.d:0 "With our policy of removing reactionary influences repressing minority communities from within, the Browderist-Fordist line has been hunted down and executed. Named for Browder's ally in the black community James W. Ford, they were found guilty of social capitalist influences although James W. Ford remains alive and out of reach. This has managed to silence many remaining Browderists."
csa.407.a:0 "Good"

csa.408.t:0 "Under the Table Deals"
csa.408.d:0 "With our advent of the total planned economy, party officials in different regions have reported an increasing tendency of workers to deal 'Under the table'. Examples include workers purchasing excess lumber from farmhouses using either existing goods or our monetary currency. Given that this robs the central planners of potential resources and reinforces the very extortionist capitalist pricing system that allows extraction of profit from surplus labor and extortion this is unacceptable and party officials are wondering how to respond, with potential policies ranging from death for engagement in 'minor capitalism' to political rehabilitation via pressure and confessions, alongside some fees."

csa.408.c:0 "Rehab and warnings for the smallest infractures"

csa.409.t:0 "Teachers Attacked!"
csa.409.d:0 "Our youth wing is engaging in attacks on professors and teachers that are remembered to have engaged in 'patriotic' and conservative rhetoric. Further, professors who insist on teaching Darwinian evolution are being attacked by some youth wings for teaching a 'reactionary' ideology that opposes collective cooperation and has reinforced racism. As such some in the cabinet such as Eugene Dennis are requesting we try to calm them down from such excesses, although others think that such extremes in the short-term could result in a quicker path to a truly revolutionary culture."
csa.409.a:0 "Reign them in"
csa.409.b:0 "Let it go"

csa.410.t:0 "IWW Liquidations"
csa.410.d:0 "As the IWW Centrist Faction is increasingly liquidated we have to settle the issue of the anarchists and Orthodox syndicalists, some of whom have also been liquidated for counter-revolutionary tendencies. Some believe we should simply finish off the remaining members of Congress who have not fully jumped ship to the TUUL while others view the more radical anarchists and syndicalists as still supportive."

csa.410.b:0 "A Full Purge"

csa.411.t:0 "A Socialist Culture"
csa.411.d:0 "At long last, the old consumerist, nationalist and reactionary symbols of the United States have been destroyed and teachers are having a new curriculum approved that teachers the old United States was built on slavery, bloodshed, and colonialism. At long last, we will look to the future, not the past, for solidarity as the New Socialist Education Act is passed."
csa.411.a:0 "Excellent"

csa.412.t:0 "Worker Uniformity"
csa.412.d:0 "With the TUUL dominant all workers are now required to join the TUUL so that they can be represented fairly and so they more easily contribute to the common good. This will massively aid our census data and make coordination much simpler. However, an argument has flown up about whether they should be registered to the central TUUL only or to their sub-regional TUUL, giving local union bosses more power. While so far the TUUL has been relatively decentralized in its political organization there is an argument to be made that this is an opportunity to take some control out of their hands."
csa.412.a:0 "Regional TUUL"
csa.412.b:0 "Central TUUL"

csa.413.t:0 "Prisoner Complaints"
csa.413.d:0 "As we use reactionary and deviant prisoners to do much of the heavy lifting in rebuilding from the Civil War we are receiving reports of complaints as they are 'overworked', resulting in occasional deaths. This is normally not an issue considering they were going to be executed anyways but some of the local party heads think it is damaging our public image and we might want to relax their work hours a bit."
csa.413.a:0 "No"
csa.413.b:0 "Very well"

csa.414.t:0 "AFL Purged"
csa.414.d:0 "At long last the so-called Social Patriots, originating in either the AFL or the Independence League, are being purged as the treacherous and social capitalist Klan sympathizers in their faction are being arrested. John Dewey, Jack Reed, and William Green are amongst the most recent names put to a public trial in which spectators watched as they were denounced for collaboration with capitalist powers. Remaining members are either in exile or attempting to join the TUUL to show their loyalty to the new order, attempting to join our National Textile Workers Union and Metal Workers Industrial Union in particular."
csa.414.a:0 "Let them join"

csa.415.t:0 "Purge Reports"
csa.415.d:0 "While reactionaries are being purged across the nation, the Klan bases of South Carolina and Indiana are being hit particularly hard, with anyone affiliated with the organization being either executed or arrested. Our Southern organizational leaders however believe we should slow down on attacking family members of the Klan members who can't be outright proven to be members or supporters, thinking the purge would be so large it would damage the economy, although hardliners want to keep it up. A middle-ground option would be to take their children away from them to avoid potential reactionary indoctrination while keeping those we aren't certain of alive for now."
csa.415.a:0 "Keep up the pressure"
csa.415.b:0 "Slow it down"
csa.415.c:0 "The Middle ground option"

csa.416.t:0 "SPA Dissolved"
csa.416.d:0 "While his election meant that Foster was essentially the figurehead of the SPA and the CSA, he has always been an outsider to the organization as he is reliant on the TUUL for support and criticizes party politics factionalism. As such, the SPA has been formally dissolved and replaced with wings of the TUUL where applicable, with those not replaced being for all purposes politically purged."
csa.416.a:0 "Excellent"

csa.417.t:0 "Class Traitors Arrested"
csa.417.d:0 "There are members of the middle-class who were not bourgeoise but decided to work for them against the worker, then later attempted to side with the social patriots. As such, the TUUL Red Militias have undertaken a class traitor initiative, targeting largely members of the middle-class and some socially conservative workers who supported the social patriots. However as well still need them for potential labor perhaps we should sentence the lesser offenders to imprisonment as opposed to execution."
csa.417.a:0 "No, liquidate them"
csa.417.b:0 "Commute their sentences"

csa.418.t:0 "Removing Distinctions"
csa.418.d:0 "As a consistent follower of the Marxian communist ethos, Foster has denounced differences between rural and urban regions. He has considered them backward distinctions used by members of the middle and upper class to isolate themselves from rural people or cramp workers in small areas in cities, separating their shared class consciences in the process. As such he wants to go forward with his plan to destroy the distinction between the two, relocating workers to more spacious regions and building into rural areas to avoid urban sprawl.  His cabinet is reluctant to endorse the position, however, claiming it would be costly."
csa.418.a:0 "It is the way forward"
csa.418.b:0 "We will show restraint"

csa.419.t:0 "Foster's Call to Foreign Workers"
csa.419.d:0 "William Z. Foster has called on foreign workers to rise up against their masters if possible and, if not, to cease reproducing and passively destroy industrial equipment to bleed the capitalists of their economic power. The speech was heard by very few in foreign nations of course due to censorship, outside of militant left cells, although while it invigorated hardliners at home it was also found to be 'bizarre' by others, albeit rarely said aloud."
csa.419.a:0 "Alright"

csa.420.t:0 "A Fit Nation"
csa.420.d:0 "With pointless and unhealthy capitalist consumerism and junk being removed en masse, our local union heads are increasingly pushing for fitness in order to have a maximally fit nation that can battle capitalist armies and have a healthy workforce. An issue has arisen over our Tobacco Workers Industrial Union, however, as this is at odds with their interests and the more martial of our supporters such as Shulman would have us outlaw tobacco for non-medicinal reasons and retrain or move these workers into new industries."
csa.420.a:0 "Retrain them"
csa.420.b:0 "Tobacco will be tolerated"

### Browder Events ###

csa.430.t:0 "Radio Chats"
csa.430.d:0 "With the cultivation of socialist media, we are enjoying an increased radio presence in the homes of average Americans. With this, it has been suggested that Browder should give more personalized speeches to the people via radio in what Party members are jokingly referring to as 'The Browder Hour'. This would have to be used sparingly so that it is not taken for granted but if used properly would be effective in gaining support."
csa.430.a:0 "Very well"
csa.430.b:0 "No, scarce appearances are better"

csa.431.t:0 "Dealing with Burnham"
csa.431.d:0 "Leader of the AWP James Burnham has had a mixed-relationship with Browder, flipping between working with him while praising his Americanist Socialism and criticizing him for being unrealistic, vague, and inconsistent. However, even the American Workers Party has taken note of the SPA Centralists' victory and many are defecting, though some increasingly nervous AWP members remain under Burnham. Shall we recruit the Burnhamites and pressure them into joining in return for political clout or simply purge their leadership and force the remainders into joining?"
csa.431.a:0 "Recruit Burnham"
csa.431.b:0 "Purge them"

csa.432.t:0 "Standard Oil Managers?"
csa.432.d:0 "With the West under our control we have captured many of the oligarchs who formally ran the territory. While many of the top members of the PSA leadership are being purged, some of the managers for Standard Oil could be potentially useful in helping us manage the now nationalized western oil reserves. Of course, their loyalty is questionable. What shall we do?"
csa.432.a:0 "Use them"
csa.432.b:0 "Purge them"

csa.433.t:0 "Jack Shulman Dead!"
csa.433.d:0 "Foster's top man in the military, Jack Shulman, has been found guilty of conspiring against the state and alongside his inner circle has been sentenced to death. Decrying Browderism as 'ahistorical reaction' Shulman cursed the court that judged him before he and his cohorts were shot today."
csa.433.a:0 "Great!"

csa.434.t:0 "Fate of the IWW"
csa.434.d:0 "The IWW has been gutted of its most ardent anti-Browderist activists, with Elizabeth Nord and Dorothy Day being forced to retire and many IWW anarchists being arrested, including Emma Goldman's circle. Now of course a new leader must be decided with the shell IWW officially being under the SPA umbrella and many workers have already defected from the organization into the SPA, with Robert Minor being a potentially workable syndicalist who is friendly to Browderism or Gus Hall if we wish to use a more hardline but inexperienced loyalist."
csa.434.a:0 "Gus Hall"
csa.434.b:0 "Robert Minor"

csa.435.t:0 "Wage Setting"
csa.435.d:0 "While we allow workers to engage in some monetary trade and wage-setting with one another, at least in the small and some medium-scale workers industries, the amount of autonomy they should have is still heavily debated by the SPA cabinet. Some believe we should only allow them to set a very limited amount of room to set wage differences while others believe in allowing relatively more wage autonomy so long as they do not attempt to own private property, accumulate too much wealth, or question larger industries. What should be the default?"
csa.435.a:0 "Greater Autonomy"
csa.435.b:0 "Limited Autonomy"

csa.436.t:0 "Competing Funding"
csa.436.d:0 "With all of Popular Front and its various interest groups now needing to answer the SPA Centralists and, more particularly, Browder, it appears there is some competition for funding between the various Farmer's Union now organized under the Socialist Party Farmer's Union and the Industrial Industries. While some SPA operatives view the former as more fundamental to an independent economy and that we have and are going to spend enough time on industry we should divert more funds to Farmers, while many others in the Browder circle argue industry is too fundamental to divert funds from even now."
csa.436.a:0 "Pay off the Farmers Unions"
csa.436.b:0 "Focus on Industry"

csa.437.t:0 "President Empowered"
csa.437.d:0 "With the victory of the SPA Centralists, they have accumulated enough support from Centrist, Orthodox, and national syndicalists to pass Executive Empowerment, which coincided with Fosterists being increasingly displaced from positions of power and increased street brawls between pro-government factions and the anarchists and Collectivists. With the Executive Empowerment Act, Browder now has the position of both Chairman of the SPA and the President, with both positions being embodied by a single individual and greater power being given over economic affairs and the right of the President to order arrests. Supports are hopeful this will create stability while opponents are angered at this 'authoritarianism'."
csa.437.a:0 "A Step Forward"

csa.438.t:0 "Anarchists Angered!"
csa.438.d:0 "The Anarchist factions of Congress, particularly the Goldmanites and various societies, have become increasingly angered by Browder's behavior and policies and are now refusing to pay manpower and other forms of aid from the communes while continuously blocking our acts. With the anarchists organizing protest marches against our policies, shall we try to sabotage them with the aid of the Socialist Party Centralist intelligence leader John Abt?"
csa.438.a:0 "Not yet"
csa.438.b:0 "Yes, counter-intelligence"
csa.438.c:0 "Break up protests"

csa.439.t:0 "Chicago Brawl!"
csa.439.d:0 "Anarchists marching on Chicago got into a brawl with the Red Guards and Army under our control today. While a bloody disaster in the short-term it has given us an excuse to arrest an array of our critics who can be blamed for inciting the riot, although our critics in Congress are now causing an even larger headache than before."
csa.439.a:0 "Good and Bad"

csa.440.t:0 "Surveillance Created"
csa.440.d:0 "With our enemies being purged many are still suspicious of Congress's remaining members despite them now being wholly under the thumb of the Centralists. Gil Green has been assigned to plant bugs in the phones of Congressmen and to have them monitored by the newly formalized Socialist Party Security Section made up of John Abt's intelligence wing of the faction, relaying all information directly to Browder. As such we have the means to arrest any members who are attempting a coup."
csa.440.a:0 "Excellent"

csa.441.t:0 "Accusations of Social Capitalism"
csa.441.d:0 "Our recent policies have been met with the accusation of 'Social Capitalism' by the Collectivists, anarchists and even some syndicalists who are attempting to block our bills, with Eugene Dennis, in particular, calling us 'traitors of the highest sort'. As such we are losing some public support even as we gain members of the middle-class to our cause."
csa.441.a:0 "Damn"

csa.442.t:0 "Farmer's Union"
csa.442.d:0 "With our recent foray into agriculture, we have increased control over the various farmers' unions, with unregistered farmers needing to sign up for the Social Party Farmer's Union. As the Union is now the largest in agriculture we are moving for all agricultural unions to be subsumed into the group, either directly or as a subgroup. Competition is fierce for leadership of the group with the competition being between our loyalist William Schneiderman and Bernard Ades who is more acceptable to orthodox syndicalists."
csa.442.a:0 "Schneiderman"
csa.442.b:0 "Ades"

csa.443.t:0 "The National Parks?"
csa.443.d:0 "The National Parks of the United States were essentially nature reserves but now we must decide what to do with them, with the centrally-controlled economy having proponents who think that the forests can be put to use in industrializing the country. However, this would lose us some moderate support."

csa.444.d:0 "While we have accepted compromises on the economy this has left us with a small problem of too much economic activity to keep track of on a small scale. As such a small black market has opened to gain goods that are not taxed or restricted by the central government, egged on by former gangsters in our territory such as the Five Families.

Wicks and his faction of Oregon Socialists so that we no longer need to make payouts to them while also creating an example that will allow us to not be openly questioned if we lower funds for another faction."

As such the AFL and Independent League members are being pressured to resign or join the SPA, and virtually all workers are members. To finish the job there is a proposal by Browder's right-hand man Gus Hall to make all Americans official members of the SPA and (now officially) subject to its regulations."

Though Browder and other like-minded Leftist groups like the Lovestoneists and the Burnhamites pride themselves on being American and wish to keep the identity of the old United States alive and well, metamorphosed into a new Socialist form, many radical elements along the American Left, such as the Fosterites, despise these Americanist notions, and instead push for a new revolutionary identity and culture entirely removed from the old order. So, should Browder embrace the original identity of the failed United States of America and work to reform it while dyeing it a revolutionary red, or should we cave to more radical elements and finally move past these failed concepts and ruined identity once and for all in order to create a new revolutionary Communist culture based on Browder’s new ideas of carmine Americanism?"

Battling Canadian forces, Federal sailors, and the infamous Captain Muskrat of the Klanist Black Legion atop the stormy waters of the world’s largest lakes, Captain Seavey and his men battled their foes in the largest freshwater naval battle seen since the First American Civil War using nothing but repurposed fishing trawlers, tugboats, and whatever other crap the Syndicate government could spare that would still float and hold a gun. Despite all odds, Seavey’s ragtag group not only broke through the blockade, but also decimated the enemy fleets in a true showing of naval genius, allowing him to land in Thunder Bay and pillage a massive amount of supplies from the Canadians. With this victory, the Great Lakes has undoubtedly become Socialist territory, at least for now, and Seavey has been commended as a national hero. With victories like these, this war will surely be over in no time."

A fellow author, Hammett is famous for being perhaps the greatest crime fiction author in American history, creating Sam Spade of ‘The Maltese Falcon’, ‘The Thin Man’ with Nick and Nora Charles, the Continental Op as seen in ‘Red Harvest’ and ‘The Dain Curse’, and the comic strip featuring Secret Agent X-9, but is also a widely-known Socialist activist and violent anti-reactionary that served in the Second American Civil War in order to personally fight the racist ODP down in Dixie. Since returning home from the front once the guns finally stopped their thunderous screaming, Hammett reignited his literary career while also taking a swing at politics, working with fellow Socialists in New York and his native Maryland before coming to our door. Now a committed Utopian Technocrat and a known friend to Hemingway, the President has moved to give Hammett a position within the government. Though most expect him to just get a position on the Technocratic Council and within Hemingway’s inner-circle cabinet, the Lead Director Hemingway has spoken with Hammett in private, and has revealed that his own lifelong battle with mental illness has only gotten worse due to the pressures of ruling an entire nation. As such, Hemingway has privately suggested to Hammett that he take the reigns of power and continue the Utopian Technocrat dream with the Technocratic Council by his side so that Hemingway himself can retire and focus on his health and wellbeing, for many are worried that he may eat a shotgun shell if his stress gets any worse.

The two most dominant groups are the more traditional technocrats favored by Scott and Hubbard, including figures like Walter Rautenstrauch, Seymour Melman, Edward Condon, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and many more intellectual titans, and the Futurian group favored by Loeb and Hemingway, dominated by figures like David Lasser, Isaac Azimov, Donald Wollheim, John Wood Campbell Jr., Hugo Gernsback, John Michel, Robert Lowndes, G.G. Clark, Will Sykora, Frederik Pohl, Dashiell Hammett, and many more; with the two groups dominating the Technocracy Council, but perhaps not for long. With varied Technocratic figures rising to prominence like the famous conservationist and Green Technocrat Benton MacKaye, awarded chemist and theoretical cosmologist Richard C. Tolman who worked with the famed Albert Einstein, ecologist and Social Gospel-preaching Christian Technocrat Leland Olds, former secretary to the late Franklin Roosevelt and later Fiorello La Guardia turned Communist, Feminist activist, and Technocratic economist Alice Barrows, famed architect of the New York City skyline Frederick Ackerman, the Georgist Technocrat Stuart Chase that seeks to fuse the ideas of Henry George with modern Technocratic ideology, the leader of the Canadian Chapter of Technocracy, Inc. Joshua N. Haldeman - a chiropractor turned political economist, adventurer, sportsman, and devoted Technocrat with links to certain South African emerald and diamond mining operations, and so many more, our growing Technocratic council is even more varied in ideological outlook than the old Congress was. \n\nIn an attempt to consolidate this factionalist behavior in our favor, we must decide on one of the two factions that have risen to the top. \n\nFirst is the Green Technocrat faction headed by Benton MacKaye and Leland Olds, who have come together to preach the Social Gospel and Agrarian Technocratic economics all with a deep focus on environmentalism, park-building, and conservation. Rivaling them is the Radical Technocrat faction of Stuart Chase and Alice Barrows who are deeply connected to Georgist Syndicalism and the Communist factions of Foster and Browder, who seek to introduce some more direct Syndicalist and Communist reforms into our Technocratic system.

From eco-socialist communes to typical industrial unions, people from all walks of life professing all kinds of new ideas have aided us on our journey, but one group that has gained prominence recently more than any are the Futurians. Starting out as just a band of Science-Fiction super fans and geeks, the organization has transformed into a true artistic union committed to the ideas of Futurist Socialism and Utopian Technocracy. Led by committed and experienced American social activist David Lasser, the group is expansive, with members including Isaac Asimov, Hugo Gernsback, Donald Wollheim, Chester Cohen, Rosalind Cohen, Joshua Norman Haldeman, Theodore Sturgeon, Anthony Boucher, Sam Moskowitz, Hannes Bok, James Blish, Damon Knight, Virginia Kidd, Cyril Kornbluth, Harry ‘Dirk Wylie’ Dockweiler, Walter Kubilius, David Kyle, Howard Philips Lovecraft, John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, Francis E. Dec, Robert Lowndes, Judith Merril, John Michel, Frederik Pohl, Leslie Perri, Larry Shaw, Richard Wilson, and many more, all committed to our cause of triggering a true metamorphosis of American society. With a notable slant towards Socialist Internationalism, Utopian Technocracy, and old Republican-style Progressivism, the group’s Socialist merits are well known, and their dedication to revolutionary causes is assured. With this in mind, many ministers within our government push for the expanded and empowered Futurians to take an official place in our government. How much control they should be given however is up for debate."
csa.6006.a:0 "Fund their group and introduce them into our government."
csa.6006.b:0 "Allow Lasser and the Futurians to take control of our scientific destiny."

csa.6007.t:0 "America’s Place as the Last Bastion of Trotskyism"
csa.6007.d:0 "Left Internationalism, more commonly called Trotskyism in most circles before its namesake’s failure, disgrace, and eventual death at sea while exiled, has long been the black sheep of the American Left, but somehow despite all odds and very fate acting against them, the American Trotskyists within the Communist League of America headed by James P. Cannon now control the fate of America and the wider dream of World Revolution. Already bringing about their own Trotskist reformation within the prevailing American system, James P. Cannon and his fellow Trot associates like Vincent R. Dunne, Martin Abern, Max Schactman, Albert Goldman, Farrell Dobbs, Jean van Heijenoort, Harold Isaacs, Irving Horenstein, George Breitman, Felix Morrow, Tom Maidhc O'Flaherty, Hugo Oehler, Walter Ufer, Alexander Buchman, and more now must decide upon America’s role in their Internationalist dream. Should we abandon our current foreign policy to pursue the total revolution across the New World or even the wider globe to fulfill the final dream of Trotsky, or should we stick to our own borders and work on building Trotskyism from within - an idea at odds with our very ideology?"
csa.6007.a:0 "Internationalism shall be pursued through diplomacy alone."
csa.6007.b:0 "Pursue the World Revolution in steps, starting with just the New World."
csa.6007.c:0 "America shall be the champions of the World Revolution!"

csa.6008.t:0 "On the Matter of Black Belt Autonomy"
csa.6008.d:0 "While much of the Socialist movement both in America and the wider world has been sorely lacking when it comes to official positions against racial supremacist reactionarism or ethnic autonomism, members of the former CPUSA were different. Our chairman William Z. Foster, and even the traitorous Earl Browder, have long been vocal advocates when it comes to granting the so-called Black Belt an official autonomous status. Not only that, but they have long fought against racial prejudice on the Left and even run in the presidential elections organized by now dead United States while drafting James W. Ford, the famous Black Communist activist and member of CPUSA, as their vice-presidential pick. While the course of action is clear to chairman himself, that is establishing Black Belt as a separate part of our Union according to the principles of self-determination, an idea supported by Harry Haywood, Foster's ardent organizer among the Black. However, some members of our government retort that while the idea is noble, leaving a part of our Union free from direct supervision of our government structures may allow reactionary subversives to infiltrate the area, and thus propose to only grant autonomy to the Black Belt States as part of one Union."
csa.6008.a:0 "Grant them autonomy within our Union!"
csa.6008.b:0 "Our Black comrades fought bravely for their own state, release an autonomous Black Belt!"

csa.6009.t:0 "The Blacklist Program"
csa.6009.d:0 "In order to address the rising need for a stronger espionage system to combat subversive foes both foreign and domestic, the Internal Affairs Committee has gone ahead with its plan to expand our intelligence efforts, funding a program that would pull and train new spies from a pool of known public figures. These famous faces would be the last people anyone would suspect as being spies for the state, and will of course only be pulled from known loyal Socialists. Figures such as Charlie Chaplin, Katherine Martha Houghton Hepburn and her daughter, Lucille Ball, Langston Hughes, Orson Welles, Leonard Bernstein, Lena Horne, Dalton Trumbo, Dorothy Parker, Pete Seeger, Lee Grant, Dashiel Hammett, Alvah Bessie, Herbert Biberman, Lester Cole, Edward Dmytryk, Ring Larder Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Samuel Ornitz, Adrian Scott, Irving Lerner, Bernard Gordon, Joan LaCour Scott, Bernard Goldon, Martin Gabel, Artie Shaw, Sun Ra, Pert Kelton, Louis Armstrong, Harold Rome, and so many more. To aid in their training, some of the floors at the famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City have been rented out by the government in order to provide a secure location to create the next generation of super spies."
csa.6009.a:0 "A license to kill, to protect and serve."

csa.6010.t:0 "Our Position Towards the Galleanisti"
csa.6010.d:0 "All across America there exists various independent or autonomous Anarchist movements of all different breeds and ideological backgrounds, but perhaps the most famous of these groups outside our own Anarcho-Syndicalist clique within the IWW are the Galleanisti. Named after the famed Insurrectionary Anarchist Luigi Galleani who bounced between exile from Italy and hiding out among Italian workers movements across the Northeast in places like New Jersey, Vermont, and Massachusetts, the Galleanisti follow their founder’s advocacy for the ‘Propaganda of the Deed’, or the use of attention-grabbing political action such as assassinations, violent hit jobs, or bomb attacks as a revolutionary catalyst in order to inspire the wider masses to rapidly rise up against the State, progressing the Anarchist dream. \n\nAlready notorious for orchestrating infamous acts of revolutionary violence - such as the 1919 letter bomb spree which killed two (including one of the bombers himself, a common theme in Galleanisti attacks given their shoddy bomb-making skills from complete lack of experience or expertise) and injured two, the 1920 Wall Street bombing that killed 40 men and a horse while also severely wounding 143 and minorly injuring several hundreds more, the San Francisco Preparedness Day Bombing which killed 10 and injured 40, or their 1914 spree which saw them bomb St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the Bronx County Courthouse, The Tombs, a priest’s home at St. Alphonsus Church, and the Ludlow Coal Mine owned by the Rockefellers, injuring dozens - all aimed at anti-anarchist officials, anti-immigration politicians, prominent businessmen and warmongers, and other similar scions of Capitalist decay, the Galleanisti were some of the most active agents that added to the chaos that preceded the Second American Civil War, for better or for worse, and continue to be effective if brutal agents of Anarchist change to this day. With Galleani himself passing away in 1931 at the age 70 however, the movement has since grown more violent and radical as leadership struggles abound between new leading figures within their inner-clique that guides them called the Bresci Circle - named for the famed anarchist assassin Gaetano Bresci who assassinated Umberto I of Italy in 1900 - like Mario Buda, Gabriella Segata Antolini, Raffaele ‘Bruno’ Schiavina, and many more, but none of their members are more widely known and beloved as Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. \n\nWith their dedication to Anarchism unquestionable, but their violent and savage nature painfully clear to all, our section must now decide if we should allow the Galleanisti to join our Anarcho-Syndicalist platform if they agree to de-radicalize a bit, handover their guilty members to the authorities, and stop the attacks, or should we just simply wipe out these rabid dogs lest they try to bite the hand that has fed them their Anarchist utopia on a silver platter?"
csa.6010.a:0 "Though we respect Sacco and Vanzetti, we must turn these radicals away."
csa.6010.b:0 "Work with these firebrands and try to moderate them."

csa.6011.t:0 "The Revolt of the Homosexual"
csa.6011.d:0 "Although the Revolution in America has championed many new social reforms that push the boundaries of what was once considered appropriate, one particular issue has remained in the dark - homosexuality. Despite the victory of Leftist politics, America’s conservative and Puritan background still dictates much of what is considered taboo or not, but with the Revolution finally secured, some movements and political figures of note have begun to push against this notion in favor of a focus on gay rights. The main force pushing for the inclusivity of homosexuality has been the French-inspired ‘Mattachine Society’, which formed from the consolidation of numerous similar smaller groups such as Chicago’s Society for Human Rights, under the guidance of Communist activist Harry Hay with the help of his gay friends who lived out in major cities like Los Angeles and New York, such as James Gruber, Rudi Gernreich, Bob Hull, Chuck Rowland, Konrad Stevens, and Dale Jennings. Supported by the likes of openly gay politicians, or those otherwise who support the free love movement, within the government like Emma Goldman, William Aughe Gheer, Bayard Rustin, and even Henry A. Wallace, whom they have supported politically for years, the Mattachines see themselves as harlequins and justicars of sexual rights and freedom. Supported by an environmentalist and individualist anarchist subwing called the ‘Radical Faeries’ that dabble in eclectic rituals and occultism while aping certain Native American motifs and pushing the boundaries of gender identity and sexual orientation defintions, founded by Hay as well with the help of John Lyon Burnside III that is supported by the likes of wider Mattachines and their new Lermondite allies from New England, the Mattachines push for full gay, lesbian, bisexual, and intersex inclusion in the Revolution, leading to this fiery debate. What shall be our administration’s stance towards these groups and others like them in the coming years?"
csa.6011.a:0 "Give these fairies our full support."
csa.6011.b:0 "Allow them to function, but do not publicly endorse their goals."
csa.6011.c:0 "Publicly denounce them, and quietly suppress them."

csa.6012.t:0 "The Young Brain of Technocracy"
csa.6012.d:0 "Following the conclusion of the civil war, Technocracy Inc. has accrued a number of young and eccentric, but brilliant, new members. Nobody in the new generation of young Technocrats embodies this trend quite as well as one Jacque Fresco. Born in 1916 to a New Yorker Sephardic Jewish family, Fresco's life has been nothing if not tumultuous, starting with his flirtations with the Young Communist League, to his split with them and his journey west along with other vagabonds, to his mingling with the Commonwealth Party and the Spiritualists in California during the war. Unfortunately for him, his various aeronautic ideas, including one of the first fixed-wing aircraft proposals and a far more fantastical saucer-like craft, were not widely received by the PSA's military and industrial leadership, with the notable exceptions of Robert Heinlein and Walt Disney, who would advocate for Fresco's designs within their own circles. \n\nIn Technocracy Inc., with Scott and Hubbert's drive for technical and visionary technical ideas, Fresco has not only found a new political home, but also access to all the resources and personal support to see his ideas made manifest, even if he, eccentric as ever, has already begun to chafe against the rank and file of Technocracy Inc. Regardless, aside from his aircraft proposals, Fresco and his collaborator Earl "Madman" Muntz, have ventured into the realm of architectural and social engineering, putting forward designs for an affordable and modular mass producible home for the future, the "Trend Home". Fresco has presented these plans to the Technocratic Council, along with others, his new and wilder ideas for city design hinting at Fresco's ambitions of mass social engineering and movement within the organization. For now, Scott and the Council will have to choose where to focus the young man's energy, or decide that the young upstart may not be worth the trouble."
csa.6012.a:0 "Trend Home! The home of the Technate!"
csa.6012.b:0 "Fixed-wing aircraft! The future of flight!"
csa.6012.c:0 "Try and keep him mired in local politics and planning for now."
csa.6012.e:0 "This guy might be more trouble than he's worth..."

csa.6013.t:0 "The Best Damn Garage in Town"
csa.6013.d:0 "While taking his Oldsmobile 66 for a joyride down to Florida, Al Capone got to Daytona Beach, a place that had become renowned in recent years to car and speed enthusiasts as one of the best places to race a car in Florida. Trying his luck, Capone decided to enter the day’s race, organized by William France, a man who’d fled the Federal government at the start of the war and settled in Florida to make a living out of racing. Unfortunately for him, his car broke down in a plume of smoke on the second lap of the race, and he was forced to retire. He limped his car out of the circuit, which finally broke down and stopped in the middle of the street. Luckily for him, a young man in his late teens or early twenties covered in grease came up to him, and offered to roll him into his garage. Capone, seeing no better option, reluctantly accepted. The young man quickly got to work, taking down the engine with ease and inspecting it with a brief glance before telling the mobster the issue was a blown head gasket, and that it’d take roughly three hours to fix. Not wanting to stay longer than he had to, he told the kid he’d give him a fat stack of cash if he could do it in two. The mechanic chuckled before getting to work, quickly disassembling the engine and replacing the head gasket before putting it all back together in barely under an hour, the two of them chatting about their experiences in the war and how the young man had fixed hundreds of tanks and planes as an army mechanic. Once he was done, Capone was in awe and patted him one the back before handing him a thousand dollars in cash and quickly rode off in his car, noticing the engine was running better than ever. Before it disappeared into the distance, he checked his mirror to check the mechanic shop’s name: “Smokey Yunick’s Best Damn Garage in Town”"
csa.6013.a:0 "Well, perhaps there’s something to the name..."

csa_sucsessor.1.t:0 "The Rigors of Executive Power"
csa_sucsessor.1.d:0 "It would seem that the stress and rigorous wear and tear that comes with being President has begun to take its toll on [root.getleader], with many in the Party urging our beloved leader to take a short private vacation from this weary nightmare, and the President’s doctors urge us that a brief leave of absence may be medically necessary. Should we allow the President to take this much-needed rest?"
csa_sucsessor.1.a:0 "Have the President take some needed time off."
csa_sucsessor.1.b:0 "Nonsense! The office waits for no man!"

csa_sucsessor.2.t:0 "The Death of Burnham"
csa_sucsessor.2.d:0 "Saddening news rings out across the nation as word spreads of President James Burnham’s death. Found slumped over on the floor of his study, piss running down his leg and hand on his chest, it is assumed Burnham had a heart attack while smoking a cigar and drinking brandy as he was listening to a newly pressed recording of the Glenn Miller Orchestra. How the two guards stationed outside his room did not hear the commotion of his death, it is not known, though many suspect they simply feared to disturb the President on penalty of punishment. The suddenness of his passing has aroused some suspicion among Party officials, with some whispering that he may have been poisoned by a would-be successor, but any talk of this is quickly hushed as lies under penalty of arrest or death. \n\nWith the passing of Burnham, a new titan must rise to take his place, someone trusted by the former President and intune with his vision for America. The main candidates, and the pair some suspect may have been behind Burham’s possibly early passing, are Jay Lovestone, a committed Communist who seeks to sideline Technocratic power in order to build his own Market Socialist Communist State based around his position and the concept of Socialism in One Nation, the ‘secretly’ mixed race Right Technocrat and anti-semitic Corporatist firebrand Lawrence Dennis - famous for his friends across the American Far-Right in circles and noted for being the only technocratic minister within our government that Burnham truly trusted or even liked, and his former friend turned rival James P. Cannon, devoted International Communist and former ally of the disgraced Trotsky. The main opposition to this titan of American Leftism are the rehabilitated Ronald Reagan and Bunrham’s own student Lyndon LaRouche - two young proteges of the late Burnham, representing two halves of the late President’s political identity. LaRouche, a young firebrand that believes in an odd fusion of Leftist Technocracy and National Socialism mixed with some Far-Right views and prejudices, represents the core loyalists of Burnham, and promises to honor Burnham’s vision for the nation. Reagan, the moderate young politician, navy man, and actor, is a rehabilitated former Federalist that has since fallen in line with our national doctrine and who fell under the wing of Burnham. He represents the de-radicalizing, Conservative, and socioeconomically Progressive ideas Burnham began to drift towards in his later years, standing as the herald of new Burnham thought with his fellow 'young guard' including the likes of Irving Kristol and Willmoore Kendall. Only one can rise to lead however, so who shall succeed the great President Burnham?"
csa_sucsessor.2.a:0 "Lovestone shall lead the nation towards more traditional Socialism."
csa_sucsessor.2.b:0 "Cannon will lead the Revolution beyond under the doctrine of Internationalism."
csa_sucsessor.2.c:0 "The young LaRouche will adhere firmly to Burnhamist principles."
csa_sucsessor.2.e:0 "Reagan, the young moderate, will guide America towards a progressive center."
csa_sucsessor.2.f:0 "Dennis, the only technocrat Burnham truly trusted, rises to the occasion."

csa_sucsessor.3.d:0 "Saddening news rings out across the nation as word spreads of President Earl Browder’s death.

The main candidates are James W. Ford, who stood as Browder’s Vice-President on a platform of civil rights and Black autonomy while working with his own web of African American allies in places like the Black Belt and New York City, along with Gus Hall and Gil Green, Browder’s committed pair of political protégés who seek to carry on the vision of our late founding father. Hall is the more charismatic face, blindly trusted by the American people due to his close association with Browder but less so by his fellow party members due to allegations of nepotism on account of his rapid rise through the ranks of the Party thanks to a dangerously close friendship with the late Browder, while Green is less famous with the public but far more respected within the Party due to his experience leading the Youth Community League and leading key strikes before the Civil War. However, some others support less polarizing Browderist figures like John J. Ballam or Max Bedacht among our big tent of American coalitionist Leftists, but none were as trusted by Browder as Hall, Green, and Ford. With little opposition to this ruling, it would seem that Gus Hall shall be voted in by the Party as the new President shortly unless some other candidate can somehow swindle enough support."

The main candidates are James P. Cannon, who leads the last American Trotskyists under a syncretic banner fusing the Syndo-Communism of Fosterism with the Internationalism and Militarism of Trotskyism, James W. Ford, Foster’s former running mate and prominent Black Socialist that fights for African American autonomy in the Black Belt, and Israel Amter, who stands largely as the orthodox Forsterite, aided by other prominent Fosterites such as William Weinstone, Jay Fox, John J. Ballam, and Jack Shulman, who are all also in the running themselves.

#CSA's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

CSA_SMEDLEY_BUTLER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 30, 1881, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W In 1898 'The Fighting Quaker' Smedley Darlington Butler lied about his age and enlisted in the Marine Corps to join the American force in the Spanish-American war. Due to his high education level, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and would be transferred to the recently captured Guantanamo following basic training. He didn't manage to see combat as his company would soon return to the US, where he was reassigned to the USS New York, becoming a first lieutenant in April 1899.\n\nHe was later transferred to the Philippines, where he mainly did garrison duty, although he took part in some engagements against the Insurrectos. In 1900, he'd accompany Littleton Walker during the Boxer Rebellion, taking part in the Battle of Tianjin and the Gaselee Expedition, being wounded in the thigh while trying to rescue a fellow marine, for which he earned a brevet promotion to captain.\n\nAfterwards, Butler would take part in the Banana Wars, first in Honduras to defend the American consulate in 1903 and then in Nicaragua between 1909 and 1913, where he took part in breaking the siege of Granada, in the battle of Masaya, and the capture of Coyote Hill. He took part in the occupation of Veracruz in Mexico in 1914, earning his first Medal of Honor in combat and was promoted to Major. He'd be transferred to Haiti, where he earned his second Medal of Honor for fighting the Caco rebellion. He'd be transferred back to the United States, where he served garrison duties until being promoted to Brigadier General in 1921. In 1927 he was sent to China to take charge of the Marine Expeditionary Force in the Legation Cities, earning his promotion to Major General, returning to America in 1929, and then competing and winning the role of Commandant of the USMC in 1931. He earned the rank of General in 1935, amidst the rising tension in the Hoover administration. When the situation started to deteriorate, Butler decided to resign from his post and presented his services to the Socialist Party, becoming the highest-ranking military official to join the Red Guard and earning the rank of General of the Army."
CSA_EVANS_CARLSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 26, 1896, in Sidney, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a Congregationalist minister, Evans Carlson began his military career in 1912 when he left High School and signed up for the US Army as a private, serving in the Philippines and Hawaii, and finishing his four years of service in 1916 as a Sargeant. He then rejoined the Army right during the start of the Punitive Expedition where he took up a garrison job in Mexico. He then signed up for an officers' course, from where he graduated as a Second Lieutenant in 1917, and even did a short term in the Artillery Corps, becoming an Artillery Captain in 1918. However, he was unsatisfied with his army positions, so he signed up in the Marine Corps in 1922 as a private, regardless of his previous postings. He was quickly promoted to Second Lieutenant and served in a Marine outpost in Quantico, Virginia. He then sailed towards Culebra, Puerto Rico, in 1924 and remained there five months before being ordered to the West Coast for duty with the Pacific Fleet. Applying for aviation training in 1925, he went to Pensacola, Florida, for instruction, but subsequently returned to duty with ground units. He served another tour of foreign shore duty from 1927 to 1929 in Shanghai, China. He later returned to America and was quickly sent to Nicaragua to fight against Sandino's insurgency, earning a navy cross after facing around 100 rebels with just 12 marines. He also received a commendation after the 1931 earthquake and for his work as Chief of Police of Occupied Nicaragua. He returned to the US in 1933 and was sent to Shanghai, to the Marine Detachment in the American Legation in the Legation Cities, serving as Adjutant and studying Chinese. He returned to Quantico in 1936, attending the Marine Corps Schools while also taking a course on International Law and Politics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. As the Nation spiraled into chaos, Smedley Butler began probing the Marine Corps for signs of dissenting opinions and quickly found an ally in Evans. When the time finally came to join the Chicago Syndicalists in their fight, even despite being severely torn, Carlson decided to follow Butler and is now one of our Highest Ranking officers, and Butler's most trusted General."
CSA_MAURICE_ROSE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 26, 1899, in Middletown, Connecticut, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Maurice Rose, born into a Jewish family, lied about his age to enlist in the Colorado National Guard in 1916 with the hopes of being able to join Pershing's Punitive Expedition to Mexico but was discharged six weeks later for being underage. He worked with his brother in a meatpacking plant until he came of age, after which he enlisted and was selected to officer training, graduating from the Officer Candidate School in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He reached the rank of Captain in 1923 and would start the Infantry Company Officer Course, graduating in 1926. With the growing schism between the pro-mechanization officers and the traditionalists, Rose joined the former, meeting higher ranking officers like Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton, who instilled some of their theoretical armored warfare knowledge into him. He'd undergo the Cavalry Officer Course in 1928, graduating in 1931, and then joining the Command and General Staff College, where he was still undergoing the final stages of his training when the Civil War was about to break out.\n\nRose's career had unfortunately been plagued with discrimination because of his Jewish origin, both from his commanding officers and fellow colleagues, most notably from General George Van Horn Moseley and Pedro Augusto del Valle, who are even said to have held his promotions back because of his background.\n\nAs a reaction to his treatment, Rose began to be seduced by the promises of social equality by the Socialist Party of America and when the situation finally seemed unsalvageable, Rose decided to defect northwards, where he joined the Red Guard. After having been recognized by Butler, he was promoted to the rank of General, and is widely considered the main mechanized warfare expert in the Syndicates' army\n\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He hasn't pledged his allegiance to any of the CSA political factions, and he's rumored to only be in our army in order to fight the anti-semitic officers of the AUS who once hindered his career."
CSA_MILTON_WOLFF_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 7, 1915, in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Milton 'Milt' Wolff, born into a Lithuanian-Hungarian immigrant family and previously an art student, joined the Red Guard as soon as it formed. Despite holding more Vanguardist views, he was accepted into the ranks and became quite popular amongst his peers for his leadership during the clashes against the AFP militias in late 1936 and early 1937.\n\nOnce Bill Haywood announced the Revolution, it became immediately apparent there was a major lack of command staff available to the CSA, and it was in this void that Wolff was promoted to General following a vote held by his peers and colleagues who saw him as a good fit for the role. However, his ability to lead large armies has yet to be put to the test.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Centralist Faction, aligned mostly with Browder."
CSA_EDWARD_CARTER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 26, 1916, in Los Angeles, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Edward Allen Carter Jr. was born to a Black American father and an East Indian mother, who shortly after his birth moved to India. With the collapse of the British Empire and the proclamation of the Bharatiya Commune, Carter came into contact with socialism for the first time as a child, although it was short-lived as his parents would move again in 1932, this time to Shanghai, where he tried to join the local American garrison, only to be rejected on account of his young age.\n\nWith the American Civil War brewing in the distance, he traveled to America as a stowaway in one of the Legation's transports, reaching Seattle and joining the local branch of the Red Guard. As their numbers discreetly mobilized eastwards to start the revolution, Carter slowly became popular amongst the soldiers, retelling the stories of bravery and revolution he had seen in his infancy in East India. When the Revolution finally started, Carter was voted in as a General, becoming one of the only black members of the CSA staff along with Oliver Law.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Federalist Faction."
CSA_GEORGE_H_CANNON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 5, 1915, in Webster Groves, Missouri\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Ham Cannon attended the Culver Military Academy before entering the University of Michigan in 1934 to become a Mechanical Engineer. In Michigan, he joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps program, with the specific purpose of joining the Marine Corps. It was there he further developed his knowledge of warfare. However, the outbreak of the civil war disrupted his training and his studies. With many of his fellow classmates being recruited by the Syndicate Red Guards, Cannon decided to follow them into the Red Guard. As the officers were voted to fill the staff of the syndicates, Cannon was chosen as a CO of Michigan's divisions. After a short inspection of the available candidates by Smedley Butler, Butler selected Cannon personally to be promoted to General and has been trying to help the young officer perfect his Marine officer training."
CSA_BENJAMIN_KATINE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 7, 1912, in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Benjamin Katine, a mechanic and electrician of some renown in New York, joined the Industrial Workers of the World militias as soon as they started recruitment. Becoming popular amongst the automobile unions, he was voted as an officer in February 1937 and was chosen by the Central Staff as a general. Despite the Automotive unions backing his position, Katine still has a lot to learn before becoming a valuable general for the CSA\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Unionist Faction."
CSA_JAMES_PATRICK_MURPHY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 9, 1901, in San Francisco, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W James Patrick Murphy graduated from the California State University in 1926 as a Radio Engineer and moved to San Francisco. While he was unremarkable in the major unrest of the 1930s, he joined the Red Guard after the 1936 election, where his mechanical expertise with radios allowed him to connect the workers of California with those of Chicago. As the workers were discreetly mobilized into Chicago, Murphy was assigned to several cities across what now is the Syndicalist stronghold, improving radio communications between the Red Guard detachments. For his service, he was granted the rank of General within the Red Guard, but even many within the CSA General Staff doubt this Radio Engineer will be capable of leading vast armies across the American landscape."
CSA_JOHN_TISA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 6, 1914, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W John Tisa comes from a Cuban-Italian immigrant family. Previously working mostly as a factory worker and as an amateur writer in his spare time, Tisa joined the Red Guard on the 31st of December, 1936. Since then, he has earned the respect of the Syndicalist soldiers in New Jersey and was voted as their CO at their staff elections. Tisa was then promoted to general, where, for better or worse, he will have to learn from scratch the art of warfare if he hopes to come out ahead of the enemy during the revolution."
CSA_HERBERT_HOLDRIDGE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 6, 1892, in Wyandotte, Michigan, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Herbert Charles Heitke was born in a German immigrant family, and would sign up for West Point in 1913, graduating in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He was first assigned to the Quartermaster Corps of the Army's Reserve in Georgia, reaching the rank of First Lieutenant in 1920 and Captain in 1923. In 1925, while he was still in the Reserve Corps, he transferred to the Cavalry Corps and was assigned as Assistant Professor of History and Social Sciences at West Point. In late 1929, he was transferred to the Army's Cavalry School at Fort Riley, and remained in this position until early 1937, earning the promotion to Colonel in 1934. As soon as street violence began escalating, Heitke decided to resign and move back to New York with his family, signing up for the local Red Guard, where his military experience granted him a promotion from Smedley Butler himself. Now a General of the Syndicalist Army, Heitke has become, along with Maurice Rose and Smedley Butler, one of the few military generals of the US Army to join the revolution."
CSA_OLIVER_LAW_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 23, 1900, in Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Oliver Law enlisted to the US Army in 1919 as a private, serving with the 24th Infantry regiment stationed on the Mexican Border. He left the military in 1925 after being refused any kind of promotion on the basis of his skin color, moving first to Bluffton, Indiana, where he worked at a cement plant and then shortly thereafter to Chicago where he drove a cab for the Yellow Cab Company. When the Great Depression hit, Law was left unemployed for years, until he managed to become a stevedore and joined the International Longshoremen's Association. With his savings, he tried to open a restaurant in 1932 but ultimately failed and unemployed once more, he joined the International Labor Defence. With a Civil War looming over the United States, Law was amongst the first to volunteer for the Red Guard. Because of his military background and leadership skills, he was quickly voted in as an officer by his fellow soldiers, before later reaching the rank of General thanks to the sponsoring of the National Negro Congress.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Loyal Member of the Unionist Faction, and he is rumored to keep close relations with both Bayard Rustin and Asa Philip Randolph."
CSA_ROBERT_H_MERRIMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 17, 1908, in Eureka, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a lumberjack, Robert Hale Merriman grew up in a poor family hit hard by the Depression. Forced to take odd jobs to continue his education after graduating from high school, he ended up joining the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) branch at the University of Nevada, where he graduated in 1932, marrying his wife Marion, also a student, on their graduation day. After this, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a master's degree in economics. With the Depression's grip worsening in America and fascinated by French and British economic structures, he and Marion moved to Paris for a year to study at the Sorbonne. Returning to California in 1935, he finished his master's degree and was accepted to the University of Chicago's Ph.D. program in 1936, drawn to the growing revolutionary activity in the city.\n\nAs MacArthur's deadline loomed over Haywood's conference, Merriman, with his background in the ROTC, began teaching students of all ages the rudimentary military training he had learned half a decade ago. Though he was not a devoted syndicalist, Merriman was outraged by the widespread political repression and authoritarian tenancies demonstrated by the American government in the summer of 1936, and with his warm personality and commanding figure he was elected to lead the University's branch of the Red Militia.\n\nUnlike many of the other young officers voted into command by their peers, Merriman's military training and educated background made him stand out to Smedley Butler, who hand-picked the young man for higher command and began to nurture what he saw as his strong talent for leadership and command.\n§YImportant Notes:§W-It is unclear where exactly Merriman's political loyalties lie within the greater CSA Party Congress. He has an academic interest in Syndicalist economic policy, but his distaste for authoritarianism has alienated him from the more centralist faction of the Congress lead by Browder."
CSA_DAVID_SHOUP_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 30, 1904, in Battle Ground, Indiana, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L David Shoup was born in an impoverished family in the heart of the steel belt. From an early age, Shoup leaned politically to the left - having been moulded by the progressive ideas of Indiana politicians fighting against Wall Street's big businesses. Excelling in academics and extracurriculars such as wrestling and football, he joined the United States Marine Corps for financial reasons. In the Marine Corps, Shoup was recognised for his athletics, marksmanship, and leadership skills - impressing his commanders and subordinates for his ability to keep morale with his sense of humour. From 1927 to 1934, Shoup served in China, protecting American interests in the war-torn country, a mission he was personally opposed to seeing his actions as simply an imperialist exploitation of the Chinese people. As the nation began to spiral into chaos, Shoup's anti-imperialist stance and personal beliefs made him a staunch supporter and ally of fellow Marine Corps General Smedly Butler. When the time came for revolution, Shoup committed himself to the syndicalist cause and Butler, bringing the experience and leadership the Second Continental Army desperately needed."
CSA_ROBERT_ALLEN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 14, 1900, in Latonia, Kentucky, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Robert S. Allen was born Herman Greenberg until his father officially changed his name as the Weltkreig raged on to avoid connections to Germany and to pick a real \"American\" last name. Lying about his age, Allen joined Pershing's expedition to seek out Pancho Villa after which he graduated from the University of Wisconsin and took up reporting. It was in Wisconsin, one of the key hotbeds of American socialism that Allen became dedicated to Reed's cause. As racial tensions seeped into American society with the ongoing economic crisis, Allen used his investigative journaling skills to successfully infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. A foreign correspondent with the Christian Science Monitor, Allen's dissatisfaction with the Hoover administration compelled him to write an anonymous expose "Washington Merry Go-Round." Disillusioned with MacArthur's military clique in Washington and Hoover's incompetence brought Allen more and more committed to the vision of America held by the SPA. A proponent of speed and armor due to his experiences in the Pershing Expedition, Allen has pledged himself to the worker's cause in the wake of the civil war."

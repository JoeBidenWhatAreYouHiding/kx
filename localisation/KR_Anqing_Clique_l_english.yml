### Parties ###
ANQ_totalist_party: "Kuomintang Remnants"
ANQ_totalist_party_long: "League of Ten\n§gDai Chunfeng has eyes everywhere, and the League Provinces are no different. The campaigns being waged to the south led to a previously active resistance in the mid-sized towns dotting the countryside. However, as a result of aggressive suppression campaigns (many carried out under Chen's direction), the League of Ten are relatively powerless to act here. Not that it stops them from trying.§!" #### Dai Chunfeng's pre-KMT followers are the League of Ten. They don't become BIS until the League War is won by the Left KMT.
ANQ_syndicalist_party: "LCS"
ANQ_syndicalist_party_long: "Syndicalist Student Groups\n§gStudent protests were a regular occurrence under Sun Chuanfang's regime, and while the new administration takes a much more tolerant approach — even sympathising with some of their goals — they aren't totally pacified. Still, most serious Kuomintang supporters went south to join the struggle, so the overall political impact they have amounts to essentially nothing.§!"
ANQ_radical_socialist_party: "Kuomintang Remnants"
ANQ_radical_socialist_party_long: "Socialist Insurgents\n§gIn the countryside, peasants hardly feel represented by Chen's new government, despite whatever promises he may make. Rebels — some affiliated with the KMT, some merely wishing to empower their own local communities — seek to raise militias against the government. Their ideologies are at best loosely defined; sometimes they consist of some form of 'people's revival' or 'revolution by all classes', Quanmin Geming, but much more often they simply advocate for land reform. They pose no serious threat due to years of continuous suppression, but they haven't been discouraged yet.§!"
ANQ_social_democrat_party: "Anti-Concessions League"
ANQ_social_democrat_party_long: "Anti-Concessions Movement\n§gChen's greatest ally — and, perhaps, greatest weakness — is the Anti-Concessions Movement. Almost an accidental ally, too; a nebulous political body, the Anti-Concessions Movement is bound by only one thing — hatred of foreign imperialism. Chen's patriotic rhetoric swayed them to his side and launched him to prominence, but whether he can satisfy their expectations remains to be seen. Many members are tending increasingly towards radical ideas of popular democracy and a socialist-inspired state, hardly what Chen himself had in mind, and if their influence grows unchecked they might well make a nasty enemy unless Chen can appease them. Their leaders continue to agitate against the vestiges of German influence, and nationalist sentiment is the phrase on everybody's lips.§!"
ANQ_social_liberal_party: "Vermillion Society"
ANQ_social_liberal_party_long: "Vermillion Society (Zhuhong Hui)\n§gDuring the 1932 Shanghai Uprising, the Five Provinces exploded with revolutionary sentiment — generally dying with a whimper after the brutal suppression carried out by Sun Chuanfang's troops, aided by the Germans. Chen, however, took no part in that suppression, and consequently the Vermillion Society lives on as a moderately influential organization where others have fallen away.\nTaking their name from the vermillion-coloured headlines of the posters they spread around Shanghai, declaring hostility to the Qing and to warlordism, they've since established roots around the country and in the corridors of power. Their name is something of a pun, too, playing on one translation of vermillion (Zhongguohong): literally, 'Chinese red', reflecting their sympathy for leftist groups.\nThe individuals making up the Society are a varied lot; intellectuals, businessmen, and the obscenely wealthy dominate, however. Most members live and work in the concessions, with their origins lying in Robert Hotung's Chinese Club, founded in Hong Kong. Nonetheless, their most important characteristic is — paradoxically — anti-concessionism. They count among their ranks Chinese nationalists and republicans, and now they find themselves reaching out a generous hand to Chen — provided he's willing to make some concessions of his own, that is.§!"
ANQ_market_liberal_party: "Beijing Liaison Council"
ANQ_market_liberal_party_long: "Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing\n§gOur benefactors, the Zhili, have naturally taken a keen interest in the programmes being undertaken by our impromptu government. Relations between the Southern and Northern Zhili were always fraught, and the intricate web of connections that served as both groups' foundation served only to aggravate the issue; a personal slight against a Nanjing official could have grave economic repercussions on both sides.\nWhile we may resent somewhat their presence here, at least they have little strength independently; any power they do have is only as a tool of Beijing, and if we maintain good relations with the Qing themselves these representatives can't give our government any trouble. The extent of their activities is mostly disseminating pro-Qing propaganda and pushing for their own candidates in some minor posts. It would be a different story, however, if we were to somehow offend the dragon to the north...§!"
anq_influencepartyname_projapan: "Xinhai Society"
anq_influencepartyname_projapan_long: "Xinhai Society for National Reclamation (Xinhai Fuguo She)\n§gAs Japan's — and Fengtian's — voice in Nanjing, the Xinhai Society is an aggressive lobbyist on behalf of these two powerful groups. Within it, however, one finds a not exactly harmonious arrangement of egos; Zhang-aligned warlords gone into retirement, Japanese businessmen, and a small core of optimistic intellectuals who seem to have truly bought into the Pan-Asian dream all make up this society. Standing in stark contrast to the Vermillion Society, though they pay lip service to many of the same ideals, the Xinhai Society harkens back to a time when the country had what they term 'legitimate unity' — that is, when all people could agree on was that the monarchy's days were numbered. Much like the Xinhai Society itself, in other words.\nThat isn't to say they're toothless, however. The Japanese market is an appealing one for many, and they have the quiet backing of many economic powerbrokers — financial resources often translated into political changes. Furthermore, Japan's primary involvement is through the ostensibly apolitical railway companies — giving them tremendous power with the appearance of being above the petty politics unfolding here. The quick mobilisation of troops was practically all that kept Sun's old League together, and it was a railway's construction that ultimately did it in. Many still remember the Railway Protection Movement that truly sparked Xinhai in 1911; if we were to anger either of our supporters or if their involvement became too unpopular, we might well discover that railways would once again launch a revolution... against us.§!"
ANQ_social_conservative_party: "Jiangnan Consortium"
ANQ_social_conservative_party_long: "Lower Yangtze Merchant Association (Jiangnan Shangbang)\n§gThe Lower Yangtze Merchant Association is an eclectic grouping made up of many disparate factions united in the pursuit of profit. Labeled by the Western businessmen they primarily trade with as a 'Consortium', they are comprised of Chinese merchants, small banks, minor industrialists, and guilds that are not especially politically active or powerful. Rarely courted by any faction and disinterested in any changes that don't affect their bottom line, they are a necessary but nonetheless frequently ignored part of East China's economic wellbeing.§!"
ANQ_authoritarian_democrat_party: "Anqing Clique"
ANQ_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Anqing Clique (Yixi Junfa)\n§gIn the years after the Zhili triumph and the ostensible reformation of the empire, there were opportunities aplenty for ambitious young commanders to forge some new disunity from what was meant to be a glorious restoration. Chen Tiaoyuan was one such, and over the past decade he has set about building a base of power from the city of Anqing and the province of Anhui he governs. This historically agricultural, but recently industrialising, province would be the perfect stage from which he rallied support — support from the unlikeliest of places.\nThe leftist rebels he suppressed turned to him as an alternative to what they saw as doomed revolt; officers shoved aside in Sun Chuanfang's administration saw in him an opportunity for advancement; nationalists wishing to cast out the oppressors joined him, sensing in him a strong will and proud heart.\nPerhaps some of them were even right in seeing what they did in Chen — but it's ultimately become irrelevant, as he can hardly back down now. Like it or not, Chen Tiaoyuan is a symbol of national pride and a form of anti-imperialism more stable, less radical, than the Kuomintang's shouts from the south. During the 1932 Shanghai Uprising, he chose to keep his troops at home against the wishes of League-Marshal Sun, whom he was meant to serve. The Northern Zhili have maintained a more positive view of him ever since, hoping to sow discord amongst their southern competitors.\nNow this 'Anqing Clique' must break from the legacies of exploitative warlords and foreigners alike, and journey forward to build a better China. Whatever that looks like.§!"

ANQ_national_populist_party_long: "Yiguandao\n§gZhang Tianran's esoteric cult may have its base in Shandong, but its tendrils stretch south to embrace those searching for some better way and uninterested in politicians' promises. Those same politicians, however, have been quite resolute in stamping it out; the cult can barely influence local affairs, let alone have a meaningful impact on the region's politics.§!"


### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ANQ_CHEN_TIAOYUAN_DESC: "In 1916, at age thirty, Chen Tiaoyuan was a commander in chief of the Military police in Jiangsu province. This modest career was interrupted by the short lived reign of Yuan Shikai, whose military adventure left a power vacuum for younger officers such as himself to advance. In these early years Chen served along Zhang Zongchang, whose friendship ended when the later’s lack of discipline became apparent. Chen’s loyalty drifted from the Fengtian Clique to Sun Chuanfang in the same manner, for which Sun showed his gratitude by giving Chen command of the Anhui Army.\nUnder Chen's regime, the province of Anhui was refused German investment from the Algostasien company. Compared with their compatriots in Jiangsu and Fujian, Anhui Province was seen as both impoverished and helpless to industrial innovation. Chen has won respect and prestige for his antagonism towards Sun Chuanfang's Pro-German policies. In recent years, the intertwined interests with the Germans and Sun has broken Chen’s trust in the League and Sun.\n Chen’s army strikes out to reform the League provinces away from German dependence, and towards either inner renovation or a renewed alliance with anti-imperialist forces."

Because someone criticized that Zhang Zhongli considered standing with KMT, Sun Chuanfang arranged him from Jiangsu to Anhui which made him be familiar with Chen Tiaoyuan and became the partner of Anqing Clique."

He was the classmate of Bai Chongxi in Baoding Military Academy. After graduating from the Academy, he was trained in Ni Sichong's Army and then sent to Hunan and Sichuan. In 1925, he became an officer in the remaining Anhui Clique Army which was commanded by Ma Xiangbin and participated in the war against Zhang Zongchang and the suppression action against Daohui in Luan. Several years passed since the end of the Northern Expedition and by orders of Sun Chuanfang, he was once sent to support the siege to Jiangfu Base Area which was lead by Zhou Yinren. But his army suffered great casualties because of bad weather. Considering the failure of siege, Sun Chuanfang demoted him, making him an officer in Chen Tiaoyuan's army."
POLITICS_ANQ_MA_DENGYING_ARMY_DESC: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1890, Gaomi, Shandong Province, Qing Empire§!\n§YPolitical Career:§! §gMa Dengying, also known as Ma Haiqiao, began his career in the Chinese military after developing a fascination with martial arts as well as physical wellness. He entered Baoding Academy in 1906 and was sent in 1908 to study military affairs in Japan. During this time he made contacts with the Tongmenghui, briefly returning to China in 1912 to establish a revolutionary cell in Qingdao. Dengying fought alongside a small cadre to capture the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong, but was driven out by the forces of Yuan Shikai and went back to Japan. His exile was short lived however, as sympathetic members of the Anhui Clique invited him back into the country just a year later.\n\nDengying then climbed the ranks of the armed forces, being promoted in 1923 to Chief of Staff for a Brigade tasked with supressing banditry in Shandong. He also made a reputation for himself as a virtuous man who promoted clean and healthy living, reportedly refusing to take bribes and to indulge in many of the other vices that proliferated through the army at the time. By 1925 he broke with the Anhui Clique and attached himself to Sun Dianying's Southern Zhili Clique. It was here he got to know the \"Dice-Rolling General\", Chen Tiaoyuan, as they fought side by side in Jiangxi to drive back the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition.\n\nDengying forged a comradely bond with Chen, admiring the man for his strong principles and refusal to bow to foreign imperialists. After the Xuantong Restoration, he held a number of administrative posts on behalf of Sun Chuanfang's League of Eight Provinces, but ran up against the entrenched corruption in the Eastern provinces. His uncompromising attitude towards bribes, banditry and drug use drove Dengying to Anhui Province, where Chen recruited him to serve as the Deputy-Commander of the Anhui Army, as well as allowing him to preside over physical fitness and sport activities for the military.§!\n\n§YImportant Notes:§!\n§gDengying is an avid art collector and amateur poet, primarily composing verses such as:\n\"In a place of seclusion in the mountains, with no official position or status, one must nevertheless have the eloquence to secure the state and settle the nation.\"\n\nHe is a leading figure within the Anti-Opium Movement in Eastern China.§!"

We are heavily outnumbered and we must make use of all who wish to help us."
ANQ_anticollaborationist_patrols: "Anti-Collaborationist Patrols"
ANQ_anticollaborationist_patrols_desc: "The hate against the Germans and the West has spawned many vigilantes, who are currently operating on their own and trying to crack down on all who in the past collaborated with Germany.

ANQ_harsh_desertion_policy: "Harsh Desertion Policy"
ANQ_harsh_desertion_policy_desc: "Due to the general disorder in Eastern China, our lands are plagued with rebellious officers and other bandits, many of them former soldiers. We must crack down hard on deserters in order to prevent them from wreaking havoc on innocent peasants."

ANQ_internal_decisions: "Emergency Wartime Requests"

ANQ_Jinhua_City: "Fall of Jinhua"
ANQ_Jinhua_City_desc: "Home of the famous Jinhua ham, the city is an important regional center for the processing and collection of food in the Zheijang province.

ANQ_Nanjing_City: "Fall of Nanjing"
ANQ_Nanjing_City_desc: "Seen by some as the actual capital of China, the sprawling city of Nanjing is without a doubt the most important city of the League and should it fall the position of [LEP.GetLeader] would be under significant threat.

ANQ_Huai_River_Line_desc: "Connecting £victory_points §GBengbu§! with the interior of the Qing province of Honan, this river whilst not having the prestige or shipping traffic of the Yangtze still provides us with a small trickle of supplies from our allies in Bejing."
ANQ_Yangtze_River_Line: "Yangtze River Line"
ANQ_Yangtze_River_Line_desc: "River of stories and river of conflict, the Yangtze has had a profound impact on Chinese history from its origins up till the conflicts of the past decades. Flowing from the mountains of Tibet to the East-China Sea, the 6,300 km river is home to nearly one third of the Chinese population and a vital connection for the bolstering city of Shanghai.\n\nWith railroad connections into our territory barely existing and with heavy foreign support for our enemies in Nanjing coming in from the Sea, this river provides us with a critical connection to our supporters in the territory under Wu Peifu. Should we lose the city of £victory_points §GAnqing§! then the impact on our potential to continue the war effort will be drastically decreased."
ANQ_Xuzhou_Rail_Line: "The Beijing-Shanghai Railway"
ANQ_Xuzhou_Rail_Line_desc: "Connecting the capital of the Great Qing to the financial hub of Shanghai on the East-China Sea, this railway is one of the most important in all of China and a vital supply line for our troops.\n\nThe main hub of importance for us is £victory_points §GXuzhou§! but control over £victory_points §GNanjing§! and £victory_points §GBengbu§! will only increase our capacity to import supplies and will convince benefactors across the Qing land that we are likely to take up the mantle of the fallen League."
ANQ_Nanchang_Rail_Line: "The Nanchang-Shanghai Railway"
ANQ_Nanchang_Rail_Line_desc: "Connecting the city of £victory_points §GNanchang§! to the ports of £victory_points §GHangzhou§! and Shanghai, this less important railway is not as well connected to the land of the great Qing as the other railroads but can serve as a desperate last line of supplies and could support our actions in the Southern half of the League. Taking over control of the railway hub at £victory_points §GJinhua§! is likely to increase the amount of supplies coming down the tracks and will be seen as a sign of progress by our benefactors in the land of the Qing."
ANQ_Jinan_Rail_Line: "The Beijing-Qingdao Railway"
ANQ_Jinan_Rail_Line_desc: "Connecting Bejing to the German treaty port of Qingdao, this railway much like its larger brother leading to Shanghai is of key importance to our insurrection and should be held open at all times. One should thread carefully in this region however as the city of £victory_points §GJinan§! may still have hidden sympathies for the Yiguandao sect who has under the rule of Zongchang steadily been increasing its influence in the region."

# Supply lines Japan
ANQ_Nantong_Port_Line: "Nantong-Nagasaki Shipping Route"
ANQ_Nantong_Port_Line_desc: "Behind Shanghai likely the second most important port of the East China Sea and connected by rail to the interior, £victory_points §GNantong§! is of vital importance to ensure a steady supply of 'Chinese' weapons flowing into our army."

ANQ_Quanzhou_Port_Line_desc: "Far more Southern than the other ports, £victory_points §GQuanzhou§! has a position very close to the Japanese island of Formosa and is as such an important lifeline to their armament complexes."
ANQ_Hangzhou_Port_Line: "Hangzhou-Nagasaki Shipping Route"
ANQ_Hangzhou_Port_Line_desc: "Secured together with the allegiance of the treacherous Chen Yi, governor of Zheijang, £victory_points §GHangzhou§! is the cornerstone of our revolt and the only connection with the Empire of the Rising Sun until we can secure the more important harbours of the East China Sea."

ANQ_subei_canal: "The Subei Canal"
ANQ_subei_canal_desc: "The Northern Jiangsu Main Irrigation Canal or Subei Canal has been designed to provide a direct outlet to the sea for the waters of the Huai River, which discharged near the mouth of the Guan River. In the late 12th century the Huang He (Yellow River) changed its course to discharge south of the Shandong Peninsula, thus taking over the lower course of the Huai, which thereafter discharged into Hongze Lake and thence southward through a string of lakes and waterways into the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) near Yangzhou (Jiangsu). The Huang He remained in that course until the 1850s, when it again shifted to its present course north of the Shandong Peninsula. In the early 20th century the drainage of the Huai area had become a perennial problem.\n\nTo solve this issue a canal linking Hongze Lake with the sea has been ordered, designed not only as a channel for the discharge of floodwaters but also as the main artery of an extensive network of drainage and irrigation channels."

ANQ_friends_in_low_places: "Friends in Low Places"
ANQ_friends_in_low_places_desc: "If we wish to advance our authority, we need to make deals with those we would rather avoid.

ANQ_sanction_patriotic_protests: "Sanction Patriotic Protests"
ANQ_sanction_patriotic_protests_desc: "Sun Chuanfang and Qi Xieyuan made the mistake to crack down hard on protests. In fact, it was the harsh reactions against often quite limited protests that often set off a much larger chain reaction.

ANQ_nationalize_key_industries_desc: "If we wish to expand our control over the economy so we can better steer it in the direction we wish, nationalizing certain key industries would be a good option.

ANQ_okura_bank_loans_desc: "If we wish to continue our heavy investments into the economy, we need additional capital.

ANQ_caifa_contracts: "Caifa Contracts"
ANQ_caifa_contracts_desc: "The caifa, the Chinese equivalents of the zaibatsus, are eager to expand. While many of them are relatively young and undeveloped, we could allow Chinese businesses to flourish if we hand them this opportunity."

ANQ_reconstruction_efforts_desc: "The League War has caused tremendous damage to our country.

ANQ_fujian_encirclement_campaigns_desc: "While the KMT has lost control of most of its territory, they continue to be holed up in various bases throughout Fujian. In order to prevent them from escaping each time we close in on them, we should employ a tactic of 'encirclement campaigns', in which we encircle them and close off any escape route. This should help to finally get rid of them."
ANQ_provisional_currency: "Provisional Currency"
ANQ_provisional_currency_desc: "The recent war has lead to dozens of different currencies flourishing, many of them supported exclusively by small local governments.

This will require a series of thorough purges of the bureacracy in Nanjing."
ANQ_administrative_centralization: "Administrative Centralization"
ANQ_administrative_centralization_desc: "The high degree of decentralization of the Old League allowed Chen Tiaoyuan to declare independence and seize power.

ANQ_expand_jiangnan_arsenal: "Expand the Jiangnan Arsenal"
ANQ_expand_jiangnan_arsenal_desc: "The Jiangnan Arsenal is the largest center of military production in the Five Provinces.

### Events ###

anq.1.t: "Tension on the Yangtze"
anq.1.d: "Outrage echoes in the streets of Anhui- 'Justice for Wuhu; expel the foreigners!' Governor Chen Tiayouan has risen to the challenge, and already agents of the Nanjing government are being expelled from the province. Virtually overnight Chen has been branded a defender of the people, but now his forces are locked in a series of standoffs throughout the lower Yangtze, and the question looms- what next? Some have called for a complete overthrow of the Nanjing Regime, but more cynical voices point to strategic opportunity.\n\nChen has long been known for his tendency to take calculated risks and this moment is no different."
anq.1.a: "Long Live the Governor!"

anq.2.t: "A Request to Wu Peifu?"
anq.2.d: "With chaos erupting all across the Eight Provinces, Chen is fully aware that his own situation may soon be threatened as well. To avoid immediate collapse or decisive military action by one of our enemies, we will therefore need allies. The Jade Marshal, governing the Qing and posessing the largest military force in Eastern China could here prove an asset as it is rumoured that he may possess hidden loyalties and wishes to aid our Anti-Concessionist cause. It may not be wise to immediately ask for his full backing, so instead we should simply ask him to help provide funding for our troops."
anq.2.a: "Send the telegram."

anq.3.t: "Wu Accepts our Request"
anq.3.d: "Marshal Wu Peifu has returned our latest telegram expressing his deep sympathies for the people of Anhui, and his admiration for their dedication to Chinese exceptionalism. In this grandiose letter however, Marshal Wu never authoritatively states whether Beijing will move to help Anqing. Governor Chen is left with a quandry and little time to decide. Is it worth it to continue to engage with Marshal Wu, or is our precious few days spent in peace better spent on a different plan for diplomatic survival?"
anq.3.a: "See? What did I tell you!"
anq.3.b: "No point. He's little more than a German lapdog."

anq.4.t: "Wu Refuses Chen Tiaoyuan's Request"
anq.4.d: "In another letter sent by Marshal Wu, it appears that any common ground between him and Governor Chen has broken down. Marshal Wu's letter chastises Chen for the incredible gamble he is taking with the people of Anhui, and cautions him towards what could only mean Chen's death via appeasing Nanjing. This development has pushed back our attempts to gain support in Beijing considerably, and our time is becoming ever more scarce.\n\nA second opportunity may have opened itself up in the shape of the controversial general Chen Yi however whose rumored connections with the Black Dragon Society could help us gain an audience with the Japanese ambassador in Tianjin. [ANQ.GetLeader] is fully aware of the risk this may pose to the goal of the anti-concessionist movement but with Wu still adamantly refusing, we have little other choice."
anq.4.a: "It is time to visit the Japanese."

anq.5.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan Approaches Chen Yi"
anq.5.d: "Chen Yi, governor of the powerful Zhejiang province still within the League, has approached Chen Tiaoyuan to discuss possible cooperation. Urging his colleague that the true future of China lies with the Fengtian government and not with the Qing, he promises that if Chen Tiaoyuan pledges himself to Zhang Zuolin, the leader of Fengtian, Chen Yi will offer his full support in the coming war.\n\nAs Chen Yi's position within the Zhejiang does provide him with a sizeable capital and force to back up these promises and with Wu Peifu remaining supportive of Nanjing, it seems that we have little choice but to take the chance and hope for the best."
anq.5.a: "What choice do we have?"

anq.6.t: "Anqing Asks Our Support"
anq.6.d: "Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of the Anhui province within the League of Eight Provinces, has asked for our support in their coming struggle against the Qing and the League. Whilst Chen takes a strong anti-concessionist viewpoint and receives most of his support from this movement, he also recognises the position he has found himself trapped in. Either he sticks with his ideals and loses his land, his army and likely his life or he reaches out and comes knocking on the door of the most powerful nation in all of East-Asia. Urged by the governor of Zhejiang, Chen Yi, to establish contact with Fengtian and their allies, it seems that he has chosen for the latter option.\n\nThis has provided us with an excellent opportunity to further weaken German hold on Nanjing and cause damage on the Southern flank of the Qing center of power, something we should exploit as much as possible. Caution should still be advised however as pushing ourselves too hard on Chen may yet cause him to reconsider or worse have his support and by extension his chances of victory evaporate."
anq.6.a: "Another piece has entered the board"

anq.7.t: "Meeting with Japan"
anq.7.d: "Working in shady backrooms and through the network of the Black Dragon Society, [ANQ.GetLeader] has been able to establish contact with the [JAP.GetName]. Although their intentions seem questionable at best and their wish for a China for the Chinese is just a plain lie, Chen is fully aware that he has little choice in the matter and their request to recognise Fengtian as the sole Chinese government is more than reasonable in exchange for sorely needed support.\n\nWith the first shipement of gold and small arms arrived in Anqing to show that Japan is ready to stand by its words and with the Nanjing military mobilising for an invasion of our domain, it seems that the time for waiting is now fully over. We will strike first and we will strike hard, ensuring that the German stooges on the coast will be incapable of oppressing China any longer!"
anq.7.a: "Declare war on the League"

anq.8.t: "Wu Peifu reconsiders his position"
anq.8.d: "Likely having received word of our connections to Tokyo, Wu Peifu has recalled his original statement in which he demanded us to stand down and surrender to Nanjing. He now offers the full degree of support that his government can provide and praises [ANQ.GetLeader] for his decisive action during China's time of need. To reinforce his words, he as well has authorised the transfer of gold and weapons to Anqing with more on the way if we accept Wu's offer and break of all contact with Tokyo."
anq.8.a: "Who says he won't betray us a second time?"
anq.8.b: "We are grateful for his support"

anq.9.t: "Chen Tiaoyuan rebukes our offer"
anq.9.d: "Likely frustrated by our earlier betrayal, the governor of Anqing has refused to meet his demands and has clearly pointed out that the interests of his people lay with the Fengtian government. To give strength to his words, he has also handwaived the bribe we sent to bring him in line to ensure that he no longers has any obligation to the Qing."
anq.9.a: "This is unfortunate"

anq.10.t: "Qing Pledges Its Support"
anq.10.d: "The League lies weak, smouldering ruins show where once German fatcats dined with Nanjing officials whilst their army is disorganised and squabling amongst themselves. Not only have our troops the courage and the dedication to bring our goals to a successful end, we also have the support of the great Wu Peifu himself and the Imperial Army. All the pieces have been placed in motion, the time has come to put the League out of its misery and as a phoenix rising from the ashes so will Chen watch over the rebirth of China!"
anq.10.a: "Mobilise the troops!" 

anq.11.t_1: "Shangguan Rises in Zhejiang"
anq.11.t_2: "Chen Yi Rises in Zhejiang"
anq.11.d_1: "Governor Chen Yi of Zhejiang has sided with the Anqing in this most desperate hour. His forces have rallied around Jinhua and march north to take the provincial capital of Hangzhou and kick out the forces of [LEP.GetLeader]. Shangguan joins our cause!"
anq.11.d_2: "As he promised us, Governor Chen Yi of the Zhejiang province has risen up and joined our forces! With his help, we now control Hangzhou, which provides us with a port to accept Japanese supplies. Nonetheless the Anqing-Hangzhou corridor is far from secure as it forms an easy prey to the superior forces of [LEP.GetLeader]."
anq.11.a: "Our ally joins us"

anq.12.t: "Victory against Nanjing!"
anq.12.d1: "A semblance of order has been restored to the former League. The fall of Nanjing and the subsequent departure of pro-German traitors has shown that a China free of Western meddling is still a possibility and has given a significant morale boost to the Anti-Concessionist Movement. Furthermore, many of Nanjing's former troops have defected to us!\n\nThe road ahead however is a long one and although [ANQ.GetLeader] may now control his former enemy's seat of power, stability is still far away. To establish a strong basis for governing and to combat the continued threat posed by the Yiguandao and the Kuomintang movements, Chen will have to pull out all the registers but should he succeed, China will go towards a brighter and stronger future!"
anq.12.d2: "The Nanjing Clique may have been defeaten, but we do not yet hold their base of power, the Southern Capital, Nanjing. However, the defeat of the League has lead to a wave of increased morale among all Chinese freedom fighters and given our government much more significant support. Furthermore, many of Nanjing's former troops have defected to us! We must move forward against our remaining enemies and secure all of the Five Provinces. Only then can we think of the future."
anq.12.d3: "A semblance of order has been restored to the former League. The fall of Nanjing and the subsequent departure of pro-German traitors has shown that a China free of Western meddling is still a possibility and has given a significant morale boost to the Anti-Concessionist Movement. Furthermore, many of Nanjing's former troops have defected to us!\n\nThe road ahead however is a long one and although [ANQ.GetLeader] may now control his former enemy's seat of power, the threats to the north and south are still very real. We will need to move fast and ensure we control all of the Five Provinces."
anq.12.a: "Peace is nearby" 

anq.13.t: "Clashes with Kuomintang Troops"
anq.13.d: "Word has reached command headquarters of limited engagements with Kuomintang forward elements not long after breaking through Nanjing Clique lines. Despite our shared interest in defeating Qi Xieyuan, the KMT are an old and inevitable enemy.\n\nFor now, a temporary ceasefire might be to our advantage, and we could instruct local commanders to avoid open conflict. If we choose to do so, we must remain vigilant; NRA forces could still attack at any time."
anq.13.a: "Declare war"
anq.13.b: "Bide our time"

anq.14.t: "Continued KMT clashes"
anq.14.d1: "Despite orders to the contrary, low-level officers near NRA lines have carried out a series of attacks into hostile territory, raiding villages and stealing supplies. Supposedly this was triggered by opportunistic NRA sharpshooting, but whatever the case the situation is escalating.\n\nShould we tell the troops to back down, or attack?"
anq.14.d2: "Skirmishes have broken out near NRA lines once again. The exact cause of the fighting is unclear but predictably it seems set to escalate without explicit orders to the contrary. Should we tell the men to engage or continue to bide their time?"
anq.14.a: "Attack!"
anq.14.b: "Hold position!"

anq.15.t: "Clashes with the Anqing Clique"
anq.15.d1: "Word has reached command headquarters limited engagements with Anqing Clique troops in recently liberated territory. Despite his commendable anti-German goals, Chen Tiaoyuan is still nothing but a Warlord, and above all an opportunist. As a reactionary element, he will need to be eliminated.\n\nHowwever a temporary ceasefire could be to our advantage, and we could instruct the NRA to avoid open conflict. If we choose to do so, we must remain vigilant; Anqing forces could still attack at any time."
anq.15.d2: "Skirmishes have broken out near Anqing lines once again. The exact cause of the fighting is unclear but predictably it seems set to escalate without explicit orders to the contrary. Should we tell the men to engage or continue to bide their time?"
anq.15.a: "Declare war"
anq.15.b: "Bide our time"

anq.16.t: "Five Provinces Together Again"
anq.16.d: "We have united the Five Provinces, which means our heartland is whole once more. We have dealt with the League and the threats to the north and south. It is now time to rebuild and consolidate our gains before we look further to Hunan and Liangguang to remake the League once more."
anq.16.a: "Victory!" 

# Relocating the Capital
anq.17.t: "Relocating the Capital"
anq.17.d: "We have reclaimed the Southern Capital - Nanjing. Whilst our current power base lies primarily in and around the city of Anqing, the city does not hold the industry or prestige that Nanjing provides and which we will require if we are to assert control over the various feuding warlords further down South.\n\nWhilst the relocation of the government to this city is thus inevitable, some are worried that doing so too early might open us up to public unrest in a region without the strong support we enjoy at home. On the other end, moving there as soon as possible will grant us access to its resources sooner and could shorthen the war drastically."
anq.17.a: "Commence preparations"
anq.17.b: "It would be wise to delay"

anq.18.t: "Relocating the Capital"
anq.18.d: "With our hold over the former lands of [LEP.GetLeader] somewhat stable, [ANQ.GetLeader] has decreed the relocation of the capital from the city of Anqing to Nanjing. Being both more prestigious and industrially capable than our war capital, many still fear however that this shift could prove a liability to Chen who will now no longer have a stable support base to coordinate his expeditions from and will be more affected by international meddling and local powerhungry politicians and businessmen."
anq.18.a: "Commence preparations"

anq.19.t: "Insurgents on the Anqing-Nanjing line"
anq.19.d: "Although transfer of power mostly went off without a hitch, the supply lines responsible to reinforce our garrisons on the coast with manpower and equipment from Anqing are suffering under increasing insurgent attacks and just sheer banditry causing the loss of a significant amount of much needed support. Detachements from the army have been sent in to put down these troublemakers but their actions are costing us both time and money."
anq.19.a: "Most unfortunate"

anq.20.t: "Bombing in Nanjing"
anq.20.d: "The capital was rocked by another act of insurgency today as a munitions depot was blown up by presumably Kuomintang terrorists. Whilst there is no hard proof that the socialist organisation was responsible, the attack has been spun by our government as a barbaric act designed to threaten Chinese sovereignty. Not only did the Kuomintang sell out to the imperialists in France, they are now also acting as their cronies in an attempt to bring down the legitimate Chinese government in an attempt to make the Century of Humiliation last for another 100 years."
anq.20.a: "At least Chen wasn't hurt"

# Nanjing Purge
anq.21.t: "Opening of the Military Tribunals"
anq.21.d: "Although we have taken over control in Nanjing, much of the old bureaucracy has been left intact with many of the commanders of our armies still harbouring questionable loyalties. To solve this and to make the Hanjian pay for the crimes they commited, [ANQ.GetLeader] has tasked general Yang Jingyu with the creation of a mobile military tribunal to eradicate possible disloyal factors. Although its aims are according to public broadcasts centered around ensuring a fair trial and not an attempt by Chen to rid himself of his enemies, many still wisely chose to flee the city under the cover of the night."
anq.21.a: "All will answer to the law"

anq.22.t: "Nanjing Trials: Military Command"
anq.22.d: "The Military command has grown steadily since the days of our rebellion in Anqing, bringing with it a whole slew of troubles. Forced by an ever growing military force and an ever greater pool of candidates to command portions of this force, some with more questionable loyalties but decent military credentials have been given a preferential treatment over our more dedicated supporters. Whilst this move has led us to final victory in the field, we now have a substantial number of these officers under our wings who as time goes on will likely abandon their current employer in the same way they did their former when they joined us.\n\nAs such we are presented with a choice: Ensure a loyal corps but with lacking experience and training or reward our new officers with a high enough prize that they would no longer need other sources of income."
anq.22.a: "Purge them!"
anq.22.b: "We will need them for our coming battles"

anq.23.t: "Nanjing Trials: Bureaucracy"
anq.23.d: "The vast majority of bureaucrats currently serving in our administration have served Sun before and have only switched allegiances after the fall of their capital. Whilst they do have the experience necessary to govern the massive swathes of land currently under our control, they do not share the same dedication to the cause as many of our own do. Furthermore many still have contacts with German businessmen and corporations who are likely to use these bureaucracts as a way to secure their investments and strike up the profits."
anq.23.a: "Purge them!"
anq.23.b: "We can still use them"

anq.24.t: "Handling the Nanjing crime bosses"
anq.24.d: "As in most Chinese cities, crime bosses and agents of various criminal organisations control massive networks that can make or break local governments. When Sun still ruled Nanjing, he coopted many of these and let them share in the profits so long as they left his assets alone, a move which was greatly appreciated by them and led to a spectacular increase in their wealth. Under Chen however, this privileged position is under serious threat as the governor has already announced his ambitions to rid the city of their influence.\n\nWell aware of this danger, a collection of crime boses have through shady backchannels proposed a deal to Chen. In exchange for a continuation of the laissez-faire policy of his predecessor, they will offer the support of their network, provide protection to some of our assets and allow us to utilise their agents to ship weapons into the nation."
anq.24.a: "We can come to an...arrangement"
anq.24.b: "We don't negotiate with criminals!"

# Replacing the Governors
anq.25.t: "The matter of Zhejiang"
anq.25.d1: "When our need was the highest and the united forces of the German lapdogs in Nanjing stood at our gates, the province of Zhejiang was the only one ready to stand by our side. Whilst not the most reliable of people, shown by his dedication to the cause in Fengtian and his ability to readily run into the arms of the Japanese Emperor, Chen Yi has proven his worth during the war and should be rewarded accordingly. For his service during the war, the man will accept nothing less than the continuation of his governorship and with no other candidates really able to match both his prestige or administrative qualities, it goes without saying that he will continue to serve us in this position for the wars to come."
anq.25.d2: "When our need was the highest and the united forces of the German lapdogs in Nanjing stood at our gates, the province of Zhejiang was the only one ready to stand by our side. Undercutting the treacherous Chen Yi, we found a dedicated ally in the form of his subordinate Shangguan Yunxiang. For his service during the war and to reward the great bravery the man showed, Chen has offered him the position of his former master and has officially appointed him governor of Zheijang."
anq.25.a: "It's only logical"

anq.26.t: "The matter of Jiangsu"
anq.26.d: "The former governor of Jiangsu province, Zheng Junyan, sadly did not see reason when the League collapsed and sided with our enemies in Nanjing. On top of that the man also failed horribly in stopping the spread of Yiguandao influence coming from the Shandong peninsula, key points that should normally immediately disqualify him.\n\nWe however don't have many options and with the limited size of our clique, the lack of qualified personnel has become quite apparent. Furthermore Zheng still has many connections in the province that could prove vital for our own control over the region and which would make quelling unrest both quicker and more efficient."
anq.26.a: "Re-appoint Zheng Junyan"
anq.26.b: "He had his chance and he blew it!"

anq.27.t: "Confirmation of Ma Yuren"
anq.27.d: "After the former governor of Jiangsu province was dismissed, a temporary military government was installed until a better candidate could be found. This man, in the shape of Ma Yuren, has now been found and has ceremoniously been confirmed in this position by Chen himself from his headquarters in Nanjing. Whether or not the man will be more successful in stopping the influence of the Yiguandao sect than his predecessor remains to be seen but it finally solves one of the few loose ends still remaining."
anq.27.a: "Good luck!"

anq.28.t: "The matter of Anhui"
anq.28.d: "The origin of our rebellion and the source of the brunt of Chen's support, the province of Anhui has been a tad neglected recently as its current governor - Chen himself - has been too preoccuppied with the smooth transition of his government to Nanjing. To solve this issue, some of the people in his entourage have suggested that he should withdraw from ths position and let someone else take over the day-to-day business of the province. Whilst this is a tough decision for Chen who feels a certain sadness that he would be forced to give up the province closest to his heart, it would greatly relieve the strain on the bureaucracy."
anq.28.a: "Chen remains in charge"
anq.28.b: "Install a puppet governor"

anq.29.t: "Deng Ruzhou requests an audience"
anq.29.d: "The governor of Jiangxi province in the previous government, Deng Ruzhou, has requested a meeting with Chen in Nanjing to discuss the future of his position. It is no secret that the man wants to regain control of the province and he has been trying to butter up Chen and his associates ever since the fall of his previous master, Qi Xieyuan. Placed in our custody since the fall of Nanchang earlier this year, the man still posseses an expansive network of contacts and organisations that could greatly enhance our capacity to restore order to the region. His loyalty to our government remains an iffy matter however as he might be just as happy to abandon us as he did Qi Xieyuan."
anq.29.a: "Re-appoint Deng Ruzhou"
anq.29.b: "The man is a traitor, we will deal with his province later"

anq.30.t: "The matter of Jiangxi"
anq.30.d: "Deng Ruzhou seems to have made good on his promises as order has been restored faster than expected to the province of Jiangxi. Benefitting from his agents on the ground and with the dedication shown by a man who knows his head is on the line, he has more than outdone himself in proving himself a capable and reliable governor for Jiangxi."
anq.30.a: "Splendid"

anq.31.t: "The matter of Jiangxi"
anq.31.d: "Jiangxi has remained a thorn in our side for quite some time as its previous governor in the shape of Deng Ruzhou was executed on the orders of Chen for siding with Qi Xieyuan during the war. A temporary military government was appointed to replace him but their efficiency in restoring order to the province has been less than stellar with ex-agents of Deng wreaking havoc and protests rocking the streets of Nanchang. Now, Chen has decided to firmly appoint a new governor and recall the military. A lack of qualified personnel for the job however has further complicated the matter as we had to scrape the barrel for a decent replacement."
anq.31.a: "That's less than ideal"

anq.32.t: "The matter of Fuijan"
anq.32.d: "After the fall of the League we took Zhou Yinren, Fujian’s former governor, into custody. Like many others, he is poised to be executed as a traitor for failing to root out the KMT and for participating on the side of Qi Xieyuan. However, whilst we may not want the man as he was all things considered a failure, we need his network if we wish to install a proper government. Thankfully, one of his former officers, Kong Zhaotong, has proven to be willing to take over. Kong also participated on the side of Qi Xieyuan but he was not their leader so we can overlook that and as such speed up the process of integration. If we are unwilling to overlook his crimes, we must install a new governor from among our own clique but he will have a hard time establishing proper control without the networks of his predecessor."
anq.32.a: "Appoint Kong Zhaotong"
anq.32.b: "Let's keep this one closer to the chest"

# Canal stuff
anq.33.t: "Construction of the Subei Canal"
anq.33.d: "The Northern Jiangsu Main Irrigation Canal or Subei Canal has been designed to provide a direct outlet to the sea for the waters of the Huai River, which discharged near the mouth of the Guan River. In the late 12th century the Huang He (Yellow River) changed its course to discharge south of the Shandong Peninsula, thus taking over the lower course of the Huai, which thereafter discharged into Hongze Lake and thence southward through a string of lakes and waterways into the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) near Yangzhou (Jiangsu). The Huang He remained in that course until the 1850s, when it again shifted to its present course north of the Shandong Peninsula. In the early 20th century the drainage of the Huai area had become a perennial problem.\n\nTo solve this issue a canal linking Hongze Lake with the sea has been ordered, designed not only as a channel for the discharge of floodwaters but also as the main artery of an extensive network of drainage and irrigation channels."
anq.33.a: "We commence at first light!"

# Happenings on the ground
anq.34.t: "Rampant War profiteering"
anq.34.d: "As our troops fight the battles to decide the future of China, criminals and bandits make sway in the scepter in the vast agrarian regions of the hinterland. Extorting the local population and holding whole cities ransom through their control on the supply of food, recent shortages have only aggrevated the situation leading to many calling for intervention by the army. Overstretched and barely capable of harvesting enough for themselves, this seem idle hope for the time being."
anq.34.a: "That's less ideal"

anq.35.t: "Revenue Tax Stamps"
anq.35.d: "An old but trusted way to generate extra revenue is the use of revenue tax stamps. These stamps which are required for a wide variety of legal documents have also been placed on more common goods such as alcohol, drugs, tobacco and a wide variety of other commodities.\n\nWith the treasury in a practically endless downwards spiral, the government has seen the need to increase the costs in an attempt to generate more revenue. Protests and civil discontent has broken out almost immediately after the announcement but there is little we can do to mediate their issues."
anq.35.a: "What about a stamp for the colour of your carrot?"

anq.36.t: "Illegal Opium-smuggling"
anq.36.d: "Whilst we have taken a decisive anti-opium standpoint as it is the tool of the Western imperialist to weaken the spirit of China, we have been unable to effectively eradicate its influence. Flowing in from the triads in the legation cities and from the Chinese hinterland, we remain stuck with a epidemic plaguing both commoner and general alike."
anq.36.a: "We are doing what we can!"

anq.37.t: "Creation of the Sixth Section"
anq.37.d: "With the enlargement of our territory so does the need for more efficient tools of control and repression arise. The Sixth Section has been the governments answer to this issue and consists of a network of hundreds of agents all across Tiaoyuan controlled China. Serving as a secret service and military police at the same time, these agents can be best compared to the Special Organisation deployed by the Ottoman and German Empires during the Weltkrieg who were responsible for liquidating possible dissident elements.\n\nA new organisation, especially one with such a wide array of powers, is sadly no stranger to corruption. Arbitrary arrests, paralysing corruption and the personal ambitions of its members have made the organisation into a tool feared by the local people. Attempts to stamp out this inherent problem have thusfar been unsuccessful but Chen is adamant that it is only a matter of time."
anq.37.a: "Will the common man ever catch his breath?"

anq.38.t: "The Salt Tax"
anq.38.d: "As in all other regions of China, salt is one of the most essential commodities in existence. This has given rise to many of the warlords raising exorbitant taxes on this product to ensure a steady revenue flow. The already heavily taxated peasants, coupled with severe food shortages originating from the near constant state of war, is almost at a breaking point. Nonetheless the gears of war keep turning and these expenses need funding. To 'solve' the issue, some in Chens entourage have suggested to lower the salt tax and get the revenue from other less essential commodities. Whilst the population would be grateful for this decision, it could potentially lead to severe shortages for our armed forces."
anq.38.a: "Lower the Salt Tax"
anq.38.b: "They should be content with the knowledge that it's all for the greater good"

anq.39.t: "Instatement of Transit Taxes"
anq.39.d: "Another ingenious way employed by the warlords of China to increase their revenue is the exploitation of Transit Taxes. These taxes which are raised based on the distance travelled by products from their source can reach exorbitant levels. This furthermore worsens the effects of shortages as well off regions won't export their products to those less fortuned out of fear of new taxation which would eradicate their profit margin. Should the product against all odds still reach its destination then the cost for the local people becomes so immense in an attempt to offset the tax burden that only those with a certain degree of wealth can afford the products."
anq.39.a: "All for the greater good!"

anq.40.t: "Tax on Pornography"
anq.40.d: "In another display of pure hypocrisy, some of the governors under our authority have instated a so called "Pornography Tax". This tax which is instated on all objects that depict women to protect the population from the temptations of the flesh has been received with outrage as within the walls of their grand estates, many of these governors and their associates spend their time whoring around in luxury and eating lobster from golden plates whilst on the streets the common Joe goes to sleep with an empty belly."
anq.40.a: "We shall send them a strongly worded letter!"

anq.41.t: "Soldiers Ambushed"
anq.41.d: "While on a regular patrol today, a group of soldiers were ambushed by a band of Kuomintang guerillas near [getanqattacklocationkmt], who quickly overpowered them and killed them. Further war parties have been sent out to track them down, with little success."
anq.41.a: "Damn"

anq.42.t: "Train Bombed in [getanqattacklocationkmt]"
anq.42.d: "While stopping to load more supplies onto a train in [getanqattacklocationkmt], multiple KMT agents snuck up to the train, and placed multiple bombs beneath it. When they went off, they completely destroyed the train, all the supplies, and the railway it was on. These terrorists have still not been tracked down, most likely having taken refuge in some of the peasants' houses."
anq.42.a: "When will it end?"

anq.43.t: "Officers Assassinated in [getanqattacklocationkmt]"
anq.43.d: "Tensions remain high in the South, as we are forced to send more and more troops and military police over to keep the region secure. During some training of new military police in [getanqattacklocationkmt], multiple Kuomintang agents infiltrated the barracks and shot multiple officers before being killed by the training troops. Following the death of those agents, multiple small bombs went off around the barracks, injuring three and costing lots to repair."
anq.43.a: "Damn them"

anq.44.t: "Factory Bombed in [getanqattacklocationkmt]"
anq.44.d: "Even though the factory in [getanqattacklocationkmt] was thought to be secure, it still fell victim to Kuomintang agents. Just around midnight, suddenly explosions echoed throughout the area, as a bomb were set off in the industrial district, damaging a factory. This is sure to be bad for business."
anq.44.a: "Damn them"

anq.45.t: "Gunfight in [getanqattacklocationcitykmt]"
anq.45.d: "Since the defeat of Chairman Wang Jingwei, tensions have remained high in [getanqattacklocationcitykmt]. The military presence and Kuomintang sympathies have remained very high. It was bound to boil over eventually, as it has today. A man, dressed as a regular peasant, was walking past a group of soldiers, when suddenly he drew a pistol and began to shoot at them. Though that man was killed quickly by the troops, it was in fact a distraction, as while the man was being killed, a large group of Kuomintang troops charged at the soldiers from the other side, and shot them all. As the day went on, more loyal soldiers joined the fighting, but were countered by more Kuomintang attacks. Dozens, maybe hundreds were killed, but thankfully, by the evening, the fighting had dwindled, and order was secured."
anq.45.a: "I'm sure it won't be the last"

anq.46.t: "Heavy Factory Bombing in [getanqattacklocationkmt]"
anq.46.d: "Though the KMT have been defeated on the field, their terror campaign rages on. Today, multiple bombs were set off in [getanqattacklocationkmt], centred around the main industrial complexes. Though there were no casualties, the factory has been very badly damaged, and will be unable to work for a while. From what the Kuomintang have said, we should probably get used to events like this, until we have rooted them out for good."
anq.46.a: "Damn them"

anq.47.t: "Battle in [getanqattacklocationcitykmt]"
anq.47.d: "[getanqattacklocationcitykmt], still a hotbed of Kuomintang activities, has faced a massive confrontation by the KMT. Around 400 Kuomintang troops went into the main square of the city, killed any police and soldiers in it, and quickly entrenched themselves with hastily put together fortifications. It took multiple pushes from hundreds of our own troops to be able to get back into the square and clear it of their guerillas, who quickly retreated back into the back streets, eventually harboured in the homes of many of the peasants living there. However, the officer leading the attack decided that these KMT must be rooted out of [getanqattacklocationcitykmt], and so sent out around 200 soldiers on a killing spree throughout the city. Hundreds of civilians were lined up and shot, and the houses of many were burned to the ground. When Chen heard of what some are calling the [getanqattacklocationcitykmt] Massacre, he had the officer arrested, but that was too little, too late."
anq.47.a: "The Quanzhou Massacre was the KMT's fault"

anq.48.t: "Mass Railway Bombings in the South"
anq.48.d: "Early today, multiple bombs were set off on a railway across the south of our territory. This was a very well organised attack, due to the amount of bombs spread out across multiple provinces. The attack has crippled the railway and will be felt throughout, greatly hurting our abilities to move troops and deal with the KMT, not to mention repair the damage. This is a disaster."
anq.48.a: "They must be dealt with"

anq.49.t: "Multiple Factory Bombings"
anq.49.d: "In the very early morning, multiple factories were bombed across the south in our country. The attacks were obviously coordinated closely and can have only come from the KMT. However, this time, there were already many workers present and dozens have been killed. This has been among the most brutal attacks the KMT have perpetrated."
anq.49.a: "This must end immediately"

anq.50.t: "KMT Headquarters Encirclement"
anq.50.d: "Months of tracking KMT activities, months of frustrating their efforts and months of planning have finally paid off. The new headquarters of the few terrorists that remained after Wang Jingwei's defeat has been located and completely razed to the ground. Now that we have worked against them for so long, their resources are completely exhausted and we can finally call the movement of the Left KMT destroyed. Their traitorous rebellion is no more."
anq.50.a: "Finally"

anq.51.t: "Opium Storage Warehouse in Xuzhou Destroyed"
anq.51.d: "Yiguandao followers, who are weirdly upset over opium use in Shandong and Jiangsu, have attacked and destroyed an illegal opium storage warehouse in Xuzhou. While having less opium isn't necessarily bad, they also killed everyone nearby. When soldiers arrived, they then continued to resist. We cannot let the Yiguandao religion continue to exist, as its followers cause too much chaos."
anq.51.a: "Barbarians"

anq.52.t: "Assault on Merchant Caravan in the North"
anq.52.d: "Yiguandao adherents have robbed a merchant caravan and killed dozens that were travelling along with the caravan train. Again, this shows the kind of violence and brutality adherents of that crazy religion are capable of. We must root out the strange delusions of these people or things will get worse."
anq.52.a: "Disgusting"

anq.53.t: "Soldiers attacked in Northern Village"
anq.53.d: "Soldiers on patrol in a northern village were attacked out of nowhere by a large band of dozens of homeless Yiguandao followers. These people, whose association with their religion has caused them to already lose everything, reverted to robbing and looting, which had caused the village to institute a patrol. But still the village wasn't safe, as nearly twenty have now been killed."
anq.53.a: "Those rats"

anq.54.t: "Town Invaded by Yiguandao Adherents"
anq.54.d: "Again the Yiguandao have caused massive chaos by invading and occupying an entire town. After the Yiguandao expelled all the former owners, soldiers were sent out to investigate, only for them to see the entire town barricaded. A large amount of soldiers were required to drive away the Yiguandao adherents before the village people could return home. Hundreds of Yiguandao were killed, and many soldiers too. Things are getting too crazy."
anq.54.a: "That is bad"

anq.55.t: "Yiguandao Fanatics Take Over Military Barracks"
anq.55.d: "In response to recent military actions against the Yiguandao, they have no chosen to attack and take over a military complex at the edge of a city in Jiangsu. Hundreds swarmed the barracks, killing many soldiers, after which barricaded themselves within. Soon, the city fell into chaos as looting became widespread. There are even reports of rapes. The military action required to take back the barracks was brutal, leaving nearly a hundred dead."
anq.55.a: "Things are getting worse"

anq.56.t: "Railway Occupied in Jiangsu"
anq.56.d: "The Yiguandao, again showing their anger at their treatment, have barricaded and occupied an entire railway, even destroying it at some parts. The action required to take it back left many dead. While before they mostly left the infrastructure alone, they have now begun to also attack the lifeblood of our country, on which much of our economy rests. The Yiguandao have proven to be a major threat."
anq.56.a: "Our railroads must be protected"

anq.57.t: "Massacre of Yiguandao Followers"
anq.57.d: "A stand-off between Yiguandao adherents and soldiers in a Yiguandao camp has escalated into a massacre. After the religious fanatics refused to leave, which they had been ordered by the soldiers as they were harassing nearby city folk, the soldiers began doing this by force. This lead to a counter-attack, which made the officer in charger decide to begin shooting. However, the shooting didn't stop until their was not a single Yiguandao follower left. Nearly a thousand are dead. While Chen Tiaoyuan has fired the officer for this excessive use of force, Yiguandao unrest is likely to only get worse."
anq.57.a: "This doesn't look good"

anq.58.t: "End of the Yiguandao"
anq.58.d: "The Yiguandao threat can finally said to be neutralized as the last sect was destroyed, its members thrown into jail. It took a lot of policies and military action, but now the northern countryside can finally be declared safe again. The damage that the rotten religion of the Yiguandao did to our country will long live in infamy. But now they are gone and we won't let them come back."
anq.58.a: "Finally peace"

anq.59.t: "Training Mission to Anqing"
anq.59.d: "The Anqing Clique is in dire need of additional troops to be able to meet the League. Should we send a large training mission to them? While victory for them would be an enormous boost to our influence within China, this training mission would constrain our own training abilities for at least a while."
anq.59.a: "Let's do it"
anq.59.b: "Not worth the cost"

anq.60.t: "Japanese Training Mission"
anq.60.d: "The Japanese, in their support of our efforts, have sent a large training mission to us, consisting of hundreds of drill sergeants and other officers. This should help us set up the large army necessary for a conflict with the League."
anq.60.a: "Great news"


anq.62.t: "Shandong is Defeated"
anq.62.d: "The vile regime in the Shandong Clique, which thought to expand its domain by attacking us when we were weakest, has been ousted. We now control the streets of Jinan and will make sure the memory of the former rulers of Shandong will disappear completely. However, we will have to soon decide what we will do with the region, as a continued military occupation is untenable."
anq.62.a: "Excellent"

anq.63.t: "Left Kuomintang is Defeated"
anq.63.d: "The radical leftist regime that was the Left Kuomintang has now been defeated in the field. They will have to retreat back to their hidden bases and won't be a serious military threat anytime soon, as we have crushed all of their forces."
anq.63.a: "Excellent"

anq.66.t: "Anqing Takes Control of Shandong"
anq.66.d: "The Anqing Clique has emerged victorious against both the Nanjing Clique.However, the Shandong Clique intervened in their conflict and in the resulting struggle, Anqing has occupied Shandong.\nHowever, Anqing has no claim to Shandong and as they recognize us as the rightful national government, they must be willing to hand the Shandong Province over to us."
anq.66.a: "Issue a request"
anq.66.b: "Let them have it, they'll owe us"

anq.67.t1: "Qing Offers Us Shandong"
anq.67.t2: "Qing Demands Shandong!"
anq.67.t3: "Fate of Shandong"
anq.67.d1: "The Qing government, knowing very well that we will owe them after this, offers us to remain the marshals of Shandong Province. For now, at least. We have no true claim to Shandong and the Qing government knows this. They will almost surely use this as leverage in future negotiations."
anq.67.d2: "We have recently begun a military occupation of Shandong after kicking out the vile regime there. However, we have no formal claim to Shandong and recognize our Qing benefactors as the legitimate government of China. They have reminded us of this and are now forcing us to hand over Shandong. Due to our current weak position, we have no choice but to accept and hand control over to them immediately. However, we will not forget that they were so eager to expand their dominion."
anq.67.a: "We agree"

anq.68.t: "Anqing Occupies Shandong"
anq.68.d: "Our ally, the Anqing Clique, has successfully seized control of the Shandong Province, which foolishly intervened in Anqing's war with the Nanjing Clique. However, the Anqing government has little justification to annex the region and recognizes us as the legitimate government. While we can't annex the region ourselves right now, as that would make Qing too wary, we can ask our allies to temporarily install an autonomous puppet government. Once the war begins, we can then proceed to take control of the region. Of course, our allies won't like doing this, but it's the best option."
anq.68.a: "Excellent"

anq.69.t: "Puppet Shandong"
anq.69.d: "Our benefactors, Fengtian and Japan, have pressured us to not hold on directly to the Shandong Province. While this is unfortunate, we understand it as we have no rightful claim to the province. Thankfully, they will allow us to install one of our own, Liu Heding, to rule the province for the time being. He will have some autonomy, but remains loyal to us."
anq.69.a: "It's the only option"

anq.70.t: "Shandong Threat"
anq.70.d1: "The vile regime in Shandong has intervened in the conflict and in the process, occupied parts of our core territory. Their army is not strong and the only reason they were able to do this was because the League was distracted by us and the Kuomintang. We must act immediately."
anq.70.d2: "The vile regime in Shandong may not have taken any territory, but they are unable to keep Yiguandao adherents or opium addicts from swarming into Jiangsu. Furthermore, with their current leadership they are likely to attack us very soon. We need to act soon."
anq.70.a: "We'll prepare"
anq.70.b: "Declare war"

anq.71.t: "Wuchang-Anqing Railway"
anq.71.d: "The Qing city of Wuchang and our own city of Anqing are booming. Furthermore, they are located quite strategically in our interiors. As a result, developing them and the surrounding areas together with our Qing benefactors could be very useful. This should start with an expanded railway that serves to connect Wuchang and Anqing with our own railway networks. First, the railway from Nanjing to Wuhu will be extended along the Yangtze to Anqing and then further to Wuchang, passing by Jiujiang, which is already connected to Nanchang and Hangzhou by a large railway. This will not only link Wuchang and Anqing, but also Nanjing and Wuchang, bypassing the need to go north through Xuzhou, then west and then south through Zhengzhou."
anq.71.a: "Begin the works"
anq.71.b: "It's not worth it"

anq.72.t: "Further Wuchang-Anqing Development"
anq.72.d: "The Wuchang-Anqing Railway has been completed! Using our experience from renovating the Longhai Railway and other projects, Anqing workers were able to turn the project into a massive success.\nHowever, railways are not enough as we also want to develop the region's industry, particularly its military industry. For that reason we should work with Qing enterprises and also Nanjing enterprises to develop new armament factories."
anq.72.a: "Make preparations"

anq.73.t: "The Beijing Liaison Council"
anq.73.d: "The Beijing Liaison Council is the official organization representing the interests of the Qing government. Its goal is eventually achieving the complete unification of China, starting with the merger of the states controlling the Northern and Southern Capitals. It is hard to say exactly how much funding and support they will receive from the Qing government, but we can be sure they will try to get what they want."
anq.73.a: "We'll wait and see"

anq.74.t: "Beijing Liaison Council Offices"
anq.74.d: "The Beijing Liaison Council has just opened their new office in Nanjing. The building is quite impressive and hard to miss, as it has been built in a classical Chinese Imperial style, right in the middle of the city and not far away from Chen Tiaoyuan's residence. They are definitely aiming big."
anq.74.a: "Impressive"

anq.75.t: "Banditry Issue"
anq.75.d: "While we might have cleared out the countryside from the most egregious troublemakers, bandits remain all too common on the roads, something which we can do little about as we have an enormous population, of which many are poor. However, while we may not be able to reduce the amount of bandits, we can protect trade and peaceful travellers. A problem is that our country is massive and our administration limited. The Chines Unity Council has approached us with a solution. If we allow Qing troops and local militias to cross the border to accompany travellers, that will take a lot of the pressure of our forces."
anq.75.a: "Good idea"
anq.75.b: "We won't let Qing troops in"

anq.76.t: "Safe Railways"
anq.76.d: "Not only our roads are dangerous, our railways can be too. Too often bandit gangs force trains to a halt and rob them blind. Since there is a lot of train traffic between our country and Qing, we should again allow Qing troops to remain with the trains in order to make guarding them much more efficient."
anq.76.a: "Good idea"
anq.76.b: "We won't let Qing troops in"

anq.77.t: "State of the Country"
anq.77.d: "While we have indeed brought together the Five Provinces and defeated the traitorous Nanjing Clique, this beautiful country no longer look the same. Instead, war and destruction has descended upon it and yes we have to admit we played a role in that. But now has come to the time to rebuild, to return the currently militarily occupied provinces back to civilian rule and make the Five Provinces truly whole. We will have to begin reconstruction and repair the broken countryside but also our industry, which now lies derelict as a result of Westerners fleeing and damage in the war. There's a lot of work to do."
anq.77.a: "We'll make this country whole again"

anq.78.t: "Kuomintang and Yiguandao"
anq.78.d: "We have neutralized the state threats to our north and south, but unfortunately the problems did not end there. The Kuomintang, though defeated in the field, have returned to their former bases hidden in Fujian. They will continue to wreak havoc if not dealt with swiftly.\nThe Yiguandao might no longer have Zhang Tianran, the fanatics continue trying to inspire a whole-scale religious revolution and are still heavily active within our territory. We will have to deal with them as well."
anq.78.a: "We'll root both movements out"

anq.79.t: "New Resource Exploitation"
anq.79.d: "Now that we have proper control over our territory, business and enterprise has begun to flourish, as has our industry. Mining companies and prospectors have reported that there may be a number of areas where additional minerals could be found, particularly iron and coal. However, these areas are tough to develop. Partnering with the Qing would be very beneficial in this case, as there are many Qing companies specialized in prospecting and developing resources."
anq.79.a: "Work together"
anq.79.b: "Do it on our own"

anq.80.t: "Mineral Rights"
anq.80.d: "Now that we have let the Qing in on our mineral project, they have begun making demands. In fact, they demand the rights to some of our most precious iron mines, namely those in Wuhu. Of course, we already said yes to this project and what they are offering might give us more mineral production than before, but do we really also need to give something away?"
anq.80.a: "Give them the resources in Wuhu"
anq.80.b: "Refuse them, they'll still help us"

anq.81.t: "Qing Court Jurisdiction"
anq.81.d: "The Beijing Liaison Council has made a new request of Chen's government. They say that in order to ease cooperation and be sure of the safety of citizens in either country, it should now be possible to be tried by Qing courts in the Anqing Clique as a Qing citizen. Saying yes would give quite a lot away, as all our citizens are technically also Qing citizens. It would mean that in the end it are the Qing courts that have supreme jurisdiction. However, if we say no, the Qing might be unwilling to lend valuable aid as they cannot be certain of the legal rights of their companies and citizens."
anq.81.a: "Give the Qing courts power"
anq.81.b: "Refuse them"

anq.82.t: "Qing Legal Rights" 
anq.82.d: "While we recently rebuffed the Qing request to allow supreme jurisdiction of their courts in our territory, they have demanded we guarantee the rights of their citizens and companies in a different way. We will have to make special definitions for them and afford them special rights that they would usually not have, as their judicial system is far more advanced than ours. This will most likely not fall well with our population."
anq.82.a: "Grant special rights"

anq.83.t: "Qing Businesses" 
anq.83.d: "Qing businesses are becoming more and more eager to invest also in our country. However, they are telling us they have often been rebuffed by local governments and hurdles set up on a local level. The Beijing Liaison Council is now lobbying that we set up systems so the businesses can circumvent these local governments and operate partially under Qing law. While this might stimulate investment, it carries the risk of making it hard for local companies to compete."
anq.83.a: "Accept the proposal"
anq.83.b: "We won't be unfair"

anq.84.t: "Qing Investments Soar" 
anq.84.d1: "While possibly dubious and very likely unfair, allowing Qing businesses to more easily do business in our resource-rich country has proven to be very beneficial as we have recently noticed a significant influx of investments from the north. It seems like cooperating does have its benefits."
anq.84.d2: "While we may not like the way it happened, we have to admit that the special considerations made for Qing enterprises have lead to a significant increase in their investments. Maybe we should have accepted the first time around."
anq.84.a: "Great news after all"

anq.85.t: "Qing Sends Another Offer" 
anq.85.d: "We had hoped that the Qing would not further pursue the issue, but alas, they did. The Beijing Liaison Council has voiced its very serious displeasure with our recent actions. They have also made another request, this time even more far-reaching. Not only do they want ways for Qing businesses to circumvent local governments, they also want us to establish a special committee representing their interests and give them a formal voice in government. They have also let us know that the consequences for refusal will be far more significant this time around."
anq.85.a: "We'll have to accept"
anq.85.b: "We still can't accept this"

anq.86.t: "Qing Punishes Businesses" 
anq.86.d: "Qing was not happy at all with our actions and as a result has implemented some temporary sanctions against comopanies operating in their territory. This will most likely hurt for a while."
anq.86.a: "That's not nice"

anq.87.t: "Puyi Visits Nanjing" 
anq.87.d: "The Emperor Puyi himself has visited Nanjing in a grand ceremony. Both Wu Peifu and Chen Tiaoyuan were present and publicly reaffirmed the north-south friendship and Anqing's continuing recognition of Qing's supremacy over China. While in the past decades, the people of China had trouble accepting that an Emperor reigned over them once more, acceptance is growing of His Majesty. How will Nanjing react to his presence?"
anq.87.a: "Nanjing welcomes him with open arms"
anq.87.b: "Protests litter the streets"

anq.88.t: "Beijing Liaison Council Reprimands Chen" 
anq.88.d: "Chen Tiaoyuan was called for an audience with the emissary of the Beijing Liaison Council, where he was reprimanded for his inadequate reaction to the protests when the Emperor visted Nanjing. The Council demands an apology as well as Anqing fully funding a project to build a large imperial palace for Puyi to visit in Nanjing."
anq.88.a: "We're sorry"
anq.88.b: "They can't ask that!"

anq.89.t: "Imperial Palace in Nanjing" 
anq.89.d: "The Beijing Liaison Council has relayed a message from the Emperor Puyi himself in which he requests permissio to construct a palace complex in Nanjing, so he can visit Nanjing more often and see his southern subjects. He says that due to our excellent handling of his visit, we will not have to pay anything ourselves."
anq.89.a: "It's not like we can say no"

anq.90.t: "Gathering of Intellectuals" 
anq.90.d: "At the initiative of the Beijing Liaison Council, various Chinese intellectuals from across the country, especially Nanjing and Beijing, have gathered and come to the same conclusion: China must unite now, rather than later. While they admit political differences might be difficult to overcome and that a Qing monarchy is not ideal, they say that reform can always come later. The Qing government has broadcasted this far and wide, saying that now is the time to unite. Chen Tiaoyuan, pressured by nationalist groups, has made the following statement:"
anq.90.a: "We will accelerate the process!"
anq.90.b: "Local autonomy trumps unification"

anq.91.t: "Qing Spreads Counter-Message" 
anq.91.d: "Unfortunately, Qing did not take Chen's words about autonomy very well. In fact, they felt they were so bad that they began an active messaging campaign throughout our country, throughout all of China, in fact. This messages mostly consisted of arguments 'debunking' Chen's words. It will be hard to prevent it from spreading."
anq.91.a: "Unfortunate"

anq.92.t: "Canal and River Authority" 
anq.92.d: "Our recent experience with developing dikes and our effort to complete the Subei Canal has led the Beijing Liaison Council to approach us for projects of a scale not limited to our current territory, but also in Qing lands. Do we accept their offer and cooperate with Qing to construct additional canals? If we do, first we will aid them. After they have finished, they will aid us with additional construction in Jinhua and Qiantang."
anq.92.a: "Yes, help them"
anq.92.b: "No we can't afford that"

anq.93.t: "Deepen Army Cooperation" 
anq.93.d1: "Now that we share common goals and are united with Qing in an alliance, it is time our armies begin working together more closely. The Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing has set up a new department known as the Army Cooperation Commission, which will work towards the goal of further integrating our military forces. The first steps have already been made. Now this Commission has come again to Chen and requested additional cooperation. Are we interested?"
anq.93.d2: "While last time we rebuffed the Army Cooperation Commission's request for additional cooperation with Qing, they have now come again asking if we want to further integrate our militaries. They say we need not worry and that the units will continue to answer to Chen Tiaoyuan primarily."
anq.93.a: "No, what we did is enough"
anq.93.b: "We can take the next steps"

anq.94.t: "Integrated Command Structure" 
anq.94.d: "The Army Cooperation Commission has presented its plan for deepening military ties between the Qing and Anqing armies. First of all they have proposed a limited integration of both countries' command structure. It especially involves introducing the more modernized Qing structure to the outdated warlordist armies of Anqing. While this may give Qing greater power over our armies, the benefits cannot be denied."
anq.94.a: "Yes, execute the integration"
anq.94.b: "No, we don't want to give away control"

anq.95.t: "Shared Officer Training" 
anq.95.d: "Recently, the Army Cooperation Commission has noticed that miscommunication is a frequent issue in the newly integrated command structures. To remedy this, and also to give Anqing officers a much needed tactical refresher, shared officer trainings provided for by Qing generals has been proposed. This should surely improve results further."
anq.95.a: "Good idea"
anq.95.b: "We don't want that"

anq.96.t: "Defensive Training" 
anq.96.d: "Now that there is some proper integration between our armies, it is time to test them in action. Large military exercises have been planned by the Army Cooperation Commission, focused primarily on defence against our enemy, Fengtian. This should hopefully better prepare our divisions for the grueling work of defending against enemy invasion."
anq.96.a: "Yes, participate in the exercises"
anq.96.b: "No, we won't participate"

anq.97.t: "Provisional Currency Backing" 
anq.97.d: "A while ago, we have set up a provisional currency that is shared throughout the Provinces. It has been a great success, improving trade and easing limitations to moving around the provinces. But now [getanqally] has approached us if we are willing to let them back the currency, with their central bank controlling it. The currency would remain separate and technically their central bank would only make decisions with their approval, in reality it would still amount to losing some control. However, [getanqally] backing the currency would make it significantly more stable and would also speed up adoption, further improving its use."
anq.97.a: "Yes, we'll let them back it"
anq.97.b: "No, we want full control"

anq.98.t: "KMT Threat"
anq.98.d: "The Kuomintang, who have caused such incredibly instability in the southern provinces, threaten to undo everything that makes China, China. Their 'National Revolution' threatens the entire being of our nation and most likely they are preparing to attack us as we speak. We must act soon or they might grow too strong for us to defeat!"
anq.98.a: "We'll prepare"
anq.98.b: "Declare war now!"

anq.99.t: "Wu Meets Chen"
anq.99.d: "Wu Peifu has come to meet Chen in a strictly personal meeting. Wu Peifu travelled with only a small entourage and it was clear that he was not here to propagandise Qing, but only to convince Chen. Wu appeared weary, but he also exerted an aura of power, one that even Chen could not match.\n\nThe meeting took no more than two hours, with Chen Tiaoyuan emerging from the room without a smile, sunken in thought. It quickly became clear that Chen had little retort to Wu's eloquence and arguments. China had to be united, and soon."
anq.99.a: "We can trust Wu"

anq.101.t: "Public Qing-Anqing Conference?"
anq.101.d1: "The Qing have approached us with the suggestion of holding a large public conference between our leaders in Nanjing. Puyi's visit to Nanjing was a major success and as such the Qing have asked if we again allow Puyi to visit. They also mentioned it would be nice to hold the event in Puyi's new palace in Nanjing. Now the question is, do we agree to hold the event?"
anq.101.d2: "The Qing have approached us with the suggestion of holding a large public conference between our leaders in Nanjing. Puyi's visit to Nanjing was a massive failure and as this time the Qing have decided to let Puyi stay home. They hope we can move past that unfortunate incident. They did mention his new palace in Nanjing could be used as the location. Now the question is, do we agree to hold the event?"
anq.101.a: "Yes, hold the event"
anq.101.b: "No, they'll have to stay home"

anq.102.t: "Outcome of the Conference"
anq.102.d: "The conference took multiple days. Tens of thousands of people visited to get a look at the national leaders of China. Wu Peifu and Chen Tiaoyuan seemed friendly and could frequently spotted shaking hands for a photograph. But now comes the big question, was any real progress made? Did Chen agree to new concessions to Wu?"
anq.102.a: "Unification is now a lot closer"
anq.102.b: "Progress was adequate"
anq.102.c: "Almost no progress was made"

anq.103.t: "Qing and the Dalu Yinhang Loans"
anq.103.d1: "The Qing have approached us with the following enticing offer: they say they will significantly relax the lending conditions placed upon us by the Dalu Yinhang loans, practically making the debt service so low it's almost free. In return, they do want us to make some additional steps on integration and future unification. Is this worth it?"
anq.103.d2: "The recent Dalu Yinhang loans we took out have provided much-needed capital for industrial expansion. Now the Qing approach us with an offer for additional loans, in similar vein to the ones we received from Dalu Yinhang. This requires us to make a decision. Are the loans worth the additional expectation that the Qing will certainly expect from us concerning unification?"
anq.103.a: "Yes, accept"
anq.103.b: "No, not worth it"

anq.104.t: "Wu Meets Anti-Concessionists"
anq.104.d: "The true leader of the Qing government, Wu Peifu, recently met with various leaders of the Anti-Concessions League. This news came to Chen's ears through one of the more pro-republican Anti-Concessionist leaders, who has been asking Chen to take a strong stance against Qing and proclaim an independent republic. Of course, Chen very well knows that he has neither the backing nor support required for such a move and has instead aligned much more closely with the Qing. Chen also forgives Wu Peifu, for he respects the man. Still, it is unfortunate Wu Peifu went behind his back."
anq.104.a: "Sneaky bastard"

anq.105.t: "Extra Aid from Qing"
anq.105.d: "Our cooperative approach to the rebuilding has already let to an influx of support from Qing, but much of this was handled by local governments and through smaller initiatives. However, their government has decided to also provide additional support, so reconstruction can be finished more swiftly and with less obstacles."

anq.113.t: "Qing Government Unsatisfied"
anq.113.d1: "Our Qing benefactors have let us know they are very much unsatisfied with how things are going in the relationship between us. While we have worked hard to cooperate and become closer, recently we have rebuffed a great deal of their proposals. They have begun using their agents against us and are now actively sabotaging us if we do not show remorse."
anq.113.d2: "While their anger has reduced somewhat recently, the Qing government continues being unsatisfied with our actions and we most definitely cannot afford to anger them more. We must be careful."
anq.113.a: "That's not good"

anq.114.t: "Escalated Qing Conflict"
anq.114.d1: "The conflict with our Qing benefactors has escalated as we have only angered them even more with our recent actions. Their sabotage has reached higher levels and it has become difficult to continue normal governance under these circumstances, partially because we have become so dependent on Qing. We need to do something soon."
anq.114.d2: "The Qing government is no longer furious, but the conflict between our governments remains very escalated. It is paramount we work on solving the problems between each other. We cannot afford a mistake."
anq.114.a: "This may not end well"

anq.115.t: "Qing Is Furious"
anq.115.d1: "Our Qing partners have let us know they are absolutely furious. The Anqing Clique has failed all of their expectations and has backtracked on multiple promises. Our government has become increasingly unstable as tensions mount."
anq.115.d2: "The Qing have lifted the major obstructions to our government and relations have normalised somewhat, but they continue to be extremely bad. It will still require a lot of effort from our side before things start improving again."
anq.115.a: "We should probably back down"

anq.116.t: "Qing Obstructs Our Government"
anq.116.d: "As the conflict has escalated even further, Qing has now begun to obstruct all elements of our governments. They have sent troops and agents right into our territory to disrupt our communications and they have begun approaching our governors if they maybe want to switch allegiance. Knowing them, they might even be willing. We need to take back control or accept Qing demands."
anq.116.a: "Placating them would be better"

anq.117.t: "Qing Relations Restored"
anq.117.d: "The conflict with the Qing has been resolved as they are no longer as angry as before. We must be careful not to let this happen again."
anq.117.a: "Back to normal"

anq.118.t: "Chen and the Anti-Concessionists"
anq.118.d: "Chen Tiaoyuan is the undisputed leader of the Anqing Clique. He rules supreme, with his friends and allies holding all positions of government. However, Chen does not have the personal relations nor the military backing to fully rule autocratically. No, the only reason he is where he is now is his support for the Anti-Concessionist Movement. This support was a gamble, one that paid off very well. But it also means that he is dependent on them for his political support. Should he lose it, his governors and military will easily find someone else.\n\nThat is why Chen must remain friendly with the movement. But this is no easy task, as it is fragmented, consisting of numerous organisations and coalitions. By far the biggest player is the Anti-Concessions League active in all of Eastern China but now particularly influential within the Anqing Clique. This League is itself divided, with two groups being the most prominent, namely the Republicans and the Monarchists. Both groups advocate a swift reunification of China, but only with their government of choice. Within the Republican group, there is also a small minority who support neither the [QIE.GetNameDef] nor the Fengtian government and instead advocate Chen proclaim himself a national leader.\n\nChen will have to balance many interests if his government is to succeed. On one hand he must keep the former military men and local leaders who underpin the rural order as friends, but this means collaborating with those who supported Sun Chuanfang's traitorous government. He must also make significant reforms to appease Anti-Concessionist radicals, which again comes with its own problems. But it is certain that with much of Eastern China under his control, no one will be able to ignore Chen."
anq.118.a: "Interesting."

anq.119.t: "Fengtian Considering Strategy"
anq.119.d: "Our benefactors, the Fengtian government, are considering how to alter their strategy now that they have us as their allies. They are preparing their Reclamation War against the Beijing government and must now decide how to use us in their plans. Chen Tiaoyuan would rather not wade into war, especially considering the damage done to the Five Provinces and the current weak state of the military. But knowing that he cannot immediately backtrack on his benefactors, the following will be proposed to Fengtian, as well as their benefactor, Japan: we will participate in the war, but wish very extensive reconstruction aid and generous backing from both the Fengtian government. Otherwise we cannot afford to fight a protracted war."
anq.119.a: "That sounds good"

anq.120.t: "Fengtian Waits"
anq.120.d: "The Fengtian government has decided that due to our current weak state"
anq.120.a: "That sounds good"

anq.121.t: "Fengtian and Japan Back Reconstruction"
anq.121.d: "The Fengtian government and Japan back a rapid reconstruction plan to get us back on our feet. This will allow us to move on Beijing relatively fast."
anq.121.a: "Great news"

anq.122.t: "Fengtian Wishes to Strike Soon"
anq.122.d: "The Fengtian government has decided that a swift strike against Beijing, to begin with months, is the best course of action. Of course, this means we would have to join another war, when we only just had one. [getanqshandongreclamation] Will we deny their strategy or accept it and hope for the best?"
anq.122.a: "This is a bad idea"
anq.122.b: "We can do it"
anq_shandong_participatesreclamation: "Shandong is would possibly also join on Fengtian's side, which give us an additional edge."

anq.123.t: "Fengtian Doesn't Change Strategy"
anq.123.d: "The Fengtian government has not been able to agree with us on a correct strategy, or its strategy was not backed by Japan. This means they will stick to their existing timeline."
anq.123.a: "That sounds good"

anq.124.t: "The Reconstruction Plan"
anq.124.d: "As agreed, the Fengtian government and Japan have committed significant resources to the Reconstruction Plan to get the Five Provinces whole again as fast as possible. They have also commited workers as well as troops to guard against possible Kuomintang and Yiguandao insurgencies. This should allow us to deal with our problems much faster than if we had been alone."
anq.124.a: "That sounds good"

anq.125.t: "18 Months Have Passed"
anq.125.d: "It's been a bit past 18 months after we secured the Five Provinces. The Fengtian government will expect we are ready now."
anq.125.a: "We'll prepare"

anq.126.t: "Fengtian Goes to War!"
anq.126.d: "Shanxi has convinced Fengtian to come to their immediate defense. Fengtian has decided that this was more important than honoring their commitment to the plan we decided upon to attack Qing. This is unacceptable!"

anq.127.t: "Grand Marshal's Proclamation"
anq.127.d: "[FNG.GetLeader] has made his great proclamation, announcing the start of the Reclamation War in a month's time. As agreed upon in our strategy, we will join the war with him. "

anq.128.t: "Grand Marshal's Proclamation"

anq.128.a: "We honor our commitment"

anq.129.t: "Zongchang Rules Shandong"
anq.129.d: "Zhang Zongchang, known also as the Dogmeat General and widely reviled and hated within China, rules Shandong. He is an old ally of Fengtian, meaning that we are, in a way, also allied. However, Zhang certainly has ambitions within the Five Provinces. So while for now his moves against the League make our war more easy, in the end we will have to deal with him somehow."
anq.129.a: "Okay"

anq.130.t: "No Intervention"
anq.130.d: "Fengtian has completely removed itself from the dispute between Shandong and us. This leaves us no other option that to immediately move on Shandong and deal with it ourselves. Words will not help when dealing with Zhang Zongchang."
anq.130.a: "War it is"

anq.131.t: "Talks Break Down"
anq.131.d: "Fengtian's mediation is failed and all diplomacy with Zhang has ceased. We must act now and move against him!"
anq.131.a: "War it is then"

anq.132.t: "A Deal is Made"
anq.132.d: "A deal has successfully been brokered with Shandong, meaning that at least until the defeat of the Kuomintang, we have peace in the north. But the situation has most definitely not been permanently resolved."
anq.132.a: "Temporary peace."

anq.133.t: "Diplomat Offers Deal"
anq.133.d1: "A lowly diplomat within our own bureacracy has taken it upon himself to prevent war between Shandong and us, believing that Fengtian's failed mediation was no reason to give up hope. The diplomat went out on a limb and approached Shandong, meeting with Zongchang at the risk of his life. But for once, Zongchang was reasonable and accepted the diplomat's proposal, which involves Shandong giving up all of its territory outside of Jiangsu for now. This does mean they will, temporarily, administer Jiangsu, which is one of the Five Provinces. But considering the Kuomintang are the more acute threat, this should be acceptable."
anq.133.d2: "A lowly diplomat within our own bureacracy has taken it upon himself to prevent war between Shandong and us, believing that Fengtian's failed mediation was no reason to give up hope. The diplomat went out on a limb and approached Shandong, meeting with Zongchang at the risk of his life. But for once, Zongchang was reasonable and accepted the diplomat's proposal, which involves Shandong holding on to the Jiangsu territory it acquired. This does mean they will, temporarily, administer at least parts of Jiangsu, one of the Five Provinces. But considering the Kuomintang are the more acute threat, this should be acceptable."
anq.133.d3: "A lowly diplomat within our own bureacracy has taken it upon himself to prevent war between Shandong and us, believing that Fengtian's failed mediation was no reason to give up hope. The diplomat went out on a limb and approached Shandong, meeting with Zongchang at the risk of his life. But for once, Zongchang was reasonable and accepted the diplomat's proposal, which involves us ceding Jiangsu to them. This does mean they will, temporarily, administer Jiangsu, one of the Five Provinces. But considering the Kuomintang are the more acute threat, this should be acceptable."
anq.133.d4: "A lowly diplomat within our own bureacracy has taken it upon himself to prevent war between Shandong and us, believing that Fengtian's failed mediation was no reason to give up hope. The diplomat went out on a limb and approached Shandong, meeting with Zongchang at the risk of his life. But for once, Zongchang was reasonable and accepted the diplomat's proposal, which involves us ceding only Xuhai, a part of Jiangsu, to them. This does mean they will, temporarily, administer a part of Jiangsu, one of the Five Provinces. But considering the Kuomintang are the more acute threat, this should be acceptable."
anq.133.a: "This deal is reasonable."
anq.133.b: "War is the better option."

anq.134.t: "Fengtian Backs Us"
anq.134.d: "The conflict with Shandong has escalated and led to war, but thankfully the Fengtian Government has decided to support us and not Zhang Zongchang."
anq.134.a: "Good."

anq.135.t: "Fengtian Backs Shandong"
anq.135.d: "The conflict with Shandong has escalated and led to war, but the Fengtian Government has decided to support Zhang Zongchang and not us!"
anq.135.a: "Good."

anq.136.t: "The Shandong Issue"
anq.136.d1: "Now that the war is over, we will have to deal with the Shandong issue once and for all. We will not accept any temporary deals, only permanent solutions. Currently, Zhang Zongchang is stuck with only Shandong, something he most likely finds himself much too important for. As a result, we can soon expect Fengtian to approach us with some kind of suggestion to cede parts of Jiangsu to him. This of course, is unacceptable. The unity of the Five Provinces must be preserved."
anq.136.d2: "Now that the war is over, we will have to deal with the Shandong issue once and for all. We will not accept any temporary deals, only permanent solutions. Currently, Jiangsu (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong) is split between us and Zhang Zongchang. This is unacceptable as Jiangsu should be united and under our control, as it is one of the Five Provinces. We will immediately lodge a diplomatic protest with Fengtian, who will hopefully back us against the madman that is Zhang Zongchang."
anq.136.d3: "Now that the war is over, we will have to deal with the Shandong issue once and for all. We will not accept any temporary deals, only permanent solutions. Currently, Jiangsu (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong) is under Zhang Zongchang's rule. This is unacceptable as Jiangsu belongs to our critical territory as it is one of the Five Provinces. We will immediately lodge a diplomatic protest with Fengtian, who will hopefully back us against the madman that is Zhang Zongchang."
anq.136.a: "Let's see what happens."

anq.138.a: "Tell them it is unacceptable."

anq.139.t: "Fengtian Talking to Japan"
anq.139.d: "We have learned from credible sources that Japan is seeking to push Fengtian to take the aggressive route to unifying China, leaving little room for democratisation or tolerating other leaders. Due to our current reliance on Japanese aid, it is not bad that Fengtian wishes to continue to have strong relations with Japan, but we should still ask them to be careful."

anq.146.a: "We won't join them."
anq.146.b: "Rejoin Fengtian."

anq.147.t: "Joining Fengtian"
anq.147.d: "Even though we may not participated fully and have been wary of Fengtian, they are still the national government. Furthermore, our government currently lacks serious legitimacy, meaning that it will look very bad if we delay Chinese unification or seek some other national government."
anq.147.a: "Rejoin Fengtian."

anq.148.t: "Fengtian Moves Against Us"
anq.148.d: "Still angry with our limited participation in the Reclamation War, Fengtian has decided to wait no longer and has begun mobilising its troops for a strike against us. We must either plea with them to resolve this peacefully through expedited integration, or we must ready for war."
anq.148.a: "Make a plea."
anq.148.b: "Ready for war."

anq.153.a: "Tough."

anq.154.t: "Faster Integration?"
anq.154.d: "Our government enjoys good credibility and we can plausibly deny Fengtian advances for at least a while. However, some Anti-Concessionist leaders and people within our government have told Chen that there is no reason to delay. The faster China unites, the better, even if this means losing autonomy."
anq.154.a: "Yes."

anq.161.t: "Ask Fengtian for Help"
anq.161.d: "The Fengtian government, our benefactors, hope that we will join them in their Reclamation War against Beijing. Chen Tiaoyuan would rather not wade into war, especially considering the damage done to the Five Provinces and the current weak state of the military. Hopefully, they will want to aid us in reconstructing our territory. If they agree, we might consider joining their Reclamation War."
anq.161.a: "Make the request."

anq.162.t: "Fengtian Commits Aid"
anq.162.d1: "The Fengtian government has decided that it will indeed help us! This is excellent news, as this will allow us to recover much faster. However, they will also have greater expectations of us. What is unfortunate is that Japan did not agree to aid us."
anq.162.d2: "The Fengtian government and Japan have decided that they will indeed help us! This is excellent news, as this will allow us to recover much faster. However, they will also have greater expectations of us."
anq.162.a: "Great."

anq.163.t: "Reconstruction Cooperation Begins"
anq.163.d1: "The aid that the Fengtian government has committed towards us has begun arriving, meaning that we can now truly begin reconstruction."
anq.163.d2: "The aid that the Fengtian government and Japan have committed towards us has begun arriving, meaning that we can now truly begin reconstruction."
anq.163.a: "Very good."

anq.164.t: "Fengtian Denies Aid"
anq.164.d: "Fengtian has denied us reconstruction aid, meaning that we must now do it alone."
anq.164.a: "Bad news."

anq.171.t: "The Reclamation War"
anq.171.d1: "The Shenyang Conference, held by Fengtian, has just concluded. They have, at our request, adopted a strong Anti-Concessionist stance. This is great news and will make it much easier for us to justify joining their Reclamation War against Beijing. However, we must also consider other factors if we wish to truly make the correct decision."
anq.171.d2: "The Shenyang Conference, held by Fengtian, has just concluded. They have blatantly disregarded our suggestions and have refused to adopt a firm Anti-Concessionist stance. However, before we refuse to join their alliance outright, we must weigh other factors. It is possible that joining the Reclamation War is the right decision after all."
anq.171.d3: "The Shenyang Conference, held by Fengtian, has just concluded. Time is of the essence, as the conflict against Qing has already begun. We must swiftly come to a decision if we wish to have a say in the future of China."
anq.171.a: "Much to discuss."

anq.172.t: "Fengtian and Reconstruction"
anq.172.d1: "The Fengtian government was quick to come to our aid when we required help with reconstruction following our victory in the League War. This has helped us recover faster and should positively influence our willingness to join them in the Reclamation War."
anq.172.d2: "The Fengtian government was quick to come to our aid when we required help with reconstruction following our victory in the League War. They even convinced Japan to help us as well. This has helped us recover faster and should positively influence our willingness to join them in the Reclamation War."
anq.172.d3: "The Fengtian government did not come to our aid when we needed them to, deciding to not expend capital and commit to helping us reconstruct. This has severely damaged our trust in them."
anq.172.a: "Indeed."

anq.173.t: "Conference with Shandong"
anq.173.d1: "If we want to have a good measure of the competence of the Fengtian government when it comes to negotations, which will almost certainly be necessary for a successful unification of China and proper unification with us, we can look to their efforts mediating the Shandong War Conference. They completely failed here, as they were not even able to engineer a temporary peace. That does not bode well for the future."
anq.173.d2: "If we want to have a good measure of the competence of the Fengtian government when it comes to negotations, which will almost certainly be necessary for a successful unification of China and proper unification with us, we can look to their efforts mediating the Shandong War Conference. They were able to engineer a temporary compromise, which allowed us to focus on other threats first, but unfortunately they then messed up and failed to give a good permanent solution."
anq.173.d3: "If we want to have a good measure of the competence of the Fengtian government when it comes to negotations, which will almost certainly be necessary for a successful unification of China and proper unification with us, we can look to their efforts mediating the Shandong War Conference. Fengtian failed at first, but thankfully we were able to strike an independent deal with Shandong and eventually Fengtian did lead the way in providing a permanent solution."
anq.173.d4: "If we want to have a good measure of the competence of the Fengtian government when it comes to negotations, which will almost certainly be necessary for a successful unification of China and proper unification with us, we can look to their efforts mediating the Shandong War Conference. Fengtian was able to defuse the situation and successfully engineer both a temporary compromise and a permanent solution."
anq.173.a: "Indeed."

anq.165.t: "Anti-Concessionists and the [QIE.GetNameDef]"
anq.165.d1: "Our republican stance has led to increased support from the Republican faction of the Anti-Concessions League. To the north, the Qing still rule, even though Puyi is little more than Wu Peifu's puppet. We must continue emphasising our republican ideals in order to the keep the Anti-Concessions League as our ally."
anq.165.d2: "The Qing are no longer ruled by Wu Peifu's Zhili Clique. Instead, Puyi was restored to greater power in a coup known as the Manchu Restoration. This has greatly increased anti-monarchist sentiment among Anti-Concessionists within our country and cemented our pro-republican reputation. The Monarchist faction of the Anti-Concessions League, which used to emphasize the fact that the Qing government was a harmonious balance between the Zhili Clique and the Manchu Qing dynasty, have seen their arguments weaken with the destruction of the Zhili Clique. Of course, at the same time some staunchly pro-Manchu Monarchists have gained support, but they are a minority. With the Manchus holding greater power and remaining unpopular, our popularity has increased. Increased calls have been made for us to join the Reclamation War with Fengtian against the Qing government."
anq.165.d3: "Much of our argument in siding with the Fengtian government was based on republican ideals. The 1911 Xinhai Revolution, which was wildly popular, was inherently republican and anti-monarchist and our reiteration of its ideals has increased the legitimacy of our denial of Qing being the true government of China. However, following an attempted coup, Wu Peifu has consolidated control over the government and ousted Puyi from the throne, declaring a republic in the process. This is bad news for us, as this undermines much of the fundamental premise of our support for Fengtian. The Republican faction of the Anti-Concessions League, always the most popular, has now seen members change their support from Fengtian for Wu Peifu's Zhili Clique. They have called on us to do the same, but unfortunately considering Fengtian's support for us in the League War, we are unable to do this. This will hurt our credibility."
anq.165.a: "Alright."
anq.165.b: "Great."
anq.165.c: "That's not good."

anq.166.t: "Anti-Concessions League Calls for Reclamation"
anq.166.d1: "The Anti-Concessions League, the largest Anti-Concessionist organization in China, was originally divided on whether it would support our intention to join our ally Fengtian in the Reclamation War. However, the recent Manchu Restoration in Qing has marginalized the Monarchists and emboldened the Republicans, who see it as an example of why even a 'constitutional monarchy' would not work. Even though they do not like Fengtian much,"
anq.166.d2: "The Anti-Concessions League, the largest Anti-Concessionist organization in China, was originally divided on whether it would support our intention to join our ally Fengtian in the Reclamation War. However, the break in relations between Fengtian and Japan have caused the Republicans who supported Fengtian to gain significant support, as the Japanese issue was the main reason why the League hadn't fully embraced our partnership with Fengtian. The Republican faction is much emboldened now and have called for our government to join Fengtian and end the Qing regime."
anq.166.d3: "The Anti-Concessions League, the largest Anti-Concessionist organization in China, was originally divided on whether it would support our intention to join our ally Fengtian in the Reclamation War. However, our government has shown that it is not just any warlord government but has truly made effort to achieve proper legitimacy and credibility. As a result, because of our partnership with Fengtian, Republican Anti-Concessionists have now been swayed to our side and have come out in support of us participating in the Reclamation War, believing that we will make sure Fengtian behaves."
anq.166.a: "Good."

anq.167.t: "Anti-Concessions League Rallies Against Reclamation"
anq.167.d1: "Recent events, particularly the Republican takeover of Beijing led by Wu Peifu, have caused great turmoil among Anti-Concessionists. Many believe that even though Wu Peifu cooperates with the Germans, he is still a principled man, much more so than Zhang Zuolin, who sells out to the Japanese instead. As a result, they have actively called for us to forgo participation in the Reclamation War. While we cannot afford to break ties with the Fengtian government due to their support of us, we can try to take a less active role in the conflict."
anq.167.d2: "Recent events that have led to a thorough increase in Japanese influence over Fengtian, have led to outrage within the Anti-Concessions League. Even some of the most ardent republicans have withdrawn their support for the Fengtian government, saying that we must instead seek a neutral position in Fengtian's desired Reclamation War against the [QIE.GetNameDef]. While we cannot afford to break ties with the Fengtian government due to their support of us, we can indeed try to take a less active role in the conflict."
anq.167.a: "We don't want to make them angry."

anq.168.t: "Anti-Concessions League Divided on Reclamation"
anq.168.d: "The various factions within the Anti-Concessions League remain divided on the question of whether we should participate in the Reclamation War. Our partnership with Fengtian basically requires it, but we could also choose for a less active role."
anq.168.a: "We can make our own decision."

anq.169.t: "Japanese Influence in Fengtian"
anq.169.d1: "We have not only the Anti-Concessions League to worry about when it comes to Japanese influence. It also concerns our own interests. High Japanese influence would also mean our autonomy would be under question more quickly, as the Japanese would most likely prefer us to be eliminated, in part due to our Anti-Concessionist stance. And right now, Japan has an extremely dominant position in the Fengtian economy and political sphere. This makes us very uncomfortable to join their Reclamation War."
anq.169.d2: "We have not only the Anti-Concessions League to worry about when it comes to Japanese influence. It also concerns our own interests. High Japanese influence would also mean our autonomy would be under question more quickly, as the Japanese would most likely prefer us to be eliminated, in part due to our Anti-Concessionist stance. And right now, Japan has a powerful position in the Fengtian economy and political sphere. This makes us seriously uncomfortable to join their Reclamation War."
anq.169.d3: "We have not only the Anti-Concessions League to worry about when it comes to Japanese influence. It also concerns our own interests. High Japanese influence would also mean our autonomy would be under question more quickly, as the Japanese would most likely prefer us to be eliminated, in part due to our Anti-Concessionist stance. And right now, Japan has a significant position in the Fengtian economy and political sphere. This makes us a bit uncomfortable to join their Reclamation War."
anq.169.d4: "We have not only the Anti-Concessions League to worry about when it comes to Japanese influence. It also concerns our own interests. High Japanese influence would also mean our autonomy would be under question more quickly, as the Japanese would most likely prefer us to be eliminated, in part due to our Anti-Concessionist stance. Thankfully, Japanese influence within Fengtian is currently somewhat limited, assuaging our fears."
anq.169.d5: "Fengtian no longer has ties to Japan, meaning they are a much more independent and credible government. This makes us much more eager to join their Reclamation War, purely from our own perspective. It also means Fengtian is more reliant on our support, as they no longer have a powerful benefactor"
anq.169.a: "This is important to consider."

anq.170.t: "Our Japanese Reliance"
anq.170.d1: "In order to determine our course of action, we must look not only at the negatives of Japanese relations with Fengtian, but also at their benefits, as they allow us to enjoy considerable economic advantages. In fact, we have increased Japanese reliance to such a level that losing it could hurt our economy quite a lot. As a result it is probably better to join Fengtian and not risk losing Japanese support."
anq.170.d2: "In order to determine our course of action, we must look not only at the negatives of Japanese relations with Fengtian, but also at their benefits, as they allow us to enjoy considerable economic advantages. We do not have very high reliance, but there are still already significant benefits we receive from cooperation with Japan. We do not want to risk losing those."
anq.170.d3: "In order to determine our course of action, we must look not only at the negatives of Japanese relations with Fengtian, but also at their benefits, as they allow us to enjoy considerable economic advantages. However, our reliance on Japanese support is not so large that this will have any real impact, so we can safely ignore this."
anq.170.a: "We'll take this into account."

anq.174.t: "Relations with Fengtian"
anq.174.d1: "The final factor we should weigh in order to make a decision whether to join Fengtian's Reclamation War is our current opinion with them. Currently, relations with them are very strong and joining the Reclamation War will surely keep it that way."
anq.174.d2: "The final factor we should weigh in order to make a decision whether to join Fengtian's Reclamation War is our current opinion with them. Currently, relations with them are good, which means we should probably join their war."
anq.174.d3: "The final factor we should weigh in order to make a decision whether to join Fengtian's Reclamation War is our current opinion with them. Currently, relations with them are relatively low, but not so low we should think about abandoning the Reclamation War."
anq.174.d4: "The final factor we should weigh in order to make a decision whether to join Fengtian's Reclamation War is our current opinion with them. Currently, relations with them are very limited, meaning we probably shouldn't join their Reclamation War."
anq.174.a: "Alright."

anq.175.t: "Reclamation Decision"
anq.175.d1: "There are many factors that have made it abundantly clear that committing to Fengtian's Reclamation War to capture Beijing is the right choice. As a result, no matter the credibility of our government, abandoning Reclamation would mean political suicide. This leaves us only one true choice, commit to come to Fengtian's aid when they go to war against Beijing."
anq.175.d2: "Allmost all the factors are pointing in the same direction, namely that we should join Fengtian's Reclamation War. But of course, almost all means there are at least some factors which allow a way out. Because it's a fact that there is little thirst for war among our population, especially one against their fellow Chinese people. However, our current government thanks its legitimacy in large part to our stated desire to unify China under Fengtian rule. Abandoning Fengtian would also mean abandoning unification.[getanqreclamationdecisioncredenough2]"
anq.175.d3: "Most factors point towards joining the Reclamation War, but we cannot ignore a significant amount of factors also indicating it might be a bad idea. However, our current government thanks its legitimacy in large part to our stated desire to unify China under Fengtian rule. Abandoning Fengtian would also mean abandoning unification. [getanqreclamationdecisioncredenough3]"
anq.175.d4: "The factors in favor and against joining the Reclamation War are roughly balanced. However, our current government thanks its legitimacy in large part to our stated desire to unify China under Fengtian rule. Abandoning Fengtian would also mean abandoning unification.  [getanqreclamationdecisioncredenough4]"
anq.175.d5: "The factors are against us joining the Reclamation War. However, our current government thanks its legitimacy in large part to our stated desire to unify China under Fengtian rule. Abandoning Fengtian would also mean abandoning unification. [getanqreclamationdecisioncredenough5]"
anq.175.d6: "There are many factors pushing us against joining the Reclamation War. However, our current government thanks its legitimacy in large part to our stated desire to unify China under Fengtian rule. Abandoning Fengtian would also mean abandoning unification.  [getanqreclamationdecisioncredenough6]"
anq.175.a: "Commit to the Reclamation War."
anq.175.b: "Abandon Fengtian."
anq_reclamation_credibility_not_enough: "\nUnfortunately, we have too little credibility to stand alone as a separate national government and thus depend too much upon Fengtian. As a result, we cannot afford to lose their support and are forced to join their Reclamation War."
anq_reclamation_credibility_enough: "\nThankfully, our government has, also using the arguments against the Reclamation War, enough credibility to stand separately from the Fengtian government and decline to participate. This will force us to either make our own claim to national leadership, or seek another party to support. "

anq.176.t: "Shandong Handover to Fengtian"
anq.176.d: "As agreed upon when we seized Shandong Province, now that the conflict with the [QIE.GetNameDef] has started, we must now hand over Shandong Province to Fengtian, as we have no justifiable claims on the region."
anq.176.a: "Very well."

anq.177.t: "Fengtian Cuts Ties"
anq.177.d1: "Due to our decision to not participate in Fengtian's Reclamation War to capture Beijing, they have cut ties with us and labeled us as just another warlord government. This is unfortunate but expected. We must now rely upon ourself to see China's future secured and we will have to watch what happens in both the north and south very closely."
anq.177.d2: ""Due to our decision to not participate in Fengtian's Reclamation War to capture Beijing, they have cut ties with us and labeled us as just another warlord government. They have also canceled all remaining reconstruction aid. This is unfortunate but expected. We must now rely upon ourself to see China's future secured and we will have to watch what happens in both the north and south very closely."
anq.177.a: "It is how it is."

anq.178.t: "Fengtian Tolerates Non-Participation"
anq.178.d1: "Fengtian is, as expected, very unhappy with our decision not to participate in their Reclamation War to capture Beijing. However, as they are in dire need of allies and all possible help, Fengtian has decided to not cut ties with us and to continue to tolerate our presence among their group of allies. This allows us to still reap some of the benefits of cooperation with them and the Japanese. However, as the Reclamation War progresses, they will most likely cut us out anyway if we do not participate. We can decide to not agree to this and cut ties ourselves, fully distancing from the Fengtian government. The latter will give us some increased standing as we had already announced we would not be supporting Fengtian. [getanqcanannexshandong]"
anq.178.d2: "Fengtian is, as expected, very unhappy with our decision not to participate in their Reclamation War to capture Beijing.

anq.178.a: "Alright."
anq.178.b: "Cut ties anyway."
anq_can_annex_shandong: "If we cut ties, we can also take full control of our Shandong puppet."

anq.179.t: "Keeping Shandong"
anq.179.d: "Since we have decided to no longer fight together with Fengtian and no longer recognize them as the national government of China, there is no reason to keep Shandong as an autonomous province and hand it over to Fengtian later on. We should recall Liu Heding and assume full control over the province."
anq.179.a: "Great."


anq.180.t: "End of Destruction"
anq.180.d: "Through many months of hard work and targeted programs, we have repaired the majority of our industry and fixed the worst destruction in the cities and countryside. While there is still a deeper damage that has yet to heal, at least most of the material value has been restored and our country can again function properly."
anq.180.a: "Great."


anq.181.t: "Full Civilian Government"
anq.181.d: "We have transfered the last of the Five Provinces from direct military occupation to more civilian governments. All the governors have been installed and the bureaucracy has returned to normal. All of these governments are loyal to our leader, Chen Tiaoyuan. Nanjing is also firmly under our control. We now truly control all of the Five Provinces."
anq.181.a: "Fantastic."


anq.182.t: "Healed Once More"
anq.182.d: "Under Chen Tiaoyuan's exemplary leadership, the Five Provinces have defeated Kuomintang insurgents and Yiguandao fanatics. The damage done by the brutal League War has been fixed and new civilian governments, different from the corrupt warlords that ruled before, have been installed in all regions. Chen Tiaoyuan has succeeded in bringing together his allies to make the League much greater than it was before. Because before it suffered under the German yoke, but now it stands free and in support of a great, independent China."
anq.182.a: "Onward!"

anq.183.t: "The Grand Marshal's Proclamation"
anq.183.d: "Grand leader of the Fengtian Government, Zhang Zuolin, has made a bold proclamation indicating a Fengtian invasion of the [QIE.GetName] is imminent. We must prepare for war immediately."
anq.183.a: "Good news."

anq.213.t: "Recognising the Fengtian Government"
anq.213.d: "Now that the League War has concluded in our favor, we have no other choice but to make up our end of the bargain with Fengtian. We shalll have to move forward and officially announce to the world that we recognize Fengtian as the official national government of China. This will prove to be a major shift within China and almost certainly upsets the careful balance further that kept the peace between the various states up until the League Collapse."
anq.213.a: "Make the declaration."

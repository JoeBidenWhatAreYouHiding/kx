### Events ###
transbaikalia.1.t: "Dealing With the Current Troubles"
transbaikalia.1.d: "Ataman Semyenov finally has the Chita region at his disposal and can restore order in it with a firm hand.\n\nThe main problems at the moment are rampant crime, Siberian regionalists and socialist partisans. To solve all the pressing problems, it is necessary to make a primary decision: to convene a People's Regional Council, or to leave the region in a state of martial law, so that nothing prevents the ataman from pursuing his policy."
transbaikalia.1.a: "Form the advisory council."
transbaikalia.1.b: "Maintain the martial law."

transbaikalia.2.t: "[FROM.GetName] Forms the Regional Council"
transbaikalia.2.d: "The recent news from the wild Transbaikalia are the following. Ataman Semyenov has established the People's Regional Council, an adivory body that is made up to deal with the current issues in the region, though without the approval of Semyenov, the laws have no legal force."
transbaikalia.2.a: "If this will help him..."
transbaikalia.2.b: "Demand he gets rid of the council."

transbaikalia.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Disbanding the Council"
transbaikalia.3.d: "Central Government in Vladivostok has demanded that we immediately disband the Council we have just established as this decision was made without permission of the Supreme Ruler."
transbaikalia.3.a: "Well..."
transbaikalia.3.b: "Who they are to tell us what to do?"

transbaikalia.4.t: "[FROM.GetName] Disbands the Council"
transbaikalia.4.d: "As demanded earlier, the People's Regional Council in Transbaikalia has been disbanded by Ataman Semyenov, bringing back the martial law. At least, they are still loyal to us."
transbaikalia.4.a: "Great."

transbaikalia.5.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Disband the Council"
transbaikalia.5.d: "Despite our demands, Ataman Semyenov refused to disband the council. Although this would normally be regarded as a betrayal and refusal to follow the order of the Supreme Ruler, in the conditions of martial law in Transbaikalia, it seems that we have no choice but to accept the Transbaikal Council as a fact."
transbaikalia.5.a: "This raises suspicions."

transbaikalia.6.t: "Semyenov's Appeal to the Buryat-Mongolian Nation"
transbaikalia.6.d: "Today, Ataman Semyenov, the governor of the Transbaikal Military District, appealed to all citizens who identify themselves as Buryat-Mongols with promises to soon give them broad autonomy and grant legislative and executive rights to Burnatskom, if they agree to join our state peacefully\n\nThe Buryat-Mongolian Autonomy will be officially established on the territory of Verkhneudinsk and in the surrounding lands. Nevertheless, as long as martial law is in effect in the region, all supreme power will belong to Ataman Semyenov."
transbaikalia.6.a: "We hope they accept this peacefully."

transbaikalia.7.t: "Appeal From [FROM.GetLeader]"
transbaikalia.7.d: "Ataman [FROM.GetLeader] of the [FROM.GetName] has appealed to our nation, promising our great deal of autonomy and legislative and executive rights, if we agree to recognize him as our Supreme Leader."
transbaikalia.7.a: "Instead offer him a defensive pact."
transbaikalia.7.b: "Bow our heads, we need to survive."
transbaikalia.7.c: "Our future lies with Mongolia, not Cossacks!"

transbaikalia.8.t: "[FROM.GetName] Suggests Equal Status"
transbaikalia.8.d: "Surprisingly, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has instead offered us a defensive pact against the socialists. This means they will retain even greater amount of autonomy, staying as an independent nation."
transbaikalia.8.a: "Refuse their pathetic 'offer'."
transbaikalia.8.b: "That's better than nothing, still."

transbaikalia.9.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
transbaikalia.9.d: "[FROM.GetName] has officially refused our generous offer, as they wish to stay completely independent."
transbaikalia.9.a: "We will forcefully install a loyal regime there."
transbaikalia.9.b: "We should focus on other matters."

transbaikalia.10.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
transbaikalia.10.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our terms."
transbaikalia.10.a: "Great!"

transbaikalia.11.t: "Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Host"
transbaikalia.11.d: "Ataman Semyenov decided to create a new Cossack Host, which should become a loyal part of the Far-Eastern Cossack Host, consisting of Buryat-Mongols and controlled by the Transbaikal Cossacks. Such an initiative, according to the ataman, will contribute to the creation of a strong army, relying on horses, that have served the Buryat-Mongols faithfully for centuries."
transbaikalia.11.a: "Great!"

transbaikalia.16.t: "Sacred War Against Bolshevism"
transbaikalia.16.d: "Now that we have more or less strengthened the power in Transbaikalia, it is time to fight the main enemy. There is no one whom Ataman Semyonov would hate more than the Bolsheviks. Having been one of the first to declare war on Lenin, Semyenov has long established himself as a militant fighter against everything Bolshevik. In Transbaikalia, the so-called partisan army of the NRA is most active. Partisan cells are everywhere, irritating the people and enslaving their minds with fairy tales about communism. The most prominent of them are the so-called Godless - near-proletkultist accomplices of Satan, destroying churches and killing priests, as well as disturbing peaceful Buddhists. It is necessary to destroy this Bolshevik scum as soon as possible!"
transbaikalia.16.a: "Catch these outlaws!"

transbaikalia.17.t: "Preparation of Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.17.d: "Yemelyan Yaroslavsky - the leader of the Union of the Militant Godless is none other than an ordinary fatman hiding under a false name and afraid to appear in the light, while crowds of his fanatics shed blood for false ideas. He is a coward and a traitor to the Motherland, who tries to decompose it at the expense of others. At the expense of people who could faithfully serve the Motherland. But we have some good news. Our informant reported about a meeting of the Union of the Militant Godless in Chita, where Yaroslavsky himself is rumored to be. It is necessary to carefully prepare an operation to eliminate this fat scum and destroy his best fighters. So this God-defying movement will fail.\n\nWe have several options for how to arrange a raid. The first is to blow up the building where the meeting will be held. Despite the fact that in this way we cannot avoid civilian victims, this guarantees us success in the fact that Yaroslavsky will not only be destroyed, he will honorably burn in hell for his sins. The second option is not to blow up the building, but to send a detachment of armed Cossack formations there, which will arrest the Godless, and they will be brought to an honest trial. The third option is to arrange an ambush, and wait until the Godless leave the meeting and then arrest them."
transbaikalia.17.a: "Blow up the building!"
transbaikalia.17.b: "Send Cossack Divisions."
transbaikalia.17.c: "Set up an ambush."

transbaikalia.18.t: "Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.18.d: "The demolition of the building turned into a complete disaster! It was successfully blown up, becoming a burial ground for several civilians, however, there was no meeting in the building. The informant who gave us the information turned out to be a traitor and set us up. While we were dealing with the blown-up house, we received information that the Militant Godless mobilized NRA partisans and captured some villages and towns in the Chita province. The partisans are approaching Chita, and we need to urgently organize a defense."
transbaikalia.18.a: "Protect the Chita approaches"
transbaikalia.18.b: "Defend the city center"

transbaikalia.19.t: "Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.19.d: "The Cossack divisions sent by us broke into the building, but did not find any traces of the presence of the Godless. It seems that we were tricked. Moreover, the informant turned out to be a traitor who distracted our attention. While we were focusing on the building, the Godless mobilized partisan detachments and moved to Chita. We can only send the distracted divisions to the city center, where they will have time to meet with the NRA."
transbaikalia.19.a: "Send them to the city center!"

transbaikalia.20.t: "Manhunt Near Chita"
transbaikalia.20.d: "Our ambush revealed that no meeting was actually held in the building. The informant was exposed and we successfully learned about the impending coup. The partisan cells near Chita were quickly discovered and destroyed as a result of a short battle. Moreover, the informant-traitor told about the real shelter of Yaroslavsky, to which a Cossack patrol arrived in order to arrest the sinner. He really was there, and was caught red-handed. By order of Ataman Semyenov, he will be executed in the coming days."
transbaikalia.20.a: "Finally we will deal with them."

transbaikalia.21.t: "Defending Chita"
transbaikalia.21.d: "The Cossack troops defending the approaches to Chita managed to withstand the onslaught of the partisans and successfully destroyed them. The city was saved. The informant who betrayed us, under torture, confessed to where Yaroslavsky's real refuge is located. A Cossack patrol arrived there in order to arrest the sinner. He really was there, and was caught red-handed. By order of Ataman Semyenov, he will be executed in the coming days."
transbaikalia.21.a: "Finally we will deal with them."

transbaikalia.22.t: "'Chita Slaughter'"
transbaikalia.22.d: "The Cossack detachments did not manage to get into the center of Chita in time. Already on the approaches to the city, they were ambushed by partisans who struck from the rear and destroyed one of our best divisions. The city was left virtually unprotected, and soon partisan detachments captured it. The situation in the Military District has become like anarchy, and according to rumors, Ataman Semyenov is preparing for a retaliatory strike, mobilizing the best Cossacks in Nerchinsk. However, with Chita under the control of Atheists, to whom factory workers have openly begun to join, our chances of success are extremely small."
transbaikalia.22.a: "Wait for them in Nerchinsk."
transbaikalia.22.b: "Quickly mobilize and try to recapture Chita."

transbaikalia.23.t: "Transbaikal Civil War"
transbaikalia.23.d: "A civil war has almost begun in Transbaikalia. With Chita under the control of the Godless and the NRA, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky himself came out of the shadows, declaring the victory of socialism in the Chita Labor Republic. Addressing the masses from the balcony of the Chita State Council, Yaroslavsky promised the citizens the immediate nationalization of resources and de-cossackization, as well as the liberation of the local population from the centuries-old slavery of capitalism. The industrial city, a major transport hub, was under the control of the partisans, and we were cut off from Vladivostok.\n\nHaving prepared the defense of Nerchinsk, Ataman Semyenov did not take into account only the fact that many Buryat-Mongols were completely unable to fight and were not ready for a civil war to break out in their region. Their political apathy led to the fact that many simply went home, not wanting to fight for the ataman, who had his own goals that did not meet the interests of the Buryat-Mongols.\n\nTogether with the NRA offensive on Nerchinsk, Ataman Semyenov was faced with a choice - to try to escape to wild Mongolia and stay there, surrendering Nerchinsk to the socialists, or to give the last fight. A fight that can be lost."
transbaikalia.23.a: "Escape. There's no way we can succeed."
transbaikalia.23.b: "We will never surrender to some zealots."

transbaikalia.24.t: "The Last Fight of Ataman Semyenov"
transbaikalia.24.d: "A civil war has almost begun in Transbaikalia. With Chita under the control of the Godless and the NRA, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky himself came out of the shadows, declaring the victory of socialism in the Chita Labor Republic. Addressing the masses from the balcony of the Chita State Council, Yaroslavsky promised the citizens the immediate nationalization of resources and de-cossackization, as well as the liberation of the local population from the centuries-old slavery of capitalism. The industrial city, a major transport hub, was under the control of the partisans, and we were cut off from Vladivostok.\n\nIn an unsuccessful attempt to capture Chita back, Ataman Semyenov made the main mistake, relying on the forces of the Buryat-Mongols. Many refused to go into battle for the ataman and deserted, leaving the Cossacks alone with the red partisans.\n\nThe Cossack troops were defeated, and their leader, Ataman Semyenov, was captured and arrested by the partisans. A few hours later, he was taken to Chita under escort, where he finally saw his enemy in the face. Yaroslavsky, surrounded by armed partisans, ordered the hanging of the enemy of the socialists as a war criminal on the main Chita Square, taking revenge on him for the long-term oppression of the socialists in the Far East.\n\nWith the death of Semyenov, the last minutes of the life of the Military District came, which was now under the full control of the NRA and the Godless."
transbaikalia.24.a: "Long live the NRA!"

transbaikalia.25.t: "The Last Fight of Ataman Semyenov"
transbaikalia.25.d: "Deprived of the support of the local population, the Cossacks under the leadership of Semyenov tried in vain to protect Nerchinsk from the onslaught of the red partisans. Unfortunately for them, the NRA managed to break through the Cossack defenses and take the city.\n\nThe Cossack troops were defeated, and their leader, Ataman Semyenov, was captured and arrested by the partisans. A few hours later, he was taken to Chita under escort, where he finally saw his enemy in the face. Yaroslavsky, surrounded by armed partisans, ordered the hanging of the enemy of the socialists as a war criminal on the main Chita Square, taking revenge on him for the long-term oppression of the socialists in the Far East.\n\nWith the death of Semyenov, the last minutes of the life of the Military District came, which was now under the full control of the NRA and the Godless."
transbaikalia.25.a: "Long live the NRA!"

transbaikalia.26.t: "Cossacks Arrive in Urga"
transbaikalia.26.d: "Having surrendered Transbaikalia to the red partisans and the Militant Godless, Ataman Semyenov and his henchmen arrived in Urga with the intention of finding refuge here or even joining the active army. Their help would be useful to us, but the fact that they treacherously deserted may have some influence on the decision of [ROOT.GetLeader]"
transbaikalia.26.a: "Let them serve us now!"
transbaikalia.26.b: "They can have a refuge here, but they won't fight."
transbaikalia.26.c: "Extradite them to [TRM.GetName]"

transbaikalia.27.t: "Proclamation of the Transbaikal People's Socialist Republic"
transbaikalia.27.d: "With the whole of Transbaikalia finally under the control of the NRA and the Militant Godless, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky made an appeal to the citizens about the creation of the Transbaikal People's Socialist Republic.\n\nIn the near future, the Bureau for National Minorities will be formed, as well as the Supreme Council of the Republic. However, it is already obvious to everyone that Transbaikalia has fallen under the onslaught of the Reds, and will only further strengthen its power."
transbaikalia.27.a: "The New Order in Transbaikalia."

transbaikalia.28.t: "The Red Banner Over Transbaikalia"
transbaikalia.28.d: "The red banner of the Godless and partisans of the NRA hung over the wild Transbaikalia. The traitor Semyonov could not restore order in the Military District, but only doomed it to chaos and destruction. It remains only for us to bring troops into the region before it is too late and defeat the shameful Godless."
transbaikalia.28.a: "We are not ready to fight them..."
transbaikalia.28.b: "Onwards!"

transbaikalia.29.t: "[FROM.GetName] Extradites Traitorous Cossacks"
transbaikalia.29.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government decided that they should extradite traitorous Cossacks, that deserted the battlefield and left Transbaikalia in the hands of traitors."
transbaikalia.29.a: "That's good. They will be executed for treason."

transbaikalia.30.t: "The Nerchinsk Truce?"
transbaikalia.30.d: "for several months now, we have been unsuccessfully trying to capture Transbaikalia, which does not surrender into the hands of the Siberian Army. It seems that their influence in the region is too great and our army cannot cope with it. Perhaps we should conclude a truce and gain strength."
transbaikalia.30.a: "We won't negotiate with the Reds!"
transbaikalia.30.b: "We shall conquer them later."

transbaikalia.31.t: "The Nerchinsk Truce"
transbaikalia.31.d: "The Siberian army could not defeat us, and now they cowardly offer to sign a truce. Despite the fact that our army is ready to go through the entire Far East and capture Vladivostok, perhaps we should agree to gain strength."
transbaikalia.31.a: "March towards Vladivostok!"
transbaikalia.31.b: "A truce is much needed."

transbaikalia.32.t: "Treaty of Friendship with [FROM.GetName]?"
transbaikalia.32.d: "Our dear friend, ataman Semyenov, leader of the [FROM.GetName] has approached us with a friendly request to sign the treaty of friendship. This will allow us to have closer ties."
transbaikalia.32.a: "Sure!"
transbaikalia.32.b: "We are now on our own."

transbaikalia.33.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Refused the Alliance!"
transbaikalia.33.d: "It seems that [FROM.GetLeader] has refused the alliance, betraying Ataman Semyenov. We cannot trust him anymore and it seems that he's becoming more insane and dangerous, than ever."
transbaikalia.33.a: "Better secure our borders with [MON.GetName]"

transbaikalia.47.t: "An Offer From [FROM.GetName]"
transbaikalia.47.d: "Ataman Semyenov, the military governor of Transbaikalia, sent a delegation of Cossacks on a secret visit to Tokyo, where they met with the head of our government and offered to sign a certain agreement. It is brought to our attention that Ataman Semyenov is gathering his forces to march out of Transbaikalia and declare war on Kolchak. His plans include the creation of a full-fledged White Cossack state in the Russian Far East, the existence of which would be conditioned by Japanese patronage in exchange for simplified customs duties and gold. In return, the Japanese Empire undertakes to attack the Transamur in the event of the beginning of the offensive of the Transbaikal Cossacks."
transbaikalia.47.a: "We will definitely support him."
transbaikalia.47.b: "Supporting [TRM.GetLeader] is more profitable."

transbaikalia.48.t: "Secret Pact with Japan"
transbaikalia.48.d: "Rumors about Semyonov's cooperation with the Japanese have long been plowing through the expanses of the Far East, and this story stretches back to the times of the Civil War, when Semyonov relied on Japanese help in the fight against the Bolsheviks. Now, we can be sure of Japanese support, since a secret pact was signed in Tokyo a couple of days ago on a joint attack on Transamur."
transbaikalia.48.a: "Great!"

transbaikalia.49.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Sign the Pact"
transbaikalia.49.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has traitorously refused to sign the secret pact with us. It seems that they have made a bet on the government in Vladivostok, which means that they will not support us in our conquests."
transbaikalia.49.a: "Very bad."

transbaikalia.50.t: "Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Republic"
transbaikalia.50.d: "By the creation of the Buryat-Mongolian Cossack Republic, Semyenov means the endowment of its citizens with the rights and part of the duties of the Cossacks. Thus, the Buryat-Mongols will be able to use the traditional right of the Cossacks to own land. Forming the Buryat-Mongolian identity as a Cossack, Semyenov not only gives the Buryat-Mongols broad autonomy, but also offers them a successful option for implementing their national state. If the project is implemented, the Buryat-Mongols will most likely forever become part of a large Cossack family, but they will also receive their own developed armed forces and support from other atamans."
transbaikalia.50.a: "This is a stupid idea."
transbaikalia.50.b: "This is what Buryat-Mongols need."
transbaikalia.50.c: "This is what we need."

transbaikalia.51.t: "Intervention in Transamur?"
transbaikalia.51.d: "With [TRM.GetName] and [BRY.GetName] clearly in a state of war, we are now uncertain if we should help Ataman Semyenov with his conquests or simply stay away out of this. While the latter choice can result in loss of influence over both countries, at least we will stay out of Russian internal disputes."
transbaikalia.51.a: "We never break our promises."
transbaikalia.51.b: "We'd better stay out of this."

transbaikalia.52.t: "Japan Refused To Intervene!"
transbaikalia.52.d: "Despite our agreements, the cowardly government of Japan has refused to intervene in our war with [TRM.GetName]. After hearing this, Ataman Semyenov was furios to know about treason of his former allies. He will most likely keep it in mind, when he will cooperate with the Japanese in the future."
transbaikalia.52.a: "We have to rely on ourselves this time."

## The Militant Godless & NRA ##
atheists.1.t: "The SVB Consolidates Power!"
atheists.1.d: "Transbaikalia fell under the onslaught of the Union of the Militant Godless and the partisan army of the NRA. Long live socialism! Every day the resistance of the local population is fading, because it is useless. The power is in the hands of the Transbaikal Soviet of Workers and Peasants, and only it will create history from now on. It is time to start active actions to destroy religious fanaticism."
atheists.1.a: "We have things to do."

atheists.2.t: "Orthodox Church Banned"
atheists.2.d: "Finally, the most important of our decrees was implemented - a complete ban on the Orthodox Church. Religion is the opium of the people, which has poisoned so many lives, has thrown our country back several centuries in development. Religion is a regression, and from now on millions of beggars, whose lives have been ruined by faith, will not pray, but work for the good of the Motherland.\n\nAccording to the decree, the new ban applies to the entire territory of the former Russian Empire within the borders of 1914. Failure to comply with the decree will mean death for the churches and priests who disobeyed."
atheists.2.a: "Wake up, people!"

atheists.3.t: "The Great Destruction of Churches"
atheists.3.d: "A state campaign has already begun to destroy churches-previously shelters for the poor and a purse for fat priests. From now on, the poor will work and get paid, and not sit around praying for a good time.\n\nFrom now on, all Orthodox churches in Transbaikalia will be destroyed at the state level. The whole of Russia is next in line. Only by explosions will we achieve justice for all the humiliated."
atheists.3.a: "Burn in hell!"

atheists.4.t: "Mass Murders of Priests"
atheists.4.d: "Although Transbaikalia is not so rich in priests, they still exist, and before they have time to throw off their shoddy robes, they will be killed. By arming the working people with rifles, we will give them a goal - to kill every priest without trial. Until there is not a single priest left."
atheists.4.a: "Red Terror at its best."

atheists.5.t: "Forced Secularization"
atheists.5.d: "Transbaikalia is slowly being cleansed of the filth of religion. Buddhism and Orthodoxy have almost sunk into oblivion. Mass shootings of priests, the destruction of churches led to a total fear of the population before the Transbaikal Council. Now, instead of prayer services, people are working, because the liberation of our motherland is still ahead."
atheists.5.a: "Glory to Soviet!"

We should move to emulate their doctrine as masters of winter and tundra warfare. We too shall rise to be masters of these wastes."

TRB_Rally_The_Masses: "Rally the Masses"
TRB_Rally_The_Masses_desc: "For any war to be won, the masses must be behind the nation and the army lest the whole nation collapse. As we move to build up our military, we must also instill a deep sense of patriotism and respect within the populace towards our men in uniform. Who knows, this may even get more to volunteer for our ever hungry armed forces."

TRB_Improve_Artillery: "Improve Our Artillery"
TRB_Improve_Artillery_desc: "Much of our heavy guns and canons are relics of the Weltkrieg or are museum pieces ransacked and pushed into service out of necessity. By studying more modern designs from Russia and Japan, we shall modernize our artillery corps so that we may rain down heavy ordinance upon any foe."

TRB_Increase_Military_Spendings: "Increase Military Spendings"
TRB_Increase_Military_Spendings_desc: "Our military-industrial complex is an ever growing and ever hungry machine. In order to fuel this rampant growth, we must allocate more of the national budget towards the armed forces. Though other sectors of our society may take a slight hit, it is worth it for national security."

TRB_Modernized_Cavalry: "Modernized Cavalry"
TRB_Modernized_Cavalry_desc: "Though troops on horseback are the basis of our martial tradition, they have little place in a modern army. Instead, their tactics and traditions shall be translated to new, modernized divisions utilizing the latest armored vehicles in order to get similar results. The cavalry of the past shall fold before the cavalry of the future!"

TRB_Mechanization: "Mechanization of Cossacks"
TRB_Mechanization_desc: "In order to improve the combat effectiveness of our recruited cossack warriors, we shall replace many of their horses with mechanized and motorized vehicles. Though this might cut their speed and their flexibility on rough terrain or when without supply, they shall be far more effective at fighting in this modern style of warfare that has become the dominant form of combat."

TRB_Socialist_Army: "People's Revolutionary Army"
TRB_Socialist_Army_desc: "In order to safeguard the revolution, the People’s Revolutionary Army shall rise to take the place of the disorganized militias that have served our movement thus far. This professional army shall take time to develop and train, but it shall be worth it as a guarantee of national sovereignty."

TRB_From_Militia_To_Army: "From Militia to Army"
TRB_From_Militia_To_Army_desc: "We must transform the disorganized yet experienced rabble that makes up our militias into an effective, modern, and professional military. Through total mobilization and thorough training, we shall forge the PRA into the stalwart sword and shield that defends both our revolution and the Buryat proletariat without fail."

TRB_Conscript_Buryats: "Conscript Buryats"
TRB_Conscript_Buryats_desc: "In order to fill the ranks of our growing military, conscription must go into effect, and who better to recruit for our army than our own people. The Buryat people are hardy, and shall form a sturdy, reliable foundation for our manpower pool."

TRB_Centralized_Command: "Centralized Command"
TRB_Centralized_Command_desc: "In order to better defend the revolution and to better command our quickly-growing army, our administration has pushed to create a centralized command hierarchy directly keyed into party leadership. With our government and our military staff working in concert with one another, there shall be no room for mistakes and no room for errors caused by mismanagement or lack of attention, for from this lofty hierarchy, our generals and commanders shall see and control it all."

TRB_Reorganize_Armament_Production: "Reorganize Armament Production"
TRB_Reorganize_Armament_Production_desc: "Every man in our army needs a rifle, and we cannot keep requisitioning them from scavenging operations or from the dusty old storerooms of foreign powers. We must create a domestic gunsmithing industry here in Buryatia so that no soldier within our army ever needs for a rifle or some ammunition to defend the nation with."

TRB_Dedicated_Artillery_Batalions: "Dedicated Artillery Battalions"
TRB_Dedicated_Artillery_Batalions_desc: "In order to effectively fight in modern war, combined arms tactics must be utilized, and the easiest additional ‘arm’ to give our infantry is heavy artillery. Independent artillery battalions giving support to our troops shall aid any future war effort greatly. We shall split the skies and rain hell down upon our enemies with these newly created or purchased gun batteries, showing all who dare to mess with Buryatia that we have the means to defend ourselves, so if any dare assault our bastion, they best be ready to face the fire of our heavy guns."

TRB_Encircled_By_Enemies: "Encircled by Enemies"
TRB_Encircled_By_Enemies_desc: "We are surrounded on all sides by enemies of the revolution who only seek to consume and devour our nation and our people. We must fortify and dig-in, never faltering in our watch as the rest of the world eyes us with hungry looks and greedy ambition. Buryatia shall stand for a thousand years, and our dedicated armies shall ensure this reality!"


TRB_Militant_Atheists_In_Power: "The Militant Godless in Power"
TRB_Militant_Atheists_In_Power_desc: "The ‘Soyuz Voinstvuyuschikh Bezbozhnikov,’ or Union of The Militant Godless, is led by Yemelyan Yaroslavsky and his band of Proletkult-inspired militant Socialists that all agree on one thing: tradition and religion have only served to shackle and ensnare the Buryat people. Claiming Buddhism to be only a tool of oppression and control, the SVB has villainized both the Buddhist clergy and the laity, and seek to rid Buryatia entirely of this wretched influence while also rapidly militarizing the nation to serve as a barrier to keep our revolution safe. Through fire and blood, Buryatias new future will be won, and the great Yaroslavsky will guide us there."

TRB_Transbaikal_Cossacks: "Transbaikal Cossacks in Power"
TRB_Transbaikal_Cossacks_desc: "Headed by their infamous Ataman, the Transbaikal Cossack Host under Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyenov have established a new Cossack State out here in the frozen paradise of Buryatia. With Ataman Semyenov at the helm, Buryatia shall become the heart of new great and growing Host; one that shall ride across the Far-East in pursuit of the freedom that life as a cossack brings and the great arcadian idyll our nomadic lifestyle strives for."

TRB_Spread_Atheist_Propaganda: "Spread Atheist Propaganda"
TRB_Spread_Atheist_Propaganda_desc: "Religion is no mere ‘opiate’; it is a cancer that has infected human society for thousands of years and it must be uprooted once and for all. We know this truth, but many in our nation do not. We will rectify this lapse in logic with a state-run propaganda campaign aimed at educating the masses about this simple truth. Buddhism, as well as any other religion, is a plague, and plagues must be eradicated."

TRB_Nationalize_Means_Of_Production: "Nationalize the Means of Production"
TRB_Nationalize_Means_Of_Production_desc: "In order to more efficiently and more reliably run the state and its economy, the SVB has moved to nationalize all aspects of the nation. Every farm, every factory, all mineral wealth, all resources - every last facet of the economy - shall be directly controlled by the state while tacitly ‘owned’ by the proletariat. With this push towards progress, our infantile industrial sector and wider economy should get the jumpstart they need, and with our infallible administration at the wheel, we shall drive Buryatia towards prosperity."

TRB_Ban_The_Church: "Ban the Church"
TRB_Ban_The_Church_desc: "The Buddhist Church, as well as the smaller Orthodox Church, of Buryatia is a devilish and conniving organization of clergymen hiding behind the shield of religion as they live corrupt, decadent, and sinful lives. Accumulating wealth, land, and power while giving nothing in return but hollow lies and fairytales, these institutions must be gutted, and the first step in doing so is to completely ban their operation. In order to remove an infestation, first the source must be isolated before the extermination can begin."

TRB_Every_Hand_A_Rifle: "Every Hand a Rifle"
TRB_Every_Hand_A_Rifle_desc: "Conflict is the true aspiration of man - not religious fulfilment or diluted peace. Conflict is not only natural, it is guaranteed, for the wolves already circle our Buryatia as they eye up our people and our wealth like table scraps needing to be devoured. In order to defend our revolution and our new state, every adult citizen in the nation will be issued a rifle, ammunition, and be rudimentarily taught how to aim, fire, and maintain said rifle. Upon reaching adulthood, every growing member of our society shall be drilled in the same way, so that even in future generations, our populace is always ready to defend itself."

TRB_Destroy_Churches: "Destroy Churches"
TRB_Destroy_Churches_desc: "With the black heart of this pious infection now isolated as all religious institutions across Buryatia have been banned, the next step in the extermination can finally take place. Every single church, temple, monastery, shrine, religious statue or art piece, and any other religious idolatry or monument shall be destroyed. Through flame, searing lead, and explosive ordinance, each and every single bastion of this old ‘opiate’ shall be annihilated with nary a trace left behind. Buryatia will be cleansed of this irrationality totally and completely, no matter the cost. "

TRB_Every_Priest_A_Bullet: "Every Priest a Bullet"
TRB_Every_Priest_A_Bullet_desc: "While every layman’s hand deserves an able rifle, every priest, monk, or other clergyman deserves nothing more than a searing bullet and a quick death. These servants of Buddha or God or whoever else shall all be brought to the sword, for only swift and bloody violence and exact justice from these spineless cretens. Though they may be sheltered and protected by some, any of those foolish enough to harbor these traitors shall be treated as such, for nothing will get in the way of Buryatia’s cleansing."

TRB_Fight_Buddhists: "Combat Militant Buddhists"
TRB_Fight_Buddhists_desc: "Across the nation, many orders of Buddhists practice a militant derivative of the normally peaceful religion, and as such our dogmatic foes have many veteran and well trained warriors at their disposal who are willing to die protecting their spiritual masters. We shall grant them this wish, and slaughter these foolish defenders as well, for not even their martial prowess and years of intense training can stop a simple piece of lead from splitting their skulls."

TRB_Forced_Secularisation: "Forced Secularization"
TRB_Forced_Secularisation_desc: "With monasteries and shrines engulfed in flames across the nation, and with the blood of the ‘holy’ flowing through most streets, secularization at the end of a gun barrel can finally be brought to Buryatia. The last shreds of religious taint are finally to be scrubbed from our society for good, and our atheistic dream shall finally come to fruition. Buryatia shall soon be fully cleansed of the vile plague that is religion, and once freed from these shackles, our people shall finally be free."

TRB_Militant_Proletkult: "Militant Proletkult"
TRB_Militant_Proletkult_desc: "Mirroring the Proletkult movement preached by some fringe Socialists within Russia’s surviving Bolsheviks, a new and purely Buryat Proletkult will be established in our own nation. Prioritizing military perfectionism, total mobilization of the masses, state-enforced atheism, and the promotion of a new Buryat culture dominated by modernist Socialism, this organization shall guide Buryatia into its new crimson dawn."

TRB_Liberate_The_Far_East: "Liberate the Far-East"
TRB_Liberate_The_Far_East_desc: "Though we may have saved ourselves here in Buryatia, the rest of the proletariat within the Far-East still cry out as they languish in their reactionary-forged chains under pompous monarchies and false republics. We must burst forth from Buryatia and ride into this frozen expanse in a new hell-bent on bringing our brand of militant and atheistic Socialism to the masses. Under our guidance, the Far-East shall achieve its peak ideal as we ride to raise the Red Star across Siberia."

TRB_Support_Buryat_Autonomy: "Support Buryat Autonomy"
TRB_Support_Buryat_Autonomy_desc: "Though cossacks reign supreme here in Buryatia now, that is no excuse to oppress these people who have long been our allies. The Buryat-Mongols shall be given their long-promised autonomy, and be spared from the raids of our men. They shall be protected by our Host and nurtured, allowed to rule their own as they see fit and allowed to ride across and live on the lands that they have done so on for centuries before our arrival."

TRB_Create_Buryat_Cossack_Host: "Create Buryat Cossack Host"
TRB_Create_Buryat_Cossack_Host_desc: "To foster closer cooperation between our cossacks and the Buryats, Ataman Semyenov has called for the creation of a true Buryat Host. This would make all Buryats honorary cossacks, and slowly introduce them to our culture and beliefs. Over time, they hopefully will take in some aspects of this culture, creating a new syncretic identity loyal to our Ataman."

TRB_Anti_Socialist_Raids: "Anti-Socialist Raids"
TRB_Anti_Socialist_Raids_desc: "Socialism is a cancer. It snakes its way into the brains of the downtrodden, filling their heads with false promises and unachievable dreams of utopia. We must cease the call of these siren’s, and the easiest way to do so is to raid their meeting places and properties until all those guilty can be arrested, their works destroyed, and their radical taint eliminated for good."

TRB_Ally_Mongolia: "Mongolian Allies"
TRB_Ally_Mongolia_desc: "To the south lies Mongolia proper - a vast nation surrounding the Steppe and the Gobi, filled with potential and danger. Despite our differences, they are our natural ally out here in the Far-East, for we both oppose the ambitions of the greater powers around us, instead pushing for our own. These kindred spirits would make excellent allies as we both strive to bring greatness to our nations."

TRB_Loyal_Burnatskom: "Loyal Burnatskom"
TRB_Loyal_Burnatskom_desc: "In order to appease our Buryat allies, who vastly outnumber us out here in the heartland of Buryatia, Ataman Semyenov has expressed his interest in reviving Burnatskom. Short for the Central National Committee of the Buryat-Mongols of East Siberia, Burnatskom is a united council of Buryat political, religious, and military figures who come together to represent Buryat interests. We shall revive and shackle this council to our Host, allowing them to be the voice for the Buryats within our nation, giving them some sense of national representation."

TRB_Buryat_Mongol_Cavalry: "Buryat-Mongol Cavalry"
TRB_Buryat_Mongol_Cavalry_desc: "Pulling from our Buryat allies once more, we shall move to incorporate their vast number of able horse riders into our army, for their skill in the saddle is nearly unmatched anywhere else in the world. These expert riders shall form the core of our elite cavalry corps, serving as shock troops and vanguard units to our main force."

TRB_Connections_With_Japanese: "Connections With the Japanese"
TRB_Connections_With_Japanese_desc: "Despite their ambition, the Empire of the Rising Sun is our only hope to combat Russian dominance in the Far-East. Calling on old ties through Ataman Semyenov, an audience with the Emperor’s court in Tokyo has been scheduled, where we shall attempt to garner their favor and their aid without losing our hard-fought sovereignty."

TRB_Ignore_Banditry: "Ignore Banditry"
TRB_Ignore_Banditry_desc: "Banditry is part of cossack life. Supplies, loot, food, weapons, clothing, money, and everything else our cossacks use is frequently sourced from raids and bandit action. Though this angers many within our lands, it also is necessary for our Host to function, for raiding doesn’t just put food on the table, it also puts the love of life and high spirits in the hearts of all our riders. We will suggest to our men to raid outside our borders instead, but shall overall turn a blind eye to these actions, unless they grow too out of hand."

TRB_Buryat_Cossack_Republic: "Buryat Cossack Republic"
TRB_Buryat_Cossack_Republic_desc: "With our new Host solidified and and our new regime consolidated, Ataman Semyenov has moved to proclaim the Buryat Cossack Republic of the Far-East. Though far from democratic and with most power residing with the hands of the Ataman, this new state still puts the needs and desires of its varied peoples first - whether they be cossack or Buryat. With the people having free local government and our national administration standing resolute with a powerful army at its back, our new state is the pride of Semyenov and one of the first semi-representational states in the region. Though our destiny is far from complete, our nation and our peoples have come a long way."

TRB_Liberate_The_Far_East_Cossack: "Liberate the Far-East"
TRB_Liberate_The_Far_East_Cossack_desc: "Now is the time we ride for our destiny, deep and far across the frozen Far-East. Our Host shall charge into this new dawning age of cossack dominance, and under Ataman Semyenov’s wise and calculated command, we shall be victorious! We shall liberate the Far-East and from the ashes of Russian and Japanese ambition, we shall carve out our own Cossack Republic as we face the rising sun head on to claim our birthright."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ALPHONSO_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Alphonso XIII of Bourbon, king from the moment of his birth in 1886, was, to popular contempt, restored to the throne of Spain in 1932. His second reign has been even more tumultuous than his first; republican, Carlist, and socialist dissidents all undermine his authority, and economic growth has stagnated. Spain, under Alphonso, has become a powder keg liable to explode."
POLITICS_JUAN_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Juan of Bourbon inherited a Spain divided, a Spain on the brink of the abyss. As the son and successor to the widely despised Alphonso, his reign will forever be marred by the specter of his father, but it is Juan, not Alphonso, who must lead Spain into a better future."
POLITICS_FRANSISCO_FRANCO_DESC:0 "General Fransisco Franco Bahamonde's widely noted charisma and uniquely Spanish machismo facilitated his quick ascension to leadership of the Acción Popular. Now Franco, as Spain's head of state, has the unenviable task of forging a broken nation anew. For such burden, none can deny that he is uniquely qualified."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_FERRER_DESC:0 "Miguel Cabanelles Ferrer, who commanded Spain's African colonial conscripts in the Rif war has risen to the forefront of Spanish politics through strict discipline and focus. He and his Falange Española, organised more like a paramilitary than a traditional political party, may be the only force capable of bringing some semblance of order to Spain."
POLITICS_GIL_ROBLES_QUINONES_DESC:0 "José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, a committed monarchist and militant Catholic, has risen to prominence in Spain. His firebrand speeches denouncing the Kingdom's enemies while extolling religious virtues might even appear radical to a Carlist; nonetheless, Quiñones stands defiantly at the helm of the troubled Spanish nation."
POLITICS_JAIME_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Jaime of Bourbon, second son of King Alphonso XIII, deaf and once considered likely to renounce any claim to the throne, has been crowned King of Spain. While not lacking in mental faculties, his reputation as an invalid precedes him. This unlikely King, however, must lead Spain into its uncertain future."
POLITICS_CARLOS_PIO_DESC:0 "Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, Prince of Tuscany... now Carlos VIII of Spain. For the first time in over two centuries, a Habsburg is once again King of Spain. Carlos VIII was born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria and of his wife Blanca de Borbón y de Borbón-Parma. His mother was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain. Carlos VIII grew up in the Palais Toskana in Vienna, but moved to Barcelona at a young age. The youngest and furthest right of the Carlist claimants, Carlos VIII demonstrated his right-wing bona fides by joining a nationalist militia in Austria, participating in street fights against syndicalists from Vienna to Madrid. Now leader of the Carlists, Carlos VIII will restore Christ, Honor, and Tradition to Spain."

### Ideas ###

SPR_memories_of_the_republic_desc:0 "On August 11th, 1932, the Second Spanish Republic came to an end, but the Republic lives on in the hearts of many Spaniards.

### Focuses ###
SPR_strengthen_kingdom:0 "Strengthen the Kingdom"
SPR_strengthen_kingdom_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Spain is in dire straits, and many believe our nation will soon descend into civil war. We must consolidate our position and endeavour to thwart impending disaster."
SPR_focus_diplomacy:0 "Focus on Diplomacy"
SPR_focus_diplomacy_desc:0 "We must convene meetings with both the Carlists and the CNT-FAI. With our crisis seemingly unresolvable, perhaps we can at least prevent complete collapse."
SPR_talks_with_CNT:0 "Meet with the CNT-FAI"
SPR_talks_with_CNT_desc:0 "We should meet with the CNT-FAI, Spain's leading socialist organisation. By establishing a dialogue and engaging their demands, we can hopefully dissuade them from open rebellion."
SPR_meet_with_xavier:0 "Meet with Javier"
SPR_meet_with_xavier_desc:0 "Javier, Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne, seemingly desires nothing less than the throne itself. Through discussion and perhaps even concession, we hope to persuade him to abandon his claim, or at least refraim from insurrection."
SPR_plea_for_peace:0 "Plea For Peace"
SPR_plea_for_peace_desc:0 "Spain is rife with unrest, and with civil war seemingly inevitable, the people should hear directly from their king. Hopefully, King Alphonso's personal plea for peace can persuade at least a few Spaniards to abandon violence."
SPR_focus_economy:0 "Focus on the Economy"
SPR_focus_economy_desc:0 "Spain faces massive unemployment and economic hardship. Until we address these issues, the people will continue to be restless and receptive to revolutionary ideas. To prevent civil war, we should impliment comprehensive economic reform."
SPR_construction_focus:0 "New Construction"
SPR_construction_focus_desc:0 "Economic revitalisation necessitates the construcion of new infrastructure and industry alike. By providing jobs to the jobless, perhaps we can distract their political frustrations."
SPR_civ_production:0 "New Factories"
SPR_civ_production_desc:0 "While state-sponsored factories are never the most efficient, this will be a way for us to get the people working... and for more trade to flow into Spain. Everyone will benefit!"
SPR_new_jobs:0 "Jobs for the People"
SPR_new_jobs_desc:0 "There is so much to be done, but already we have put a great portion of the unemployed back to work. We need to spread the word to the people and reassure them that things are not as dire as they seem. If they only give the kingdom a chance, and time to rebuild, we will prove to them they have made the right choice."
SPR_focus_military:0 "Focus on the Military"
SPR_focus_military_desc:0 "The civil war is likely to come, no matter what we do. While it would still be best if we found another way, we must also prepare for the worst - and that means bolstering our military for the coming battles."
SPR_mil_production:0 "Increase Arms Production"
SPR_mil_production_desc:0 "The economy will need to take a back seat to new factories which can produce bombs and guns. These we will need first - the rest can come later."
SPR_mil_planning:0 "Review Our Leadership"
SPR_mil_planning_desc:0 "Some might call it a 'purge', but it's very simple - we need to look to the officers who lead our forces, and ensure that those who remain in the higher positions are not secretly loyal to the Carlists or the anarcho-syndicalists. Those who remain must come together and talk of military planning. Let us ensure we have every scenario accounted for before the firing begins."
SPR_fortify_madrid:0 "Fortify Madrid"
SPR_fortify_madrid_desc:0 "Our capital, here in the heart of Spain, is also our weakest link. It can easily be surrounded, and our enemies know that capturing the Royal Family would ensure we instantly lay down our arms. We cannot allow this to happen, even if it means turning beautiful Madrid into a veritable fortress."
SPR_rally_kingdom:0 "Rally the Kingdom"
SPR_rally_kingdom_desc:0 "Despite our efforts to preserve peace, civil war has broken out in Spain. Now is the time to rally those loyal to the king, to eliminate our remaining divisions and ensure our nation does not fall to radicals."

SPR_no_civil_war:0 "Civil War Averted!"
SPR_no_civil_war_desc:0 "We have succeeded! The danger is past, and our government has received a mandate from the people which even the Carlists and the anarcho-syndicalists cannot ignore. They might try to rise again, but they know not enough of the people will follow to make a difference. Things are still dire in Spain, but at least we can be assured we have a position of strength from which to work."
SPR_victor_civil_war:0 "Victory in the Civil War!"
SPR_victor_civil_war_desc:0 "We fought hard, and in the end the battle was won by tradition and by the king. Spain is whole, and ours once again!"
SPR_consolidate_spain:0 "Consolidate Spain"
SPR_consolidate_spain_desc:0 "Now is the time to look across the country and see what must be done to pull it together, and to heal the rifts which have formed since the end of the Second Republic."
SPR_replace_alfonso:0 "Restore the Monarchy"
SPR_replace_alfonso_desc:0 "Our King Alfonso is in a coma, and it seems there is no returning for him. A regent is not enough - we must decide who is to lead Spain in the years to come."
SPR_arrest_leaders:0 "Arrest the Malcontents"
SPR_arrest_leaders_desc:0 "We will never have true peace while radicals are free to foment discord. While they will certainly do their best to rise up, their time is done and they know it. We must capture the worst of the leaders and put them away - this is the path to lasting unity for Spain."
SPR_new_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
SPR_new_constitution_desc:0 "Until the CNT-FAI and the Carlists are allowed to be a peaceable part of our government, Spain will never know true unity. We must look to having regular elections, and allow these radicals to run in them. We must not fear what they could do. Rather we must embrace them, and perhaps make peace as much their goal as ours."
SPR_unity_at_last:0 "Unity at Last"
SPR_unity_at_last_desc:0 "We have finally bridged the divisions which have torn apart our nation, at least for now. It is time to move forward as a renewed Spain, and for the world to know that we are whole and not to be trifled with."

SPR_rebuild_industry:0 "Rebuild Industry"
SPR_rebuild_industry_desc:0 "Our industrial sector has been heavily damaged by war and a horrid economy - it is time to pull the people together to rebuild and move forward."
SPR_railroads_1:0 "Expand the National Railroads"
SPR_railroads_1_desc:0 "Before true industry can be started, we need a better transportation network which crosses from one side of Spain to the next. This will be a national undertaking which will require our full effort."
SPR_new_industry:0 "Embrace New Methods"
SPR_new_industry_desc:0 "The world of industry and technology has been advancing without us, and we must look outside of Spain to these new methods. Embracing them is the only hope we will ever have of catching up."
SPR_expand_industry_1:0 "Expand Our Industry"
SPR_expand_industry_1_desc:0 "We must focus on expanding our civilian industry, to increase Spain's trade potential and our place as a powerhouse in Europe."
SPR_expand_mines_1:0 "Expand New Mines"
SPR_expand_mines_1_desc:0 "There are resources yet untapped in Spain, mines that new technology allow us to finally access. We must take advantage of them."
SPR_expand_industry_2:0 "Expand Our Industry Further"
SPR_expand_industry_2_desc:0 "We must continue our focus on expanding our civilian industry, to increase Spain's trade potential and our place as a powerhouse in Europe."
SPR_trade_focus:0 "Focus on Trade"

SPR_recover_black_monday:0 "Recovery from Black Monday"
SPR_recover_black_monday_desc:0 "It has been a long road, and Spain was perhaps harder hit than some. We have weathered the storm, however, and it is time to come out of the other end of it stronger than ever."

SPR_university:0 "Centro de Estudios Universitarios"
SPR_university_desc:0 "Established in 1933 by the Asociación Católica de Propagandistas, the Centro de Estudios Universitarios is a foundation for the development of education. It controlled and supported only a few universities like the Universidad de Deusto, but now it will gain control over the entire educational structure of our country."
SPR_radio_focus:0 "Central Spanish Broadcast"
SPR_radio_focus_desc:0 "Radio is the way of the future - we must centre it here in Madrid, and find a way to turn it to our advantage."
SPR_electronics_focus:0 "Focus on Electronics"
SPR_electronics_focus_desc:0 "Electronics and computers are how we will compete - we must learn ways to keep our information secure, while simultaneously discovering what our enemies plan. We will never gain an advantage if we do not know our enemies are coming."
SPR_united_minds:0 "Uniting Minds of Spain"
SPR_united_minds_desc:0 "We have allowed our differences to impede us for too long. It is time to bring fine Spanish minds together in our universities, and to give them free reign in aiding or great leap forward into the modern era."

SPR_rebuild_command:0 "Rebuild Our National Command"
SPR_rebuild_command_desc:0 "Our command structures have been devastated. Now is the time to rebuild them anew, to cast aside old and outdated ways of thinking and to embrace the new."
SPR_standing_army:0 "A Standing Army"
SPR_standing_army_desc:0 "We must focus on our army's strength and quality, instead of focusing on expanding into areas we cannot truly afford."
SPR_mobile_army:0 "A Mobile Army"
SPR_mobile_army_desc:0 "The ways of footsoldiers and horses will soon be a thing of the past, if they are not already. The cost of equipping our forces with vehicles will be high, but it is necessary."
SPR_new_equipment:0 "Update the Army's Equipment"
SPR_new_equipment_desc:0 "We must focus on modernising our army's equipment, much of which dates back to the Weltkrieg. This will not do."
SPR_motor_focus:0 "Spanish Motorworks"
SPR_motor_focus_desc:0 "We must get our soldiers off their feet, and focus on giving them the kind of mobility which will give us an advantage."
SPR_artillery_focus:0 "Artillery Focus"
SPR_artillery_focus_desc:0 "Firepower - this is what we most desperately need. The ability to knock down an enemy's fortifications, and to bombard them into senselessness should they dare cross the Pyrenees."
SPR_tank_focus:0 "The Spanish Panzer Corps"
SPR_tank_focus_desc:0 "Heavy armour - it provides both speed and firepower, and it is our clear path to victory in the wars to come."
SPR_army_innovation:0 "Army Innovation"
SPR_army_innovation_desc:0 "Above all else, we must ensure our army has the finest minds behind it to plan our offence and defence. Without them, all the fine equipment in the world will do us nothing."

SPR_air_academy:0 "Academia Básica del Aire"
SPR_air_academy_desc:0 "After the end of a war, it has been proposed to create of a new Air Force Academy where our glorious air forces can be trained and new aeronautical doctrines researched. This will require a low cost for us and should give great advantages to our air forces."
SPR_air_factory:0 "Iberavia Aircraft Factory"
SPR_air_factory_desc:0 "Before the start of the war, there were plans for opening a new aircraft industry near Madrid, but the bad economic situation and the war prevented any investments. Now that we have achieved our glorious victory, we finally have the opportunity to finance and support it."
SPR_expand_airforce:0 "Expand the Air Force"
SPR_expand_airforce_desc:0 "We must focus on researching new types of aircraft, to keep our air force from lagging behind nations who have been at it for far longer. If we cannot have strength of numbers, we will have quality."
SPR_air_focus:0 "Rule the Skies"
SPR_air_focus_desc:0 "It is a basic fact that we cannot be both a naval power and an air force power - so we have chosen to rule the skies, and to gear our industry towards producing the kind of air power which will make superiority over the skies something we can achieve."

SPR_naval_academy:0 "Academia Naval Española"
SPR_naval_academy_desc:0 "There are several naval academies in operation throughout Spain, but all of them adhere to long-outdated methods. We must bring them together, and provide them the resources to ensure new doctrines can be embraced which will give us the kind of naval experience we so desperately need."

SPR_expand_navy:0 "Expand the Navy"

SPR_navy_focus:0 "Rule the Seas"
SPR_navy_focus_desc:0 "It is a basic fact that we cannot be both a naval power and an air force power - so we have chosen to rule the seas, and to gear our industry towards producing the kind of naval power which will make superiority over the seas something we can achieve."

SPR_place_in_the_world:0 "Our Place in the World"
SPR_place_in_the_world_desc:0 "With all the troubles which have afflicted the kingdom, we have come to be treated as a second-class country within Europe - a nation to be ignored, or even one which might be seen as an easy target. Now that we have reasserted our position, it is time to restore our contact with the rest of the world, and to let them know our strength has returned."
SPR_join_germany:0 "Join the Reichspakt"
SPR_join_germany_desc:0 "Our place lies at Germany's side - let us join the Reichspakt, so that the syndicalists will find themselves surrounded."
SPR_join_entente:0 "Join the Entente"

SPR_guard_border:0 "Guard the Borders"
SPR_guard_border_desc:0 "The many paths over the Pyrenees are our only weakness. We must fortify the border, to ensure no-one pushes into Spanish territory while we can yet defend it."
SPR_bourbon_throne:0 "Claim the Bourbon Throne"
SPR_bourbon_throne_desc:0 "King Jaime I is, by rights, the senior legitimate male heir of the House of Capet and thus heir to the French throne. Indeed, there are many Frenchmen who consider him the de jure King of France. It is time to see that claim enforced and see all of France and Spain united under a single banner once again."
SPR_fate_of_france:0 "Fate of the Bourbon Crownlands"
SPR_fate_of_france_desc:0 "After centuries of rivalry and struggle, we have conquered the French at last, and we're now in a position to pursue greater ambitions over the former homeland of the Bourbons. The House of Bourbon is now a Spanish dynasty, and we can now prove this once and for all. The fate of France is now in our hands, and may King Jaime guide us into our prestigious new destiny!"

SPR_question_of_the_monarchy:0 "Question of the Monarchy"
SPR_question_of_the_monarchy_desc:0 "It is a new age for the Spanish Kingdom. Many of our subjects are suggesting that the monarchist system is outdated, and we should allow for elections while maintaining the King as a figurehead. The decision is ultimately up to us."
SPR_franco_question:0 "Elections in the Republic"
SPR_franco_question_desc:0 "There are grumblings among the Spanish people that the "Republic" cannot call itself one unless we allow elections. How should we respond?"
SPR_absolutism:0 "An Absolute Monarchy"
SPR_absolutism_desc:0 "We will officially declare ourselves an absolute monarchy, which will hopefully unite all Spanish peoples under the Bourbon throne."

### Events ###

### Domestic ###

sprd.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Spain"
sprd.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Spain: Once the greatest of the Colonial Empires, she saw all of her remaining overseas colonies lost after a swift war against the USA in 1898. After this, separatist movements in both the Basque country and Catalonia arose, and both the Church and a radical worker's movement, the CNT, are interfering in her internal politics. Spain's populace has become deeply divided.\n\nAfter taking his place on the throne in 1902, King Alfonso XIII seemed keen on regaining Spain's former status as a colonial power by intervening in Morocco. The intervention lasted for a whole decade, and the outcome, while a victory, was not exactly in favour for Spain: Her Moroccan possessions remain a source of permanent unrest. Spain turned in on herself afterwards, remaining neutral during the Weltkrieg, all while the populace's faith in King Alfonso faded.\n\nAs a result of the General Elections of 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, and Alfonso, accepting the will of his people, went into exile. However, the Republic lasted only a short while. The Kingdom was restored by a coup d'état lead by General Sanjurjo just a year later. Still, the memories of the short-lived failure that was the Spanish Republic fuel the regime's opponents left and right.\n\nTo date, there remain deep divisions within Spanish society. On the one hand, the resurgent Carlist Movement, headed by Alfonso Carlos, aims to re-establish the 'True Dynasty' and recreate an integralist Christian monarchy, and on the other, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI seeks the abolition of the Spanish state altogether, and to replace it with a voluntary federation of communes and economic collectives. If the political split is not mended, Spain might even see a Civil War."
sprd.1.a:0 "Let us prevail."

sprd.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Spain"
sprd.2.d:0 "The Spanish economy has been tied to Germany since the end of the Weltkrieg. Since France and England's defeat, a good portion of our economy has been centred around exporting materials and goods to the German markets. As such, we can expect a flood of layoffs and closings. Our political foes will undoubtedly use this to their advantage."
sprd.2.a:0 "We did not need this!"

sprd.3.t:0 "Breakdown of our Society"
sprd.3.d:0 "The bickering of both leftist and traditionalist fanatics have been driving the Spanish people into a frenzy, and the sustained economic crisis following Black Monday has poured gasoline onto the embers. Several political groups have called for open protest against our reign."
sprd.3.a:0 "This is not going to end well."

### Carlist Chain ###

sprd.4.t:0 "Carlist Succession Crisis"
sprd.4.d:0 "During the hundred years of its history Carlism was headed by six successive claimants with clear heritage rights; however, in the early 1930s it was evident that the dynasty would soon extinguish. The pretender, Don Alfonso Carlos, was eighty-two years old upon assuming the claim in 1931 and had no issue. More troubling was the fact that Don Alfonso Carlos appeared to lean towards reconciliation with the Isabelline kings currently occupying the Spanish throne. After the death of Don Alfonso Carlos, King Alfonso XIII of Spain will be the senior male descendant of Carlos IV.\n\nNevertheless, the majority of Carlists consider Alfonso disqualified because he does not share the Carlist ideals and because Spanish law excludes from succession the descendants of those who commit treason against the king, as Carlists deem Alfonso's male-line ancestors to have done when Francisco de Paula recognized the reign of Isabella II. Duke Javier of Bourbon-Parma is the most likely successor to Don Alfonso Carlos as he currently acts as the elderly claimant's representative in Spain. Alternatively, Archduke Karl Pius von Habsburg claims to be the legitimate Carlist claimant through the rights of his mother, Infanta Blanca. Both refuse to recognize the present King of Spain."
sprd.4.a:0 "The Carlists must be plotting something."

sprd.5.t:0 "Javier de Borbón-Parma y de Braganza"
sprd.5.d:0 "Javier de Borbón-Parma is considered the natural successor to the Carlist cause due to his close relationship with Don Alfonso Carlos de San Jaime. The second son of the last reigning Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Duke Javier was torn between the great powers of Europe during the Weltkrieg. Initially planning to enlist in the Austrian army to avenge his cousin Franz Ferdinand, plans changed when his adoptive France declared war on Austria-Hungary. After the Weltkrieg, Duke Javier retired to Vienna and avoided politics until the 1930s. It was in Vienna that he fostered his relationship with Don Alfonso Carlos and took an interest in Spanish legitimism, i.e. Carlism. In 1934, he moved to Spain to act as the royal octogenarian's representative. Javier is devoutly Catholic and committed to legitimism, though some far-right Traditionalists question his absolutist bona fides.\n\nSince coming to Spain, he has been a thorn in the side of King Alfonso XIII and his government. His political profile and popularity are troubling. Yesterday, he gave a speech arguing that the Kingdom of Spain needs to work together with its Catholic neighbours. He proposed an economic bloc with other Mediterranean nations to support each other through free trade."
sprd.5.a:0 "He is a threat. Keep him under surveillance."

sprd.6.t:0 "Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena y de Borbón"
sprd.6.d:0 "Born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria, Archduke Karl Pius von Habsburg might seem like an odd choice for Spanish succession. Yet, through his mother, Infanta Blanca de Borbón, Karl is the grandson of Carlos VII, the last legitimate Carlist King of Spain. Unlike Duke Javier, Carlos Pío has lived in Barcelona since the 1920s. He returned to Austria briefly in the early 1930s, where he joined nationalist causes and participated in street fights with syndicalists. A significant minority of the Carlist movement believes that Carlos Pío is the natural and legitimate claimant to the throne of Spain, due to his mother's lineage and his rightist views.\n\nThe Carlist doctrine of Dual Legitimacy requires that a potential King descend legitimately from Carlos V and maintain 'legitimacy of execution' through a commitment to Spanish Traditionalism and Carlist principles. As the male line of Carlist Bourbons will be extinct when Alfonso Carlos dies without issue, descent must by necessity track through the eldest female, Infanta Blanca, and through her to her son, Carlos Pío. Carlos Pío has older brothers, but they have disqualified themselves through morganatic marriages and abdications. Carlos Pío, on the other hand, remains unmarried and has a demonstrated commitment to Traditionalism. The Archduke's supporters, known as Carloctavistas, already refer to him as Carlos VIII."
sprd.6.a:0 "A Spanish Habsburg?"

sprd.7.t:0 "Alfonso Carlos de Borbón Dies"
sprd.7.d:0 "Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, and the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, died today in Vienna at the age of 87. He was killed in an automobile accident while crossing the street. His passing, expected at his age, but no less sudden, has thrown the Carlist factions of Spain into chaos. The current king of Spain, Alfonso XIII, is now by right the head of the Capetian dynasty. Alas, the Carlist movement rejects any compromise with the traitorous Isabelline dynasty. They are divided between Duke Javier and Archduke Carlos, a pair of foreigners! The will of Alfonso Carlos indicates that Duke Javier should be regent of the Carlist movement until a legitimate claimant is chosen."
sprd.7.a:0 "Why don't they like me?"

sprd.8.t:0 "Carlist Ambitions for the Throne"
sprd.8.d_javier:0 "Following a series of diplomatic successes abroad, the Carlist representative, Don Javier, has begun giving speeches throughout northern Spain, the Basque Country, and Catalonia. In this, he is aided by Manuel Fal Conde, one of Carlism’s greatest political tools, a master organizer. Groups of far-right young men gather in the north, under the guise of Catholic faith and a commitment to monarchy. His Majesty’s Guardia Civil assures him these are truthfully rebellious cells; Carlist militias preparing to challenge the throne. Don Javier uses his new publicity to question the rule of King Alfonso XIII."
sprd.8.d_carlos:0 "Following recent diplomatic successes abroad, the Carlist claimant Archduke Carlos Pío has begun touring the nation, particularly in the Basque Country and Catalonia, promoting the Carlist cause. The young, charismatic usurper-in-the-making is aided by the politician Jesús de Cora y Lira and the young, magnetic Requeté, Jaime del Burgo Torres. He uses his new platform to press his claim to the throne of Spain as Carlos VIII."
sprd.8.a:0 "Time to ban Carlist organizations."

### CNT-FAI Chain ###

sprd.13.t:0 "The CNT-FAI"
sprd.13.d:0 "The anarcho-syndicalist union of the CNT-FAI are one of the greatest threats to His Majesty's Government. Yesterday, Joaquin Maurín Juliá, a leader in the movement made a speech entitled 'My Heroes' in which he stated that the CNT will attempt to organise all laid off workers in an effort to save the country's economy."

sprd.17.t:0 "Disbanding the CNT-FAI"
sprd.17.d:0 "Our police and military have moved to disband and arrest as many CNT-FAI members as possible. However, we have found almost none. They appear to have fled or gone into hiding"
sprd.17.a:0 "This shows how weak they are!"

sprd.18.t:0 "Organising the workers"
sprd.18.d:0 "The CNT-FAI have set about organising the laid-off workers and the unemployed. They have come up with series of projects to put these people to work on."

sprd.34.t:0 "Civil War Averted!"
sprd.34.d:0 "Despite violence held during the election and immediate protests which have sprung up throughout Spain as the results are announced, it's clear: the Acción Popular remains in power, and the kingdom remains whole. The entire nation is breathing a sigh of relief, and despite obvious attempts by Carlists and CNT-FAI supporters to stir up trouble, everyone knows that the election was fair. They will not have the support for the uprising they crave, not now and perhaps not ever."
sprd.34.a:0 "Freedom has won the day."

sprd.35.t:0 "The CNT-FAI are Victorious!"
sprd.35.d:0 "Though some question the veracity of the vote, there can be no question to most that the election was fair...and the CNT-FAI have eked out a narrow victory at the polls. The royal advisers suggest that the results of the election need not be abided by. Indeed, should the government be turned over to the anarcho-syndicalists, it's very likely the royal family will be immediately deposed if not outright endangered."

sprd.35.b:0 "Invalidate the election!"

sprd.36.t:0 "The Carlists are Victorious!"
sprd.36.d:0 "Though some question the veracity of the vote, there can be no question to most that the election was fair...and the Carlists have eked out a narrow victory over the anarcho-syndicalists and our own Acción Popular. The royal advisers give word that the Carlist pretender is already on his way to the palace, and if the regent wishes to invalidate the election results he must move quickly. There is, after all, no telling whether the Carlists will keep their word and show mercy to the royal family."
sprd.36.a:0 "No, we will abide by the result."
sprd.36.b:0 "Invalidate the election!"

sprd.37.t:0 "The Grand Carlist Assembly"
sprd.37.d:0 "Following the death of Don Alfonso Carlos, there is now a divide within Carlism. A small portion of Carlists believe it is finally time to reconcile with the Isabelline kings. This is obviously unacceptable. The majority of Carlists support the final wishes of Don Alfonso Carlos and will follow the regent, Don Javier as the next leader of the Carlists. A significant minority with support drawn especially from the Carlist militias of the northeast, the Requetés, support the claim of Archduke Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena. Don Javier knows the Carlist revolution will not succeed without the Navarrese and Basque Requetés, but is loathe to come to an accord with Carlos Pío. As a last resort, a Grand Assembly has been called in Pamplona, to be attended by leading Carlists. They will decide on the legitimate heir to the Carlist claim. Who will succeed? Don Javier or Archduke Carlos Pío?"

sprc.120.d:0 "The Spanish Civil War is finally over, and it seems that [SPR.GetNameDef] has emerged triumphant. Much of the countryside lies in ruins, and order has not completely been restored, but the [SPR.GetAdjective] government announced that the anarchist and syndicalist threats had finally been dealt with and would be unlikely to rise again anytime soon. This is a triumph for King Alfonso XIII, though the king is unlikely to know of it, having fallen into a coma shortly before the civil war broke out."
sprc.120.a:0 "Hail to the king!"

sprc.122.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Terror"
sprc.122.d:0 "During ongoing civil war some of our commanders started to use rather doubtful methods to permanently suppress civilian population suspicious of helping our mortal enemies. Such policies, even if looks drastic, are necessary in these dark times."
sprc.122.a:0 "War is war..."

sprc.124.t:0 "We Must Surrender"
sprc.124.d:0 "Our position has become untenable, and it is clear we have lost the war. Already our soldiers are deserting en masse, with several of our generals out in the field having already surrendered to the enemy."
sprc.124.a:0 "So must it be..."

sprc.125.t:0 "[SPR.GetNameDefCap] Surrenders"
sprc.125.d:0 "With Madrid taken and the remainder of the [SPR.GetAdjective] forces routed, the government has finally realized the futility of its position and admitted defeat. Already officials are either fleeing the country or surrendering to any [Root.GetAdjective] soldier they see."
sprc.125.a:0 "Excellent news."

sprc.127.t:0 "[CAR.GetNameDefCap] Surrenders"
sprc.127.d:0 "With Burgos taken and the remainder of the [CAR.GetAdjective] forces routed, the Carlist pretender has finally realized the futility of his position and admitted defeat. While some of his supporters claim they will fight to the last, Javier himself has approached [Root.GetAdjective] forces and surrendered himself - on the condition of leniency for both him and his senior officials. A sad day for the ardent Catholics in Spain, it seems."

sprc.129.t:0 "[CNT.GetNameDefCap] Surrenders"
sprc.129.d:0 "With Barcelona taken and the remainder of the [CNT.GetAdjective] forces routed, the anarchists have finally realized the futility of their position and admitted defeat. While this is almost certainly not the end of the syndicalists in Spain, this is at least a defeat they will not soon forget. For now, the CNT-FAI banner - tattered and worn - has vanished from the political landscape."

sprc.205.a:0 "Good."

sprc.206.t:0 "The End of the Spanish War"

sprc.206.a:0 "Great!"

sprc.207.t:0 "Workers Rise Up"
sprc.207.d:0 "Our efforts at organising and building along the coast are paying off. The workers have risen to stand with us, and our secret work at building forts in the old castles and watch posts have come to fruition."
sprc.207.a:0 "Huzzah!"

sprc.208.t:0 "Returning from [?CNT.CNT_foreign_support.GetNameDef]"

sprc.221.t:0 "The People's Home"
sprc.221.d:0 "Now that we have won the Civil War, our Syndicalist dream has become a reality! But should we keep the People's home in Barcelona, or move it to the old capital in Madrid?"
sprc.221.a:0 "Madrid, for a unified Spain!"
sprc.221.b:0 "Barcelona is now and forever the People's home."

sprc.255.t:0 "The Fate of Andorra"
sprc.255.d:0 "An interesting matter has come to our attention; that of the Principality of Andorra.\n\nThe Principality of Andorra was founded in 1278, but since 1607 has been linked to France, first through the royal family and later through various treaties. When the government fell to the Germans Andorra appealed to the Spanish for protection which was granted, officially signed into law in 1921.\n\nThey now lie within our control and it may be wroth integrating them into our nation; we surely can't leave them alone given their links to the old French and Spanish governments? Then again, is it really worth the trouble for such a small 'nation'?"
sprc.255.a:0 "They shall be part of Spain!"
sprc.255.b:0 "Leave them be."

sprc.256.t:0 "Peace With Andorra"
sprc.256.d:0 "The Principality of Andorra joined the war against us in support of France, but after their defeat Andorra had no ties with the new Commune and aligned itself with Spain, officially signing a protection treaty in 1921.\n\nHowever, that treaty didn't annul their declaration of war against us, and in fact, nor has any treaty since. Several diplomats have been working to resolve this strange circumstance and now we have a peace deal ready to be signed, it is but a formality of course."
sprc.256.a:0 "Of course."

sprc.306.t:0 "Assassinating the Regent"
sprc.306.d:0 "Infante Juan is King Alfonso's regent, as well as his heir. His death would through [SPR.GetNameDef] into disarray and give us time to knock them out of the civil war completely!"
sprc.306.a:0 "Godspeed to our agents."

sprc.307.t:0 "The Assassination Plot Fails!"
sprc.307.d:0 "Our plot to assassinate the royal heir has failed. It seems Infante Juan was injured by our bomb, but is expected to fully recover from his injuries."

sprc.308.t:0 "Assassination Plot Fails!"
sprc.308.d:0 "A Carlist plot to assassinate Infante Juan, the royal heir, only barely failed this morning. A bomb went off when the prince was reviewing troops, but he was only wounded and is expected to pull through."

He had been in the Regency position since his father's coma, and now the country is thrown into chaos as there is not only no regent but no clear successor to the throne!

sprc.321.d:0 "Now that we have won the Civil War, our Carlist dream has become a reality! But should we move the national capital to the House of Borbón's home in Madrid, or keep it as is?"
sprc.321.a:0 "To Historical Madrid!"
sprc.321.b:0 "A new Borbón Dynasty with a new home."

sprc.322.t:0 "The Troubles Continue"
sprc.322.d:0 "Despite our victory in the Civil War, there is still a great amount of unrest and partisan activity around the country. Rebuilding and regaining the trust of the people may take some time."
sprc.322.a:0 "The after-effects of a war."

sprc.323.t:0 "The Nation is Recovering"

sprc.327.t:0 "Syndicalists in Equatorial Guinea"
sprc.327.d:0 "The anarchist-syndicalists in Spain have taken control over the Spanish colony of Equatorial Guinea, and more than one member of the [Root.GetAdjective] government is suggesting that allowing [CNT.GetNameDef] to possess land in the middle of Africa is hardly a wise idea."

sprc.327.b:0 "Leave it be."

sprc.330.t:0 "The Cuban Gambit"
sprc.330.d:0 "Agents of His Majesty have infiltrated Cuba; many of them stay-behinds from the Spanish-American War who remain loyal to the Kingdom of Spain. They are preparing the ground for Spanish reconquest of the island, though we are guaranteed to face stiff resistance to maintain Cuba's ill-gotten independence. With the United States distracted and reeling from civil war, Cuba lacks its traditional protector. The Great Powers of Europe are distracted. We can only hope the Kaiserreich has no interest in the region."
sprc.330.a:0 "It's time to reverse the decline."

sprc.331.t:0 "Operation Hombre Sincero"
sprc.331.d:0 "Our agents have infiltrated the stevedores' unions of a number of Cuban ports. In addition, two garrisons in the western part of the island have come over to our cause, their commanders recognizing  that the protection of Spain is preferable to the continued political conflict overcoming the country. They are prepared to open one of the ports for Spanish forces to make an unopposed landing."
sprc.331.a:0 "Land in Guantánamo!"
sprc.331.b:0 "Land in Santiago!"

sprc.332.t:0 "The Invasion of Guantánamo Bay"
sprc.332.d:0 "Spanish marines landed in Guantánamo Bay under the cover of darkness, with the aid of the local Cuban garrison. We repeated the success of the Americans in 1898, routing loyal members of the Cuban military during a short firefight in the night. The evacuated American naval station will serve as an important beachhead for the conquest of the island."
sprc.332.a:0 "Victory!"

sprc.333.t:0 "The Invasion of Santiago Bay"
sprc.333.d:0 "Spanish marines landed in Santiago Bay under the cover of darkness, with the aid of the local Cuban garrison. The waters of Santiago de Cuba are home to many dead Spaniards, slain in the disastrous naval battle with the Americans during the Spanish-American war. We will redeem their memory."
sprc.333.a:0 "Victory!"

sprc.334.t:0 "Spain Invades Cuba!"
sprc.334.d:0 "The perfidious Spanish have invaded Cuban soil! Our former masters have returned, demanding we be enslaved to imperial hegemony once again! Many Cubans have long memories of the war of independence, less than half a century before. We will fight them in the streets! On the farms! In the mountains!"
sprc.334.a:0 "Cuba Libre!"

sprc.335.t:0 "Restoration: Cuba"
sprc.335.d:0 "Spain has achieved the impossible; bringing herself back from the brink of international irrelevancy and once again extending her sovereignty across the Atlantic. His Majesty has ordered all royal historians to refer to the period between the Spanish-American War and restoration of Spanish rule in Havana as the 'Cuban Rebellion,' seeking to erase the notion of independence. Rebel leaders are exiled to the Spanish Sahara, lest they become martyrs. The government now subsidizes the establishment of Spanish businesses on the isle, hoping to coax more peninsulares into returning to the island and giving it a loyal domestic population. Until the region is totally pacified, military occupation will be necessary. For now, however, Spaniards should celebrate. The jewel of the Caribbean has been returned to its rightful owners."
sprc.335.a:0 "Cuba Linda!"

# New Spanish Events

sprd.100.t:0 "Question of the Monarchy"
sprd.100.d:0 "Now that our country has stabilized once again the people are demanding we should call for elections, and as we have just secured victory in a bloody war, now may not be the time for another revolution. The King would still remain as a figurehead but the democratically-elected Cortes Generales and prime minister would hold the real power."
sprd.100.a:0 "We shall become a constitutional monarchy."
sprd.100.b:0 "Forget them. What are they going to do, revolt again?"

sprd.101.t:0 "The [GetYear] Spanish Elections"
sprd.101.d:0 "For the first time since the coup in 1932, free elections are finally here at last and everyday Spaniards are clamoring to have a voice in the government once more. The results are in, and the winner is..."
sprd.101.a:0 "Partido Liberal Moderado, led by Ramón Otero Pedrayo."
sprd.101.b:0 "The PSOE, led by Augusto Barcia Trelles."
sprd.101.c:0 "The moderate wing of the Acción Popular, led by Francisco Franco Bahamonde."
sprd.101.e:0 "Izquierda Republicana, led by Manuel Azaña Díaz."

sprd.102.d:0 "The [GetYear] elections are finally upon us. Who shall take control?"

sprd.103.t:0 "The People Demand Elections"
sprd.103.d:0 "Despite all we have done for this country the people are protesting outside the presidential mansion, and are demanding that Franco step down and be replaced by a democratically-elected president and Cortes Generales. Of course, there is nothing stopping us from running ourselves in said elections. Also, as we have just secured victory in a bloody war now may not be the time for another revolution. Then again, as we hold all the cards right now we could always say no."
sprd.103.a:0 "We are a republic after all. Allow the elections."
sprd.103.b:0 "Forget them. What are they going to do, revolt again?"

sprd.104.t:0 "Dealing With the Moderate Socialists"
sprd.104.d:0 "Founded in 1879, the Partido Socialista Obrero Español-the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party- is one of the oldest political parties in Spain. However, since the CNT-FAI uprising the PSOE has been officially banned from participating in Spanish politics. Now that our situation has stabilized, it may be time to reconcile with them and once again allow them to operate."
sprd.104.a:0 "Only if they dissasociate from syndicalism."
sprd.104.b:0 "Never!"

sprd.105.t:0 "Franco's Speech"
sprd.105.d:0 "In front of thousands in Madrid, president Francisco Franco has declared a new era for the Spanish Republic. No longer will Carlist reactionaries, pompous monarchists, and dirty anarchists pollute our soil. Spain will be great once more!"
sprd.105.a:0 "Viva España!"

sprd.106.t:0 "The King's Speech"
sprd.106.d:0 "In front of thousands in Madrid, King [SPR.GetLeader] has declared a new era for the Kingdom of Spain. No longer will Carlist reactionaries, greedy republicans, and dirty anarchists pollute our soil. Spain will be great once more!"
sprd.106.a:0 "Viva España!"

sprd.107.t:0 "Autonomous Communities"
sprd.107.d:0 "In a near-unanimous decision, the Cortes Generales have ratified a bill creating "Autonomous Communities" across Spain in an effort to heal the divisiveness still prevalent in Spanish society. It recognizes that Spain is in fact a nation of many unique peoples and nationalities, such as Basques, Catalonians, and Galicians, among others, and provides further regional autonomy for these peoples. However, a small number of critics say that increased regionalism could fuel additional separatist movements in the future."
sprd.107.a:0 "Out of many, one."

sprd.108.t:0 "Stability at Last!"
sprd.108.d:0 "In a shocking announcement, [SPR.GetLeader] has proclaimed that Spain has finally healed from the brutal divisiveness that shattered the country not so very long ago. People of all races, creeds, and religions now see themselves loyal to Spain first and their region second, perhaps helped along by the numerous propaganda and coercion efforts by the Spanish government. Regardless, Spain is more united than it has ever been, and although there are still pockets of dissent in a few regions such as Basque country and Catalonia, these movements are much smaller than they have ever been even before the war."
sprd.108.a:0 "One Spain, one people."

sprd.109.t:0 "A Bourbon Empire?"
sprd.109.d:0 "With the lands of France - the homeland of the Bourbons - now under Spanish occupation, an old idea has resurfaced in popularity. With King Jaime Leopoldo Isabelino Enrique Alejandro Alberto Alfonso Víctor Acacio Pedro Pablo María de Borbón y Battenberg of Spain, Duke of Segovia and Anjou now holding the lands of the new House of Bourbon and the old, he and his supporters are in a prime position to reform the Kingdom of France and place Jaime on its throne while also fusing the two crowns into one Bourbon Empire with Jaime as both Dual King of France and Spain and Emperor of this new imperium. However, there has been some pushback to this idea, particularly among French nationalists and monarchists who resent the plan of a foreigner on ‘their’ throne. Their opinion matters not however, for this divine choice is in the hands of our King and his hands alone."
sprd.109.a:0 "Fuse the crowns and proclaim the Bourbon Empire!"
sprd.109.b:0 "Fuse the crowns and form the Franco-Spanish Union!"
sprd.109.c:0 "All belongs to the Kingdom of Spain!"

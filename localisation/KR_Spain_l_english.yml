### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ALPHONSO_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Alphonso XIII of Bourbon, king from the moment of his birth in 1886, was, to popular contempt, restored to the throne of Spain in 1932. His second reign has been even more tumultuous than his first; republican, Carlist, and socialist dissidents all undermine his authority, and economic growth has stagnated. Spain, under Alphonso, has become a powder keg liable to explode."
POLITICS_JUAN_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Juan of Bourbon inherited a Spain divided, a Spain on the brink of the abyss. As the son and successor to the widely despised Alphonso, his reign will forever be marred by the specter of his father, but it is Juan, not Alphonso, who must lead Spain into a better future."
POLITICS_FRANSISCO_FRANCO_DESC:0 "General Fransisco Franco Bahamonde's widely noted charisma and uniquely Spanish machismo facilitated his quick ascension to leadership of the Acción Popular. Now Franco, as Spain's head of state, has the unenviable task of forging a broken nation anew. For such burden, none can deny that he is uniquely qualified."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_FERRER_DESC:0 "Miguel Cabanelles Ferrer, who commanded Spain's African colonial conscripts in the Rif war has risen to the forefront of Spanish politics through strict discipline and focus. He and his Falange Española, organised more like a paramilitary than a traditional political party, may be the only force capable of bringing some semblance of order to Spain."
POLITICS_GIL_ROBLES_QUINONES_DESC:0 "José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, a committed monarchist and militant Catholic, has risen to prominence in Spain. His firebrand speeches denouncing the Kingdom's enemies while extolling religious virtues might even appear radical to a Carlist; nonetheless, Quiñones stands defiantly at the helm of the troubled Spanish nation."
POLITICS_JAIME_BOURBON_DESC:0 "Jaime of Bourbon, second son of King Alphonso XIII, deaf and once considered likely to renounce any claim to the throne, has been crowned King of Spain. While not lacking in mental faculties, his reputation as an invalid precedes him. This unlikely King, however, must lead Spain into its uncertain future."
POLITICS_JAIME_BOURBON_FRANCE_DESC:0 "Jaime of Borbón, second son of King Alfonso XIII, deaf and once considered likely to renounce any claim to the throne, has managed the impossible with his coronation as King of both Spain and France. As King of Spain he rules as Jaime I, whilst in France he is known by the regnal name of Henri VI, but in everyday conversation many simply refer to him as King Jacques Henri."
POLITICS_CARLOS_PIO_DESC:0 "Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, Prince of Tuscany... now Carlos VIII of Spain. For the first time in over two centuries, a Habsburg is once again King of Spain. Carlos VIII was born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria and of his wife Blanca de Borbón y de Borbón-Parma. His mother was the eldest daughter of Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain. Carlos VIII grew up in the Palais Toskana in Vienna, but moved to Barcelona at a young age. The youngest and furthest right of the Carlist claimants, Carlos VIII demonstrated his right-wing bona fides by joining a nationalist militia in Austria, participating in street fights against syndicalists from Vienna to Madrid. Now leader of the Carlists, Carlos VIII will restore Christ, Honor, and Tradition to Spain."

### Ideas ###
SPR_memories_of_the_republic:0 "Memories of the Republic"
SPR_memories_of_the_republic_desc:0 "On August 11th, 1932, the Second Spanish Republic came to an end, but the Republic lives on in the hearts of many Spaniards. While many malcontents harbour Carlist or Socialist sentiments, many political moderates, especially among military officers, wish to see the end of the incumbent Spanish monarchy. The open defiance of even the centrist elements of Spanish Kingdom are ever present in their continued use of Republican party names, and what little support Accion Popular may have had before the coup, it is now truly gone unless drastic measures are taken to rectify the rapidly crumbling situation."

### Focuses ###

### Pre Civil War Focuses ###

SPR_strengthen_kingdom:0 "Strengthen the Kingdom"
SPR_strengthen_kingdom_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Spain is in dire straits, and many believe our nation will soon descend into civil war. We must consolidate our position and endeavour to thwart impending disaster."
SPR_focus_diplomacy:0 "Focus on Diplomacy"
SPR_focus_diplomacy_desc:0 "We must convene meetings with both the Carlists and the CNT-FAI. With our crisis seemingly unresolvable, perhaps we can at least prevent complete collapse."
SPR_talks_with_CNT:0 "Meet with the CNT-FAI"
SPR_talks_with_CNT_desc:0 "We should meet with the CNT-FAI, Spain's leading socialist organisation. By establishing a dialogue and engaging their demands, we can hopefully dissuade them from open rebellion."
SPR_meet_with_xavier:0 "Meet with Javier"
SPR_meet_with_xavier_desc:0 "Javier, Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne, seemingly desires nothing less than the throne itself. Through discussion and perhaps even concession, we hope to persuade him to abandon his claim, or at least refraim from insurrection."
SPR_plea_for_peace:0 "Plea For Peace"
SPR_plea_for_peace_desc:0 "Spain is rife with unrest, and with civil war seemingly inevitable, the people should hear directly from their king. Hopefully, King Alphonso's personal plea for peace can persuade at least a few Spaniards to abandon violence."
SPR_focus_economy:0 "Focus on the Economy"
SPR_focus_economy_desc:0 "Spain faces massive unemployment and economic hardship. Until we address these issues, the people will continue to be restless and receptive to revolutionary ideas. To prevent civil war, we should implement comprehensive economic reform."
SPR_construction_focus:0 "New Construction"
SPR_construction_focus_desc:0 "Economic revitalisation necessitates the construction of new infrastructure and industry alike. By providing jobs to the jobless, perhaps we can distract their political frustrations."
SPR_civ_production:0 "New Factories"
SPR_civ_production_desc:0 "While state-sponsored factories are never the most efficient, this will be a way for us to get the people working... and for more trade to flow into Spain. Everyone will benefit!"
SPR_new_jobs:0 "Jobs for the People"
SPR_new_jobs_desc:0 "There is so much to be done, but already we have put a great portion of the unemployed back to work. We need to spread the word to the people and reassure them that things are not as dire as they seem. If they only give the kingdom a chance, and time to rebuild, we will prove to them they have made the right choice."
SPR_repurpose_steel_mills:0 "Repurpose Steel Mills"
SPR_repurpose_steel_mills_desc:0 "Steel mills employ many in our nation and make up a vital part of our economy, however desperate times such as these call for desperate measures. Restructuring a few of the steel mills in southern Spain into more generalised factories may be enough to give us the edge if the ongoing tensions bubble over into full blown conflict, even if it may permanently harm the region's steel industry."
SPR_relocate_factories_seville:0 "Relocate Industry to the South"
SPR_relocate_factories_seville_desc:0 "If things in Spain do truly escalate into civil war, our government stands little chance of holding much north or east of Madrid. It has therefore been proposed that we preemptively move as much industry as we can to Seville, due to it being one of the largest urban areas in the nation and an area that will hopefully be far from the frontlines."
SPR_galician_tungsten:0 "Invest in Galicia"
SPR_galician_tungsten_desc:0 "With the situation turning dire, it seems time to already prepare for the inevitable. Galicia's untapped tungsten reserves are plentiful, and is likely to be isolated from any potential conflict within the nation. By focusing on establishing mines to extract this tungsten, vital northern munition factories will be much less restricted by resource constraints."
SPR_focus_military:0 "Focus on the Military"
SPR_focus_military_desc:0 "The civil war is likely to come, no matter what we do. While it would still be best if we found another way, we must also prepare for the worst - and that means bolstering our military for the coming battles."
SPR_mil_production:0 "Increase Arms Production"
SPR_mil_production_desc:0 "The economy will need to take a back seat to new factories which can produce bombs and guns. These we will need first - the rest can come later."
SPR_mil_planning:0 "Review Our Leadership"
SPR_mil_planning_desc:0 "Some might call it a 'purge', but it's very simple - we need to look to the officers who lead our forces, and ensure that those who remain in the higher positions are not secretly loyal to the Carlists or the anarcho-syndicalists. Those who remain must come together and talk of military planning. Let us ensure we have every scenario accounted for before the firing begins."
SPR_fortify_madrid:0 "Fortify Madrid"
SPR_fortify_madrid_desc:0 "Our capital, here in the heart of Spain, is also our weakest link. It can easily be surrounded, and our enemies know that capturing the Royal Family would ensure we instantly lay down our arms. We cannot allow this to happen, even if it means turning beautiful Madrid into a veritable fortress."
SPR_army_of_africa:0 "Recall the Ejército de África"
SPR_army_of_africa_desc:0 "The Ejército de África, the Army of Africa, were fundamental to our success in crushing the native rebellion that rose up in the Rif. It seems unlikely that we will face further rebellion in the region in the short term, and so we are presented with the opportunity to recall General Franco's troops back to Cádiz to prepare for any insurrection on the mainland instead."
SPR_german_assistance:0 "German Material Support"
SPR_german_assistance_desc:0 "While the Spanish army may lack in tank divisions, our friends in Berlin lead the world in tank production and development. By petitioning the Germans to provide direct material support in the form of heavy tanks, we stand to have a significant technological advantage over the rebels, which will certainly aid us in restoring order in the realm."
SPR_rally_kingdom:0 "Rally the Kingdom"
SPR_rally_kingdom_desc:0 "Despite our efforts to preserve peace, civil war has broken out in Spain. Now is the time to rally those loyal to the king, to eliminate our remaining divisions and ensure our nation does not fall to radicals."

SPR_destabilise_kingdom:0 "Destabilise the Kiñgdom"
SPR_destabilise_kingdom_desc:0 "It is clear that we will soon see the end of Gil-Robles's regime and the ousting of his puppet king Alfonso. Instead of attempting to prop up the government any longer, attempts should be made to strengthen those who wish to bring an end to the old order and bring in a new age of Spanish prosperity."
SPR_focus_cnt:0 "Shatter Iberia's Chains"
SPR_focus_cnt_desc:0 "Capitalism has clearly failed the nation of Spain, and the people of Iberia as a whole. Through supporting the cause of CNT-FAI we may be able to eliminate the evils of capitalism in our nation and bring about a new economic system that will directly benefit the common people of the realm."
SPR_cig:0 "Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra"
SPR_cig_desc:0 "Comissió d'Indústries de Guerra, the War Industries Commission, has been established in Catalonia with the stated purpose of ensuring the country is ready for war. Secretly however, the CIG's real purpose is to militarise the areas of Spain most loyal to CNT-FAI in order to arm these revolutionaries in the event of a civil war."
SPR_roads_of_war:0 "The Roads of War"
SPR_roads_of_war_desc:0 "Even during the times of Roman Hispania roads were vital not only to daily life but also to warfare. Without a proper network of roads, and in the modern age railways, supplying and repositioning troops is near impossible. By improving the roads of eastern Spain, we can ensure that any uprising can quickly organise itself into a proper frontline."
SPR_raid_police:0 "Raid Guardia Civil's Armouries"
SPR_raid_police_desc:0 "For a revolution to be successful, its revolutionaries must be armed to oppose those who wish to suppress them. By conducting raids on the armouries of the Guardia Civil, the revolutionaries of the CNT-FAI will be able to both arm themselves and help deprive the Kingdom's armies of combat equipment."
SPR_zaragozan_steelworks:0 "Expand Zaragozan Steelworks"
SPR_zaragozan_steelworks_desc:0 "Zaragoza is home to some of the largest steelworks in the entire nation, and as a result it is also home to some of the strongest unions in all of Spain. As the city will certainly fall under the control of Syndicalist rebels, investing in an expansion of the steelworks there will greatly aid their potential industrial capacity."
SPR_factory_sabotage:0 "Sabotage the Factories of Madrid"
SPR_factory_sabotage_desc:0 "Despite Madrid being the heart of the Kingdom of Spain, many within the city also wish to see the end of the regime. With the aid of factory workers loyal to the socialist cause, we can organise a coordinated campaign of industrial sabotage as a prelude to the revolutionary uprising, preventing the use of any of Madrid's factories by forces loyal to the King."
SPR_focus_carlist:0 "The Righteous Cause of the Carlists"
SPR_focus_carlist_desc:0 "The failure of the Second Republic showed the peoples of Spain that the country will fall apart without the guidance of a strong monarch. These past four years of turmoil have also shown us that Alfonso's incompetence would result in him failing to get people drunk in a brewery, let alone guide them through crisis. We should instead offer our backing to the Carlist claimant to the throne, and hope that a more legitimate Spanish King will lead our nation forward."
SPR_northern_industry:0 "Industrial Expansions in Northern Spain"
SPR_northern_industry_desc:0 "For centuries the stronghold of the Carlist movement has been in the north of Spain. In the event of a civil war, there is no doubt that these territories will remain loyal to the Carlist cause, and any industrial investments in these regions are bound to end up in the hands of their troops."
SPR_defend_burgos:0 "The Stronghold of Burgos"
SPR_defend_burgos_desc:0 "Burgos has been firmly established as the metaphorical stronghold of the Carlist movement, with the government having already lost de facto control of the city. If the Carlist movement is to succeed, Burgos must be transformed into a much less metaphorical stronghold. Defensive positions should be established throughout the city, and even the old castle can be home to anti-air batteries to ensure Javier's ultimate triumph."
SPR_kings_proclamation:0 "The Proclamation of the True King"
SPR_kings_proclamation_desc:0 "No matter who or what they support, it is always painful for the blood of Spaniards to be spilled. While it seems unlikely at this stage that Javier can be peacefully restored to the throne, a proclamation from the true king declaring the end of Alfonso's reign and urging a peaceful transfer of power may convince some Alfonsists to lay down their arms and help save some Spanish lives from being needlessly lost."
SPR_portuguese_aid:0 "Aid From Our Iberian Brothers"
SPR_portuguese_aid_desc:0 "No matter how much we fight or bicker, the peoples of Spain and Portugal are truly brothers and sisters. While the Portuguese government does not yet wish to officially recognise Javier as the king of Spain, those in charge of the Portuguese regime and many subjects of its realm wish to aid the rightful Carlist cause. If we petition our Portuguese friends for support, there is no doubt that they will provide to us as much as they possibly can."

### Post Civil War Focuses ###

SPR_post_civil_war:0 "The Storm Draws to a Close"
SPR_post_civil_war_desc:0 "We have succeeded! The danger is past, and our government has received a mandate from the people which even the Carlists and the anarcho-syndicalists cannot ignore. They might try to rise again, but they know not enough of the people will follow to make a difference. Things are still dire in Spain, but at least we can be assured we have a position of strength from which to work."
SPR_consolidate_spain:0 "Consolidate Spain"
SPR_consolidate_spain_desc:0 "Now is the time to look across the country and see what must be done to pull it together, and to heal the rifts which have formed since the end of the Second Republic."
SPR_replace_alfonso:0 "The Fate of the Crowned One"
SPR_replace_alfonso_desc:0 "Our King Alfonso is in a coma, and it seems there is no returning for him. A regent is not enough - we must decide who is to lead Spain in the years to come."
SPR_arrest_leaders:0 "Deathkneel of Radicalism"
SPR_arrest_leaders_desc:0 "We will never have true peace while radicals are free to foment discord. While they will certainly do their best to rise up, their time is done and they know it. We must capture the worst of the leaders and put them away - this is the path to lasting unity for Spain."
SPR_new_constitution:0 "Extend an Olive Branch"
SPR_new_constitution_desc:0 "Until the CNT-FAI and the Carlists are allowed to be a peaceable part of our government, Spain will never know true unity. We must look to having regular elections, and allow these radicals to run in them. We must not fear what they could do. Rather we must embrace them, and perhaps make peace as much their goal as ours."
SPR_unity_at_last:0 "The Wounds Finally Start to Heal"
SPR_unity_at_last_desc:0 "We have finally bridged the divisions which have torn apart our nation, at least for now. It is time to move forward as a renewed Spain, and for the world to know that we are whole and not to be trifled with."

SPR_rebuild_industry:0 "Rebuild Industry"
SPR_rebuild_industry_desc:0 "Our industrial sector has been heavily damaged by war and a horrid economy - it is time to pull the people together to rebuild and move forward."
SPR_railroads_1:0 "RENFE's Rapid Railway Renewal"
SPR_railroads_1_desc:0 "Before true industry can be started, we need a better transportation network which crosses from one side of Spain to the next. This will be a national undertaking which will require our full effort."
SPR_new_industry:0 "End of the Spanish Intellectual Isolation"
SPR_new_industry_desc:0 "The world of industry and technology has been advancing without us, and we must look outside of Spain to these new methods. Embracing them is the only hope we will ever have of catching up."
SPR_expand_industry_1:0 "The Castilian Boom"
SPR_expand_industry_1_desc:0 "We must focus on expanding our civilian industry, to increase Spain's trade potential and our place as a powerhouse in Europe."
SPR_expand_mines_1:0 "Recovering the Colony of Rio Tinto From Rothschilds"
SPR_expand_mines_1_desc:0 "There are resources yet untapped in Spain, mines that new technology allow us to finally access. We must take advantage of them."
SPR_expand_industry_2:0 "La Naval's Truly Spanish Artillery"
SPR_expand_industry_2_desc:0 "We must continue our focus on expanding our civilian industry, to increase Spain's trade potential and our place as a powerhouse in Europe."
SPR_trade_focus:0 "A New Flota de Indias Brings Prosperity to Spain's Shores"
SPR_trade_focus_desc:0 "We must seek out new markets for Spanish goods, as well as arrange trade treaties to acquire the raw resources we so desperately need."
SPR_recover_black_monday:0 "Recovery from Black Monday"
SPR_recover_black_monday_desc:0 "It has been a long road, and Spain was perhaps harder hit than some. We have weathered the storm, however, and it is time to come out of the other end of it stronger than ever."

SPR_university:0 "Centro de Estudios Universitarios"
SPR_university_desc:0 "Established in 1933 by the Asociación Católica de Propagandistas, the Centro de Estudios Universitarios is a foundation for the development of education. It controlled and supported only a few universities like the Universidad de Deusto, but now it will gain control over the entire educational structure of our country."
SPR_radio_focus:0 "Central Spanish Broadcast"
SPR_radio_focus_desc:0 "Radio is the way of the future - we must centre it here in Madrid, and find a way to turn it to our advantage."
SPR_electronics_focus:0 "Focus on Electronics"
SPR_electronics_focus_desc:0 "Electronics and computers are how we will compete - we must learn ways to keep our information secure, while simultaneously discovering what our enemies plan. We will never gain an advantage if we do not know our enemies are coming."
SPR_united_minds:0 "Uniting Minds of Spain"
SPR_united_minds_desc:0 "We have allowed our differences to impede us for too long. It is time to bring fine Spanish minds together in our universities, and to give them free reign in aiding or great leap forward into the modern era."

SPR_rebuild_command:0 "Rebuild Our National Command"
SPR_rebuild_command_desc:0 "After the military was given free reign over our nation, they expanded the army budget considerably but all those coins flowed straight into the pockets of corrupt officers. Much work is needed for the nation to stand proudly on its two feet again, and the military reform is no exception to this."
SPR_standing_army:0 "Boots On the Ground"
SPR_standing_army_desc:0 "From time immemorial, the wars have been fought by boots on the ground, the noble infantryman in his many, many forms. While modern war may have evolved to be even more lethal and varied, the infantryman is still the backbone of every military worldwide, and as Spain lacks the funds to buy massive amounts of tanks or planes, we must focus on the soldiers as much as we can"
SPR_mobile_army:0 "The Thrill of Maneuvre Warfare"
SPR_mobile_army_desc:0 "While the infantry will obviously remain a priority of our forces, a mobile force is needed to counteract the developments of our enemies. These mobile forces can also be used to suppress rebellions in Africa and the metropole, and can provide a stepping stone for future motorization and mechanization developments, depending on the route we take."
SPR_new_equipment:0 "The Harsh Reality of Materialist Warfare"
SPR_new_equipment_desc:0 "The wars of today are fought in a manner completely different than those our men are used to. Materialistic supremacy, be it in equipment, ammunition or other goods, is needed to defeat our enemies, especially should the conflict bog down like the Weltkrieg did."
SPR_cavalry_focus:0 "Glory of the Cavalry Corps"
SPR_cavalry_focus_desc:0 "The ways of cavalry seemed to be lost when the horrors of Weltkrieg were unleashed on the world, with barbed fire, machine guns and heavy artillery making much of the horseback cavalry completely obsolete. Yet in the harsh terrain of Iberia, horses may very well retain a niche, especially if we were to integrate other units into the cavalry to make the utilization it more suited for a modern war."
SPR_artillery_focus:0 "The Indomitable Human Spirit"
SPR_artillery_focus_desc:0 "Materialistic superiority is all well and good until the men under one’s command abandon their posts and run away or surrender to the enemy. Without harsh and strict discipline, mass utilization of propaganda and focus on the superiority of Spanish spirit above all else, we cannot make sure that our men are suited for the horrors of war. The more traditional officers of the Spanish army support the direction of focusing on mental warfare, and the drilling of our men until their will can shatter that of their enemies."
SPR_fortress_busters:0 "A Hammer to Shatter Any Bunker"
SPR_fortress_busters_desc:0 "Modern warfare is developing into multiple interesting directions, but it would seem that fortifications shall still play a strong role in the ways of war in the future as well. By investing into heavy artillery and modern shell types aimed at defeating the various architectural and engineering developments used in fortification building, we can ensure that our men are never bogged down by enemy bunkers or pillboxes."
SPR_composite_divisions:0 "Composite Divisions"
SPR_composite_divisions_desc:0 "The Republican officers, in their ill-fated reforms, came up with an interesting concept, that of the Composite Divisions. Utilizing far more mobile artillery than the conventional infantry units of our rivals, these divisions would require more supplies to function and a more sophisticated supply infrastructure, but in turn their overwhelming firepower would allow our men to surpass even the hardest targets and most dug-in foes."
SPR_the_queen_on_our_board:0 "The Queen of Our Board"
SPR_the_queen_on_our_board_desc:0 "Infantry must become the jack-of-all-trades in Spanish army, moving quickly from front to front, suppressing enemy through integrated artillery forces all the while retaining its impressive ability to dig in and resist enemy attacks or counter-attacks. As such, we must train our men and officers to make sure that our infantry divisions are the Queen of the chess set, always outmaneuvering their opponents through sheer versatility."
SPR_fire_superiority:0 "Drowning Our Enemies in Shells"
SPR_fire_superiority_desc:0 "Spain’s artillery force has always been rather outdated, but we have recently acquired a large amount of German FK.16 field guns and Austro-Hungarian M.14 Feldhaubitzes to strengthen our fleet of old French and British cannons. With these new additions, we must set up a domestic ammunition factory to supply the needed shells for these new guns, and with their assistance, we can drown any enemy position with endless rounds."

SPR_the_traditional_arm_desc:0 "The defeat at Annual at the hands of the Rifian tribesmen led by Abd el-Krim was by far the worst defeat our nation has suffered in the 20th century. But by investing into colonial guards and upgrading the training practices and equipment of the Spanish Tercio, or foreign Legion, we can ensure that the Rifians, or any other African enemies, will never threaten our colonial possessions ever again."
SPR_cyclists_and_sappers:0 "Broaden the Definition of Cavalry"
SPR_cyclists_and_sappers_desc:0 "Cavalry as it was understood in the last century is very much obsolete by now, but the broad concept of cavalry still serves a purpose. On the one hand, units like Guardia Civil and Carabineros must still utilize horses in the underdeveloped regions of Spain, while on the other regular army cavalry units are still valuable as scouts, anti-partisan forces and colonial guards. But we can expand the definition of cavalry by integrating various sapper and cyclist units into their organization, providing much needed versatility and firepower to the cavalry units. This can further be strengthened with the inclusion of small but powerful portable guns like the Canon d'Infanterie de 37 modèle 1916 TRP, which is very easy to maneuver into position, and while quite obsolete in normal duties, can be utilized better thanks to the mobility of the cavalry units."
SPR_heavy_cavalry:0 "Heavy Cavalry of the Modern Era"
SPR_heavy_cavalry_desc:0 "When cavalry developments were theorized by Spain’s cavalry officer corps, the idea of a heavy cavalry has resurfaced. While the lancers, cuirassiers and cataracts are obviously things of the past, the German experience in the Weltkrieg proved that there was still a need for a mobile, hard-hitting unit such as the Sturmtruppen. However, Spanish officers have argued that this niche could be filled by the cavalry, with horse-mounted stormtroopers dismounting to attack fixed positions similar to their German infantry counterparts, but retaining the ability to fight from a horseback if the tactical situation requires it. While this type of unit must still be experimented upon, it might provide a new breath of life for the cavalry units."

SPR_maneuvre_warfare:0 "Speed Over Stagnation"
SPR_maneuvre_warfare_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg turned into a massive meat grinder especially on the Western Front primarily because both sides lacked the speed and maneuverability required to fight a war in the age of machines and automatic weapons.

SPR_morale_above_all_desc:0 "Modern ‘experts’ may claim that a triumph in warfare is simply a matter of overpowering your opponent through materialistic means, either through the quantity of one’s supplies or the quality of one’s weapons. This is false. War is a battle of wills, where those imbued with true spirit for victory triumph over those who are poorly motivated and trained. As such, we must ensure that the Spanish soldier is ready for war and has the psychological means to best his opponents in this tug-of-war of mental fortitude."

To rectify this flaw, the artillery captain Carlos Ruiz de Toledo, one of the few men in Spain to have experienced tank combat, set out to create the first domestic tank in Spain, the Trubia A4. While the program has vexed and vaned in funding and interest, and has been on hold for quite some time with only a few vehicles built, if we were to give it the funding and attention it deserves, the Trubias could become a new mainstay of Spain’s army."

However, after the war, Fokker returned to his native Netherlands and opened up a factory there, which has utilized Netherlands’ neutrality to supply nations not aligned with the Internationale, Entente or Reichspakt. Possibly the most common of their new products is the Fokker D.XXI, a fighter known to use many innovative design features already adopted by numerous European nations such as Finland and Netherlands itself. We have previously worked with Fokker on many projects, so it would be only natural to contact them once more as we focus on new airframes."

The Dutch concept of a multirole bomber is best seen in the Fokker T.V bomber, which can remain airborne for very long time and loiter around the air space until its qualities are required. Capable of light interception due to its nose-mounted 20 millimetre Oerlikon cannon, it could help ease the burden on our fighters, but simultaneously its decent bombload means that it can fill the role of a tactical bomber if need be. Having such versatile aircraft for use would mean that we require less of them, which is always great news for the strained budget of Spain."

Spain’s engineers, tank crews, artillery crews and cavalrymen could use German expertise in honing their skills to the level of our Central European allies, and in exchange Spanish Africanist officers could share their skills in desert and mountain warfare, taught to them during the bitter days of the Rif war."
SPR_profiteering:0 "Profiting From the Weltkrieg, Again"
SPR_profiteering_desc:0 "Even as we have decided not to pursue an alliance with any of the European or global powers in the current world war, we can still choose to side with one of the factions in it. After all, profiting off the conflict may not be the most morally righteous thing to do, but it will greatly help our economic prospects, and besides, it will provide support for a cause close to our heart."
SPR_hive_of_intrigue:0 "The Spy Capital of Europe"
SPR_hive_of_intrigue_desc:0 "Given that Spain sits right next to the revolutionary bastion of France, we have understandably been the hive of intrigue ever since the French revolution, housing spies from the Reichspakt, Entente, Communards, Russia and various other actors. While our agents are more than displeased at this development, as it keeps their workload high, there are beneficial sides to such oversaturation of spies. By establishing a strong surveillance and counter-intelligence net over Spain, we can gather information from all over the globe in our cities, intercepting messages, radio signals and interrogating captured infiltrators. With their help, we can gather a great deal of intelligence on our foes and neutral powers alike, should we find ourselves in conflict with either."

The Damocles project has shown to the world that the French and British will stop at nothing to spread their revolution, even if it means forging weapons of global destruction to achieve it. Should the inevitable happen and the Communards win their upcoming battle, we must be prepared to fight fire with fire. Our best scientists will be assigned to seek ways into unleashing the power of the atom, even though our programs may take years to get into full swing."

SPR_Revanchism:0 "The Bonfire of Revanchism"
SPR_Revanchism_desc:0 "Other nations of the world seek alliances and guarantees of independence to protect them, but we need no such things. The Spanish people have been humiliated, beaten and humbled for so long now, by our neighbours, imperial powers overseas and even by the colonial subjects of Rif. By exploiting this resentment and desire for revenge deep within the consciousness of the Spanish public, we can set ablaze an inferno of revanchism that allows us to overcome any obstacle, foe or difficulty with ease."
SPR_Hispanism:0 "The Allure of Hispanism"
SPR_Hispanism_desc:0 "After our empire fell, fools and misguided patriots called for violent means to reestablish Spain’s pride, some even dreamed of a reclamation of South American colonies. Yet this would be equal to fratricide, as our former colonies have developed into distinct cultures and populations after becoming independent. We must instead seek to establish a brotherhood of nations united by certain Hispanic characteristic, partly because of our similar values and partly to shield Hispanic nations from those that would seek to impose their own order on these cultures, namely the Americans and Internationale’s dogs."
SPR_Moroccan_Question:0 "Rekindle Africanist Fervour"
SPR_Moroccan_Question_desc:0 "After the loss of Cuba and Philippines, Spanish nationalists turned their advances towards Africa to cope with the loss of our priced possessions elsewhere. Slowly, we captured territory in Sahara and Rif, but while the complete conquest of Maghreb eluded us after the borders of Africa stabilized, the time is perhaps upon us to fully capture rest of Morocco. The German eagle is distracted, and the Moroccan sultan’s realm is perhaps not as stable as he may think."

However, it was not to be, and the Spanish claims slowly faded into obscurity. Now, the German colonial beast of Mittelafrika groans in pain as separatism and corruption runs rampant in its veins, and it’s only a matter of time until it splits apart. When the time comes, we must be ready to strike and finally create our own Central African dominion."

In the aftermath of the Italian collapse, Ferdinando of Bourbon-Two Sicilies was returned to the throne of Two Sicilies by his Austrian and German supporters to stop the blasted Reds from taking over the Italian peninsula. We have been unable to support them much, but given that they are fellow Bourbons, perhaps the time has come to deepen our ties."

However, it is also clear that a large part of Spain is not satisfied with strong centralization, and trying to stomp out the flames of regionalism may simply lead to further trouble down the line. Many politicians and statesmen have proposed their own unique solutions to the problem, but in essence the question comes down to whether regional parties, such as Liga Regionalista or Partido Nacionalista Vasca, are to be allowed to exist in some form, or whether they are to be integrated to the wider network of the ruling party."
SPR_economic_protectionism:0 "Sheltering the Economy From Outsider Threats"
SPR_economic_protectionism_desc:0 "For nearly a century, Spain was very heavily turned inwards, relying mostly on colonial profits, local agriculture and modest expansion of infrastructure, industry and expertise, without focusing too much on international trade. After the Weltkrieg, general Miguel Primo de Rivera saw the fall of the French Republic and the British crown as a sign to shift attention towards the Reichspakt’s massive markets, and Spain attempted to nudge itself into Mitteleuropa by cooperating with German industrial giants. However, the collapse of Black Monday showed us just how horrible the results of such overreliance on other states can cause, and thus the current government of Spain has sought it best to ensure the dominance of Spanish products in local markets through protectionist measures and tariffs on foreign goods, with the main exception being Latin American nations, the long time preferred trade partners of Spain."

In order to ensure complete stability of the new monarchist order, these unions must be brought into far greater collaboration, if not outright oversight of the government, to better facilitate the introduction of social Catholicism state-wide.

The government will delegate local level decision-making to local councils of municipalities, to local guilds and Catholic unions, and on the very lowest level, to families themselves.

Now that we, the true heirs of Jacobinism in Spain and not the Reds beyond the border, are at the helm of the nation, even though we cannot bring true Jacobinism to the Spanish masses with our compromise with the monarchy, we can implement aspects of our radical plans for the Spanish masses, and bring them the light of Jacobinism through a very Spanish lens."

Their influence has been a disaster, as for centuries, they have been the reason why our people remained in abject backwardness, while the world moved towards modernity and enlightenment, and furthermore, they fuel the rise of various reactionary movements seeking to tear down our infantile democracy, from the Carlists, the radicals within the Acción Popular’s Greenshirts to various Catholic reactionary cliques festering within our state’s bureaucracy and army. It is up to us, the Spanish Jacobins, to drag our nation towards modernity by severing these malicious influences from the nation’s politics, through secularization of various state functions such as education, workers’ unions, and anywhere else that the Church could be using against us. Even if the process might be slow and arduous, and we might not be able to fully turn the nation towards the peace and progress that secularism brings immediately, our efforts at least will help clear off the Catholic reactionary taint that plagues our nation."

Even though we must now work within the monarchist system and accept the king as head of state, that does not mean that we are bound to like this change.

It is time to sweep away the corrupted elements of Partido Radical and approach our former comrades with a gesture of goodwill. They may not outright join us, but at least we can reignite collaboration and lead Spain towards a better future, under the united Radical banner.

Perhaps it is time to adopt that term to our use and truly reform the party into what it was meant to be, back to grassroots populism and anti-clericalism. The church has only been a lackey of the crown, and continues to spread its tendrils into places it was never meant to be in. We, young barbarians of Lerrouxism, will finally sweep away the primordial Spain, replacing it with a truly new, radical and enlightened form. Partido Radical may have undergone shifts in its policy for a long time now, and it is clear this direction may lead us to ruin, so it seems that going back to the roots of Lerrouxism is the way forward."

First is Alejandro Lerroux and his Partido Radical, who is popular in urban centres and have been leaning closer to the right-wing despite starting off as a left-wing anti clerical party. While their nature would sound like they would be hard pressed to be in coalition with a Catholic-oriented party like us, they have been known to be ‘loose’ with their incentives, and with a few ‘material’ incentives, they can be persuaded to work with us. Second is the Partido Agrario, a minor monarchist conservative party whose agenda is similar to ours, but appeals specifically to the rural gentry and landowning classes. Because of their minor status, we can strong-arm them into our new right-wing coalition and potentially even absorb them, preventing other, more radically right wing movements from absorbing them, while bolstering our own popularity with the rural gentry.

As such, it is the duty of good Spaniards to liberate these poor souls and unite the peninsula as it was always meant to be, although far more federalized and equal than the ideas of Castilian imperialists were."

SPR_Liberate_the_Minds_of_the_People_desc:0 "CNT-FAI has, for decades, promoted various forms of low-level education and enlightenment programs for the workers. In different clubs, Spanish proletarians and peasants learned both basic skills, such as reading and writing, as well as less conventional but equally important things, such as cultural and ideological teachings. Given the woeful state of Spain’s school system, destroyed by the influence of church on it as well as the serious underfunding by the reactionaries during the last two decades, these adult programs could help us uplift the Spaniards from their intellectual poverty into a new era of rationalism, cultural revival and ideological fortitude."
SPR_Cremate_the_Catholic_Church:0 "Cremate the Arch-Nemesis of Free Will"
SPR_Cremate_the_Catholic_Church_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has spread its tendrils into every aspect of Spanish life, and for very long, they dominated the minds of the Spanish people through education and fear, with the Inquisition terrorizing anyone who would not adhere to the ridiculous delusions of the church. Republicans had a shot at finally cremating the enemy of the people, but the ineffectiveness of their rule made it impossible for them to achieve. We cannot make the same mistake."

SPR_Communalize_Every_Aspect_of_Spanish_Life_desc:0 "While we must nominally adhere to the system in place, there are ways to push Spain towards a direction free of statism and capitalism. We can support the creation of worker’s communes and peasant co-operatives, that will allow them to organize better and abandon the lashes of their bosses to benefit from the fruits of their labours fully. After all, right after the CNT-FAI was allowed to operate in 1936, they proved that the establishment of these styles of communes yielded great results. Thus, the creation and expansion of this system will get our full support, as long as the communes do not serve as havens for extremists and terrorists who would compromise our rule."
SPR_Break_Down_the_Gender_Divide:0 "Destroy Archaic Gender Roles"
SPR_Break_Down_the_Gender_Divide_desc:0 "The anarchists of Spain made a crucial mistake in not supporting the cause of women’s emancipation, and this led to them missing out on the support of CNT-FAI’s women’s section, Mujeres Libres, during many events in the past. We could utilize this failure to our advantage and fully support the equal rights of women as truly free citizens of Spain. Not only will this earn us international support, it will hopefully allow us to integrate, or at least collaborate with, the Mujeres Libres, which can give a considerable boost to our party size and popularity. Besides, such an endorsement will only upset the traditionalists, and their opinion does not influence us one bit."

We may want to eventually get rid of the king in the future, but for now, the continued presence of the monarchy may very well be the one thing keeping the reactionaries from rising up, and for that fact alone, we must establish a cease-fire with the king for the time being."

The idea was axed by the revolutions of France and United Kingdom, but its embers remained in the hearts of Radicals around the world. While Spain did not really have much involvement with the original idea, our aims to become a truly Europeanized party have made the idea of Radical Entente much more appealing to Spanish radicals, and thus we could resurrect the alliance once again, to better support each other in this world ruled by authoritarians and tyrants."

We have since then drifted away from our working class roots, but as we return to populism, we must reward those loyal barbarians of modernity, as these working class supporters were called by Lerroux, so that they feel their contributions are not overlooked by the party leadership.

SPR_Agrarianism_Powered_by_Foreign_Engines_desc:0 "The sad truth is that Spain, as it currently stands, simply cannot sustain the needed demand for tractors, trucks and other vehicles at the scope which our reforms demand. Not only are the production lines unfit for the demands, the designs our factories and forges have created are simply inferior to those produced by the international sellers. As such, the government must sign contracts with anyone willing to produce the machines of agriculture to us, costly as it may be, or otherwise we are forced to slow down the reforms once more."

SPR_Domestic_Designs_Till_Our_Fields_desc:0 "If we are to truly modernize our agriculture and improve the yield of our crops, steps must be taken to utilize machinery in the fields more. Spain is not particularly known for its heavy industry, but even our backwards industry has produced some tractors in the past, such as the chassis that would later get used for the creation of the Trubia tanks. We should invest into local heavy industry, such as Hispano-Suiza, to mobilize Spain’s resources fully in support of the agricultural reform. Only with domestic engines can we ensure full self-reliance, even if it takes a while to get to the level of other European nations."
SPR_Final_Land_Requisition:0 "Final Land Requisition"
SPR_Final_Land_Requisition_desc:0 "So far, our government has been hesitant to nationalize and redistribute land given how powerful local landlords tend to be in Spain, but without significant intervention and seizure of land, the agrarian reform will be left unfinished for all time. Spain’s rural areas cannot thrive if the land is spread out unevenly between its denizens. As such, while it will be a difficult decision politically, and bound to cause ire among the powerful landowner elites, it must be done to finally fix Spain’s grievous issues."
SPR_Local_Conditions_Above_All:0 "Localist Agricultural Planning"
SPR_Local_Conditions_Above_All_desc:0 "Spain’s agricultural prospects are far from homogenous, and the yield of our fields is based on numerous highly local factors. These factors range from the local terrain, given Spain’s highly uneven and varied topography, to the available crops, preferred sizes of estates and available workforce. In some areas of Northern Spain, small farms known as minifundios are simply too unproductive to be worth much, while in Southern Spain, vast estates known as latifundios cause much grief to Spain’s peasants as they own no land of their own and are subject to the whims of the landowners, in addition to quite terrible pay. To alleviate the issue, we must set up programs to promote local means of approaching agricultural reform, from choosing different production methods to providing land to the southern peasants."
SPR_Work_for_Jornaleros:0 "Full-Time Work for Jornaleros"
SPR_Work_for_Jornaleros_desc:0 "Jornaleros are seasonal workers, who often have even worse working conditions than the renters of larger latifundios, and suffer from being stagnated on the societal ladder, unable to break the chain of poverty given their meagre wages, no work security, no pensions and very limited access to jobs outside of the exploitative labour terms provided by landowners. In times of economic crisis, jornaleros are the ones to bear the toughest burden, sometimes resorting to eating grass or tree roots for survival. This cannot continue, the government must open work programs and contracts for jornaleros to escape their abject poverty. This will also push latifundio lords into updating their work terms, since they will have competition for their workforce."
SPR_Second_Phase_of_Reform:0 "The Next Phase of the Reform"
SPR_Second_Phase_of_Reform_desc:0 "The first phase was mostly a look into what must be done, and how the worst of the crisis can be weathered. Now, however, the time has come to fully fix the issues, thanks to the stabilizing political situation in Spain and the newfound political support to finally push the, often controversial, reforms through. Hopefully the matter can finally be set to rest, and Spain’s rural regions finally reformed to a state where they are no longer nesting grounds for social unrest and radicalism."
SPR_careful_first_phase_complete:0 "Finalizing First Phase"
SPR_careful_first_phase_complete_desc:0 "It has not been easy nor cheap, but the Spanish agrarian reform has finally been pushed into the developmental stage, which will eventually allow us to break the decades of negligence that have existed towards agriculture here. While we must put this reform on a pause until the political crisis in Spain has been fully resolved, the hope that our peasants can finally be lifted from their perilous situation has been rekindled in the hearts of the people and politicians, and we hope that this development buys the government some good faith from the rural Spaniards in the difficult days that will soon follow."
SPR_peasant_coop_focus:0 "Peasant Co-Operative Fund"
SPR_peasant_coop_focus_desc:0 "Peasant co-operatives are a relatively new development in Spain, but they have long traditions in the way of rural solidarity and charity organizations. Given that these organizations allow peasants to focus on local issues and fix them, as well as alleviate the poverty brought on by the Black Monday scenario, the co-operatives are absolutely worth supporting for our government. Similarly, they help curtail radical elements such as CNT-FAI anarchists, from wooing more peasants to adopt their extremist positions."
SPR_new_initiatives:0 "Revisiting Republican Initiatives"
SPR_new_initiatives_desc:0 "The Republican legislators and politicians, while far too radical and hasty in its reforms, did have good ideas regarding the implementation of an agrarian reform. While our current administration will never adopt such extreme measures as posited in the 1932 Agrarian Reform bill, which would have seen almost socialist levels of land seizure, other ideas such as the creation of an Ministry of Agrarian Affairs, the massive improvements to be done to Spain’s agrarian tooling, expansion of the irrigation systems and overhauling the local conditions of agriculture are all worthy ideas worth reconsidering."
SPR_agrarian_reform:0 "The Long Overdue Agrarian Reform"
SPR_agrarian_reform_desc:0 "Throughout the 19th century, different ideas for an agrarian reform were attempted in Spain, but only the Second Republic attempted one as more than just a half-hearted gesture towards the peasants. However, like with many things, the Republicans tried too hard and too fast, pushing for a reform that was incredibly controversial in Spain and polarized the republican-socialist coalition, with liberals finding the reforms too harsh and the socialists claiming them to be too lacking. We must avoid their pitfalls while still finding ways to improve the lives of Spain’s farmers and peasants."

### Events ###

### Domestic ###

sprd.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Spain"
sprd.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Spain: Once the greatest of the Colonial Empires, she saw all of her remaining overseas colonies lost after a swift war against the USA in 1898. The conflict left a permanent mark on the Spanish population, the loss of what little had remained of their overseas empire. With the loss of their empire, Spain's populace has become deeply divided.\n\nAfter taking his place on the throne in 1902, King Alfonso XIII seemed keen on regaining Spain's former status as a colonial power by intervening in Morocco. The intervention lasted for a whole decade, and the outcome, while a victory, was not exactly in favour for Spain: Her Moroccan possessions remain a source of permanent unrest and her army was shown to be a remnant of the past. Spain turned in on herself afterwards, remaining neutral during the Weltkrieg, all while the populace's faith in King Alfonso faded and the king lost what little interest he had had in governance. With the King increasingly removed from political matters and a boiling population, Spain was looking ripe for an upheaval of incredible magnitude. A military coup performed by general Primo de Rivera did little to stabilize the situation, but it did place Spain into a limbo of political stagnation. \n\n As a result of this stagnation and complacency, de Rivera was deposed after seven years of rule, and Spain would see a return to democracy the following year. After the General Elections of 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, and Alfonso, even more unpopular thanks to de Rivera’s rule, accepted the will of his people and went into exile. However, the Republic lasted only a short while. The Kingdom was restored by a coup d'état lead by General Sanjurjo just a year later. Still, the memories of the short-lived failure that was the Spanish Republic fuel the regime's opponents left and right.\n\nTo date, there remain deep divisions within Spanish society. On the one hand, the resurgent Carlist Movement, headed by Alfonso Carlos, aims to re-establish the 'True Dynasty' and recreate an integralist Christian monarchy, and on the other, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI seeks the abolition of the Spanish state altogether, and to replace it with a voluntary federation of communes and economic collectives. Yet more, the Republicans of Izquierda Republicana and Derecha Liberal Republicana defiantly contest our right to rule. If the political split is not mended, Spain might even see a Civil War."
sprd.1.a:0 "Let us prevail."
sprd.1.b:0 "Tell me more about Sanjurjada."

sprd.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Spain"
sprd.2.d:0 "The Spanish economy has been tied to Germany since the end of the Weltkrieg. Since France and England's defeat, a good portion of our economy has been centred around exporting materials and goods to the German markets. As such, we can expect a flood of layoffs and closings. Our political foes will undoubtedly use this to their advantage."
sprd.2.a:0 "We did not need this!"

sprd.3.t:0 "Breakdown of our Society"
sprd.3.d:0 "The bickering of both leftist and traditionalist fanatics have been driving the Spanish people into a frenzy, and the sustained economic crisis following Black Monday has poured gasoline onto the embers. Several political groups have called for open protest against our reign."
sprd.3.a:0 "This is not going to end well."

### Carlist Chain ###

sprd.4.t:0 "Carlist Succession Crisis"
sprd.4.d:0 "During the hundred years of its history Carlism was headed by six successive claimants with clear heritage rights; however, in the early 1930s it was evident that the dynasty would soon extinguish. The pretender, Don Alfonso Carlos, was eighty-two years old upon assuming the claim in 1931 and had no issue. More troubling was the fact that Don Alfonso Carlos appeared to lean towards reconciliation with the Isabelline kings currently occupying the Spanish throne. After the death of Don Alfonso Carlos, King Alfonso XIII of Spain will be the senior male descendant of Carlos IV.\n\nNevertheless, the majority of Carlists consider Alfonso disqualified because he does not share the Carlist ideals and because Spanish law excludes from succession the descendants of those who commit treason against the king, as Carlists deem Alfonso's male-line ancestors to have done when Francisco de Paula recognized the reign of Isabella II. Duke Javier of Bourbon-Parma is the most likely successor to Don Alfonso Carlos as he currently acts as the elderly claimant's representative in Spain. Alternatively, Archduke Karl Pius von Habsburg claims to be the legitimate Carlist claimant through the rights of his mother, Infanta Blanca. Both refuse to recognize the present King of Spain."
sprd.4.a:0 "The Carlists must be plotting something."

sprd.5.t:0 "Javier de Borbón-Parma y de Braganza"
sprd.5.d:0 "Javier de Borbón-Parma is considered the natural successor to the Carlist cause due to his close relationship with Don Alfonso Carlos de San Jaime. The second son of the last reigning Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Duke Javier was torn between the great powers of Europe during the Weltkrieg. Initially planning to enlist in the Austrian army to avenge his cousin Franz Ferdinand, plans changed when his adoptive France declared war on Austria-Hungary. After the Weltkrieg, Duke Javier retired to Vienna and avoided politics until the 1930s. It was in Vienna that he fostered his relationship with Don Alfonso Carlos and took an interest in Spanish legitimism, i.e. Carlism. In 1934, he moved to Spain to act as the royal octogenarian's representative. Javier is devoutly Catholic and committed to legitimism, though some far-right Traditionalists question his absolutist bona fides.\n\nSince coming to Spain, he has been a thorn in the side of King Alfonso XIII and his government. His political profile and popularity are troubling. Yesterday, he gave a speech arguing that the Kingdom of Spain needs to work together with its Catholic neighbours. He proposed an economic bloc with other Mediterranean nations to support each other through free trade."
sprd.5.a:0 "He is a threat. Keep him under surveillance."

sprd.6.t:0 "Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena y de Borbón"
sprd.6.d:0 "Born in Vienna, the youngest son of Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria, Archduke Karl Pius von Habsburg might seem like an odd choice for Spanish succession. Yet, through his mother, Infanta Blanca de Borbón, Karl is the grandson of Carlos VII, the last legitimate Carlist King of Spain. Unlike Duke Javier, Carlos Pío has lived in Barcelona since the 1920s. He returned to Austria briefly in the early 1930s, where he joined nationalist causes and participated in street fights with syndicalists. A significant minority of the Carlist movement believes that Carlos Pío is the natural and legitimate claimant to the throne of Spain, due to his mother's lineage and his rightist views.\n\nThe Carlist doctrine of Dual Legitimacy requires that a potential King descend legitimately from Carlos V and maintain 'legitimacy of execution' through a commitment to Spanish Traditionalism and Carlist principles. As the male line of Carlist Bourbons will be extinct when Alfonso Carlos dies without issue, descent must by necessity track through the eldest female, Infanta Blanca, and through her to her son, Carlos Pío. Carlos Pío has older brothers, but they have disqualified themselves through morganatic marriages and abdications. Carlos Pío, on the other hand, remains unmarried and has a demonstrated commitment to Traditionalism. The Archduke's supporters, known as Carloctavistas, already refer to him as Carlos VIII."
sprd.6.a:0 "A Spanish Habsburg?"

sprd.7.t:0 "Alfonso Carlos de Borbón Dies"
sprd.7.d:0 "Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, and the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, died today in Vienna at the age of 87. He was killed in an automobile accident while crossing the street. His passing, expected at his age, but no less sudden, has thrown the Carlist factions of Spain into chaos. The current king of Spain, Alfonso XIII, is now by right the head of the Capetian dynasty. Alas, the Carlist movement rejects any compromise with the traitorous Isabelline dynasty. They are divided between Duke Javier and Archduke Carlos, a pair of foreigners! The will of Alfonso Carlos indicates that Duke Javier should be regent of the Carlist movement until a legitimate claimant is chosen."
sprd.7.a:0 "Why don't they like me?"

sprd.8.t:0 "Carlist Ambitions for the Throne"
sprd.8.d_javier:0 "Following a series of diplomatic successes abroad, the Carlist representative, Don Javier, has begun giving speeches throughout northern Spain, the Basque Country, and Catalonia. In this, he is aided by Manuel Fal Conde, one of Carlism’s greatest political tools, a master organizer. Groups of far-right young men gather in the north, under the guise of Catholic faith and a commitment to monarchy. His Majesty’s Guardia Civil assures him these are truthfully rebellious cells; Carlist militias preparing to challenge the throne. Don Javier uses his new publicity to question the rule of King Alfonso XIII."
sprd.8.d_carlos:0 "Following recent diplomatic successes abroad, the Carlist claimant Archduke Carlos Pío has begun touring the nation, particularly in the Basque Country and Catalonia, promoting the Carlist cause. The young, charismatic usurper-in-the-making is aided by the politician Jesús de Cora y Lira and the young, magnetic Requeté, Jaime del Burgo Torres. He uses his new platform to press his claim to the throne of Spain as Carlos VIII."
sprd.8.a:0 "Time to ban Carlist organizations."
sprd.8.b:0 "Arrest him and his followers!"
sprd.8.c:0 "Attempt to reconcile with the Carlists."
sprd.8.e:0 "Ignore him."

sprd.9.t:0 "Bombing!"
sprd.9.d:0 "Last night, one of our commanders was killed in a bombing incident."
sprd.9.a:0 "Curses!"

sprd.10.t:0 "Carlist Protests"
sprd.10.d:0 "Supporters of the Carlist movement have taken to the streets to protest our government, calling our recent policies 'godless'."
sprd.10.a:0 "Disperse them."

sprd.11.t:0 "Assassination!"
sprd.11.d:0 "Yesterday, late at night, after a long day debating the status of our country's internal security, our current administration's Chief of Security, Miguel Ponte Mansó de Zúñiga, was gunned down on his way home from work."
sprd.11.a:0 "May he rest in peace."

sprd.12.t:0 "Assassination!"
sprd.12.d:0 "Last night, José Ungría Jiménez, the Minister of Intelligence, was killed by a car bomb on his way home from work!"
sprd.12.a:0 "Oh my."

### CNT-FAI Chain ###

sprd.14.t:0 "The CNT-FAI protests"
sprd.14.d:0 "CNT-FAI supporters have taken to the streets to protest our government's policies"
sprd.14.a:0 "Disperse them."

sprd.15.t:0 "CNT-FAI launch nationwide protests"
sprd.15.d:0 "In response to our banning of their effort to organise the unemployed the CNT have launched a national protest campaign."
sprd.15.a:0 "Send out the police!"
sprd.15.b:0 "Allow them to organise."

sprd.16.t:0 "Arresting the Leaders of the CNT-FAI"
sprd.16.d:0 "Our police moved to arrest the leaders of the CNT-FAI, but we have found none. There must be a rat in our police! The leaders are probably underground or out of the country"
sprd.16.a:0 "Find the rat and establish a secret police!"
sprd.16.b:0 "We knew this would happen."

sprd.17.t:0 "Disbanding the CNT-FAI"
sprd.17.d:0 "Our police and military have moved to disband and arrest as many CNT-FAI members as possible. However, we have found almost none. They appear to have fled or gone into hiding"
sprd.17.a:0 "This shows how weak they are!"

sprd.18.t:0 "CNT-FAI Takes the Stage"
sprd.18.d:0 "The CNT-FAI seem to have taken our positive governmental stance into their actions well, organising rallies and events for the many unemployed or laid off workers of Spain. While this will obviously increase their popularity and contest our rule, on the other hand it does give these men and women something to do. Idle hands, after all, are the Devil’s workshop, and while many among our supporters may consider the anarchists minions of the Devil, for the less hysterical members of Accion Popular this newfound activity has largely been a welcome one over the terror campaigns of the past."
sprd.18.a:0 "Watch them carefully."

sprd.19.t:0 "From Theory to Action"
sprd.19.d:0 "The CNT-FAI have announced that they are opening a series of public projects and mining operations along the southern coast. Organised in a communal system, these operations are loosely controlled from their headquarters in a small town called Agua Amarga. Our spies report that various anarchist theories are put into action there, but it seems to be largely agricultural and economical in nature, not militant. Officers of Guardia Civil are ordered to remain on standby, but it is perhaps best to let the anarchists play around with their theories for now."
sprd.19.a:0 "Let them work."

sprd.20.t:0 "The Results are In"
sprd.20.d:0 "The CNT-FAI's operations in the southern part of our country are steadily reaching their planned production. The organisation has put the workers to good use. Everything seems to be going very well. Obviously this will make them even more popular, but on the other hand it signals CNT-FAI’s dedication to our challenge for them, to resolve our differences in the elections and not through violence."
sprd.20.a:0 "Perhaps we can give peace a chance."


### Elections ###

sprd.21.t:0 "A Shot Rings Across Spain"
sprd.21.d:0 "Motorcade speeds through the Spanish countryside, sending dust flying high into the air. The imposing automobiles of the Guardia Real lead the way, the symbols of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy easily noticeable on the cars from far away. The few peasants working close to the road watch in silence as the king passes after the Guard’s cars, driving his beloved Hispano-Suiza personally. The times where king’s passing would’ve prompted cheers and celebration have long passed in Spain, but that does not concern the king for now. The toll of last few weeks has begun to take hold over the King, and despite the immense protests of his advisors over security concerns, Alfonso has ignored them to indulge in a rare moment of freedom..\n\n The euphoria of finally being removed from the constant politicking and backstabbing that dominates the court is overwhelming. While the king is a man of intrigue through and through, even he has his limits. As the cars rumble past an unassuming hovel, a single figure emerges from it, just as the vehicles of Guardia Real turn the corner and disappear from view. As Alfonso speeds into view, the figure raises a crude submachine gun, much to the horror of the king. As the gun fires, the king’s car veers out of the road and into the ditch nearby. The following Guardia Real car slams into the assailant and kills him immediately, his blood seeping into the thirsty earth under him. The Guards rush to help their liege, battered and unconscious, and rush him to the nearest hospital, but the situation appears grim."
sprd.21.a:0 "Mierda, Spain may truly be lost now."

sprd.22.t:0 "Alfonso is in a Coma"
sprd.22.d:0 "The king’s situation has recovered for the better, in the sense that he may no longer die in the next few hours. We have also identified the assailant as a member of the clandestine Nosaltres Sols, a Catalonian terrorist group seeking to free Catalonia from the rule of Spaniards. While the time to punish the regicide attempt must come soon, we have an even more pressing matter. The king is in a coma, and there is no sign of him waking up, and our enemies gather to utilize our precarious position. The anarchists have organised mass rallies in the countryside to pressure us into elections, the Republicans have united under Manuel Azaña Diaz to demand a return to democracy and even the perfidious Carlists have made a public declaration that unless an election is held to settle Spain’s internal issues, the matter will be settled on the battlefield as is tradition for these pretenders. Accion Popular leadership has been panicking ever since the assassination attempt, but have now come to an agreement on the matter."
sprd.22.a:0 "Call for free and open elections, including any party that seeks to participate."
sprd.22.b:0 "Call for elections, but with only the parties from centre and moderate right."
sprd.22.c:0 "The King is not dead! Do nothing!"

sprd.23.t:0 "Spain Arrives at Its Moment of Truth"
sprd.23.d:0 "The people of Spain rejoiced as news of immediate election arrived, and after some last-minute campaigning, the elections have been held. With final results arriving from their respective regions, the fate of Spain is revealed. Despite the incredible fracturing our society has endured over the past decades, this election may finally solve the issues once and for all. While many parties participated, only three power blocks could realistically hope to win. The CNT-FAI rallied the Spanish left, putting aside their numerous differences with the likes of BOC and PSOE for a brief period to bring about a revolution through election. The Carlists, despite their incredible disdain for elective democracy, have similarly aligned various groups of Spanish right into their movement temporarily, and now seek to dislodge the Bourbons from rule once and for all."
sprd.23.a:0 "The Acción Popular manages to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat!"
sprd.23.b:0 "CNT-FAI brings about a democratic revolution!"
sprd.23.c:0 "The Carlists restore tradition to Spain!"


sprd.24.t:0 "Elections - cancelled"
sprd.24.d:0 "Due to the civil war the elections have been officially cancelled"
sprd.24.a:0 "This is not good!"

sprd.25.t:0 "Riots!"
sprd.25.d:0 "When we called for elections that disallowed the CNT and Carlists we knew there would be issues... Now the day before elections there are riots in several parts of the country"
sprd.25.a:0 "Call off the election - Martial Law is declared."
sprd.25.b:0 "Nothing will stop this election."

sprd.26.t:0 "The Election Day Disaster!"
sprd.26.d:0 "This Election day has been marred by countless acts of violence, 4 polling places have been bombed, over a thousand people have been killed in other violence. Entire groups of Police and Military troops have disappeared"
sprd.26.a:0 "This was a mistake!"

sprd.27.t:0 "The Fate of The House of Bourbon"
sprd.27.d:0 "The war is over and the King is still in a coma. With this precarious situation on our hands, we must decide who will lead Spain to its uncertain future. Most within our government support the claims of Infante Juan. A small contingent of monarchists however, support Infante Jaime. Some officers believe it was the House of Bourbon that brought Spain into this crisis and we would be much better off without it. Should we crown one of Alfonso’s sons as the new king of Spain or declare a new Spanish Republic?"
sprd.27.a:0 "Infante Juan is crowned as Juan III."
sprd.27.b:0 "No, perhaps the time of the kingdom is over."
sprd.27.c:0 "Infante Jaime is crowned as Jaime I."

sprd.28.t:0 "Restoring the Monarchy"
sprd.28.d:0 "After the assassination of Juan, a void was left in the terms of a Royal Regent. Now Juan's older brother Jaime has returned from abroad and is requesting his rightful place as the heir to our Kingdom."
sprd.28.a:0 "Name him as Alfonso's successor."
sprd.28.b:0 "No, perhaps the time of the kingdom is over."

sprd.30.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] wants to join the Reichspakt"
sprd.30.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has announced recently that it wishes to join the Reichspakt. How shall we respond?"
sprd.30.a:0 "Absolutely, they are welcome."
sprd.30.b:0 "It's not a good idea."

sprd.31.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] wants to join the Entente"
sprd.31.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has announced recently that it wishes to join the Entente. How shall we respond?"
sprd.32.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agrees"
sprd.32.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed that [Root.GetNameDef] will be a useful addition to their faction. An alliance between the two nations has now been created."
sprd.32.a:0 "We have thrown our lot in with theirs..."
sprd.33.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses"
sprd.33.d:0 "Diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] have refused any offers of alliance or requests for the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] independence. We are on our own."
sprd.33.a:0 "So be it."

sprd.34.t:0 "Civil War Averted!"
sprd.34.d:0 "Despite violence held during the election and immediate protests which have sprung up throughout Spain as the results are announced, it's clear: the Acción Popular remains in power, and the kingdom remains whole. The entire nation is breathing a sigh of relief, and despite obvious attempts by Carlists and CNT-FAI supporters to stir up trouble, everyone knows that the election was fair. They will not have the support for the uprising they crave, not now and perhaps not ever."
sprd.34.a:0 "Freedom has won the day."

sprd.35.t:0 "The CNT-FAI are Victorious!"
sprd.35.d:0 "Though some question the veracity of the vote, there can be no question to most that the election was fair...and the CNT-FAI have eked out a narrow victory at the polls. The royal advisers suggest that the results of the election need not be abided by. Indeed, should the government be turned over to the anarcho-syndicalists, it's very likely the royal family will be immediately deposed if not outright endangered."
sprd.35.a:0 "No, we will abide by the result."
sprd.35.b:0 "Invalidate the election!"

sprd.36.t:0 "The Carlists are Victorious!"
sprd.36.d:0 "Though some question the veracity of the vote, there can be no question to most that the election was fair...and the Carlists have eked out a narrow victory over the anarcho-syndicalists and our own Acción Popular. The royal advisers give word that the Carlist pretender is already on his way to the palace, and if the regent wishes to invalidate the election results he must move quickly. There is, after all, no telling whether the Carlists will keep their word and show mercy to the royal family."
sprd.36.a:0 "No, we will abide by the result."
sprd.36.b:0 "Invalidate the election!"

This is obviously unacceptable. The majority of Carlists support the final wishes of Don Alfonso Carlos and will follow the regent, Don Javier as the next leader of the Carlists. A significant minority with support drawn especially from the Carlist militias of the northeast, the Requetés, support the claim of Archduke Carlos Pío de Habsburgo-Lorena. Don Javier knows the Carlist revolution will not succeed without the Navarrese and Basque Requetés, but is loathe to come to an accord with Carlos Pío. As a last resort, a Grand Assembly has been called in Pamplona, to be attended by leading Carlists. They will decide on the legitimate heir to the Carlist claim. Who will succeed? Don Javier or Archduke Carlos Pío?"

In order to help tip the balance of the war against the Syndicalists, Spain has proposed a temporary lease of Gibraltar as a German naval base for the duration of the war. Not only would control of Gibraltar provide a fortified position in the Mediterranean, but it would also grant us control over the strait and allow us to easily block any enemy ships from entering the Mediterranean. In exchange, Spain simply requests a simple monetary transfer as compensation and to pay for any post-war reconstruction that may be needed after our lease expires."

Now that Spain has finally entered the 20th century and left behind the abhorrent relic of the past that was the previous regime, new elections have been organized to properly represent the will of the people. Dozens of parties, both regional and country-wide, will take part, though in truth only six are likely to win the elections. On the left, the reorganized PSOE socialists, united under the moderate socialist Julian Besteiro, run on a platform of heavy-handed labour reforms, redistribution of land to those that work it, and deepening of trade and diplomacy with the Third Internationale.\n\n Representing the more centrist left-wingers is Manuel Azaña's Izquierda Española, moving further left thanks to an electoral alliance of various small socialist movements and regional parties. They represent the middle class but with sympathies to the workers too, and seek to bring about a just, equal Spain, where education and institutions are removed from church influence. To their right, representing left-leaning liberals, is Union Española led by Diego Martinez Barrio. While unlike to win, due to the influence of Azaña's party, the growing resentment towards Alejandro Lerroux's radicals could lead to their supporters turning towards the more traditionalist left-wing Radicals under Martinez Barrio.\n\nThe centre-rights are dominated by the two giants of the original republican movement, which have nonetheless taken very different routes. Known for their moderate stance on most matters, despite the name, the Radicals have sought to repair their reputation following the collapse of the authoritarian regime. Known for collaborating with the monarchists and even the Catholics despite their previous anti-clerical attitudes, Lerroux is not expected to win unless his party pulls of a miracle and manages to reinvent its image. This is not helped by the fact that the president of the Second Republic, Niceto Alcala-Zamora, and his Derecha Liberal party is increasingly popular after its leader returned from exile in Uruguay. Their party runs on a platform of liberal conservatism, secularism and respect for the regional minorities of Spain.\n\n Finally, the Accion Popular represents the most right-wing party, seeking to capitalize on the open defiance to Catholic church most other parties, supporting more traditional and even at times authoritarian currents in the Spanish society. Advocating for a society built on so called social Catholicism, large role of the king and church in society, extensive centralization of Spain especially in regards to the many minorities and resistance to socialists and republicans. Many view the party with suspicions give its role in the royal dictatorship, but its new leader José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones has agreed to respect the new monarch's wishes for democracy, though how credible these claims are remains to be seen."

After their loss in the "mandate' elections of 1937, the movement seemed to honour the agreement at first, but parts of CNT and FAI eventually regressed back into using terror tactics against their class enemies. However, given the electoral success of moderate socialists in PSOE, and their shown ability to achieve many rather radical reforms without revolutionary means, there are those within CNT-FAI who have become disillusioned to the extreme methods of the party and union.\n\nÁngel Pestaña and his followers inside the political movement have published the so-called Manifiesto de los Treinta, which condemned these means and called for the party to instead focus its attention to obtaining legal credibility. He stressed the successes of PSOE in similar strategy, and as a long-time advocater for CNT-FAI to become a true political party as well as first-hand witness to the horrors of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia decades ago, his words managed to convince many in the ranks of the anarchists.\n\nWhile  many hardliners will not accept this shift, a considerable bulk of CNT-FAI members have joined the new Partido Sindicalista, Pestaña's new party. The new party has announced that it will run in the coming elections, and while not a forerunner for election winner, they may have a chance at victory if enough anarchists abandon their previous anti-political attitude and turn up to the polls to support their parliamentary comrades. Right-wing parties, principally Accion Popular, Derecha Regional Agrario and the Carlists have condemned them as agents of Communards, but the king and most of Cortes have allowed them to run as part of the democratic process, especially considering how it weakens the terrorist side of CNT-FAI."

One such movement, and the most likely to dislodge the former from their seat as primary monarchist party, is Partido Nacionalista Español. Returning from the brink of irrelevancy, it's fiery denouncement of republican and socialist values has brought it many supporters. Backed by the Catholic church and agrarian peasants from the more conservative regions of Spain, the party seeks to eradicate regionalism by centralizing the Kingdom, defeat the socialist parties by utilizing its supporters in the Sindicatos Libres to harass them, and finish off any republican sentiments by allying with like-minded centre- and extreme-right parties to form a cohesive bloc against anything that would threaten the traditional Spain.\n\nWhile not publicly endorsed by the king, its leader José María Albiñana has announced that he wishes to expand the king's powers closer to their original scope, although the party leader has somewhat tried to moderate this rhetoric to not lose any credibility inside the democratic system. The party views corporatism, social Catholicism and uniting monarch as the cornerstones of its program, and while not anti-democratic per se, many view it with suspicion of harbouring dangerous authoritarian viewpoints. Whether the party will be a death knell to Spain's young democracy or not will be seen, though first this party must pass the hurdle of defeating its rivals in the elections."

In the rural areas, as well as whole regions such as Asturias, small-scale revolts from the likes of CNT and FAI are happening constantly, the anarchists attacking estates and police stations in a hit-and-run fashion. The king and his allies in Accion Popular and the military have deployed military forces to quell the riots, but these units are used sparingly, as to avoid the conscripts from joining forces with the rioters. The perfidious republicans are arranging protests even in areas where radical riots are not a problem. And in the overseas territories, especially Moroccan coastal areas, the devious Moroccans have sent agitators and saboteurs over the border, driving the locals to a frenzy. The military is unable to deploy the loyalist Spanish legion in the metropolitan areas because of the fear of Moroccan revolt. However, despite the dire straits Spain is in right now, it seems that the emergency measures taken after the election by the monarchists have paid off, as the socialists and republicans are split between the insurrectionists and those who honour the democratic mandate of Accion Popular.\n\n However, in the chaos the central government did not realize the lack of news from the minority regions of Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia. In a surprise declaration, the three regions denounced the centralist policies of the monarchy and its military allies, and claimed that Spain has fallen back to its reactionary abyss, stomping on the rights of its peoples just to enrich Castile. Despite all the promises, autonomy to the minority peoples of Spain was never delivered in full. Now, the Basques, Catalans and Galicians would join each other in solidarity and officially separate from the dying empire of Castile and its chauvinistic domination of sovereign peoples. The three separatists called for other peoples’ of Spain to seize the moment as well, and free themselves from the Bourbon tyrants once and for all. The central government, overstretched as it was with internal strife, could not respond to this new threat, and the local Guardia Civil units retreated from the regionalist areas, for the time being."

Their frenzied attacks whittled down the morale of even the bravest Spanish soldiers, and now, general Mola has ordered a full scale retreat, as our supply routes are pillaged by anarchist guerillas.

Now, however, it seemed that their parties had managed to find some semblance of unity, and this unity brought them resolve to resist our attacks one after another. In the winding mountain paths leading further into Galicia, snipers and militia irregular ambushed us before retreating further in, stretching the nerves and resolve of our men to the snapping point. General Vega was forced to call for a full retreat after a devastating battle at the Samos Monastery, where Galician militias managed to delay our forces long enough for their reinforcements to pin us down and crush most of the local division. The politicians of Accion Popular have called for the king to crush the pitiful insurgents, but seeing the state of Spain, the king has agreed with the military’s policy of admitting defeat."

The king, seeing the writing on the wall, followed in his father’s footsteps, and has boarded a plane headed for Portugal earlier this morning. With the country spiraling out of control, a group of generals have stepped in once more to stop this chaos from leading to total eradication of Spain. Led by the populist general Sanjurjo, the new regime has denounced all enemies of Spain, from anarchists, socialists and republicans all the way to the separatists. The new junta, however, is not exactly united in vision, and the bickering of the generals has made any proper counter-attack against the separatists possible.\n\n Realizing this, general Sanjurjo has gathered the generals for a meeting in the military headquarters of Madrid, seeking to settle the leadership question of the new Spain once and for all. This decision is hardly surprising, as Sanjurjo has immense amount of political clout due to the success of his Sanjurjada, the revolt that ended the republican regime in 1932. However, his rule is far from absolute, as many in Spain and among the military blame him for all the mistakes of the last few years. Contesting his rule are a selection of generals, all with their own visions for Spain. Perhaps the most peculiar character is the leader of the Spanish Legion, José Millan-Astray, who is known as an eccentric fanatic, with some claiming him to be borderline insane due to drug use and war injuries. His polar opposite is Emilio Mola, who is known for his calculating nature and usage of extreme means while working as a chief security official of the Spanish republic and later, kingdom. Camilo Alonso Vega, Juan Yague and Francisco Franco Bahamonde represent more traditional junta members, following many of the tenets established in the Primo de Rivera era, though Alonso Vega and Juan Yague are willing to go further on many issues than Franco. Yague is also known for his sympathies towards Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, a far-right party espousing Hispanist ideology.  Finally, the junta could simply install the son of Primo de Rivera, José Antonio, as the leader. While not a military man, the young Primo de Rivera has been remarkably active in politics of Accion Popular and enjoys a great deal of influence among the far-right of Spain.

The party now leans more towards typical Christian democrats, just with a few more aces up its sleeve and a considerably bolstered radical wing. The king himself has praised this development, claiming that without Accion Popular’s commitment to democracy, the new crown could not have legitimized its rule as easily, and by creating a more moderate version of themselves, Accion Popular has managed to convince many of even Spain’s royal house being able to adjust for the times as well."

sprd.122.d:0 "The 19th century was very difficult for Spain in general, but few events of that turbulous era left such a mark on Spanish public consciousness as the Spanish-American war of the mid-1890s. The loss of our last overseas colonial holdings in America and Asia, namely the islands of Cuba and Philippines, sent Spanish public into a deep crisis. Our society had been based on imperial glory, colonial pride and the Restoration era circulation of parties, known as el turno pacífico, where the Spanish Liberal and Conservative parties alternated in the government. When the colonies were lost, the entire Spanish economy and cultural basis pulled the plug on this alternating system and revealed the many flaws in it, which in turn lead to academic opposition and protests. These academics would be the very beginnings of Generation ‘98, and while this movement started as a simple protest, it soon evolved into complete regeneration of Spain’s culture, ranging from literature to music. The movement spawned such titans of Spanish culture as Miguel de Unamuno, Pio Baroja and Joaquin Costa.\n\n The generation was highly influenced by the ideas of German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause, who was best known for his arguments for academics to be free of dogmatic thinking, and to some extent, his ideas on divinity more as an universal essence rather than as a personalist mythical figure. The influence of Krausism also helped shape the movement towards more egoist direction. The generation demanded change in Spain’s political scene, and that itself created an atmosphere of acceptance towards radicalism, aimed at changing the stalled political scene and the impotent reforms brought about by el turno pacífico. Like most generations in Spain’s history, Generation of ‘98 was not particularly ideologically aligned, instead inspiring actors from left-wing revolutionaries all the way to the right-wing traditionalists, all calling for Spain to regenerate and rejuvenate itself, though the means to achieve this differed greatly from actor to another. Accion Popular, also greatly inspired by this movement and two of its most prolific writers, Ramiro de Maeztu and Joaquin Costa, has started a program aimed at promoting the ideas and works of the generation, with of course the left-wing ideologues excluded from the program. The leadership of the party hopes that this increased attention will bring about a more patriotic Spanish youth eventually."

sprd.123.d:0 "Despite our successful electoral results and a rather tremendous reimagination of Accion Popular, the party still remains as a big-tent for various monarchists, both reactionary and liberal, as well as agrarians, Christian democrats and even fringe legionaries. These factions have generally agreed upon a policy of Christian conservatism and moderate monarchism, but as time passes, the factionalism is starting to tear us apart. Leadership of the party, as well as the king, finds this situation untenable. The king has urged us to pick a direction before we face oblivion at the hands of our more ideologically rigid rivals. This decision, however, is bound to be a hard one. We can obviously fully dedicate our party program to Christian democracy, placating the moderates and centre of our party, but losing support from the more radical factions. There are however other, less conventional choices proposed by other party members.\n\n Our prime minister, José María Gil-Robles, has long been an admirer of Austrian right-wing demagogue, Engelbert Dolfuss, and the Austropopulist ideology he champions in the heartland of Catholicism. This choice would be a radical one, as Austropopulism has hardly been tried in a democratic system and its critics consider it wholly incompatible. However, the corporatist, nationalist and fiercely Catholic nature does draw some of the most firebrand monarchists within our party towards this conclusion.\n\n Others, less extreme members of AP seek to steer the movement towards more traditional conservatism, following the Maurist ideology of strong state intervention, moderate Spanish nationalism, social Catholicism and the integration of some liberal ideals into the Spanish right. While less radical than Austropopulism, Maurism is also somewhat marred by the many directions the movement has been pulled towards by various politicians, such as Antonio Goicoechea and Jose Calvo Sotelo. However, Maurism under Gabriel Maura, Antonio’s son, is considered the current mainstream form, and is likely to be the most palatable to democratic Spain."

While Spain is yet to reclaim the glory days of the empire, we have thwarted its descent into chaos and ruin, and from here, we can only take it to greater heights! Spain is back as a global power, and like the armadas of the past, our reach will only grow from here, destroying socialists and agents of false gods as we march onwards. While we may not hold the absolute power we did years ago, Accion Popular has shown itself adaptive enough to fit into the defines of democracy, although very much in our own way.

But the coup of 1932 saved Spain from this terrible fate, and for four years, General Jose Sanjurjo allowed us to rule Spain and shape it in our image. While that period was mired by conflicts within Accion Popular, instability caused by terrorists, both the blasted separatists and the demonic anarchists, and the weak position of our king and government due to military interference, it was also the height of our power thus far. Yet with two electoral victories under our belt in a very short span of time, first against our arch-nemesi, the Carlists and anarchists, and then against the republicans, we have shown thoroughly that the Spanish people trust our rule above all else. \n\nWith this newfound mandate, and the weakened grip of the military on Spanish affairs, we can finally set upon fulfilling the wishes of AP leadership. Spain shall be united and freed from the insidious influence of syndicalists and Carlists alike, and the corrupting influence of republicanism will be cremated once and for all. The various regional parties that constitute the Accion Popular have rallied under the banner of Spanish monarchist right, and we have even been bolstered by defectors from the Carlist cause, so AP is finally strong enough to contest even the strongest ex-republican party in congress. While we are going to be more limited than before due to the democratic system, it is a compromise we have been forced to take.

sprd.126.d:0 "As the new constitutional monarchy solidifies in Spain, the parties themselves are equally shifting in their policies to fit this new system. One of the most curious cases to observe has been the rebranded Partido Radical led by Alejandro Lerroux, which in the past was a thorn in the kingdom’s side due to its incredibly strong anti-clericalism and negative stance on the monarchy. Lerroux himself was implied to be part of many assassination attempts on king Alfonso even though nothing was ever confirmed. While his party would appear to be our staunchest enemy, this does not need to be the case. Lerroux is known to be a man of many vices, and his party is known for one thing above all else: corruption. In the last years, the radicalism of Partido Radical has vaned immensely, the party becoming little more than a political machine for Lerroux and his clique to chase more wealth and power. As such, while we share little with the Lerrouxists ideologically, allying them would not be particularly difficult.\n\n Accion Popular could promise to invest in the infrastructure of Lerroux’s seat of power, the boulevard of Paraleo in Barcelona, alongside a promise to turn a blind eye to the man’s ‘business’ ventures that certain law enforcement agencies in Spain would otherwise be quite interested in. In exchange, Lerroux would join us in coalition, and as his support base consists of the Spanish workers of Barcelona, we could use their helps to battle the great evils of Catalonia, the anarchists of CNT-FAI and the separatists of Nosaltres Sols. However, while Lerroux is more of an ally of convenience, there are other groups that align with us ideologically but lack the widespread support of AP. An influential but small party, Partido Agrario shares our rural-minded, Catholic and monarchist sentiments, but has always struggled to gather the popular support that we have. While more moderate than AP, Partido Agrario has been an electoral ally of the Carlists in the past and thus allying with them would starve our rivals of an ally."

But to us loyal and fervent Catholics, no side in that conflict is as important as that of the Papal States, the most holy city serving as the seat of power for the representative of Christ on Earth, the Pope. When Italy fell to war and division, in a rare case of unity both Carlists and Alfonsist monarchists decided to fight side by side to stop the Reds from claiming the city, and the volunteers from that conflicts helped shape Papal-Spanish relations for decades to come. However, given the hard times Spain fell to in the last years, it has been hard to keep these relations as close as we would have liked. Now, however, as Accion Popular has solidified itself as the popular ruler of Spain, we must immediately dispatch an envoy to the Vatican and pledge our undying support to the righteous cause of God. Whichever side the Pope supports in the upcoming unification wars will be our ally as well, and together we shall destroy the godless syndicalists of the north.

Clinging to an age-old dynastic feud, the Carlists have plunged Spain into numerous civil wars, coming out of their Navarran mountains to harass the good people of Spain. The untold damage they have done to our nation with their delusions and unjustified violence has taken blood, sweat and toil to repair, yet still their presence lingers in Spain’s northern territories, their fanatical followers, Requetes, striking our noble Carabineros like some sort of spectres of ruination. Their corrupting influence has been too hard to root out in the last few difficult decades, but similarly their relevance has been weakened. Only in the last few years during and after the republic did the movement gather enough steam to seriously contest the rightful king’s rule, and when the Carlists unsurprisingly were defeated in the elections, their movement fell apart. The hardliner Cruzadistas supporting Carlos Pio as king blamed the supporters of Javier Bourbon-Parma for the humiliating defeat, claiming that their softness prevented the Carlists from seizing the initiative and defeating the Alfonsine monarchy. The Intergristas, ideologically similar to the Frenchman Charles Maurras but far less concrete in their beliefs, simply either gave up or jumped ship to join Renovacion Espanola. This Carlist defeatism may have been rectified had they managed to unite under one candidate, but as Javier escaped to Algiers and Carlos returned to Austria, the movement began to fizzle out into oblivion. While hardliners still remain especially in Navarre and Basque Country, their numbers are not large enough to contest our rule, and some officers have demanded that the army boots finally stomp this pathetic pretender regime out. Others, such as colonel Valera and general Emilio Mola, current military commissioner of Pamplona, have urged for caution, arguing that the Carlists will run out of steam on their own. Ultimately, the decision lies on the king, as the officer corps is notoriously badly infiltrated by traditionalists, with even general Sanjurjo, the hero of the Alfonsine monarchy, being accused of harbouring Carlist sympathies. Without their leadership, it may be that the Carlists cannot unify en masse, but on the other hand further violence may cause political instability and prolong the existence of the Carlists if the operation fails."

sprd.129.t:0 "Juventudes de Acción Popular"
sprd.129.d:0 "Like many other movements in Spain, Accion Popular has long had its own youth wing, Juventudes de Acción Popular, commonly known as either the Greenshirts or japistas, after the movements acronym. JAP has grown to be one of the most powerful youth organizations in Spain, boasting close to 15 000 members, but its involvement with the regime has been far from easy. JAP continues to be a hotbed of radicalism within Accion Popular, and while in the past, during the years of AP’s sole governance, this was seen as ‘youthful desire to regenerate Spain’ and ‘ideological innovation for future monarchists’, this radicalism has become an awkward issue for the party. As Accion Popular has pretty much been strong-armed into the mold of a democratic party, the rascals of JAP are constantly causing us scandals and crises with their clashes with liberals and socialists. The movement’s current head, José María Valiente Soriano, is a known traditionalist, and has even been accused of secretly harbouring Carlist sympathies in the past. His traditionalism has particularly hampered the moderation of JAP, as he turns a blind eye to any bloodshed of former republicans, and some within AP believe that he is coordinating attacks to further his own agenda. However, due to his tenure as the movement’s leader and strong connections to the original leadership of AP, it would be costly to remove him. But should we choose to do so, a likely successor in the form José María Pérez de Laborda has already been chosen by AP’s leadership. The decision won’t be easy, but it could finally bring an end to the stubborn struggle of japistas. "

sprd.130.t:0 "PNE's political transformation"
sprd.130.d:0 "As PNE's stewardship of Spain continues, the party has begun to see itself transform to fit its new role. While originally a big tent party of various right-wing ideologues, drawing its support from rural agrarian peasants, anti-syndicalist militants and radical  Catholic clergymen, the party now spends about as much time balancing these interests as it does forming policies and creating laws. The prime minister Albiñana finds this situation untenable, as it stretches the party thin and causes internal conflicts that are easily exploited by its main rivals, socialists of PSOE and the liberals of Izquierda Española and Union Española. A small-scale congress has been called among party elites to finally settle the ideological differences and create an unified structure. After all, a party calling for Spain to unite as whole is laughable if it cannot unify itself first. As the congress begins, several blocs form within it. Among the most influential is the Legionaries of Albiñana, who propose following the Romanian and Italian Legionary model but form-fitting it to the conditions of Spain. This would see the movement pay lip service to democracy while pursuing its policies of heavy nationalism, militarization and political repression of undesirable influences on Spanish "nature".\n\n They are opposed by the Christian democratic wing, which calls for the movement to adopt policies championed by various Spanish Catholic parties, but with an even firmer grip and vision than those parties usually contain. Highly monarchist and pro-clergy, it would see the movement transition into a more traditionalist position, and likely cause the integration of various smaller Christian democrat parties, such as Partido Agrario, into our movement.\n\n However, there is one more faction within PNE that champions the adoption of a very specific brand of Catholic nationalism, the Mexican Synarchism, which would likely see our movement take a rather autocratic turn. While it would likely not be impossible to utilize this form of ideology inside a democratic system, something PNE must at least attempt to adhere to, it would mean large compromises to function. Lastly, something Albiñana himself supports, is the ideological drift towards Hispanism, something he himself became familiar with during his time in Mexico. While that particular idea is mostly a Latin American one, Albiñana argues that ideas from that movement could be applied to the Spanish setting just as well. Doing so would likely increase Spain's interest in the former colonies, although what shape this interest would take remains to be seen. It would also likely strengthen the anti-regionalist wing of PNE. The congress discussed these issues at length, but ultimately one side emerges victorious."

sprd.131.t:0 "The Legion and the King"
sprd.131.d:0 "Shortly after their victory in the elections, in fact right in the middle of PNE's lavish ceremony to celebrate their triumph, the king of Spain summoned the party leadership and upcoming ministers to an audience with the monarch. The new government may have expected a warm welcome given PNE's overt monarchism, but the king and his advisers raised their demands almost immediately after a short congratulatory note. PNE's history with paramilitary action and terror tactics against political opponents were denounced by the king. He proclaimed that now the party had entered into mainstream politics and was responsible for Spain's governance, it would have to moderate its rhetoric and means to achieve political goals. According to the king and his advisors, they would not allow for such barbaric street clashes and polarization as Alfonso XIII had done, for Spain had nearly been destroyed twice by it.\n\n For the good of the monarchy and Spain itself, the party would have to seek a compromise between its firebrand agenda and the democratic system, or else it would lose credibility in the eyes of the king and his people. Albiñana was quick to assure the king that while PNE was committed to its program, it would make necessary adjustments needed for stability of the realm. The Legionaries of Albiñana would return to their original purpose as the party leader's personal bodyguards. Similarly, Albiñana's initial plan was to focus on its less controversial policies first, such as implementation of the corporatist system, agrarian reforms, education reform to expand access of middle and lower class students to higher education and the strengthening of church status. The king seemed to agree with these notions for now, though Albiñana was certain that the King's secret service would keep an eye open for their activities. Still, if moderation was temporarily needed for PNE's transformation of Spain, then it would have to do for the time being." 
sprd.131.a:0 "Well, that just happened."

sprd.132.t:0 "The Agrarian Expansion"
sprd.132.d:0 "It is no secret that PNE draws most of its support from the countryside, from the pious and humble folk of Spain’s heartlands. Yet these folks do not exclusively support our party, their support also going to the blasted socialists of FNTT, the accursed anarchists of CNT-FAI and the primordial enemy of all true monarchists, the Carlists. While we can only hope that these lost souls find their way to the light one day, there are other parties more aligned with our ideology that could be integrated into PNE. Probably the most important would be Partido Agrario, a small party in the large-scale Spanish politics but still highly important, especially in local level. They have also historically been willing to ally with the Carlists, especially during the republican era, so absorbing them into our organization would starve the wounded Carlists of one more ally.\n\n Of lesser significance are the Derecha Regional Agraria and Peña Blanca, first being a group of agrarians and Christian democrats representing the national part of the regional party, Derecha Regional Valenciana and the second being a group of wealthy landowners and traditionalist monarchists. While these two parties are not massive by any means, the populist approach of DRA and the wealth of PB’s members would serve our cause well. However, some of the members of Pena Blanca are known to be associated with the extremely radical monarchist faction, Renovacion Espanola, and associating with them could bring the ire of the more moderate republicans on us. Similarly, DRA is in turn possibly too moderate for our party, causing us to slip closer to the compromising Christian democrats. Though some within our party have also argued that should we integrate DRA, it could serve as a facade to our commitment to democracy, allowing our more militant wing to continue their actions against the insidious forces seeking to corrupt the Spanish spirit."

sprd.133.t:0 "Theory of Hispanidad"
sprd.133.d:0 "As PNE grows into the role of the steward of Spain’s right-wing movements, we have attracted many prominent right-wing thinkers from other parties, such as Eduardo Callejo de la Cuesta and Pedro Sainz Rodríguez, as well as the monarchist generals Antonio Aranda and Luis Orgaz Yoldi, joining us mostly from the monarchist parties Union Monarquica Nacional and Accion Espanola. However, probably the largest influence to our movement has been Ramiro de Maeztu, known theorist of Hispanidad, a set of central characteristics of the Hispanic race. While de Maeztu has been forced to tone down his rabid anti-democratic rhetoric upon joining the party, due to PNE’s attempt to hold at least a facade of adhering to democracy, his ideas of Hispanidad have been instrumental in the party’s direction ever since the theorist joined us.\n\n The main tenets of his beliefs are outlined in the book released in 1934, Defensa de la hispanidad, where he argues that Spanish, and in more general terms, Hispanic peoples, must return to ‘pure Spanishness’. In de Maeztu’s words this means a spiritual connection between Spain and its former colonies, not guided by the false gods of liberalism and rationalism but the indomitable Spanish spirit, bolstered by his own take on the French revolutionary slogan ‘liberty, equality, fraternity’ being replaced with ‘duty, hierarchy, and humanity’. The Catholic faith and mission is also very heavily visible in his theories, seeing Catholic teachings of hierarchy, charity and humble servitude as a counterpoint to the isolating and selfish ideals of the Western individualist liberalism. His critics have in turn attacked him for being only half-Spanish himself, as his mother was British, and yet more have considered de Maeztu’s inclusion into PNE problematic due to his sister, Maria de Maeztu’s activities with feminism and liberalism. Still, his theories are far too important to our movement to pass up, and as de Maeztu approached Prime Minister Albiñana directly, it was impossible for the latter to decline the offer of such a prolific right-wing ideologue."

sprd.134.t:0 "Return of Unión Patriótica.. Almost"
sprd.134.d:0 "Unión Patriótica, the party created in support of general Miguel Primo de Rivera’s regime and soon absorbed to be the sole party of the dictatorship, has long been an inspiration to the Spanish right. Sad reality is that the union was unsuccessful in its aims to create an apolitical movement aimed solely at uniting the Spanish people on the fundamentally excellent values of Catholicism and corporatism. Yet from seeds of failure PNE must grow a new union, following in the values of Primo de Rivera into a new dawn, even if minor concessions must be made towards the whining voices of former republicans, who still cling to democracy as if it could save Spain.\n\n Under the king’s watchful eye, we will attempt to merge the values of Unión Patriótica in a new way, creating local branches of PNE that will allow it to fit local conditions better, while still supporting the core values of our ideology. This new direction, partially inspired by the Carlists in its function given Albiñana’s fascination with traditionalism, will focus on the core ideals of country, religion and monarchy as the pillars of Spanish society. However, one part where our new party structure will differ from the original ideals of Unión Patriótica is in the continued utilization of Albiñana’s Legionaries.\n\n While majority of the movement will consist of ‘neutral men of pious faith and good ideas’, Albiñana’s Legionaries will always be there, in the shadows, preying on any socialist or syndicalist guerillero who dares to intervene in the creation of a pure, loyal Spanish state. Another idea taken directly from the original ideas of Primo de Rivera is the recreation of Somatén, a rural defence force especially in Catalonia that will ensure the rights of property owners and punish the eternal threat of Marxist infiltration into our loyal farmer folk."

sprd.135.t:0 "Spain is One Above All!"
sprd.135.d:0 "Prime Minister Albiñana has, above all else, stressed the importance of Spanish spirit. To have been born as a Spaniard is the greatest honour one can have, and true Hispanism must be protected from those that would seek to shatter the unity. PNE has always stood at the forefront of neo-traditionalism, leaving behind the shackles of past that the Carlist cling onto, while revering Spain’s sacred institutions and traditions to the greatest extent. After all, few nations can claim such a glorious legacy as the mighty Espana. And yet, despite all this, despite all the glories our nation has created and achieved, even in our beloved Iberia the separatist rot gnaws at Hispanic unity and purity. The Basques, supposedly an ancient race yet to our eyes, just a relic of the past, still retain their outdated language and customs. At the very least they have seen the good graces of God and follow Catholicism almost as fervently as any loyal sons of Spain.\n\n But whereas Basques have some redeeming qualities, in the land of the Catalans, there is little of such notions to be found. These fools claim that they have a right to a Catalan nationhood, yet have never existed as an independent nation, only ever as a part of Spain and its numerous smaller kingdoms. Their most radical members even hatched the sinister plot to murder beloved king Alfonso XIII and almost succeeded, going mostly unpunished until now. This, simply cannot stand. The Basque and Catalan nationalists will be destroyed or assimilated, their leaders imprisoned or driven to exile. Already, Carabineros and Guardia Civil troops are being directed to these areas to drive the separatists out, and they will be assisted by our excellent Legionaries as well as the newly established Somatén of Catalonia. Their rot will never again spoil a single harvest of Spain’s finest, and not a single loyal son of Spain will be lead to separatist delusions. Spain will know unity, for otherwise we are lost in this mad world."

sprd.136.t:0 "The Ever-Restless Legionaries"
sprd.136.d:0 "Without the Legionaries of Spain, or Legionaries of Albiñana as they have become to be known, PNE would likely not exist. In truth, the reformation of the movement from street thugs fighting strikers and socialist agitators into the only traditionalist democratic party in Spain has not been an easy one, as the Legionaries constantly feel sidelined by the politicians and civilians. This isn’t helped by Albiñana’s calls for moderation within their ranks. The Legionaries were originally described as Albiñana to be ‘citizen volunteers with direct, fulminating and expeditious intervention in any act that threatens or depresses the prestige of the country’, so it is not surprising that as their actions are more moderated and constrained, the men are getting restless.\n\n In order to stop these young, active and energetic men from jumping ship to some other radical movements, such as Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, we must find them some enemies to fight, especially given our precarious position in the public eye. In the past, the Legionaries caused many victories for the traditionalist cause, defeating Catalan nationalists, socialists and liberals alike, but as many of these forces have now become our parliamentary rivals, attacking them in such a brash manner would sour our image in the public eye.\n\n As we have to play by the soft playbook of parliamentary politics, at last for now, the targets for Legionaries must instead be those of the radicals. We could break relations with the Carlists, who we have so far been quite close to, and gain support from the liberals and Alfonsine monarchists, but this would cause us to lose a political ally otherwise. Similarly, we can focus on the radical socialists and anarchists of CNT-FAI, and crush these insolent terrorists once and for all. Final option is to divert the Legionaries to combat Catalans, Basques and Galicians who seek to gain their independence from Spain, but this would mean leading the men away from the heartland of Spain and make them temporarily unavailable to use against other political opponents."

Hysterical liberals and socialists rioted and wrote such wild statements, claiming that PNE would bring about the second reactionary dictatorship. Yet through careful maneuvering, clever political alliances and an ever-shifting perspective on governance, we have lead Spain into a new age, where its loyal men no longer need to bow their heads and consider themselves inferior to other Europeans. We alone have uplifted Spain from its stupor, raising it on its own two knees, where the Spanish folk could finally realize their inner potential and the superiority of the Hispanic spirit. The values of nation, religion and monarchy are now instilled in every institute of Spain, leading the nation according to traditional values when need be, while adopting some new innovations that will only make us stronger in the end. Never have we been so well-protected than under the ever vigilant watch of the Legionaries, who stand to thwart any plot by the separatists or socialists.

This influenced him politically, and especially deepened his fascination with Hispanism both academically and politically. But while he was hardly politically active in the region during his time there, working mainly as a doctor, Albiñana nonetheless was targeted by Mexico’s fearsome leader, Plutarco Calles, a feud that eventually lead to Albiñana leaving the country and the New World entirely. After returning to Spain, our leader became politically involved and devoted much of his time to that, but the old feud resurfaced in his mind from time to time. Now that news have reached Spain about Plutarco Calles’ takeover, Albiñana cannot shake the feeling of the idea gnawing at his mind, and as he has confided to his aides about it, some have suggested that we prepare an expedition to rid Mexico of the tyrant once and for all. While the logistics of such an endeavor are questionable, it would help ease our leader’s mind and as a bonus, we would be liberating our Hispanic brothers from socialist influence."

On the docks, a platoon of Guardia Civil officers flanked a man in trenchcoat, clutching his leather-bound folder of documents. As the ship lowered its ladders to the pier and men started to pour out of the ship, the Guardia Civil troops made sure that each of the passengers did not attempt to escape the pier before talking to the man in trenchcoat. The administrator slowly went through the passports of the passengers, scribbling the occasional note to his documentation before nodding and handing back the passes. Three of the passengers received a stern look from the middle-aged man, before he turned towards the policemen and had the men arrested. Rest of the passengers, a rag-tag group of middle-class businessmen, aristocratic men in fine suits, an assortment of individuals dressed in working-class fatigues and even a couple military officers with medals on their uniforms, were let through, some glancing at the arrested men and pondering what their fates would be. Similar scenes happened all across Spain, as the exiled republicans returned to their homeland from their hideouts in North and South America, colonial Africa or European nations. Among these men were republican icons such as Manuel Azaña, Niceto Alcala-Zamora, Alejandro Lerroux, Jose Ortega y Gasset, Julian Besteiro, Miguel Maura, Diego Martinez-Barrio and Ramon Franco. The newly-established political amnesty to moderate republicans had brought many of those persecuted by the military regime back to Spain, where negotiations would commence to determine whether a compromise for the monarchy question could be found between the current regime and the exiled Republicans"

The monarchy, especially under Alfonso XIII, had not been a friend of syndicalists or democrats in general, and the Spanish anarchists despised them all the same. However, after a loaded exchange of platitudes and empty compliments, the king decided to cut to the chase and commented that while he was not a fan of the syndicalists, the monarchy had decided to stand behind the democratic system and as long as Partido Sindicalista would respect it as well, they would work together. Pestaña and his ministers approved these terms, and the two, ideologically almost diametrically opposed actors, begun drafting ways for the cooperation to work.\n\n One of the major talking points was the foreign policy of the new Spain, and the king's council made it clear that any attempts to join the Third Internationale would lead to a complete destruction of this ceasefire between PS and monarchy, causing the mobilization of all Spanish reactionaries against this threat. The members of Partido Sindicalista approved this request as well, an easy decision given the members of Third Internationale already saw them as traitors given their more liberal current of syndicalism. The negotiations between syndicalists and monarchist continued long into the night, but eventually all the finer details of this new agreement were honed out. While the co-existence of the monarch and his syndicalists would be an awkward one, it was nonetheless yet another step towards a stronger, less divided Spain."

sprd.142.d:0 "Spain and Portugal have had a very diverse history, with periods of rivalry and cooperation ebbing and flowing depending on the rulers and global politics. However, dreams of an united Iberia, one where the division of two nations would be washed away and their cultures unified under one banner, are nothing new. Closest example of these dreams was during the First Spanish Republic, when the idea of a federal Spain gave way to even more grandiose ideas of Iberian federation. These never came to fruition, and this sense of an unified peninsula were forgotten in part after the wave of Hispanism that rose to the forefront after the loss of Cuba and Philippines in 1898. But while Spanish reactionaries and imperialists desperately hanged on to misplaced imperial legacy, among the ranks of the anarchist FAI and its youth division, Federación Ibérica de Juventudes Libertarias, Iberism gained some ground, even leading to talks with their Portuguese comrades, though the lack of enthusiasm from Portugal did put a damper on the spread of Iberism there.\n\n Now, however, with Partido Sindicalista guiding Spain, some within our movement have resurrected the idea of an united Iberia, even though the form this would take differs greatly from the ideas of FAI. While this idealism was originally not considered worth pursuing, given the hesitancy of PS’ leadership to participate in wars, the tyrannical rule of the Portuguese monarchy and increasing shift towards totalitarianism has made many question whether we can allow such an affront to all democratic values to occupy the peninsula. The king has offered his support should PS pursue Iberism and prepare for a conflict with Portugal, though whether we fully embrace the idea and unite Iberia or simply topple the reactionary monarchy of Portugal is up to Pestana."

While the new constitution helped weaken the grip of the church on the matters of state, Pestana and other politicians of the party have called for increased process towards total secularization of Spain. Now that PS achieved dominance over Spanish politics, this vision of a Spain set free of the greatest gatekeeper towards true liberation is set in motion.\n\nEducation will be entirely removed from the grasp of the church, large portions of church wealth will be confiscated and directed towards actual charity and not the robbery disguised as ‘support for the faithful’ the church pushes, and the Jesuit order, the vipers rotting the Spanish foundation with their poison, will be expelled. CNT-FAI rebelled against the church and burned their properties, becoming a favourite scapegoat for the authorities. Now that we have actual legal means for dealing with the church, we can right the wrongs they’ve pushed upon the Spanish people for centuries, the crimes of the Inquisition and the corruption of the clergy finally avenged. While we cannot completely dismantle this antique institution as it would simply invite conservative revolution , we can limit its power to a size where it will never again dominate Spain.

However, there are those who still decry the outdated attitudes of CNT and FAI, especially among the women who would otherwise support these movements. When Spain was reaching boiling point in 1936, a group of CNT-FAI supporters, namely Lucía Sánchez Saornil, Mercedes Comaposada, and Amparo Poch y Gascón, formed Mujeres Libres, an organization meant to pursue what they considered the second goal of anarchist revolution in Spain.\n\n These women think that as the anarchist revolution brings forth a society without state control and capitalist oppression, it should also liberate women from antiquated gender roles and paternalistic attitudes of men. While this liberation has often been mentioned in anarchist literature and theories, actual commitment to it in the ranks of CNT-FAI and its FIJL youth wing has been dubious. As such, Mujeres Libres drives the vanguard of anarchist liberation of women, and given the passivity of CNT-FAI, we could possibly gain the votes of Mujeres Libres if we fully committed to the cause of gender equality. Some have even suggested contacting the Mujeres Libres leadership and offering full integration into Partido Sindicalista, as equal partners."

Illiteracy has yet to be stomped out, with twenty-five percent of Spaniards still lacking the ability to read and more yet not knowing how to write. With women, this is even worse, with the average women’s literacy being roughly sixty percent country-wide and dipping into sub-thirty percent in regions such as the Basque country. As we seek to destroy the Church control on education, new alternatives for schools and literary programs must be looked into.\n\n Partido Sindicalista’s background as a former members of the CNT-FAI have given them some ideas as to how this is to be done, as CNT-FAI has for quite some time organized grassroots classes and clubs for the workers to learn new skills, most importantly reading and writing. If we were to adopt this model and give it actual funding but no further state control, it could lead to an actual difference in literacy levels. These organizations could then further promote decentralization of the state and creation of local level communities for other causes as well, such as laying the groundwork for unions, co-operatives and other forms of worker self-organization."

Today, after all our programs have been launched, it is clear that Partido Sindicalista has proven the fearmongers wrong. While they may not agree with our policies, we have remained faithful to the new democratic values of Spain, and the restraint with which Pestana and other members of the party have shown during these last months has even caused worldwide discussion of how Possibilism can walk the tightrope of anarcho-syndicalist ideals, liberal democratic realities and most importantly, the utter paradox of a syndicalist Spain lorded over by a monarch.\n\n Over the border, the French communards see us as little more than traitors to the cause, but we can stand proud in the fact that we have, truly, made this paradox work, and through our actions, Spain has entered a new era of true freedom, equality and progress."

However, PS's  last few rallies gathered enough support to propel the newcomer party to victory, but now it must face a difficult dilemma. Many within PS demand significant changes in Spain, but pushing too hard for reforms at such an early level could cause Spain to collapse into a civil war, something that was so narrowly avoided not long ago. As such, while many radicals within PS call for a complete social revolution and toppling of the monarchy, Pestaña and the party leadership have focused their efforts instead on making economic reforms with the help of syndicalist unions, utilizing the literary clubs of CNT-FAI to spread education among workers and completely rehauling the rural and naval industries, where PS's main support base is working in.\n\nNew coalition has been formed with PSOE, Izquierda Española and Union Española, which will help the small majority PS has immensely.Already, alliances with the anti-clerical parties are being struck to hammer in new legislation, further curtailing church grip on the rural population. Criminal justice is being rehauled to be more democratic, and party envoys have been sent to Izquierda Española and PSOE to further coordinate labour law developments, and while the party must make massive compromises when it comes to combating capitalists, PS is however proposing massive changes among both rural and urban workers. It remains to be seen if the new party can push its heavily syndicalist program against its caqiquismo and clerical enemies, but so far moral in the party remains high."

sprd.148.d:0 "Few expected CNT-FAI, one of the most important actors in Spain's political scene, to simply fall apart, but that appears to be the case. After their loss in the "mandate' elections of 1937, the movement seemed to honour the agreement at first, but parts of CNT and FAI eventually regressed back into using terror tactics against their class enemies. However, given the electoral success of moderate socialists in PSOE, and their shown ability to achieve many rather radical reforms without revolutionary means, there are those within CNT-FAI who have become disillusioned to the extreme methods of the party and union. Ángel Pestaña and his followers inside the political movement have published the so-called Manifiesto de los Treinta, which condemned these means and called for the party to instead focus its attention to obtaining legal credibility.\n\nHe stressed the successes of PSOE in similar strategy, and as a long-time advocate for CNT-FAI to become a true political party as well as first-hand witness to the horrors of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia decades ago, his words managed to convince many in the ranks of the anarchists. While  many hardliners will not accept this shift, a considerable bulk of CNT-FAI members have joined the new Partido Sindicalista, Pestaña's new party. The new party has announced that it will run in the coming elections, and while not a forerunner for election winner, they may have a chance at victory if enough anarchists abandon their previous anti-political attitude and turn up to the polls to support their parliamentary comrades. Right-wing parties, principally Accion Popular, Derecha Regional Agrario and the Carlists have condemned them as agents of Communards, but the king and most of Cortes have allowed them to run as part of the democratic process, especially considering how it weakens the terrorist side of CNT-FAI."

Despite quite a bit of insults and threats being shared between Gil-Robles and the most fervent Republicans, namely Azaña and Lerroux, the talks were successful in negotiating the terms of a new constitutional framework that could possibly see Spain transform into a true constitutional monarchy. This has not been seen as a particularly joy-filled occasion by either the republicans nor the monarchists, but both sides have seen just how close Spain was to total collapse, and are willing to work together to avoid such a scenario. The question of more radical left-wing parties will be determined later, but for now, the republican parties have given their tacit support to the regime, and eagerly await the upcoming elections promised by AP representatives."

It is this disunity that often makes us forget the father of Spanish socialism, Pablo Iglesias. The unshakeable resolve of Pablo led the Spanish socialists from the founding of PSOE under him and his comrades all the way to the de Rivera dictatorship. Iglesias Posse had to endure prison, poverty and repression for his beliefs, and despite his humble upbringing, produced the theoretical and conventional background to Spanish socialism through his sheer dogged determination towards worker’s liberation and massive productivity in written works.\n\n Pablo Iglesias Posse exemplifies the qualities of a truly conscious Spanish worker, and despite all the differences of ideological orientation that Spanish left-wing activists today possess, we should all unite in celebrating the achievements of Iglesias. As PSOE celebrates its electoral victory, the party leadership has also unveiled a plan to make the birthday of Iglesias Posse into a national holiday, a kind of second First of May, to remember the difficulties Spanish labour faced in its long struggle for worker’s rights, and the men that made it possible."

sprd.151.d:0 "With PSOE’s victory in the second Spanish elections, many socialist thinkers have started to question whether the time is ripe to fully topple the monarchy and establish a Spain for the working man alone. Others, notably Julian Besteiro himself, have stressed the importance of moderation, highlighting the notable improvements in stability, individual rights and even economic growth that have slowly creeped back into Spain after the horrible anarchy and chaos of the mid-1930s. Still, PSOE was deeply divided between these two battlelines for revolution or continued evolution.\n\n Only the intervention of a deeply surprising figure helped dissipate the tension, as the former staunch revolutionary and admirer of Russian Bolsheviks, Luis Araquistáin, came forth to press the importance of cooperation between Spanish socialists, former republicans and moderate monarchists. He commented that only the peaceful adherence to democracy and curtailment of radical rhetoric will save Spain from another dictatorship or even worse, a full-scale civil war. While in no way a monarchist, Araquistáin considers the monarchy as a necessary concession to the monarchists to maintain the democratic system.\n\n These statements immediately made Araquistáin enemy number one for the revolutionaries within PSOE, but his rhetoric and call for peace convinced many moderates to take a far more dogged stance on the defense of moderation, and even turned some of the more radical PSOE members into adopting a more moderate stance. PSOE is not fully free of tensions, of course, but this newfound commitment to democracy has earned praise from the more centrist parties as well as the king himself."

sprd.152.d:0 "Julian Besteiro has long stood as one of the most moderate socialists within PSOE, something which has earned him even titles such as ‘the Spanish Menshevik’ and made many question whether the man is even a socialist or not. Besteiro has been an admirer of Karl Kautsky for a long time, and while he did support Russian Revolution due to considering it the only option besides chaos, his opinions on a socialist revolution in Spain have been very different. Like Kautsky, Besteiro considers a socialist revolution and a dictatorship of the proletariat to be a childish fantasy, and the syndicalist model of Union of Britain or the French Commune to be incompatible with Spain’s meager industrial base and highly polarized unions.\n\nForming his ideological basis from Revisionist Marxist, Krausist and positivist currents, Besteiro instead believes that Spanish socialists must use the tools of the current democratic system to their advantage, to improve the economic and social conditions of the Spanish workers and peasants, and so that one day the society is ready advance to a socialist system thoroughly. The electoral participation and victories of PSOE inside the democratic system have further strengthened the right-wing of PSOE led by Besteiro. More radical figures such as Largo Caballero and Indalecio Prieto hold considerable amount of support, it is clear that Besteiro’s vision for the party is increasingly becoming the dominant one."

Yet now, mere half a decade later, Spain is prosperous, stable and most of all, beginning a societal healing that will finally leave behind the dark days of military rule. Spanish democracy has flourished, and in part our policies have made Spain more equal and conscious of the issues our poorest folk face on a daily basis. Our party has united under the vision of Besteiro, bringing German ideals of a moderate, parliamentary socialism that will one day lead Spain into socialism through step-by-step reform, not violent revolution.\n\nWhere once we were considered a red menace that would swallow Spain and turn it into dictatorship of the workers, today we are trusted partners, or at least respected rivals, to the liberals and conservatives of the Cortes. Even the monarchy has accepted us as a partner despite our differing views on various political matters.

sprd.154.d:0 "When the republic was proclaimed in 1931 and the oppressive dictatorship was finally overthrown, something within the anarcho-syndicalist movement of CNT-FAI began to change. Previously, the movement had been purely revolutionary in nature, clashing with the SIndicatos Libres, Carabineros and Guardia Civil many times and seeking to one day bring the results seen in France in the aftermath of the Weltkrieg to Spain as well. But as even PSOE adopted some degree of parliamentarism, some within CNT-FAI began to question whether the aggressive rhetoric of the movement was simply harming them. SImilarly, the anti-political nature of CNT-FAI led to them not appearing in elections and thus the trade union and its sister group FAI couldn’t achieve many actual political goals outside of grassroots organization. \n\nMany within CNT began to advocate for a new direction, especially after the domination of FAI began to influence the effectiveness of CNT’s union activities. Eventually, the situation erupted with the Manifesto of the Thirty, that called for CNT-FAI to abandon its anti-political stance and to become a proper, legitimate party participating in elections and the parliamentary system. While the movement failed to shift the direction of CNT-FAI completely, these moderates did manage to cause CNT-FAI to accept the results of the recent elections, and have now pushed more heavily for the movement to stop its terror tactics. \n\nAmong these treintistas, there has even been talks about forming their own party to fully represent the Spanish libertarians and syndicalists in the democratic system, especially now that CNT-FAI has begun to radicalize once more after its election defeat. We could capitalize on this split in the movement and try to convince these moderates to cooperate with us and try to push CNT-FAI off its radicalized platform, as despite all the similar ideas we share with the anarchists, they tend to oppose us more than agree with us, making our position in charge more difficult. But should there be a more moderate section of CNT-FAI, perhaps as a coalition partner with us, more could likely be achieved by our politicians."

sprd.155.d:0 "The Spanish rural regions have not been a target of our reforms yet, but it is clear that as we expand the rights of workers and make great strides towards a more equal Spain, the difficulties of the rural peasants are not as heavily focused upon by the members of PSOE and UGT. Earlier today, members of the Federación Nacional de Trabajadores de la Tierra, UGT’s agricultural section, have protested en masse to the policies of PSOE and UGT, demanding that the government takes direct action towards the difficulties of rural people of Spain. FNTT’s support is critical to the continued governance of PSOE, and similarly earning goodwill among the rural folk would not be a bad thing considering how many of them currently support our rivals on the right, especially in Accion Popular and Partido Agrario. \n\nAs such, conceding to FNTT’s demands, the PSOE government has called for an extra session to tackle the issues. The list of issues is manifold, ranging from lack of proper farming equipment, terrible labour laws leading to excessively lengthy daily hours, poor division of land and the domination of local societies by the so called caciquismos, powerful political machines that keep the Spanish farmer constrained to their economic situation through dirty tactics. While the other issues raised by FNTT representatives will require a much larger agrarian reform, we could focus on the caciquismo for now and destroy their reign in the rural areas. While it won’t magically fix these areas, a bit of well-deserved revenge will make us more popular among the poor people of the farmer communities. Similarly, seizing assets stolen by the political machines from the people will allow us to fund local councils and institutions of FNTT so that they can actually begin making meaningful reforms."

sprd.156.d:0 "When the Russian revolution rose to destroy the imperialist and capitalist order in 1917, the Bolsheviks utilized methods that wholly betrayed the common man and exposed that even the adherents of socialist ideals cannot avoid backsliding into tyranny. While PSOE’s current leader Julian Besteiro supported the Bolsheviks in 1917 due to seeing them as the better alternative to Tsarist tyranny, it is well-known that he shares no love for hardliner communists, despising them almost as much as the right-wing autocrats and traditionalists. This stance, however, is not universally shared within PSOE, and many within the party ranks still harbour ideals close to the Marxist-Leninists despite the defeat of the Bolsheviks. When Besteiro was chosen to lead PSOE, many of these Bolshevizers, as they are known among the socialist party, went on to join other, more extreme left groups, such as the Catalan Bloque Obrero y Campesino and  Izquierda Comunista de España. Yet many still remain, centred around the socialist and communist intellectual newspaper Leviatan, which has long called for a Bolshevik-style revolution in Spain.\n\n If we are to earn the trust of the Spanish people and finally stabilize the situation in Spain, PSOE must eradicate this thorn in its more democratically-minded faction’s side, lest we fall to factionalism and needless bickering, or strengthen the fear mongering of our right-wing rivals. This means that PSOE must persecute even some rather high-calibre members, such as Largo Caballero, who is known to sympathize the Bolshevizers. Yet while this will temporarily hurt us, it is necessary for Spain to finally find its footing and leave the political violence behind."

Then came the Primo de Rivera dictatorship and the red scare caused by French and Bolshevik revolutions. Even when the glimmer of hope came with the Second Spanish Republic, it was soon snuffed out by the Sanjurjada coup. In the following purges, Spain was thrusted back into the chaos, ignorance and intolerance to the people’s true will that had dominated it for so long. Yet, we persisted. PSOE continued fighting on, defying the military until the faithful day not long ago, when the military was forced to give in and allow Spain’s people to vote for their chosen champions.\n\n As expected, the overwhelming majority of PSOE and its sister parties bought us the victory, but just as we had to overcome challenges in the last decades to even survive, so too have we had to fight day and night to pass the legislation and policies we want to create the truly equal and free Spain, where no commoner is looked down upon by the plutocrats and clergymen. One day, every last one of these parasites will be torn off the backs of the working men, but it will not happen without sacrifices and compromises.

UGT collaborated with the dictator, and managed to eke out an existence despite the repressive nature of the regime, but this did mean that its reputation was somewhat tarnished by this collaboration. While CNT was harshly repressed, it did gain the sympathies of those opposing the military dictatorship, and thus has utilized its anti-establishment status to draw supporters away from UGT. However, as PSOE’s status solidifies, UGT leadership has chosen to pursue even deeper ties with our party, seeking a symbiosis similar to that between CNT and FAI, hoping to regain some of its lost pride by associating even more closely with our successful party.\n\n Some within UGT have protested this as muddling union politics with government politics, while PSOE moderates see the UGT’s more radical leadership, especially the current Chairman Largo Caballero, as a threat to PSOE’s new approach. This closer cooperation would also make the more anti-establishement members of UGT uneasy, and they could drop out of the union to go join more radical left unions. Still, having a strong union on our side would allow us to utilize their mass action in support of our legislative policies."

He has historically been so heavily against these groups that many have even questioned if the man is truly a socialist at all, while others with less critical viewpoints have compared him to the Mensheviks of Russia. This has been in contrast to the famous, or infamous, Lenin of Spain, Largo Caballero, even though Caballero himself has many times collaborated with Spain’s dictators himself. Either way, the more moderate stance on socialism has earned him great praise and support, and in the recent elections he swept his more radical rivals by a very clear margin. In a Spain craving for some stability after the dark days, Besteiro has provided an alternative to radicalist demagogues.\n\n However, he himself is torn between various more moderate currents on socialism. While currently Besteiristas lead a large coalition of liberal socialists, Austromarxists and Kautskyites, this has proven to be somewhat of a difficult front to keep, especially in a party already struggling from division between moderates and radicals. As such, Besteiro must now decide upon a certain model of socialism the PSOE shifts towards. Clearest choice is to simply maintain democratic socialism and utilize socialist policies and tools to push policies both through trade unions and parliamentary methods.\n\n Significant support is also provided to the Austromarxist wing of the party argues that in a nation as large and diverse as Spain, the ideas and theories towards nationalism and socialism as unifying forces between central power and minorities could work to counteract dangerous separatism and regionalist ultratraditionalists like the Carlists. Finally, Besteiro could adopt the ideology of his personal favourite socialist theorist, Karl Kautsky, who argued for socialists to adopt a strategy of achieving a transition from capitalism to socialism through working within the capitalist framework and evolving society at large towards a new system, without the need for a costly revolution."

Still, what the last years of democracy have reminded us of, is that Izquierda Espanola is not the party it was during the republic. With the integration of many regionalist parties, such as Esquierra Catalana and the Galician ORGA, we have slipped further to the left, and while Azaña was a committed middle-class republican in the past, the party has evolved beyond that now. We alienated our supporters years ago by trying to push left-leaning reforms on the other hand and holding back on truly embracing the workers. While we are not the socialists of PSOE by any means, we must take heed of the mistakes of the Republic and fully embrace our new role in the Spanish society.\n\nWe can still honour our roots but Izquierda must also look for new partners and new avenues of thought, to finally break free from the memories of the failed Republican projects. As such, Azaña and his ministers have announced more radical policy ideas, especially in relation to minority rights of Spain, educational reform, agrarian reform and cultural funding intended to finally break the damage done to Spanish spirit by the likes of Generation of ‘98. But if we are to push through reforms of this magnitude, then we cannot remain a small-scale bourgeois party, but must instead focus our efforts into creating true loyalty to Izquierda Espanola in the masses of people currently supporting other parties, lest they support the likes of Carlists, Catholic zealots or anarchist terrorists."

Manuel Azaña has always been a very outspoken critic of the Generation of ‘98, and now that the new generation is rising to challenge the ideals of the Regenerationist, Izquierda Espanola has pledged to support these new creators of art in their endeavors.\n\nGeneration of ‘27 has been characterized as a merging of Spain’s popular culture with the folklore of Iberia, and while this new movement is hard to break down to its essentials due to the awe-inspiring variety of styles it holds, it is generally considered to be a Spanish embracing of the avant-garde principles promoted usually in various Communards circles. Some styles followed by the Generation include Surrealism, Futurism, Cubism and Ultraism, and the forms of art that have embraced this new generational spirits appear in music, poetry, painting and literature in general, pushed onwards by such savants like Federico Garcia Lorca, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel and K–Hito.\n\nThis new form of artist expression is drawing many eyes towards Spain, especially in a time where Europe itself is focusing on wartime production and other far less artistic pursuits. Izquierda Espanola has long been a defender of Spanish art, and in our pursuit for a more widespread support base, the patronage of this new generation has already helped the party’s support."

sprd.162.d:0 "Spanish regionalists rarely find many allies in the mainline parties of Castile, as both the socialists and conservatives either ignore the regional issues or prefer creating branches of their own ideologies in regions such as Catalonia and Basque Country. However, Izquierda Espanola has historically been quite stalwart ally of regionalist party, with Manuel Azaña personally pushing heavily for the proposed Estatuto de autonomía for Catalonia, though this proposition never got off the ground because of the military coup. But now, with the dark days of Sanjurjada a mere memory, our government has decided to push this controversial statute through, with expansion to our allies in Partido Galeguista and Partido Nacionalista Vasca in Galicia and Basque country in addition to Catalan regional reform.\n\nThese autonomous regions will gain a largely independent tax system, and jurisdiction over health and welfare within their regions, with their regional languages fully accepted alongside Spanish in regional matters. While Catalans especially had hoped for a full Catalanization of the region and dropping the requirement for Spanish as an official language, it seems that the concessions have been more than enough. In order to placate regional nationalists, the use of regional flags, such as the Catalan Senyera and Basque Ikurrina, and regional anthems, such as Catalan Els Segadors, has been allowed in official use as well. While this does make Spain less centralized, it does feed into Azaña’s personal agenda to fulfill a vision of Spain that is simultaneously one and multiple, fit to the realities of the nation and not to some chauvinistic agenda of a Castilian dominance.\n\nIt has also pushed many parties that would likely otherwise support our rivals into becoming staunch allies of Izquierda Espanola, such as the Basque nationalist or Catalan Lliga Catalunya. Many within Partido Radical have protested this new statute, and Lerroux himself has called it a dangerous mistake that will simply invite separatism, but given their minority in the Cortes, there’s been little they have been able to do."

It is no secret that Izquierda Espanola has struggled heavily in this new situation, given its very clear roots in republicanism, but now that enough time has passed from the painful memory of the republic, it is clear that the new transformation of Izquierda has been a beneficial one.\n\nThe presence of the monarchy and the mistakes done during the Republic era have caused our leadership to reinvent itself to less strictly middle class party with narrow support from petite bourgeois, into a party that is more aligned with the common people. Our alliances with the more radical left-wing parties have made it possible for us to push many of the laws we wished to achieve back in 1931, and thanks to these alliances we have influenced parties like PSOE and Partido Sindicalista to adopt a more democratic form, abandoning their firebrand revolutionary rhetoric.

But after so many difficult years and so much suffering inflicted to Spain after the death of the republic, many committed Izquierda republicans have simply become tired. The exile of many republicans, the harsh military repression, the infighting between anarchists, socialists and republicans, all have amounted to very little. The embers of the republican dream still burn in their hearts, but for now, the victory is half-complete. The king has seemingly been committed to democracy within Spain, and while many within IE still abhor the thought of monarchist Spain, even they must admit that the current haven of stability in the usually volatile Spanish politics is a welcome one.

One of his informants within Izquierda Espanola had sent it to the general earlier today, warning him of an upcoming purge of officers involved in the event known as Sanjurjada, where general Sanjurjo overthrew the republic with the help of Alfonsist funding, Carlist militants and clandestine German and Austrian support. Back then, the republic had been too weak to resist, and now, Sanjurjo could simply scoff at any such pitiful attempts to purge the military. If Azaña and his band of troublemakers had been unable to dislodge the powerful Spanish military from its rightful place at the height of Republic’s power, what hope did they have now that the king was in power once more? Sanjurjo grabbed a pen from his desk, beginning to write an order to Guardia Civil to sweep the conspiratory circle of Izquierda Espanola, to root this type of nonsense before it got dangerous enough. However, the pen dropped from the general’s hand as the door was kicked in, and three heavily armed Carabineros soldiers stepped into the rooms, leveling their Star submachine guns at the officer. They were followed by two men in uniform, generals Quiepo de Llano and Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer.\n\n Sanjurjo attempted to protest the intrusion, but he was quickly shut down by de Llano, who announced that Cabanellas Ferrer would be taking over as the leader of Guardia Civil starting immediately, and Sanjurjo would be escorted to a military court for his role in the 1932 uprising, especially due to his Carlist connections. As the general was grabbed by the Carabineros, he once more protested, cursing the two other officers for betraying their military brethren so callously. de Llano and Cabanellas Ferrer, known for harbouring republican sentiments, merely scowled at the officer as he was dragged out. The man who had attempted to follow in Primo de Rivera’s shoes had clearly lacked the ability that the former had possessed, the ability to slip out of Spain when the tide had clearly turned against him. Around Spain, similar arrests were carried out, the plotters of Sanjurjada disgraced and expelled from the military, receiving harsh sentiments. Even the monarchy, which they had helped restore, turned a blind eye to them, with the king remembering the role of a puppet his father had been forced into by the ruthless military junta.

With newfound vigor and purpose, Izquierda Espanola has set upon redeeming the Republic’s legacy by tackling the vast array of issues the 1931 Constitution and bills attempted to rectify. As we set upon this task, however, many within the party have noticed the difference between the Izquierda Republicana of the Republican years and the Izquierda Espanola of today.\n\n With many former Azanistas forced into exile, particularly to the United States, many within our ranks have adopted new ideas, political positions and radical thoughtforms which differ greatly from the positions we had back during the existence of the Republic. IE has visibly shifted to the left even more than before, and while the party used to be a liberal centrist one, it is closer to the PSOE than the Radicals of UE today. As such, many prominent politicians within the party, especially those integrated from smaller parties such as Partido Galeguista and Esquerra Republicana Catalunya, have called for a party convention that would hammer home the new direction of the party. Azaña himself supports continuing the current policy of reformist capitalism, but he is also known to exhibit some authoritarian tendencies, especially when it comes to dealing with right-wing extremists, anarchists, the military and Church influence, and thus Azaña would likely support adopting an even more iron-gripped style of governance.\n\n Many of the more liberal and pacifist members of the party are disgusted by such proposals, but there are also those who support these lines of thought as necessary within the new monarchist structure. Some have however, offered a middle-ground between the capitalist and authoritarian camps, seeking to bring about American-style progressivism with a Spanish radical stint into the political field of Spain. There are also some smaller, less prominent trains of thought going on within Izquierda Espanola, with Marcelino Domingo from the recently integrated Independent Radical Socialist Party promoting liberal socialism as an alternative to PSOE’s Marxism and UE’s Radicalism. Probably the smallest but still influential group is also the Georgist members of IE and its regionalist support parties, most prominently represented by Blas Infante, who advocate for the adoption of Henry George’s famous single-tax ideology in Spain.

sprd.167.d:0 "As the Republic sought to fight back against the forces of traditionalism and reaction, Manuel Azaña’s Izquierda Republicana and its allies, notably Union Republicana, sought to utilize a strategy of wide popular front, comprised of left-wing parties of a immense variety of ideological strains. This alliance, while costly and sometimes incredibly cumbersome to uphold, did allow us to make sure that the right-wing parties struggled to gain a majority. Only the backbone of any reactionary action, the military, managed to snatch the reins of progress and governorship from the popular front, and even then the response from the left almost sent the country into a civil war. As Spain continues to heal, and our party has managed to return to its rightful place as the supreme rulers of Spain, the question once again returns, how to contest the ever-present right-wing reactionaries from contesting our rule? Given the existence of the monarchy and the four years of right-wing dictatorship, Spain’s culture has once again steered more towards traditionalism, and thus we must increase our efforts to pry the nation out of this rot, into a brighter dawn.\n\n The idea of a popular front has resurfaced, and we have already sent invitations all over Spain. Most prominent parties are of course Diego Martinez-Barrio’s Union Espanola, Julian Besteiro’s PSOE and even the moderate syndicalists of Partido Sindicalista and the right-communists of Joaquin Maurin’s BOC. Progressive regionalist parties such as Vangarda Nazionalista Galego, Partido Galeguista, ORGA and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya alongside the Basque conservatives and moderate socialists in PNV and ANV respectively have clamoured to join the front as well, seeing us as their best option to enact sufficient regionalist autonomy reforms. Many former republicans, such as the leaders of the Jabali group, Ramon Franco and Blas Infante, have also endorsed the front as a necessary measure to combat the reactionaries under the monarchy. Our overwhelming support should make it easy for the Popular Front to defeat the reactionaries in future elections, although we must not become complacent even with our new political bulwark."

sprd.168.d:0 "Manuel Azaña watched the bustling city streets of Madrid from the second floor window of Palacio de las Cortes. As Spaniards hurried along to their jobs or daily tasks, the street was like a path for ants. Now that Spain’s political situation had stabilized, people had taken to the streets in a new sense of security, no longer burdened by fears of a civil war or spiraling back to the years of pistolerismo like in 1910s and early 1920s. Slowly but surely, Spain was healing, something which made even the usually muted prime minister crack a small smile. However, it quickly dissolved from his face as the red and yellow flags of the Spanish kingdom waved in the light breeze down the street, reminding Azaña that even if the threat of a Spanish collapse had been avoided, Spain was still under the grip of the monarchy. Few people in Spain had done as much to achieve the dream of a Spanish republic as Azaña, and yet all those dreams had been pummeled into the dirt by the military when the conspiracy of Sanjurjada succeeded and toppled the Second Spanish Republic. The years in exile had not been easy, seeing the dysfunctional Spanish monarchy restored and Spain’s noble people subjected to the tyranny of the military and their lackeys in Accion Popular.\n\n Yet when the inevitable happened and the military was forced to give in before the storm of popular action, a small hope rekindled in the defeated Republicans, and as the exiles were amnestied, Spain saw a true resurgence of democratic will. Yet for Azaña, the situation has been difficult to adjust. A life-long republican, he has always seen the monarchy as simply incompatible with truly free, parliamentary democracy, yet as the king has granted his support for democracy and other parties have adopted a more moderate stance towards the monarchy, Azaña has had to readjust his beliefs. Even now, as he watches the royal flag of Spain wave, the ex-president of the republic can only think back to the tricolour that once waved over Madrid’s roofs, and the mass fervour of democratization that followed it. Perhaps, even under the monarchy, that spirit could be recreated, nurtured into action through Izquierda Espanola’s policies, and Spain could make the best out of the current situation. Perhaps, the true spirit of 1931 was not completely lost, but simply forgotten, waiting to be discovered once more. Azaña sighed and turned back to head into the current session of the Cortes, feeling somewhat revitalized. Spain would know progress, even under the king, if Azaña could help it."

However, the long years under the military iron boot have made Spaniards more understanding of our good message, and the Spain of today has, in many ways, begun resembling some of the ideals the old Republic could not achieve. The bloated officer corps of the army, prone to corruption, nepotism and conspiratorial reactionarism, has been purged and finally set to a course of a proper modern military, not a semi-feudal clique of rivaling knighthoods, each seeking to beat the other for monetary and political gain. The tyrant Sanjurjo has been judged before the law, and his allies in the military have not escaped our wrath. The party has evolved from a group of, at times elitist and insulated, liberals to a party of true popular action, emphasizing the active role of enlightened civilians who feel their patriotic duty both in their national service and civilian lives. While much is still left to be done for Spain to be truly free from the ever-present reactionary obscurants, the torch of liberty has been lit, and even a victory of the right-wing demagogues will not extinguish it ever again!"

sprd.170.d:0 "Spanish Republic may now just be a distant memory, but many within Union Espanola still remember the glory days of Republican unity. As years have gone by, Republican parties have evolved into different directions, with Derecha Liberal drifting towards progressive conservatism with a monarchist stint, our original allies in Partido Radical wallowing in their corruption and ideological ambiguity, and our old friends in Izquierda Republicana becoming increasingly left-wing in their rhetoric and policies.\n\nHowever, despite all the changes, the parties still contain elements of the republican spirit, and if we are to defend the newfound democracy, we could attempt to form a wide-spread coalition with the former republicans to stop the socialists and monarchists from getting any ideas. After all, even during the days of the Republic, Union Republicana was always a negotiator between the various republican parties, so perhaps the new Union Espanola can continue this legacy. Initial proposals of this idea have already gathered some positive reactions from the parties, but the question remains whether to include Partido Radical given the history between our party and Lerrouxists."

However, while the forming of this alliance was attempted, the loss of Britain and the rising authoritarianism of National French State, German Empire and various other major powers, as well as the spiral towards collapse that engulfed United States, made any plans to form a liberal internationale mere fantasy. \n\nHowever, given our increased reliance on the myth of Jacobinism and the lack of democratic radical beacons in the world, many with Union Espanola have raised the matter of perhaps forming one ourselves. After all, the fall of France and the weakness of remaining French radicals does put us as one of the strongest radical parties left in the world, but there are still many around the globe who support the ideals of the original Jacobinism. The time looks ripe for the rebirth of the Radical Entente, to fully align the world’s radicals under one banner and resist the vile autocratic monarchs and devious syndicalists.  Some critics of the idea have claimed that the proclamation of this alliance will just cause the Communards to invade us, though whether France has the means to do so in the current international situation remains questionable."

sprd.172.d:0 "So far, we have had to walk the tightrope when it came to our policy with the church. After all, policy towards the church galvanized many of the original supporters of Sanjurjada to act, and zealots such as Carlists, Integrists and other religious fundamentalists have long been enemies of democracy and people’s will in Spain. Now, however, Spanish democracy has existed for a long time, and our support has grown to the point that we may finally be able to finish off the relic holding us in the past. Martinez Barrio has announced the reinstitution of the Republican secular laws.\n\nThe Catholic Church will be barred from holding any stakes in industry or commerce, the state subsidies to clergy will be entirely cut within two years of the law passing and any religious entities that require an oath of allegiance to any other institution than the state itself will be banned entirely from the nation. This final point would mainly target Jesuits. Further investigations into church properties will be taken, and those considered unnecessary for religious use will be nationalized so that they may be used for the benefit of society. Similarly, the state will be able to veto appointments made by the church within its organization, to curtail the appointment of anti-democratic or fundamentalist clergymen. There are some limitations to the legislation we can push through, however, as the king is obviously quite heavily connected to the church, and even though the monarchy abandoned its reactionary role in previous dictatorships, the weakening of the church role is still a sore spot for them. Still, at least the new legislation will finally kick the church out of most social functions it is not needed in."

With the last divisions between Radical Democrats and Radical Socialists fading away, we’ve made Spain into a secular, progressive paradise it was always meant to be. Centuries of meddling in this process by the church, various monarchies from Bourbons to Bonapartes, and the endless moneysinks of the colonies have held Spain from achieving its true potential as a liberal world power, but bit by bit we have pulled this nation to the level of other European countries.\n\nMartinez Barrio’s moderate rhetoric mixed in with radical action to those that deserve it has led us from victory to victory. While many challenges still remain until Spain has truly fulfílled its place in the world, thanks to our actions that day is ever closer. The Republic may be dead, and we mourn it all the same, but even despite the monarchy compromise we have achieved many of the goals that seemed impossible to reach after the collapse of the Republican dream."

While we are still weak to the point of being unable to contest the rule of the church and king completely, some members of UE have proposed strengthening our Jacobinist rhetoric. After all, over the border, the meddlesome syndicalists also claim to be heirs to Jacobinism, which we wholesale reject.\n\nFanning the Francophobia that has taken hold over Spain during the primoderiverista era, we could gain support even from our rivals and enemies as few legal parties in Spain openly support the Communard regime. This support could later earn us some goodwill as we push more radical reforms, such as the secularisation of the Spanish state. As such, while many within our party leadership are not as dedicated to nationalism as their Partido Radical counterparts, in this instance we must fully leverage the anti-French rhetoric in our manifestos and political speeches. After all, Radical parties are the true, pure heirs of Jacobinism, untainted by socialist or syndicalist ideologies."

sprd.175.t:0 "Mending the Party Divide"
sprd.175.d:0 "After the unification of Partido Radical Democrata and Partido Radical-Socialista in 1934, Diego Martinez Barrio and Felix Gordón Ordás have laboured to bridge the differences these two parties have had towards policy. While both parties showed a perhaps too overzealous attitude towards achieving secularization in the past, they have now been forced to shift their perspectives towards more practical fields, such as economy and agrarian reform. This has led to some friction before the former Radical-Socialists and Radical Democrats, as while the two parties share some common ideas, especially those among the ranks of the Radical-Socialists tend to veer more to the left in economic issues. As such, a party convention has been called to fully mend party divides and choose a line that our new union must follow.\n\nThe supporters of Martinez Barrio espouse the following of Radical liberalism and moderate cooperation between parties, while the followers of Gordón Ordás promote a society built on progressive values and moderation between parties, upholding democracy as the paramount value of the entire society. This line is seen as a more conservative stance on matters than their more radical opponents within the PRRS wing of UR, who instead promote the adoption of a liberal variant of socialism. Led by Álvaro de Albornoz, this wing of the former PRRS denounces Marxism, but promotes the adoption of more radical methods inside UR, borderlining on veering into Izquierda Espanola’s rhetoric at times. They are also more willing to work with left-wing parties such as PSOE.\n\nFourth option, coming out of left field for many, is the adoption of the ideology promoted by the Czech National Socialist Party. Circulo Espanol del Praga, and it’s Spanish counterpart, La Agrupacion de Amigos de Checoslovaquia,  a collection of Czech and Spanish intellectuals and notable members of their society have long been in a cultural exchange, despite the sad state of Czech independence movement. As the republican movements of Czechia and Spain had a lot in common, our radicals naturally intermingled in these sorts of organizations, and thus many within UR are aware of the style of liberal radicalism the Czechs espouse. This “National Socialism” promoted by the likes of T.G. Masaryk and Edvard Beneš, is not massively known in Spain, but could prove to be a good common ground to unite our fragmented party around, due to its focus on civic nationalism, moderate socialism and liberal spirit."

sprd.176.d:0 "Union Espanola is a relatively new party, formed in 1934 after the unification of Partido Radical Democrata and Partido Radical-Socialista. Both of these two groups used to be part of the larger Partido Radical Republicana, led by the infamous silver-tongued demagogue Alejandro Lerroux, and the main cause for the split was the increasing caudilloism of Lerroux and his constant compromising with the right-wing parties of Spain, especially those that were clearly very pro-church in nature. Now that Union Espanola has shown itself to be the stronger of the two radical parties of Spain, we must launch a full investigation into Lerrouxist degeneracy and corruption, just to keep them on their toes and to weaken our strongest opponent. Still, this merging of PRRS and PRD has not been easy, and while we are united in cause to decimate the Lerrouxist false radicals, the frictions inside UE are beginning to mount. In order to properly fix the damage done to radicalism by those who sought to corrupt it, UE must adopt a unified vision, and do so soon."

sprd.177.d:0 "As radicals, Union Espanola has always been committed to the ideals of the French revolution and the legacy of the Jacobins, as well as the wider ideals developed afterwards by radical liberals worldwide. However, the unique nature of Spain means that UE must compromise on the centralist nature of radical liberalism if we are to avoid the ire of the minorities. After all, we participated in the Pact of San Sebastian, guaranteeing the rights of Spanish minorities with our signature. Moving to a less exclusively anti-regionalist direction would probably earn us a great deal of goodwill among the minor peoples of Spain, especially as their most popular parties in turn tend to be rather pro-Republican. This move could possibly also align the various smaller sections of Lerroux’s Radicals closer to us, making integration of these autonomous parties easier when the time comes to take action towards them. While UE will never reach as strong a stance towards minorities as the Azanistas, we will implement new policies aimed at safeguarding the autonomy and cultural priviledges of the Spanish minorities.."

sprd.178.d:0 "Spanish political scene tends to be perceived only at the national level or through some select regionalist parties such as the Basque PNV or Catalan ERC, but especially since the abandonment of the two-party system and the proclamation of the republic, local-level parties have propped up at an incredible rate. Often these parties operate within a single territory of Spain, or at best in the surrounding provinces, but they nonetheless often wield such an influence that even state-level parties must pay heed to their demands. Partido Radical, our old rivals, have swayed two such parties to their side, these being the Valencian Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista and the Granadan Partido Republicano Autónomo de Granada.\n\nö PURA represents the left flank of PR’s autonomous parties, while PRAG has long tried to position themselves further from the main party due to various internal changes of Partido Radical. While they may not see eye to eye with Union Espanola on all issues, we could seek to integrate them into our organization in the future, especially as many PURA members have already joined us in the past. Another splinter of the Lerrouxist Radicals is also the small Catalan party, Partit Radical Autònom de les Comarques Tarragonines. Due to their Catalan roots, the party has slowly drifted away from Lerrouxism and into the arms of Catalan nationalists, but thanks to our evolution into less outwardly hostile party towards the Spanish minorities, we could attempt to woo this party into joining us. However, many within our party believe that if we are to absorb these smaller regional groups, it could lead to a slide towards different ideological basis, especially with the Blasquismo of PURA."

sprd.179.d:0 "Spanish schools have been in decline for ages now, struggling with funding and poisoned by the reactionary agenda of the Catholic church. Jesuits and monastic clergy have infiltrated our school system thoroughly, and the role of the church in education is immense, with many schools being completely under church ownership. This, simply cannot stand. Union Espanola has begun a massive operation to nationalize all Catholic school, though this is not as simple as it seems. Many of our teachers are nuns or monks, and while they cannot be blamed for the nefarious plans of the Papacy and its henchmen, they must be replaced with reliable, secular teachers.\n\n This is going to be costly, but there are ways we can cover for the costs. The moderate approach would be to slowly phase out church education as we educate new secular teachers, but this will compromise on our campaign promises and will obviously take time. The other option is to charge rent from church properties and use those funds to pay for the needed wages for teachers as well as the educational costs of training new teachers. This would likely anger the church and parties like Accion Popular, but considering our anti-clerical policies already being drafted, such as the reform to divorce laws and civil marriages, this little concession would probably not help our standing with Vatican."

sprd.180.d:0 "As DLE returns to the Spanish political scenes after years of hibernation and exile, the leadership of Niceto Alcala-Zamora has been questioned by many. Especially further right from us, some within the Accion Popular and especially among the radicals of Partido Nacionalista Español and Renovacion Espanola have protested his nomination, claiming that Spain will only relive the events of 1931-1932, with the socialists and radical liberals like Azaña seeking to dismantle Spain’s traditions and culture. They claim that the moderate stance of Alcala-Zamora only invites further radicalization, and his willingness to compromise with the left while holding conservative stances on other matters will simply lead to him becoming the Spanish Kerensky, inviting a terrible civil war because of his compromises. DLE’s supporters have struck back, claiming that it was only the compromises between republicans, socialists and even monarchists that allowed Spain to pass by the dark days of last few years, directly a result of Accion Popular’s disastrous policies. Nonetheless, even the rabid monarchist elements have a seed of truth in their ramblings, and it is true that Spanish republicans did go overboard in the fervor of liberalization in the faithful days of the Second Republic. We must learn from these mistakes and carve out a path where we can both appeal to the liberals, conservatives and moderates within our party without compromising too much with the rabid firebrands of Azanistas or Gil-Robles’ goons. DLE is the only party that can truly bring moderate progress to Spain, without the corruption of Lerrouxists or the radical ideology of the other parties. Just like Kerensky turned out to be the compromise candidate for Russia, so too shall Alcala-Zamora lead Spain into a moderate dawn, though the Spanish Kerensky shall avoid the mistakes of his namesake, and hopefully, the fate of him as well."

sprd.181.d:0 "After our defeat in 1932 during Sanjurjada, Derecha Liberal Republicana had a crisis within its leadership as Antonio Maura’s son, Miguel Maura, led a part of the party with him to form Partido Republicano Conservador. This move was primarily fueled by Maura blaming the policies of Niceto Alcala-Zamora and his close allies for destroying the republican dream by allying with socialists and liberals. Maurists instead wished to focus their efforts on the original dreams of DLR, creating a mass movement of non-confessional republicans who would ease Spaniards into the new state of things. With Spain stabilizing and DLR’s new successor, DLE, returning to conservatism with a liberal and progressive tinge, Maura has offered to rejoin our party if DLE does not continue its policy of dangerous alliances with the left. Given that Maura’s father was basically the founder of modern Spanish conservatism, having him and possibly his brother Gabriel Maura joining us instead of Accion Popular would boost DLE’s profile to previously unattainable heights. This does mean that any coalitions with Azanistas are ruled out, but we have already begun negotiations with conservative parties in the minority regions, such as Liga Regionalista in Catalonia, Irmandades da Fala in Galicia, Union Navarra in Navarre and Partido Nacionalista Vasco in Basque Country, as well as the Union Espanola of Diego Martinez Barrio, and hopefully we can form a large coalition without the need for Azaña’s support."

sprd.182.t:0 "The Debate on Conservatism"
sprd.182.d:0 "Derecha Liberal Republicana was always balancing between its two main factions, the liberal left and the conservative, Christian democrat right, and this struggle for control within the party eventually led to its weakened position in parliamentary politics. As we have returned to the Cortes in force, this issue of just what style of conservatism our new party should follow has been raised once more. There are multiple options to choose from, the easiest one obviously being that we could simply continue our curious mix of progressive and conservative policies, seeking to create a moderately Catholic state with wide popular support. However, if we were to lean more into the masses, we could also adopt even more populist tactics to create a truly mass party, less focused on the typical liberal businessmen and academics as we now do, replacing this side with more grassroots activity. This would likely put us at odds with the Lerrouxists and Accion Popular, who focus on workers and peasants respectively, but given the radicalism of those two parties, perhaps taking part of their voter based would be good for Spain. Alternatively, we could lean even more into the liberal side of our party, seeking to empower the business sector and political elite, while still maintaining our focus on civil liberties, societal progress and slight Christian tint.\n\n Yet the possibilities do not stop there, as we could also adopt the ideology of the newly integrated Partido Republicana Conservador, Maurism, named after their mentor Antonio Maura. This would see us abandon some of our more liberal principles and adopt some elements of protectionism, but it would nonetheless keep the party mostly progressive conservative in societal and economic matters. Finally, we could simply adopt Christian democracy wholesale, turning our movement more socially conservative. This shift would likely help us boost our numbers while hurting Accion Popular, which is always a nice bonus."

Yet just like in 1931 Niceto Alcala-Zamora brought a storm down upon himself for resisting radical anti-clericalism of the constitution, so too will DLE now stand up and fight for what is right and just, even if it means becoming the target of both left and right radicals. Spain has been tortured for so long that Spaniards themselves consider these constant crises normal, yet this must end. A political purge will be enacted within DLE to rid us of any possible warmongers and radicals, and after that, we must establish new legislation and juridical procedures to make persecuting violent or revolutionary political activists easier.\n\n Similarly, we will use one of our best contacts in the military, Major General Carlos Blanco Pérez. He happens to be a member of our party, and has provided information to us about those military officers most likely to align with both revolutionary actors aligned with the Internationale or traditionalist fundamentalists of Renovacion Espanola and the Carlists. Another military officer, general Quiepo de Llano, has also collaborated with DLE on this matter, partly because of his former republican sympathies and partly because of him being Alcala-Zamora’s son-in-law. With these two links within the army, we can finally curtail radicalism spreading within the military, and allow us to focus our energy on political and revolutionary actors who aren’t tied to it. While these actions are not particularly popular even inside DLE, they are necessary to finally exorcize the demon of political extremism that has haunted Spain for so long."

sprd.184.t:0 "Building Bridges Between Fellow Conservatives"
sprd.184.d:0 "Historically, many regionalist parties have tended to align with Manuel Azaña’s Izquerdistas because of their very pro-regionalist policies, but this cooperation has very often been mired by the IE’s very radical anti-clericalism, while many large regionalist parties tend to have at least some degree of Catholic factionalism. Some, like the Basque PNV, are Christian democratic parties, who in the past supported republicans simply because of their preference for pro-autonomy policies. Now, as DLE gathers steam after the electoral victory, we could capitalize on the differences between IE and its regional allies. As DLE has leaned more into pro-Catholic policies, many local parties are seeking to align with us, but they are cautious on whether we support their calls for autonomism or prefer centralism in Spain. Centralization is preferred by many monarchists and nationalists in Spain, but it would be an understatement to say that they dislike us, so we would likely not lose much by pursuing more autonomist policies.\n\n Preliminary talks with PNV and the Catalan right-wing parties such as Liga Regionalista and Unio Democratica de Catalunya have been promising, and large Galician parties such as Dereita Galeguista and Partido Galeguista have also contacted us offering support in exchange for preferential policies. This would allow us to dislodge Azaña’s party as the leader of pro-autonomism, and given the Spanish Radical parties’ preference for centralization, they would likely not gain many votes from the minorities either. As such, the party leadership has decided to focus on legislation that would support the culture and rights of Spanish minorities, especially after so many years of oppressive military crackdowns and Castilian cultural chauvinism. Thus, these new policies are basically just one more step on our road to becoming a true mass party for all Spaniards."

sprd.185.d:0 "DLE, in its initial form, was very much a republican party, and while we were committed to moderatism just as fervently back in 1931 as we are now, monarchism was never dominant within the party. However, as it currently stands, the monarchy was restored and while many within the party still hold up hopes that it could be destroyed and the monarchist flags torn down, the truth is that for the time being, the republican tricolor is not going to fly over Spain any time soon.\n\n As surprising as it may be Niceto Alcala-Zamora and other members of the party, such as Miguel Maura, used to be monarchists once. While they abandoned those convictions due to the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and the disgraceful abandonment of the Spanish people by the monarchy that happened during those years, they have now warmed up towards the monarchy thanks to the new constitutional transformation of it and renewed commitment to democracy.\n\n It is clear that DLE will most likely never match the sheer monarchist ferocity of Accion Popular or Renovacion Espanola, our monarchism will be tempered, pragmatic and most importantly, fiercely democratic, something that even the most moderate Accion Popular members could not claim in all honesty. With the DLE’s republicanism kept under a lid or possibly completely extinguished, the party will nonetheless push through the policies of the original republican dream, just fit for the new system."

But as the future looks more and more dim, a miracle has happened in Iberia. In a peninsula filled to the brim with tyrants, radicals, terrorists and separatists, a seed of hope has been slowly nurtured, our moderate policies allowing it slowly recover and grow to its full potential, and now, the Spanish Kingdom stands united.\n\n The dark years, or more accurately, decades, have finally been redeemed, with the painful memories slowly fading and the scars disappearing. Without DLE’s firm but gentle hand, Spain may have very well fallen into a nosedive towards a civil war despite all the compromises and victories of 1936 and 1937. But DLE has managed to pacify those elements of the Spanish society that would not see reason, and moderate those that could. With our politics slowly but surely turning less and less polarized, Spain’s democracy may finally be allowed to thrive and grow, to reach its full potential as it was always meant to be.

As such, Spain has never truly seen a proper, democratic constitutional monarchy, where parties are free to take part in elections and compete against each other in a truly parliamentary way. Neither was there really a party calling for such a thing while also advocating for the monarchy, if we discount the accidentalist mindset of the Republic-era Spanish right. But under the transformative leadership of Niceto Alcala-Zamora and his strong allies under Miguel Maura, Spain has seen this style of governorship finally become possible, as the party expands its ranks with new, young patriots, seeking progress alongside the long traditions of the monarchy and the moderate democratic process. Thanks to our efforts, the Spanish people are getting more and more used to democracy and its characteristics, and slowly, it is developing into something that political parties across the isle see as fundamental part of our society. While much work remains to be done, we can be proud in the achievements completed so far."

As Spain develops to a shining beacon of liberal democracy in Europe, around the world’s nations this is far from the norm. The Entente is slowly slipping to autocracy, the American peoples’ are tearing each other apart, the German order is far from a paradise of democracy and the Syndicalists themselves have violently overthrown their rightful governments, and harbour dangerous radicals like Mosley, Mussolini and Valois. In Asia, Japan seeks to dominate the poor Chinese, destroying any sense of unity they could possibly achieve.\n\n Bleakness of today’s world is on a level that is completely unacceptable to DLE’s leadership, and while far from the most jingoistic Spaniards, our party leadership understands that Spain must serve its role in the liberation of the world from the shackles of tyranny, be it reactionary or revolutionary. While we prepare the Spanish nation to take a more active part in this fight for freedom, liberty and democracy, we must create the means to defend Spain’s borders from any incoming force. Extensive fortifications will be constructed in the Basque country and Catalonian border with France, and reserve units will be circulated along the Spanish coast in preparation for a naval invasion.\n\n The Spanish people must stand ready to face the storms of the world, for the protection of liberty and our free system is of utmost importance. Factories like Star, Llama and Oviedo Mauser plants will be churning out guns, ammunition and other military equipment for domestic use, but we will also create a program aimed at supplying friendly regimes in their conflicts, for if they fall, our fall will be more likely as well. And finally, a clandestine group of volunteers and military experts will be assembled to provide direct intervention forces, mostly working without national symbols, to help our allies overseas against dictators and power-hungry madmen. Spain shall become the iron brace of liberty, holding back the horrors of the world’s radical ideologues from ruining what moderate men have built through cooperation and compromise."

Yet, we have been more successful at promoting truly democratic monarchism to the masses, as AP’s actions during the dictatorship showed their true colours to many Spanish right-wing monarchists. This has driven many minor parties, such as the agrarian parties Unión Castellana Agraria, Acción Agraria Riojana, the more traditionalist yet somewhat progressive Dereita Galeguista and Unión Navarra and the numerous smaller liberal centrist parties, such as Partido Republicano Liberal Demócrata, Partido Republicano Autónomo Navarro and Partido del Centro Democrático, into seeking an alliance or perhaps outright integration into our party. While this could help bolster out ranks and allow us to more easily defeat Accion Popular on the battlefield of parliamentarism, it would also cause our party to be ripped into different directions without considerable reorganization. As such, while many see integration of these parties as the utmost task of DLE at the moment, yet others, Miguel Maura among them, urge for caution.

Through our resolute but gentle action, Spanish people are more committed to the values of democracy than ever before, and many of those who once sought to bring Spain to a civil war and revolution have calmed their rhetoric and joined us on the parliamentary stage as rivals, not as violent enemies. Spanish culture, economy and academia blossoms as the violence of the last few years fades away, and for the first time in ages, the atmosphere of fear has vanished, replaced by a sense of pride and hope for the future, of a Spain made anew by the actions of responsible governance. While the current world order fluctuates, Spain must find its own place among it, but for now, we stand ready for the challenges the global politics will throw our way. Spain is united, moderate and stable, and for now, DLE can enjoy its place at the forefront of this change. However, as our party has continued to evolve, many have accused us of harbouring elitist sentiments, not helped by the rather laissez-faire outlook on economics that many within DLE hold. As the party attracts new blood into its ranks, many within the press and academic field have observed that DLE has slowly started shedding some of the more elitist members, both due to natural progression and partially as a concentrated appeal from DLE leadership. How this will shape the party remains to be seen, but it is certainly changing the landscape of its internal politics dramatically."

After all, the Republic was proclaimed for a reason, given Alfonso XIII’s inability to reign in the military dictatorship and his overall lackadaisical attitude towards anything related to governance. While the old king recovered from his coma, he was wise enough to not contest the rule of his son, who has proven to be far more adept at seeing things as they are. As the current monarch is less blind to the issues of average Spaniards, or at the very least is attempting to care about them, DLE has decided to support the royal house fully, though less fervently as our rivals in the Accion Popular or Partido Nacional Espanola. Just as the monarchy still has long ways to go before the average Spaniards starts viewing them with less contempt, so does DLE have to go through quite a bit of internal restructuring to adjust to this new pro-monarchy stance, even when it comes to old monarchists like Niceto Alcala-Zamora. Nonetheless, should the monarchy receive the support of a former republican party, it would likely heighten its changes at being recognized as legitimate in the eyes of Spain’s people, though even then we must understand that the process of reconciliation will take time, and the republican flame may never be truly extinguished. Nonetheless, just as the king is committed to democratic principles now, we too must be committed to the new monarchist direction Spain has taken."

The path ahead to reconquer that which has been lost to time and rivaling powers will take time, but as Spain steams ahead, seemingly recovering from the dark days of the past, Accion Popular continues to grow to its role as the citadel of Spain’s monarchism. Other parties may nibble at our support base, but this will only make us stronger as it removes those of little faith from our ranks. Already, Spaniards are becoming more charitable and caring for those in need, abandoning the greed of unfettered capitalism and the false promises of syndicalism and finding the true path to good life in God and service to Spain’s eternal institutions. While Accion Popular must continue its progress of adjusting to the new and developing Spain, we have proven that Spain, eternal Espana, still has quite a bit of fight left in her, and while the days of the Empire have long passed, through Accion Popular’s actions, perhaps she can rise to new heights once more.

However, now that we have returned to the political scene, radicalized by the slow progress of reforms, overt political Catholicism of the military regime and the presence of our old monarchist rivals on the Spanish throne once more, PR must take a swift policy shift towards these monarchists. We cannot tolerate monarchist sympathies that would draw us closer to Accion Popular, because to associate with that party would be associating with those that ruined the Republic.\n\n Instead, those monarchists that insist on remaining in our party, such as the prominent Restoration era politician Santiago Alba, must be converted to be true Radicals. Partido Radical must not slip back to its complacent moderate position, we are a party of action first and foremost and to slowly drift towards monarchism would be the death knell to our party. The monarchists of PR will accept our new political positions or leave, probably to join the DLE or the cursed Accion Popular, yet to get rid of these wolves in sheep’s clothing will only strengthen our party.

sprd.194.d:0 "Partido Radical’s list of mistakes and errors is a long one. Few parties in Spain have been so rife with corruption, grift and embezzlement as Partido Radical, and scandals such as the Straperlo affair of 1934, where the nephew of Alejandro Lerroux was caught trying to influence Accion Popular politicians to accept the legalization of fixed roulette. Accion Popular used this affair as a way to blackmail Radicals and republicans in general, and the fallout left Partido Radical reeling for quite some time. While it did enact a small purge within the party, the rate of corruption within PR is incredibly difficult to fully root out, and many of our senior politicians, such as Rafael Salazar Alonso and Moreno Calvo, have been implicated in many corruption and bribery cases.\n\n The party leader Alejandro Lerroux has managed to remain free of these scandals thus far, but his shady dealings in ruling his personal fiefdom, the street of Paraleo in Barcelona, a notable hive of scum and villainy, have made him very suspicious to law enforcement agents, at least those not in his pocket at the moment. However, while sweeping the party clean of corrupt grifters would probably make it better at doing, well, its job as governors of the Spanish people, one could also argue that the election victory implicates that no change is needed. After all, Spanish people have lived under the corrupt military regime for almost two decades now, and while Lerroux’s party has many that enjoy the finer things in life, assisted by generous ‘political interest groups’, they can’t be as ridiculously corrupt as the military, after all?\n\n However, many within Lerroux’s inner circle have argued that we must instead turn the accusations to our strength, purge the party of worst offenders and return to the golden days of the pre-Primo de Rivera era, when Lerroux was known as a firebrand populist, willing to use methods other parties didn’t have the guts to, bringing radical change to Spain even if it meant taking or giving a few bribes here and there to achieve."

This has obviously greatly weakened our party in the short term, but in the long term the damage done to PR’s reputation may finally be repaired and our pride restored. However, now that we have stripped the party from many of its most prominent members, the question remains, where do we go from here? Obvious answer would be a return to radical liberalism, allowing us to perhaps integrate Diego Martinez-Barrio’s Union Espanola in the future, but many also view this as too similar to them in case they want to retain the parties as separate entities, and thus it would likely lead us to bleeding voters to UE in the future as well. Others have instead argued that we should adopt the ideology of our smaller regional party,  the Valencian Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista. PURA was, at its infancy, dominated by one man, Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, whose ideology was in broad strokes similar to that of Partido Radical, but in reality much more in touch with the local population, and some would argue, more linked to regionalism. However, this is not the case, as while the party maintains a very Valencian nature, they still promote Spanish nationalism same as PR, and fight back against Catalan separatism. The party is noted for its heavy use of grassroots populism, and at times, direct political action even in the form of violence to achieve its goals. This could give us a truly reinvigorating perspective into governance. But these are not the only options. Others yet have argued that we should retain some elements of our former moderate outlook during the  Republican years, and instead lean more towards Classical liberal ideals, to appease the growing middle-class support of PR over our working-class supporters in Barcelona. However, this will again hurt our support somewhat as many workers will see this as betrayal of PR’s core values."

This would greatly help with colonial affairs and future colonial projects should we hope to advance further into Central Africa in the inevitable case of German colonial collapse. However, although the project is paid for, there is a matter of Antonio Nombela, who our informants claim is planning to snitch out on this project. Given that we had to grease quite a few wheels to get the West Africa Company to sign the papers, this is obviously unacceptable.\n\n As Partido Radical is looking to tap into the potential of African colonial trade, especially given the very destabilized nature of Mittelafrika’s law enforcement, we must get the trade route up and running, and having some upstart colonial enforcer stepping out of his role to snoop in the business is too risky. We could obviously just dismiss him, but other party members consider this too likely to get spotted by authorities, so there has been suggestions to fabricate an accident for the man or to implicate him for some crime that would get him locked off for some time, giving us time to pull this colonial venture through."

sprd.197.d:0 "Lerrouxismo started off as a derogatory term for the followers of Partido Radical Republicana, its detractors seeing the party as a group of ruffians and troublemakers following a violent and corrupt demagogue. While in parts, this could be considered true, these insults were mostly coming from Catalan anarchists and separatists who were seeking to leave the glorious nation of Spain to form their own breakaway state, so one could claim they were not in a position to hurl such claims.\n\n However, while the term Lerrouxismo is infamous, the promises of such ideology tend to appeal to many young and radical men, especially those who live in the regions dominated by one of Spain’s many minority groups, for example the cities of Bilbao and Barcelona. These men, brought to these cities due to their growing industrial might, found themselves surrounded by foreign language, foreign culture and hostile attitudes towards Spaniards, all because these virtuous men wanted to continue working for the betterment of Spain. Lerroux provided a voice for them, denouncing the Catholic church feeding lies to them and the separatist scum looking down upon them for being loyal to the true ruler of Iberia, the Spanish state. Lerroux’s closeness to the people, easily achievable due to his control over the famous entertainment street, Paraleo of Barcelona, allowed him to use his populist rhetoric and radical ideas to reach the Spanish patriots and use them to break those who would seek to break Spain apart or to the ignorance of old, be they anarchists, socialists, separatists or church lackeys. \n\nHis violent anti-clericalism and anti-syndicalism inspired many to fight the good fight against forces hostile to Spanish nature. But throughout the years, Lerroux lost some of his fire. The republic’s initial reforms went against his beliefs, pushing him to ally right-wing parties and compromise with the Catholics. Fighting the radicalism of his fellow republicans, PRR adopted moderatism, but given that the Republican experiment was cut short by the military jackals, perhaps it’s time to light the fire of Lerrouxismo again. As we did back in 1910s, we shall act now, serving as a vanguard of modernity, its noble barbarians bringing the fight to church backwardness, socialist lies, separatist delusion and anarchist degeneracy alike.

While the dictator may have been a tyrant, at least his response to the Catalan devils was appropriate. Now, Catalan separatists once more conspire with the anarchists of CNT-FAI, and Spanish unity is at risk.\n\n Running battles between the police and emboldened Catalan separatists from Estat Catala, Nosaltras Sols and Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana-Estat Català are almost daily occurrences, and Guardia Civil is working overtime in pursuing leads about suspected separatist holdouts. More muscle is needed to bring this insidious movement down, and the history of Partido Radical may have the answer ready. Back in the end of 1910s, Lerrouxist republicans participated in an organization called Liga Patriótica Española, an ad hoc organization consisting of Carlist workers, police and military men, Mellistas and even football hooligans from the club Real Club Deportivo Espanyol de Barcelona. These mixed units faced down Catalan nationalists on the streets, battering sense into their stubborn heads. While making such a broad coalition can be damaging to our reputation in the short term, the hit to our image is a small price to play to finally put the Catalan nationalists down for good."

Yet Catalonia is also by far the most politically active region in Spain, and while Lerroux is no friend of their people, he recognizes that many Catalans share the same republican values that Partido Radical holds so dear, and while the republican dream might be dead, or at least lost for the time being, republicans in current days Spain must stick together.\n\n So, while it will be an incredibly unpopular move inside the party and cause Partido Radical to hemorrhage voters, Lerroux has no option but to ease on the crackdowns and grant some of the concessions towards autonomy that the Catalans have been demanding, sometimes violently. While these concessions will not be the regionalist-loving softness of Izquierda Espanola or the moderate regionalism of Union Espanola, they will nonetheless be a massive policy shift for Partido Radical, and one we must recover from in other areas to avoid total party collapse."

A true source of power for Lerroux has almost always been his knowledge of connecting with the working man, which has allowed him to exploit the fears and dreams of the common man to achieve enough political capital for his political goals. His connection to the average Spaniards was partially due to his control over the street of Paralelo, one of the main streets of Barcelona known for its theatres, cabarets and circuses.\n\n The significance of Paralelo is immense, as the street rivals many of the famous entertainment centres of the world, such as London’s West End, New York’s Broadway and Paris’ Montmartre, housing such renowned venues such as El Molino concert hall, Teatro-Circo Olympia circus and Talía Theatre. The street may be a source of great art, but it is also rife with drug use, prostitution and organized crime, leading it to have a very two-faced appearance. This duality, however, has allowed Lerroux to connect with elites and workers alike, as his grip on the street has been absolute until the Catalans drove him out temporarily, but he returned in force and his political machine became synonymous with the night-life of Paralelo, granting him the nickname ‘Emperor of Paralelo’.\n\n Now, the Emperor of Paralelo labours under the Spanish king, but he has not forgotten his roots in the dirt of that Catalan street, and as Lerroux continues his crackdown on Catalan separatism, Paralelo serves as his castle to rule the realm of Barcelona from, the Emperor’s agents hunting down separatists and anarchists alike."

In the speech, he addressed many young radicals, committed anti-clericals and fierce streetfighters, saying:\n\n ‘Young barbarians of today: enter and sack the decadent civilization of this unhappy country, destroy its temples, finish off its gods, tear the veil from its novices and raise them up to be mothers to virilize the species, break into the records of property and make bonfires of its papers that fire may purify the infamous social organization. Enter its humble hearths and raise the legions of proletarians that the world may tremble before their awakened judges. Do not be stopped by altars nor by tombs. Fight, kill, die’\n\n The announcement was followed by hysterical action in the crowd, as they were caught in the fervour of the speech, but for the rest of Spain’s political scene, the announcement was met with mixed reactions. Accion Popular, Partido Nacional Espanola and Derecha Liberal Republicana denounced such violent demagoguery and claimed that Lerroux would only push Spain back to the chaos of the last decade once more. Izquierda Espanola and both socialists and syndicalists, traditional enemies of Lerroux, on the other hand, have given cautious support to this new policy of rabid anti-clericalism, though they still remain unconvinced whether Lerroux will stay true to his principles."

However, the party’s small but influential monarchist wing, still around despite the crackdown earlier in PR’s history, has argued that brokering a power-sharing deal with the king could be beneficial for Lerrouxists as it would end the needless stalemate that continues to harm PR’s image and prevents alliances with moderate monarchists such as the members of DLE. However, thus far Lerroux has brushed such ideas aside, claiming that as long as he draws breath, Radical party shall remember the crimes the monarchists committed on the republic. Nonetheless, the deadlock with the king is weighing on the aging prime minister, and should other Radicals pressure him on the matter as well, Lerroux could be negotiated to compromise with the king on a cease-fire."

Few parties in Spain, or even in the world, could be viewed as quite so controversial as Lerroux’s radicals, yet his near-personality cult level of influence has allowed the silver-tongued demagogue to capture hearts of Spain’s workers and middle class alike, creating a bulwark of radicalism that follows Lerroux’s commands even with all the baggage the man carries behind him.

The anarchist and socialist insurgencies have been a nuisance to rail travel, with saboteurs blowing up rail and railway points, locomotive storehouses and other highly expensive materials. But even beyond these troublemakers, the sad state has been largely thanks to the unwillingness of private owners to upgrade and maintain their rail lines, and the relatively primitive degree at which Spain has been able to create its rail lines in general. The calls for nationalization of the railways, already started by Francesc Cambo during his tenure as a minister during the Restoration era, have begun to grown louder, as examples such as the Compañía de los Ferrocarriles Andaluces show just how incapable these private companies are at running such a vital service.\n\n The company Explotación de Ferrocarriles por el Estado has already laid plans for the management of a state-owned railway company, though before its scope was limited to merely those companies already incorporated under state ownership, not to all of Spain. However, with the rising popular will to see railway travel become owned by the state, even the most hardline free market capitalists within the Cortes are now not as opposed to the concept as a decade ago, and as the government has promised to compensate the affected private enterprises fairly, the project seems to barrel onwards at full speed.\n\n The new state company is planned to be named Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles or RENFE, and it would see the integration of both larger companies such as Compañía de los Caminos de Hierro del Norte de España, Compañía del Ferrocarril de Madrid a Zaragoza y Alicante and Compañía Nacional de los Ferrocarriles del Oeste, as well as smaller regional actors such as Ferrocarriles Vascongados. The new rail line is planned to mostly utilize Hanomag, Krauss and Engerth locomotives, with some electric railcars provided by the Swiss Brown Boveri company, with various gaps in supply filled in by older French and English locomotives, though the revolution in these countries makes spare parts an issue of operation. It is hoped that RENFE might eventually have the ability to start manufacturing of local designs or licensed copies of locomotives, to make the supply chain far easier to maintain, though thanks to the enormous sums needed to make the nationalization happen, this will likely happen far into the future."

While Spain utilized these mines through local companies during the 1700s and 1800s and sought to modernize the extraction of resources with little actual results, the situation rapidly changed as the British capitalists caught wind of the riches of Andalusia. Headed by the Rothschild family, the British company bosses won a bid to gain rights to the mines from the First Republic for the price of mere 94 000 pesetas, a pittance given the dire straits the republic’s economy was at the time. \n\nThe English would form the company Rio Tinto Company Limited, and as their economic activity took wind into its sails, the company grew to become the largest mining center in the world at the time, with the construction of a railway to the mine itself being one of the driving factors of newfound prosperity as pack animals were no longer needed to haul the contents of the mine. This immense wealth from the copper, gold and silver mines of Rio Tinto would see the region transform into a miniature British colony, with their own luxury district of Bellavista Neighborhood, with its very own sports fields for Anglo sports, a Presbyterian church and various other excesses. However, as the British regime in their homeland collapsed, many refugees would flee to Spain, only to leave during the proclamation of the republic, afraid of the new left-wing regime. The mines were still own by the Brits and the unstable regime leading Spain until 1936 was too powerless to do much about this status quo, though British interest in the mines themselves was waning in favour of exploiting the resources of their colonies.\n\n With this in mind, the new government has maneuvered to gain control of the mines for itself, and as the long-time rival of RTC, Peña del Hierro mine, was recently nationalized due to abysmal yearly earnings, the eyes of Madrid now turn to RTC. The memory of British capital vanishing from Spanish markets after the British revolution and Great Depression on the Canadian mainland now resurfaced in the minds of Spain’s governors, and the government has started negotiations on how to approach this issue with the mines ownership. Many claim that the mines belong to Spain by right, as a compensation for the British withdrawal from rest of Spain, but the more business-savvy members of the government and Cortes see this as a diplomatic suicide towards the Canadians and propose a purchase of the mines for a similar sum to that with which it was originally bought by the British. With the British interest in Iberia at its lowest point, this may be possible to achieve, without upsetting the Canadians too much, though it is obviously going to cost us more than a simple forced nationalization would."

sprd.207.d:0 "The automotive industry of Europe was heavily shaken by the Communard revolution in France and later by the fracturing of Italy and the syndicalist takeover of Britain. Brand names such as Peugeot and Renault as well as the British Rolls-Royce disappeared from prominence, their factories turned into worker ownership or shipped off to the colonies, only to appear as a rump company. The upheavals in the Americas made it difficult for the United States to capitalize on this, and the prominence of German and Austrian firms in the European market was primarily only challenged by Ford.\n\n Spain would serve as a frontline for this rivalry, with Ford’s local factories belonging to Motor Ibérica, a local branch of the company, which up until recently was the second largest subsidiary of Ford in Europe. The situation in the New World is rapidly changing, however, and Ford’s industrial empire is unraveling almost as quickly as that of the American state itself. Motor Ibérica is left bereft of support, with the American businessmen and experts within the company either returning to their homeland to fight in the terrible wars there or staying here in Spain until the situation stabilizes, but the company itself is nearly collapsing without the financial connections to the main company.\n\n There are hardly more auspicious odds for the Spanish government to nationalize the company than now, with it floundering like a fish out of water and looking for a way out. We can either march in and dismantle the local American ownership once and for all, or simply pay them off and seize the company that way, to create the Motor Ibérica, S.A. company fully under national ownership. This would provide us with a strong industrial base for civilian and military vehicle manufacturing, and as a consequence, we no longer need to purchase everything from local private contractors as Hispano-Suiza. The contacts the company has to Morocco, Nationalist France, Italy and Portugal will likely help push the new sales out, even if the ownership is different from the original Ford company."

As the drums of war are growing louder over Europe and the Americas are engulfed in a terrible period of civil strife, the weapons manufacturers of Spain have had their fill to eat, but it is clear that while Spain has its fair share of infantry arms, there is much to be desired when it comes to heavy weapons. The Spanish artillery corps has been wishing for a domestic design for quite some time, and it seems that finally a new program is on the way. The La Naval metallurgy company, known for its smelters and factories in the Cantabrian town of Reinosa, has announced the creation of a new artillery piece based on the leFH 18 German field howitzer.\n\n While not the earth shattering bombardier that the Germans are known to also field, the leFH is far more mobile, faster-firing and far, far easier to build than the Krupp’s monsters.  The new artillery piece, named initially as Obús 105/26 Reinosa after the town itself, has already progressed to initial stages of testing, and the company has began to market it to the South American allies and friends of our regime, with Dominican Republic showing a degree in interest at buying a few pieces. Should the program succeed, it would greatly help Spain start its own heavy weapons industry, and while the nation will likely stay in the shadow of the German industrial giants for a long time, Reinosa’s products may find eager buyers among those on the Kaiserreich’s black list."

The latifundios, vineyards and citrus forests of Spain have long provided the nation and its trade partners with many exquisite tastes and much needed foodstuffs, but it has also meant that while nations such as the United Kingdom, France and Germany reaped the benefits of the modern industrial revolution, Spain lagged behind and was left out. Only the regions of Barcelona and Biscay saw a degree of industrial development, but given the strong regional identity of these two areas, it has been a highly difficult situation for the rest of Spain.\n\n As such, the new government has opened a program to supply much needed talent and experience into the pool of Spanish academics, providing the tools for a truly industrial revolution in the great nation so that it no longer suffers the fate of backwardness. Practical education, such as the school of Escuela de Ingenieros Industriales de Barcelona, shall be expanded to the programs all over the nations, from Madrid to the ancient universities of Valencia, Salamanca and Sevilla, to relatively new universities such as the University of Murcia and University of La Laguna.\n\n Additionally, companies specializing in industrial development will get their fair share of new funding, especially in areas where there is relatively little actual development going on currently, such as MZOV construction company in Galicia, La Montañesa Textil in Cantabria and the Sociedad Minera y Metalúrgica de Peñarroya in Murcia, Barcelona and Andalusia. There are hopes that the government could also fund the merger of the Asturian steel and coal mines and factories to create a new, mostly-nationally owned producer of coal to fund the new programs by supplying coal-hungry regimes such as the French National State centrally. However, only future will tell whether this endeavor succeeds, but it is safe to say that the educational and industrial development of Spain has started its very first trek towards full modernity."

sprd.210.d:0 "A curious offer has recently arrived to the desk of the head of Spanish air force, Alfredo Kindelán. A famed British aviator and playboy Jim Mollison had arrived to Madrid earlier today on his Bellanca 28-70 aircraft, with the intention to sell it to the Spanish authorities. The aircraft, nicknamed Dorothy, was initially used by Mollison in his attempt to break a speed record between the Algiers-Cape Town air route, but as this plan failed and Mollison was ordered to India in preparation of possible hostilities between the Indian splinter states, Mollison sought to sell Dorothy off for some local military to be used as a reconnaissance aircraft. The French Nationalist air force had not shown interest towards the plane, and the Moroccans were supplied by German factories, so Mollison decided to approach the Spanish air force instead. The aircraft is a tempting offer, as it possesses very high speeds at 442 km/h maximum speed, is considered a relatively easy plane to fly and according to our engineers, could be fitted with armament without too many issues related to performance. \n\nThe Bellanca company in the United States is in dire straits due to the civil strife on-going there, but they have nonetheless always been reputed as an innovative and limit-pushing company with their designs. With a service ceiling of 9300 metres and a range exceeding 4000 kilometres, the aircraft is far more capable than its current Spanish counterparts, such as the Hispano-Suiza HS.34 trainer. Adopting the plane could be the first step towards creating a truly modern Spanish reconnaissance wing, though some have pointed out that sourcing spare parts might be an issue should Bellanca be entangled in the American crisis. Nonetheless, famed Spanish aviators such as Juan de Ansaldo have tested the aircraft and support the purchase, though ultimately it is a decision of Kindelán whether the plane is accepted or not."

sprd.211.d:0 "Despite the fact that Spain managed to avoid the terrors of the Weltkrieg, Spanish aviation history is not one of idleness and backwardness, as the fledgling Aviación Militar has already seen its fair share of combat flights in the Rif War and during the numerous revolts of 1930s. One of the rising stars of this new branch of the military is the adventurer, far-right militia leader and nobleman pilot, Juan Antonio Ansaldo y Vejarano. Hailing from Basque Country, the famous pilot first saw combat during the Rif War, proving to be a scourge on the tiny air force of Abd el Krim after the destroyed one of the Durell aircrafts in their inventory and would later score other destructions of enemy aircrafts after Rifians had captured some downed Spanish planes. Ansaldo also participated in the daring Alhucemas landing, and during one sortie, kept out a stubborn attack against Rifian positions despite being wounded, turning back towards home base only after running out of ammunition and other munitions.\n\n His action would earn Ansaldo much praise and adoration, and when the last guns of Rif fell silent, king Alfonso XIII would personally grant him the Laureate Cross of San Fernando for his actions in the campaign. In his personal life, Ansaldo supported his wife Pilar in attaining a pilot license as well, and after the declaration of the republic, he would leave the military out of ideological reasons, being a hardline monarchist. His support for right-wing parties grew over time, and Ansaldo collaborated with the Hispanist magazine Acción Española. Known for his adventurous, brash and at times, violent presence, he became one of the key militia leaders working to undermine the republic and supported General Sanjurjo, a close friend of his, in the toppling of the republic. After the restoration of monarchy in Spain, Ansaldo has returned to be an important pilot in the air force, leading a squadron of bombers. His political activities remain numerous still, but have been slightly slowed by Ansaldo’s increased role in military activity."

sprd.212.d:0 "The Spanish air force may not be the most advanced or experienced in the world, but despite its lacking state, Spain has seen many a famous aviator within the ranks of its air force. Among the most famous pilots is Ramón Franco, who earned most of his fame in 1925 as a crewmember for the flying boat Plus Ultra, a model J Dornier Wal, piloted by him and another famous aviator, Julio Ruiz de Alda. Together with two other crew members, thry crossed the Atlantic from Spain to Argentina for the first time on a journey crossing over ten thousand kilometres and required over 60 hours of flight. Hailed as a hero for this achievement, Franco would return to Spain with Ruiz de Alda and serve as a flight officer until 1930, when his political leanings first reared their head. Franco, as his brothers Nicolas and Francisco before him, had joined the army in 1910s, eschewing the life of a priest for the military, but unlike his brothers, Ramón would soon turn to radical republicanism.\n\n This turn was partly caused by Franco’s second attempted crossing of the Atlantic, where his plane broke down and led to the cancellation of further attempts, much to the ire of Ramón himself. He became a strong opponent against the monarchy and dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, and together with another revolutionary airman Ignacio Hidalgo de Cisneros, the pilots attempted to bomb the royal palace in Madrid. However, their courage faltered and in the end the bombing was switched to the dropping of republican leaflets. This led to Franco’s dismissal and he turned further into radicalism, starting a Masonic Lodge while in exile and later, after the proclamation of the Republic, he was a prominent member of the Jabalí group, made up of anti-government radicals, federalists and moderate syndicalists. While Franco is not a friend of the Spanish crown in the slightest, he is nonetheless one of the greatest aviators of his generation, and his importance in the republican circles cannot be understated."

sprd.213.d:0 "The Spanish history of flight has been dominated by men, as can be expected, but recently, women have slowly started nudging their way into the field as well. The very first woman aviator of Spain has unfortunately mostly retired from the public sphere, but her legacy continues in the many other brave women chasing ever greater heights over Iberia today. That woman is María Bernaldo de  Quirós, Marquess of Alvaros. She first came into contact with aviation after witnessing a forced landing of an aircraft very close, and during the same year in 1928 she would officially get her pilot’s license from Real Aeroclub de Madrid, the first woman in Spain to do so. \n\nHer preferred craft was the D.H 60 Moth, brought into Spain by the exiles right around the time of the British collapse, and to encourage Bernaldo’s career, the De Havilland company’s local representative offered her a plane of the same model at half the price, given the dire straits the company was while transferring production to the former British dominions. Bernaldo would then name the new aircraft ‘Mosquito’, which complimented her nickname Miss Swallow among the Spanish pilots. However, despite calls from over hundred pilots in Spain, she was not made into a honorary military pilot because of her gender, as the man responsible for such honourifics, general Kindelán, was a noted conservative. Bernaldo would go on to be a highly public aviation pioneer, flying in shows and races all over Spain and performing feats, especially short-distance landings, previously thought impossible. Her most famous performance was flying over Infante Jaime’s car as the prince was arriving to his destination in A Coruña, and the car received a shower of flowers tossed from the Mosquito.\n\n Bernaldo would become a pioneer in a whole other field of Spanish society as she was one of the first women in Spain to attain a divorce from her husband, José Manuel Sánchez-Arjona, after taking advantage of the new legislature signed by the republic to allow such matters. Recent news indicate that Bernaldo has since then started a relationship with her former flight instructor, José Rodríguez y Díaz, though she has mainly stayed out of public life since the divorce. Her example has gone on to inspire many other women, such as the famed Catalan flight instructor Mari Pepa Colomer. It would appear that one of Bernaldo’s many press statements is slowly becoming true, as the pilot herself put it: ‘As public opinion evolves, people will realize that women can do more than just embroider’."

sprd.214.d:0 "The prospect of an aircraft capable of taking off and landing near vertically, without the need for long runways or even short strips of land, has long intrigued the minds of aviators. Attempts to come up with such concepts have existed since the dawn of aviation, though perhaps the most famous example is the patent for such an aircraft created by the marvellous scientific mind of Nikola Tesla. Tesla created a concept of a vertical takeoff and landing machine quite recently, in 1928, but the financial crisis in the Americas and various other factors kept the project from reaching a prototype or even a wind-tunnel mockup stage. However, it would seem that Spain’s own renaissance man, Fernando Gallego Herrera, has recently dedicated himself to the task of seeing Tesla’s vision come true. Starting in 1933, Gallego has worked on a craft he calls aerogenio, which utilizes compressed air-powered system which could give it an ability to take off and land vertically.\n\n Based on Gallego’s statements, such a craft could fly from Salamanca to Madrid in ten minutes, and cross the Atlantic from Madrid to New York in four to six hours. He also planned for it to have military applications, especially as a bomber. However, it would appear that the craft was cursed from the start, being denied to be shown on its first outing by the Ministry of Aviation out of fear that it would crash into the curious crowds, and following the actual first flight of the machine, the tests had to be cancelled due to issues with the rudder. This initial test also raised quite a bit of concern over whether the aerogenio could actually reach the speeds promised, but further testing was not possible after the prototype was destroyed in a fire in 1935. The device was a true marvel of engineering, even if it could not achieve all the feats promoted by Gallego, as it is completely unique in the field of aeronautics from known aircraft, or helicopters, so original that it lacks wings, propeller, rudders and tail.\n\n According to Gallego, he could scale the power of a mere 80 horsepower engine to lift the rather large machine, and should he be granted more funding, he could look into modifying the design further, to facilitate further tests and fine-tuning to the craft. Needless to say that the civilian and military utilizations of such a marvellous vehicle are manifold, even if it is not particularly fast or cannot carry a large payload. The work of Juan de Cierva on his autogyros has already shown the usefulness of hovercraft, and Gallego’s creation could be the very next step in evolution for these incredible machines."

Twelve officers defied this order, clearly falling into treacherous republican ideas, and were discharged from military service to be imprisoned for their treason. Among them was a man named Virgilio Leret, who spent his days in prison hard at work, designing a propulsion engine previously unknown to the world of Spanish aviation. He was released from prison before this work could be completed, as the Second Spanish republic provided an amnesty for him, but when the republic was toppled by General Sanjurjo, he was once again imprisoned for his lack of support for the coup, forced to serve his sentence in the Rif. While there, Leret finished the concept he had for a jet engine, calling it continuous reaction turbocompressor.\n\n Around the same time, similar concepts were being circulated in the Kaiserreich and Union of Britain alike, so Leret’s contribution was on the bleeding edge of scientific advancement in aviation. After the thaw in the regime following the instability of 1936 and 1937, Leret was released as he was not officially part of any radical organization, and soon he found work in Cuatro Vientos aerodrome as a mechanical engineer and lecturer on avionics. His revolutionary concept of an engine has yet to see actual implementation and construction, but should Leret be given the needed funding, his design may finally see the light of day, and propel Spanish aviation to newfound heights."

One such woman was Maria Josep Colomer i Luque, a Catalan woman from Sabadell, coming from a wealthy family of artists, with Colomer growing up alongside such famous names as Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso, her father taking her to bars and other venues away from the prying eyes of her strict mother. However, unlike her father’s, Colomer’s heart yearned for the skies, and she would join the Barcelona Aviation School in 1930 thanks to the help of her father, something her mother would not be aware of. In 1931, at an age of merely 17, she would finally obtain her license, and given that she was the first woman to make such an achievement, she was featured on the front cover of Catalonia’s largest newspaper, La Vanguardia, which finally made her mother aware of her extracurricular activities.\n\n She would become something of a darling for the new republican regime, flying a banner with republican colours on the eve of the new governmental system’s proclamation, carrying the Catalan republican nationalist Lluis Companys as one of her first passengers, and both her and her teacher Josep Maria Carreras y Dexeus would appear in numerous pro-republican spectacles of the time. Perhaps the most glorious event for Colomer was her landing one of the few Zeppelins in Spain in front of a large crowd, earning her a place in the hearts of Catalans for years to come.\n\n Having solidified her skills and place as a pioneer of Catalan aviation, she would go on to found the first cooperative of Aerial Work of Catalonia. In addition to this, she would go on to help found the Catalan School of Aviation, where she would teach much older students than herself as well. While known for spectacular showmanship and humorous stunts, such as dressing up as Mary Poppins while flying a plane, the restoration of the monarchy was not good for her career as she was known for her republican and Catalanist leanings, and the her aviation school has been the site of many inspections out of fear that it is used to train Catalan dissidents. Nonetheless, the Mary Poppins of Catalonia flies on, defying the expectations placed on Spanish and Catalan women and inspiring generations to come with her daring aerial performances."

sprd.217.d:0 "The advent of heavier-than-air flight in Spain was received relatively quickly, with numerous pioneers attempting to imitate the work of the Wright brothers in Castile, Catalonia, Andalusia and Basque country, but the roots of Spanish aviation were not dug into the ground then. In fact, pioneers of Spanish aviation go back centuries, if not millenia even, and perhaps the most known early aviator who actually finished his creation and flew it was Diego Marín Aguilera, who lived in the second half of the 18th century. Hailing from Galicia, he came from an agrarian family and took over the family farmstead after his father died, where he would use his intellect to manufacture all sorts of contraptions aimed at increasing output or helping daily life of the local peasants and farmers.\n\n However, his inspiration towards aviation came as he observed eagles and hawks while tending to his sheep herd, and for six years, he would toil on a flying machine, built from wood, iron, cloth, and feathers, the feathers coming from those dropped by the very same eagles and vultures he had been inspired by. His contraption, built with the help of local blacksmith Joaquín Barbero, was made to imitate the biology of the birds, especially their wings, which he tried to create using iron joints. The machine also had hand cranks and stirrups for controlling its direction, and Marín spent a long time calculating the different aspects of the bird’s biology transferred to its new iron and wooden form to ensure the possibility of flight. First taking flight from castle of Coruña del Conde during nighttime, he remarked ‘I'm going to Burgo de Osma, and from there to Soria, and I'll be back in a couple of days’. This would prove to be a false expectation, as the glider did fly for nearly 400 metres before crashing into the ground as one of the welded joints broke. Marín himself survived with merely scratches and bruises, but his ire towards Barbero was far greater, and the glider was left where it crashed for the night. \n\nHowever, the local townsfolk, seeing Marín ‘s eccentricity in a far more superstitious light, saw the contraption as a vessel of lunacy and the demonic, and they burned the flying machine, much to the humiliation of Marín. The inventor would never recover from this loss, and died at the age of 44, leaving behind no schematics or documentation on his groundbreaking invention. While there had been others before him that had attempted flight, it would appear that this misunderstood man was the father of Spanish aviation, made even more incredibly due to his lack of formal education. For this illustrious feat, the military aviation officers have suggested that the government build a monument to his ingenious machine, right in the middle of his village, proving that history does not forget pioneers, no matter how much the ignorant of their time may try to force it."

However, it is clear that the German proxy state of Morocco has been funding these rebels for years now, both in Rif and in the colonial holdings of Nationalist France. Even during the Primo de Rivera dictatorship there were plans to destabilize Morocco and invade it, though the threat of a German reprisal kept even the fiercest warmongers in check. However, with German economy shattered, its mega-colony of Mittelafrika bursting at seams and the ever-present threat of French and Russian revanchist attacks, Germany cannot support its Maghreb puppet as efficiently as it once could. As we have grown stronger, the lackeys of Muhammad V have not, and with every passing day it becomes more clear that if we were to invade, the illegitimate kingdom of Morocco would collapse in a matter of days. While this could draw the ire of the Germans, it would finally end the Rifian insurgency and restore some of the pride Spain has had such shortage of in the past since 1898."

However, Sanjurjo and his allies chose to restore Alfonso XIII, seeing him as a more pliable puppet, and the Carlists, enraged by this betrayal, began to plot an uprising that would seat their own candidate on the throne of Spain.\n\n However, after the restoration of Jaime I to the throne, his even more hardliner stance on traditionalism has caused many Carlists to change their views on the situation, and the separatist revolt further weakened their ranks as the more radical members of the organization joined the separatists and perished in running battles against the Spanish army and Guardia Civil.\n\n Bereft of their regionalist allies and faced with the resurgent Alfonsine monarchism, the Traditionalist Communion has sent a representative, a dual-member of both Carlist groups and Renovación Española, Romualdo de Toledo, to negotiate a possible merger of the two dynastic lines back into one.

CNT-FAI and their PSOE and BOC allies were constantly attempting to subvert our rule, and especially in 1936 anarchist deathsquads would attack conservative politicians in their homes while the traditionalists were actively training their Requete troops in the difficult terrain of Navarra and Basque Country to strike at the heart of the kingdom and install their pretender king. The right-wing militias hardly helped the spiral, as groups such as Juan Antonio Ansaldo’s Guerillas de Guerrillas de España, José Calvo Sotelo’s Juventudes Unificadas de Acción Nacionalista and the Legionarios de España of José María Albiñana were a common sight on the streets, with their harassment and persecution of opposing politicians, be they socialists, republicans or even moderate monarchists led to increased societal division.\n\n The streets of large cities weren’t safe for the most part of 1936, and when the separatist revolts began, the weakened anarchists and republicans attempted large-scale riots and rebellions in addition to those happening in the uprising regions. While it is true that without the support of right-wing militias in suppressing the left-wing rebellions, the Spanish kingdom may have ceased to exist, their presence continues to create an atmosphere of tension and paranoia. As the anarchists have gone underground or fled to France, the separatists are crushed and the republicans driven to exile, many feel that the right-wing militias may soon start fighting amongst themselves. \n\nRumours are already spreading of Ansaldo’s Guerillas fighting with the Legionaries of PNE, as Ansaldo is, most importantly, a power-hungry adventurer. The new moderate administration cannot stand this situation, and the loyalists within the military who can be counted upon not to have aligned with any of the militias will be sent to dismantle them, peacefully if possibly, by force if need be. The Kingdom of Spain cannot tolerate such infighting within its supporters, and any differences of opinion must be discussed through political means within the new, transformed Cortes, not through barbarian street brawls.

Figures like Francesc Macia, Luis Arana, Daniel Cardona i Civit and Vicente Risco have caused issues to Guardia Civil and Carabineros throughout the years, most importantly during the Plot of Prats de Mollo, where Catalan separatists tried to invade Catalonia through Commune of France. The Communards are more than happy to use these internal divisions to their advantage as they continue to undermine Hispanic unity within Iberia, and the local parties are eager to use their support.\n\n Nonetheless, if Spain’s minorities are to be trampled under the iron boot of Spanish army and Guardia Civil, it’s bound to cause further dissent. Moderates within the new regime, such as the supporters of Partido Fusionista and Partido Agrario Español, have supported establishing a limited degree of autonomy to the regional groups, using only reliable parties such as Dereita Galeguista, Derecha de Cataluña, Partido Socialista Monárquico and Unión Navarra, who will act as a converging point to loyal regionalists.\n\n These groups can then advocate development of autonomy within the interests of local groups and the national interests of Spain, to avoid further trouble with separatist groups. However, to most members of Accion Popular, this is simply unacceptable, and they are only willing to give limited linguistic rights to the citizens of Catalan and Basque regions. Given the federal nature of the party, they believe that if the Basques and Catalans want to improve their situation, they must do it through their own respective parties, such as Acción Popular Catalana, Unión Navarra, Derecha Regional Valenciana and Unión Regional de Derechas de La Coruña. Through this loyalist dialogue can certain rights be granted if local leadership considers it pertinent, though autonomy of certain regions will only lead to the further dissolution of Spanish unity, something that AP’s Jefe, Jose Maria Gil-Robles, considers utterly unacceptable."

As such, despite their overt Germanophilia, members of the Spanish right have now grown wary of German economic domination, and there has been a far stronger call to economic protectionism, decoupling Spain’s markets from rest of Europe to return to the agrarian domestic model that dominated its economic development prior to the Primo de Rivera dictatorship. Trade will resume with friendly nations of South America to a large degree, but German and other Mitteleuropan businesses will be nationalized if they’ve lingered here long enough to still remain.\n\n This is mainly due to the bitter taste left by the sudden withdrawal of Germany from multiple profitable ventures in mainland Spain and Rif right after the first shockwave of the Black Week. Some corporations, such as the large filmmaker CIFESA, will likely continue cooperation with German businesses, as their connections to the Kaiserreich are too vital to cut, but for the most part, Spain will seek new business partners elsewhere while maintaining a very isolationist and protectionist outlook on its domestic market as the nation recovers from these near crippling crises. Some of this loss in trade will be supplemented by trade with the Entente, especially French National State, as well as the Latin American countries, but the reality of the situation is that Spain must strive for autarky if it wishes to avoid a crash of this magnitude again.."

When the moderate conservatives were installed as the king’s new cabinet, many expected a quick return to at least some degree of pluralist democracy, even if it would not be a liberal democratic one, but the current government disagrees with this notion.\n\n They believe that Spain’s radical right would simply use it to gain power once more and dismantle what little institutions remain within Spain, which in turn would lead to another collapse down the line. The moderate ruling coalition is of the opinion that only through the mild authoritarian rule and taking inspiration from the Berenguer dictablanda can Spain return to normalcy and begin rebuilding itself from the ground up, to fix the mistakes of the republic, the military autocracy and the Accion Popular provisional government in handling the numerous issues that plague Spain today.\n\n Perhaps one day, some degree of constitutional democracy can be reinstituted, but for now, the moderates shall rule alone and use their strong executive to weaken the power-hungry radicals of other right-wing parties, the greedy military men seeking to reinstate a Sanjurjo-style dictatorship and the remaining republicans wishing to topple the God-ordained kingdom of Spain. For now, however, the lives of Spaniards can be as free as is possible to be allowed to them, and while they may not influence the political course of our nation much, they can rest assured that their rights as citizens of Spain are guaranteed."

These Camilas Verdes, or Greenshirts, as they are colloquially known, issued a founding manifesto upon their formation in 1932, declaring war on syndicalism and Freemasonry as they claim these movements to be inherently anti-Spanish and will lead to Spain denying that what makes Spain itself. Recently, JAP has added republicanism to this list of enemies, claiming that the accidentalist positions some within Accion Popular took upon the proclamation of the second Spanish republic were misguided and at worst, simply traitorous.\n\n To these restless and violent youth of our party, the monarchy is the new normal, and with the old unpopular monarch Alfonso XIII gone, the youth wing has revitalized to be a banner of monarchism, striking syndicalist sympathizers, communist rabble rousers and republican lackeys on the streets where ever these vermin rear their heads. However, with much of their old enemies gone, the youth wing has turned inwards, and possibly the most notable change was the expulsion of the movement’s leader and founder, Jose Maria Valiente, who was expelled for Carlist sympathies. Alongside him, various other Carlist sympathizers were imprisoned, exiled or even killed, and JAP’s new leader, José María Pérez de Laborda has announced that weak links within the organization will be purged, be they leftovers from the Christian democratic wing or sympathizers of non-monarchist organizations, such as Juntas Castellanas de Actuation Hispanica.\n\n Many moderates now fear that JAP will become a para-military wing of the monarchy, lashing out at any perceived opponents with violence and blackmail, until none but the most staunchest monarchist remain in Spain’s political apparatus. Many have also noted the personality cult of José María Gil-Robles and the veneration the JAP has for El Hefe, which is increasingly viewed with suspicion by members of Accion Popular. It is feared that Gil-Robles would utilize JAP to remove political opponents within the party and install loyal men in their place. Whatever the matter is, it is clear that JAP will only grow in importance in Spanish domestic security and party politics given its recent return to violent actions against perceived enemies of state."

The republicans, naive as always, assumed a return to democracy would happen if the monarchy scraped by in the elections of 1937, but given how close the race was between Carlists and Syndicalists compared to our final tally, Accion Popular could not support the return to constitutional democracy, for it could lead to an election victory of our rivals later on. The damage this could do to the state of Spain is not hard to see, the Carlists would return Spain to feudalism while the syndicalists would sell us to France and follow their anarchist delusions, destroying the very pillars of what makes a Spaniard what he is today.\n\n However, it is clear that some form of local organization and decisionmaking must be permitted within the new state, though this will happen through natural societal structures and organizations, not through elected representatives and meddling parties who seek to push division and dangerous agendas. Families, local Catholic unions, municipal councils and religious layman groupings will be the new organs of organic democracy, maintaining citizen participation and civil rights but concentrating the legislative and executive power in the hands of a single party to avoid the chaos and division that occurs in parliamentary democracies, though in the case of the new monarchist Spain, some other parties are still allowed to exist at least for now, as Accion Popular lacks the needed strength to go after its rivals and regularly collaborates with them on most matters."

sprd.236.d:0 "The first executive action of UMN has been to curtail the power of the vipers within Spain’s political elite, the Freemasons who brought about the end of the monarchy originally in 1930 and tried to do so again mere months ago. It is clear that these conspiratorial clubs and groups have no love for the monarchy nor Hispanidad, the inherent fabric of Spanish soul. Their only aim is to drag Spain into their perceived modernity, stripping away all the characteristics of what makes a Spaniards different from the surrounding peoples and replacing them with the formless mass of some liberal “European identity”. This dystopian vision of the Spanish future was averted through the quick intervention of general Sanjurjo in 1932, and the might of the Spanish army destroyed the last gasp of Masonry during the separatist revolt.\n\n The republican idealism will slowly wither away and die under the rule of our new kingdom, and in its place, a wholly Hispanic new state will rise, trusting its king, aristocrats and military professionals to lead it to greatness where the civilian politicians and soft bureaucrats failed. The utmost role of UMN will be to lead Spain on a resurgence towards greatness, but to achieve this, societal harmony must be achieved either by removing the undesirable elements, such as the Masons, troublemaking syndicalists or regionalist traitors, or through careful cooperation, negotiation and when the time calls for it, coercion. The ideas of Miguel Primo de Rivera’s Unión Patriótica will live on despite the lamented death of their originator.\n\n The Supreme National Assembly, a body meant to propose and fine-tune new legislation for the government of Unión Monárquica Nacional, will be restored and the relic from the republican era, the near-defunct Cortes, will be fully abolished. The original dictatorship of Primo de Rivera made the error of trying to show this change as a provisional, temporary change that would eventually give way to some form of parliamentarism, but to UMN, this is the final form of governance. Spain cannot fall into the pit of liberal delusions anymore, there cannot be polarizing parliamentary democracy that would only invite vipers similar to the likes of Freemasons to form their little cliques and political machines. The government shall rule supreme with the king as their nominal head, though unlike previously with Alfonso XIII and his weak resistance to the dictatorship, UMN has made sure that the monarch’s position is not something that could cause issues to the powerful executive organs of Spain. Only the iron fist of the military and UMN will ensure the continued dominance of Hispanidad in the lives of Spaniards."

sprd.237.d:0 "The new national order of Unión Monárquica Nacional is inherently linked to the military and the clique of officers led by Jose Sanjurjo, and while the military is not particularly interested in ruling as a stratocracy, they still hold considerable power as the only force strong enough to contest the Carlists, anarchists and separatists. However, using the military as the shock troops of the UMN regime is both wasteful and difficult from a propaganda perspective, as it will simply alienate our citizens and make them think that the military is fully in control, not the uniting force of UMN’s apolitical and benevolent rule.\n\n Nonetheless, the society itself must be militarized to a degree, as there are both domestic and international threats to our nation that must be overcome with the force of arms if no other solution can solve it, as was the case with the separatist devils. Commune of France views us as an existential threat, the Nationalists and Moroccans covet our possessions in Africa and the internal enemies may have been largely driven out of Spain for now but eventually they will return to undermine our rule. As a solution to the need for militarization of Spanish society, UMN government has decided to integrate the various para-military forces that collaborated with its general organization, and transfer them to a militia from the age of Primo de Rivera that saw a brief resurgence during the Catalan rising.\n\n La Traza, an anti-Catalanist, Hispano-supremacist group following the example of the Carlist Sindicatos Libres, was originally made up of loyal followers of dictator Primo de Rivera, and while it was disbanded during the Republican years, its master Manuel Delgado Barreto, a former Maurist, reopened the militia during the Sanjurjada and supported the hunt for Catalan separatists between 1932 and 1937. Delgado, who has been a strong ally of UMN since its inception, has his supporters, primarily the son of dictator Primo de Rivera, Jose Antonio, as well as Eugenio Vegas Latapié. However, others, more orthodox members transitioning over from Unión Patriótica, such as UMN’s leader Rafael Benjumea y Burín and relatively moderate supporter José Gabilán have noted that the party should instead focus its efforts into resurrecting the Somatén, a parapolice formation originally created in Catalonia during the 1920s, which general idea is to protect the rights of landowners and private property, and to break strikes from syndicalists and socialists.\n\n The exact nature of these forces was always quite varied, and some Somatén groups were little more than civilians with weapons. Primo de Rivera even banned the ownership of weapons from those not part of the organization, and while the Somatén was not particularly well-organized during the dictatorship, it was expanded to all of Spain, eventually becoming a sort of neighbourhood watch. This organization would allow for a more grassroots defence of Spain from agents who wish to destroy our eternal nation, but compared to La Traza it is quite amateurish and not particularly strong should the enemy be quite organized. Still, it is argued that the Somatén is less radical group and thus is not as risky for the regime as it is mostly a passive force, not the active group rooting out enemies of the state which always has a possibility of turning otherwise docile citizens towards radical causes out of protest."

sprd.238.d:0 "Early morning sun hung over Madrid, scorching the city streets with light. The new order under the authoritarian monarchists had settled in, and the avenues and boulevards of the old city replicated this, with Guardia Civil patrols marching by civilians, followed by militiamen from the ruling party’s youth organizations who hawkishly hunted dissidents. The crisis of recent years had left Spain’s mightiest cities scarred, and to many, Madrid had suffered the most. The paranoia in the air of the city was perhaps the strongest wound left by the civil conflict, as the citizens of Madrid fear bombings, assassinations or shootouts instigated by the anarchists or socialists. However, in recent weeks, the anarchist resistance has weakened. Guardia Civil, led primarily by general Sanjurjo himself, assisted by the Carabineros of Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer, have begun a series of pin-point crackdowns, utilizing demoralized anarchists as informants to open up anarchist cells for attacks, and while this does not always result in wanted results, it has greatly weakened CNT-FAI’s militancy. With the near total destruction of the Catalan anarchists during the uprising, the organization is buckling under the weight of the military, and numerous large scale massacres in towns such as Casas Viejas have led to further weakening of the remaining militant’s resolve. Many have attempted to escape to France, but with careful cooperation with regionalist forces, especially Liga Regionalista in Catalonia, the escape routes of anarchists have been mapped out and mostly blocked by Carabineros. Most anarchist cells in Madrid have been purged, and while some notorious fighters such as Buanaventura Durruti and Felix Likiniano in Basque Country still continue the fight, it is clear that the flame of CNT-FAI’s rebellion is on the verge of being snuffed out. The rank-and-file workers of the movement have already flooded into the new national unions established by the regime, and while it will take a while to deprogram these men from their anarcho-syndicalist delusions, it is yet another proof to the propaganda machine of new Spain that CNT-FAI was nothing more than a group of terrorists utilizing the past strife in Spain to further the aims of international syndicalism. With time, the new Catholic unions will erase the stain of red syndicalism."

However, many within the government’s new administration fear that the influx of former left-wing agitators will lead to an insidious takeover of these organizations through slow and meticulous infiltration, especially with Commune of France on our Eastern border. While most of the syndicalists have been removed from the Iberian peninsula one way or another, rooting these weeds fully would be a Herculean task, and for the time being we must be wary of false shepherds within the workers’ organizations.\n\n  As such, the current government proposes that the unions of Spain should be merged into one, centralized organization that can monitor the situation of smaller federal sections of the unions and intervene in their matters should they stray from the intended path of Catholic unionism. The new unions will be fully corporatist in organization, and their main goal is to promote harmony between the different actors of Spain, avoiding clashes between property owners and workers. Every union from Asturias to Andalusian coast will be integrated into the new organization, with even moderate left-wing unions dismantled and their members moved into new groups.\n\n  The members of Renovación Española and Acción Española support utilizing the ideas of Guillermo Rovirosa, a member of Acción Católica ecclesial movement, and his template of Catholic unionism named Hermandad Obrera de Acción Católica. HOAC would be administered separate from the regime, but with a strong connection to the Catholic church, and in the case of the new Spain, observed tightly by the military and regime. This would allow for some degree of mobility within the movement to avoid it becoming a full lackey of the regime and incapable of giving proper advice on matters of labour.\n\n  However, the members of Unión Monárquica Nacional and Partido Nacionalista Español instead support the ideas of Eduardo Aunós Pérez, who has supported the recreation of Organización Corporativa Nacional, a syndicate organization of the Primo de Rivera era which supported the creation of workers’ and employers’ councils where five worker representatives and five employer representatives must agree on matters of labour contracts before they can be put into action. These councils will later evolve into councils of the corporation of each trade, which will ensure lack of labour conflicts through agreements of labour regulation, and should issues arise, they can be best suited to resolve them in as short of a timeframe as possible. Aunós’ idea is very much born out of social Catholicism, but actually evolved naturally into corporatism. While the original OCN supported the continuation of existing unions, one of the central leaders of UMN, Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, has supported the merging of existing unions into a new national union, Movimiento Español Sindicalista, which would integrate the existing unions under a single entity, with the OCN’s councils acting as a overseer body to MES.."

However, as can be expected from the mighty España, we crushed such insolent traitors, but while the people of Spain can now breathe easily once more as the drums of war have silenced, the lingering doubt that a scenario of similar nature could happen in the future, remains.\n\n As the followers of José Calvo Sotelo and his Renovación Española have taken the reins of governance as ordained by the king, they have set upon to fix this glaring issue gnawing at the governors of Spain. Calvo Sotelo, an ardent follower of Charles Maurras’ ideas, has not always agreed on Maurras’ localist policies, as he viewed the republican era ideas of wide autonomy given to Spain’s minority regions as a mistake.\n\n However, Renovación Española has since revisited the issue, and unlike many other parties in Spain today, such as Acción Popular and Unión Monárquica Nacional, RE believes that a degree of regional autonomy may just save Spain from dealing with a similar issue further down the line. The rights given to the regions of Catalonia and Basque Country will not be as large as those planned by republicans originally, but Calvo Sotelo believes that Spain’s minorities must be autonomous ‘with an umbilical cord’, always linking the autonomous territories to Spain through shared cultural, religious and societal structures. The local municipal councils and other houses of governance will be able to conduct many of their functions according to local traditions and societal standards, as long as they do not clash with the ideas of Castilian central government. Any ideas or plans of secession will be harshly dealt with, but as long as the regions submit under the authority of Madrid in national-level matters, it is hoped that Renovación Española might just pacify the stubborn Basques and Catalans."

The new state will be based on the ideas of Victor Pradera, and his magnum opus El Estado Nuevo, that outlines a new Spain based on the old models, especially the era of Catholic Monarchs in Spain. The new Spain would be a corporate one, overcoming the social antagonisms of liberal democracy or absolute monarchy, focused on alleviating social tensions and wholly destroying the cursed legacy of capitalism in Spain.\n\n  The new regime must create a mystique of totalitarianism, a state which perpetuates itself through the ideals of Hispanism, monarchism and strong governance, through a cult of venerating Spain’s glorious history. The economy will be directed by the state, and unionism will be formalized through Catholic organization, through the utilization of existing agrarian and industrial unions such as Sindicato Católico de Obreros Mineros, Juventud Obrera de Acción Católica and most importantly, Confederación Nacional Católico-Agraria, will be simply integrated to Renovación Española’s new state. Some members of the government have even proposed imposing an unification of these unions into a singular, highly decentralized but centrally controlled federation of trade unions, though the integration of these unions is a more pressing matter for now. The new state shall hold an absolute ironclad hierarchy, imposing law and order to dispel any notions of dissent swiftly.

While AE shares many elements with both of these parties, the perhaps greatest defining trait of its leader Ramiro de Maetzu is his concept of Hispanidad. Maetzu, a member of the Generation of ‘98, took the loss of Spain’s last colonies harshly, and came up with the concept of Hispanidad to utilize as a blueprint on what the new Spanish nationalism would look like. He believes that despite the differences that Spain’s many minorities have towards the dominant Castilians, all the different peoples of Iberia still share the same Hispanic macroculture, which binds them far more than whatever perceived small peculiarities entities such as Galicians, Basques and Catalans may possess.\n\n His idea of Hispanidad is an evolution of the ideas of the famed Spanish academic Miguel de Unamuno, who saw Hispanidad as an egalitarian stance on La Raza, where the various Spanish colonies were sister republics to the mainland Spain, not offspring. Maetzu, on the other hand, believes that the shared values in Catholicism and cultural norms are the most important aspect of Hispanidad, and his vision does not trip to the pitfall of egalitarianism and liberalism. Thus, despite their betrayal, the approach towards these minorities should remain paternalistic but fair.\n\n The separatists were clearly goaded to this insurrectionary action by forces beyond our control, be they the slow and rotting influence of liberalism on the Spanish psyche, the insidious work of Communards saboteurs or the republican remnants hiding amidst various regionalists. Acción Española shall work with regional loyalists, such as Catalan Lliga Regionalista and Peña Blanca, Basque Liga de Acción Monárquica and Unión Navarra and Galician Dereita Galeguista to reaffirm ties towards these minority peoples, and transform the hatred and vitriol their people share into common understanding under the wider Hispanist moniker. Of course, there will be harsh retributions to the leaders of the treacherous revolt, but for the most part, we must be gentle with the locals. Only those truly lost will have to be punished, for the rest we shall guide them towards the light of Hispanidad and teach these wayward peoples just how unique the connection between Castile and her many brethren on Iberian peninsula truly is.

As such, the transformation into a proper party has not been an easy one, and debates on the ideological direction of the party have been fiery, with a few strings of consistency acting as the main thread of debate, such as Ramiro de Maetzu’s idea of Hispanidad, anti-regionalist fervour of Víctor Pradera and general disdain for both Freemasons and Jewish shared by many members of the movement. Beyond that, concepts on what direction the party should take are hardly uniform, with many members such as Marquis of Quintanar, Fernando Gallego de Chaves Calleja, supporting Lusitanian-style integralism, while others such as Emilio Ruiz Muñoz support adopting Integrist ideas, pointing out that no other ideology in Iberia is quite as strongly Catholic as the fundamentalists of Integrism.\n\n However, many view Integrism as wholly tainted by its association with Carlism, a notion that is not entirely untrue given that the formed was very much an evolution of Carlist ideas. A minority within Acción Española also support the ideas of Leon Degrelle, a famed Walloonian radical right-wing activist and fiery defender of Catholicism, to act as an inspiration for the new party, as his ideas are similar to those of Charles Maurras, but less defined and not as steeped in the positivism of Maurras, something that made the French ideologue less attractive as an inspiration to members of Acción Española.\n\n Finally, a small section of the new party has converged around José Pemartín, a strong traditionalist ideologue, who advocates for supporting the Latin monarchies of Europe to combat the Communard threat, and even collaborating with Germany, as according to Pemartín, the defeat of the Communards and the likely union of the two German powers in Europe would slowly Catholicize the continent, leading to a new Holy Roman Empire to be a likely conclusion, helped along by the power of Catholic, traditionalist Spain. Pemartín is very much a typical Catholic traditionalist, but his ideas have been called broadly Paneuropeanist as well, breaking from the typical Hispanist line of the party. His support is relatively tiny, however, but the ideas of reigniting Catholic domination in Europe have caused many nationalists within the party to align with Pemartín."

Pemartín supports Germany in the upcoming clash against Syndicalism, but in his eyes, it will only lead to a return to traditionalism as the machinations of modernist and godless forces are driven from Europe, the grip of corrupting ideas of socialism, Freemasonry and ‘international Jewish conspiracy’ pried open to suffocate the true soul of Europe nevermore. Pemartín believes that it would lead to the unification of Germany and Austria, in turn propelling Germany back into Catholicism.\n\n All these developments would cascade into a new Holy Roman Empire, built around traditional values, Catholicism and the more developed nationalities supporting the younger nations like Germany to reach their true potential. In Pemartín’s vision, this utopia of the Spanish right would then adopt ideals from the Mediterranean cradle of civilization and act as a bulwark against future attacks by godless civilizations of other continents. However, Pemartín’s critics have pointed out that for his ideals to come to pass, plenty of things he has prophesied will have to come to pass, including a German victory in the Weltkrieg, an unification with Austrian and a return to Catholicism.\n\n This would likely be a hardly possible scenario given the recent nationalism in Germany and a still relatively large Protestant population, as well as their entire monarchic house being made up of Protestants. Some of the most ardent supporters of Pemartín have even claimed that Spain should not be a passive bystander, instead seeking to unite the continent by force of arms, especially now that Spain is a resurgent power and rebuilding from centuries of bad governance. While Pemartín still believes in his own vision, the critics have made him reconsider the matter, and it is possible that he could cave to pressure and seek unification by sword."

Yet now that Acción Española has seized the state apparatus and a less controversial king, one that the Carlists were originally willing to compromise on, sits on the throne, it seems that battlelines are slowly fading away.\n\n Many Carlist hardliners fell alongside separatist scum, hellbent on seeing the Madrid regime fall even if it meant seeing Eternal Spain fracture, but the more rational members of the Traditionalist Communion have started to see the error of their ways. Many are now crawling back to us, realizing that continuing to support the seditious claims of their pretender will only lead Spain to further division and ruin. Former Carlists are already approaching us in droves, and many within AE view this situation as the most auspicious to start negotiations to fully absorb the Communion into part of our organization.\n\n This would obviously somewhat affect our party structure in the short term, but the abilities and prowess of Carlist politicians and officers cannot be understated, and their connections to the regional parties would help us further pacify the separatist regions. After nearly a decade of fraternal infighting, Spain’s monarchist forces may finally unite under one traditionalist and wholly loyal front, to forevermore watch over Eternal Spain and to stand guard against the dual devils of liberalism and syndicalism."

The various militias of the parties are often led by less than stable or overly ambitious individuals, and keeping such volatile powderkegs around the new Spanish state is simply unacceptable. The Agrarians plan to reform the military after a period of settling into the leadership of the nation, and their plan includes a relatively large downsizing of the military from navy to the army, where the old and obsolete weapons are sold in exchange of less, but better, armaments, and the same will apply to the military men, both the number of soldiers and the amount of officers. The new Spanish army will be a centralized, professional and effective force, and this reorganization will have no room for paramilitary political forces, no matter how experienced they may be at cracking skulls on the streets of Spain’s cities. By using the military to dismantle the militias one by one, the Agrarian leadership, especially the leader of the party José Martínez de Velasco, hopes that the other parties will not support various military radicals once they find themselves without work after the downsizing of Spain’s military. Additionally, given that PAE lacks a proper militia force of their own, the act of removing the rival parties’ militias from the streets will only benefit the public image and popularity of PAE at the expense of their rivals. Some naysayers are commenting that this will provoke the rival militias to act against the state, but given that the king and military stand behind the Agrarians, this is hardly a frightening scenario."

sprd.249.d:0 "The new government of Partido Agrario Español is hardly something that was expected of a new, authoritarian Spain, either by the republican traitors or the militant radicals of Spanish right. Yet perhaps this is why PAE was chosen to lead the nation, as despite their overtly monarchist sympathies and strong support for national values, be they in terms of religion, gender relations or societal organization, the PAE is very much a force for slow, steady and meticulous progress, unlike many radical members of Renovación Española or Traditional Communion, who wish to return to the distant path. PAE instead looks only slightly to the past, observing Admiral Berenguer’s period as the head of Spain as a certain new inspiration. PAE has always supported strong centralism, not massively at the expense of regional actors but simply to ensure that the sacred unity of Spain is never threatened by the separatist, syndicalist or other radicals. As such, Berenguer’s Dictablanda period may very well serve as a great template for PAE’s reforms, as the party has no future plans to reinstate a form of parliamentary democracy. Instead, the party will continue to uphold the rights of Spain’s citizenry, keeping them from harmful delusions such as liberalism, progressivism and republicanism, while providing reforms at a pace that are the complete opposite of the republican harmful strategy of trying to drive through multiple radical shifts in Spanish society. There are things within the Republican program that are not wholly destructive, and many within PAE support their adoption in a slightly updated form, such as laws of regional autonomy, military reform and other minor additions, yet other ideas are completely unacceptable, such as Republican ideas of secularism and agrarian reform. The heartlands of Spain in Leon and Castile will see some degree of change in rural organization, but PAE will ensure that this is done fairly and not in the socialist mockery of justice that was attempted in 1932. The new Spain under PAE will be one of decisive action, slow progress and benevolent, respectful government, but not one that will share its power with those that do not have the means to ensure the same, if they were to get into power."

sprd.250.d:0 "Unión Patriótica, the party created in support of general Miguel Primo de Rivera’s regime and soon absorbed to be the sole party of the dictatorship, has long been an inspiration to the Spanish right. Sad reality is that the union was unsuccessful in its aims to create an apolitical movement aimed solely at uniting the Spanish people on the fundamentally excellent values of Catholicism and corporatism. Yet from seeds of failure PNE must grow a new union, following in the values of Primo de Rivera into a new dawn. The ideas of national unionism and Catholic restructuring of the entire society will be implemented country-wide, and the values of Fatherland, Faith and Monarchy will be drilled into the heads of Spanish youth in the heavily-sponsored new education of PNE so they may never stray to republicanism or syndicalism ever again.\n\n Under the king’s watchful eye, we will attempt to merge the values of Unión Patriótica in a new way, creating local branches of PNE that will allow it to fit local conditions better, while still supporting the core values of our ideology, taking note from the success of Accion Popular in federalizing itself into multiple smaller parties in different regions that can further create grassroots agitation for this new vision of Spain. This new direction, partially inspired by the Carlists in its function given Albinana’s fascination with traditionalism, will focus on the core ideals of country, religion and monarchy as the pillars of Spanish society. However, one part where our new party structure will differ from the original ideals of Unión Patriótica is in the continued utilization of Albinana’s Legionaries.\n\n While majority of the movement will consist of ‘neutral men of pious faith and good ideas’, Albinana’s Legionaries will always be there, in the shadows, preying on any socialist or syndicalist guerillero who dares to intervene in the creation of a pure, loyal Spanish state. Another idea taken directly from the original ideas of Primo de Rivera is the recreation of Somatén, a rural defence force especially in Catalonia that will ensure the rights of property owners and punish the eternal threat of Marxist infiltration into our loyal farmer folk."

Albiñana, a doctor by trade, has always had an interest in eugenics, and his ideas of Hispanic race coincide with those of the famous father of right-wing nationalist Hispanism, Ramiro de Maetzu. Together, they outlined the idea of Hispanic supremacy, stemming from the values of Catholicism, traditionalism and martial prowess, and in the eyes of Albiñana, the utter crushing of regionalist ambitions under the heel is the only way for Spain to retain this essence of spiritual and physical being.\n\n However, separatists alone are not the main foe of Hispanidad, for Albiñana believes that it is the Freemason and the Jew who seek to truly ruin the imperial legacy of Spain and betray her on the altar of modern decadence. Only through surgical precision of the iron surgeon’s scalpel can this festering wound within the skin of Spain be removed, and the Legionaries of Albiñana shall serve as their master’s precise instrument. For too long have the republican and syndicalist mongrels threatened the Eternal España, yet their final reckoning shall come, until not a single heretic, infidel or godless abomination shall walk the sacred lands of Santiago. With the Commune of Sin right across the Pyrenees hanging over our pious peninsula like the Sword of Damocles, there can be no rock to hide under for the enemies of the regime.\n\n While Albiñana supports further militarization of Spain and the expansion of its elite branches, he wishes to enhance the bite of the monarchy and ruling party by further reinforcing his Legionaries with volunteers from other parties and militias, as according to Albiñana, these men can go where the Guardia Civil or Spanish army would make too much noise and commotion. Loyal sons of Spain shall act as the first line of defence against deviation from the sacred duty towards the monarchy and Hispanic unity. These men can then later become career soldiers and officers with the experience gained from hunting the detritus of Spain’s population, further creating a symbiosis of PNE and the military."

sprd.252.d:0 "The inner politics of Partido Agrario have received a near total revision after the sudden uplift in their power upon becoming the legal government of Spain. While originally a party of landowners of both large and medium-sized estates, united in their support for the monarchy of Alfonso XIII and their dislike of the republican agrarian reform, it’s new role as the sentinel of Spanish politics has caused their membership to soar. This has mostly come at the cost of the large estate owners, as their ranks have diminished in the far larger party, and the number of smallholders now establishing themselves within the party is growing. As such, a sort of ideological divide has started to emerge within PAE, leading to clashes of opinion between the more aristocratic leadership and more populist middle and lower class smallholders. As new members join the party, more and more members of PAE are now calling for a genuine reform into the ownership and utilization of lands in Spain.\n\n The aristocrats who own many of Spain’s latifundios resist these changes tooth and nail, and in the event of a continued push for reform, may entrench their position as the top leaders of the party, ejecting the more firebrand reformists out and creating a party ruled by Spain’s rural oligarchs, caciquismo and aristocrats. These nobles possess plenty of capital to back their takeover of the party, but they lack popular support, and should their opponents be able to push their policies through, it possible these large landowners would bend to the will of the people, as long as the reforms are relatively mild. The reformists generally follow the ideas of Joaquin Costa, the father of Spain’s regenerationism and a known supporter of a more right-wing tendency of the American reformist ideologue, Henry George.\n\n Costa’s reforms would see the creation of more arable land for wider use, through town gardens, repeal of the disentailment laws and when possible, through leasing and renting land. This careful redistribution of land would help lift the burden on Spain’s poorest farmers, and while it would temporarily hurt the owners of latifundios, a large benefit would be that the new farmer class would be less susceptible to famines and economic downturns, and by proxy, to the promises of anarchists and agrarian socialists. Georgist tax reform would also see the elimination of certain labour taxes, perhaps not to the extent  The entire base of PAE, even excluding the large landholders, are not in agreement with these new ideas, and instead support the continuation of more generalized agrarian policies of slow, meticulous reform. However, this group is generally caught between the two rival factions and unless it is able to convince one of the other segments of PAE to back down, the ‘true’ agrarians hold no real chance of reinforcing the party line."

The military’s grip on the party is making the conservatives, led primarily by men such as Rafael Benjumea, anxious of the future, and they fear that eventually the party will be transformed into a mere puppet of the army and ambitious generals such as José Sanjurjo, Juan Yague and Emilio Mola.\n\n The conservatives have courted both Sanjurjo and the king, seeking support for their governmental platform, which would seek increased civilian oversight, transition to full Catholic corporatism, nationalist but not necessarily militarist programs and propaganda campaigns and expanded support of the church as the primary pillar of the regime instead of the military. This would leave the military matters to the men better suited for it, and allow civilians to transfer Spain to a time before the Sanjurjada coup, where the military was not so intertwined with the governance of the state.\n\n However, with the king’s opinion still dubious, Sanjurjo has instead supported a something of a merger of the conservative and militarist approaches, allowing Spain to return to a traditional Catholic governance but with a strong military man leading the nation towards this destiny, with a mix of civilian and military adjutants to rely on. Sanjurjo draws much of his ideas from the French bulwark of reaction, Philippe Petain and his ideology of Révolution Nationale. However, some within Sanjurjo’s inner circle support ditching the monarchist conservatives altogether and simply creating a populist personality cult around the general Caudillo, propped up by the military.

With Austria being the leading Catholic nation of Europe, the leader of AN, José Maria Gil-Robles has always been an avid admirer and supporter of Engelbert Dollfuss, the ideological father of Austropopulism. While the Austrophiles are generally less strong among the party than the near hegemonic Germanophiles, Gil-Robles’ role as the party’s near indisputed boss has made his ideological leanings have far more weight than the faction otherwise would have.\n\n The pro-German wing of AP on the other hand has increasingly called for Spain to adopt the Prussian constitutionalist system, allowing for a highly elitistic, limited democracy integrated into the existing organic democratic model of the party. This system would empower the monarch and his cabinet to a strong degree, allowing the king to check Cortes if need be. Similarly, given Prussia’s long martial tradition, the role of army is an important factor of Prussian constitutionalism, which would fit into the realities of Spain’s military-dominated society quite well, even if power is nominally at the hands of the Accion Popular."

According to Albiñana, the Spanish might stems from its social composition and inherited traits passed on by centuries of patriotic, pious men and women. However, lately due to the invention of harmful ideologies such as the separatist delusions of national self-determination for Spain’s linguistic minorities and of course, the snake in God’s garden of Earth, the devious syndicalists, have begun to impose a degeneration on this millenia-old Hispanic spirit. These socio-syndicalists seek to impose their view of a society not based on morality and tradition, but on some grand revolutionary ideas, ideas that have turned such world powers such as Britain and France into hideous nests of degenerates in the span of mere decades. Albiñana, and the brave men of Partido Nacionalista, have sought to prevent this from ever happening, and harsh measures will be taken to ensure that a similar scenario never comes to pass in the sacred soil of España. Orphans from recent battles against syndicalism and separatism will see themselves placed into new pious families, where religious ideals and patriotic fervour will act as a balm to turn them away from the godlessness of their biological parents. Those that can yet be redeemed, will be placed into programs of conversion to allow them to denounce their wicked past, and those that cannot, shall face exile or death. The Hispanic man is God’s greatest creation, and Dr. Albiñana, a man of science and faith, cannot allow any attempts to spoil this perfection. The separatists shall be dealt with through fusion of the best qualities of the Hispanic race, and hopefully, with the passing of time, these hybrid structures can be peeled away to give way to wholly Hispanized regions, free of nationalist lunacy. Meanwhile, great lengths will be taken by Hispanist eugenicists such as Misael Bañuelos to ensure that the development of research into the unique components of Spanish Raza are better understood and cultivated, until one day we can eliminate all harmful aspects still lingering from the syndicalist and separatist rot."

Multiple papers, such as ABC and Accion Espanola, have begun to question whether the finances of the liberal conservative hegemon of current Spanish politics, Count of Romanones, are completely legal. Some independent journalists have even claimed that the Count is looking to install a country-wide net of caciques, mobsters, corrupt businessmen and other unscrupulous individuals, who would help keep his rule of grift aloft for decades to come, while leaving the Count completely guilt-free in the eyes of the king. These lies are absolutely false, officially of course, but they are painting our regime in a bad light and thus must be dealt with. The Count’s supporters have recommended that the party seeks more avenues of concrete reform to ensure that the more extrajudicial matters of governance are not monitored as heavily, though the direction of these reforms remains unknown.\n\n Partido Fusionista could attempt to move the direction of the party into an even more economically liberal direction, while retaining the more socially conservative elements to appease the more right-wing parties of Spain. Alternatively, Romanones could attempt to flirt with the working class support by suggesting more pro-worker legislation, similar to his earlier career successes such as the eight-hour work day and expansion of teacher’s wages and rights. Some, however, suggest that we instead simply shut these nosy journalists up, either with a generous donation to allow them to pursue more interesting avenues of reporter work, such as the amazing reforms Partido Fusionista is pursuing, or finding a cozy new accommodation for them in Rio de Oro.

The party, noted for its pacifism, a rare trait in Spain of today so heavily dominated by the military and bloodthirsty paramilitaries, has long sought diplomatic approaches to various issues, and above all, it has held diplomatic dialogue as a source of political strength when dealing with other nations.\n\n This has now manifested in the recent suggestion for a new program, as the PAE seeks to expand citizenship of Spain outside its borders, to the people of Latin America, given the recent creation of a military alliance with them. This rather unorthodox idea stems not only from Pan-Hispanist fervour, but also from the reality that Spain and its former colonies are each others strongest allies in these dire times, and thus cultural and national barriers must be secondary to the unity of the alliance. This program would obviously boost immigration to the Spanish mainland, but as many have pointed out, it is debatable whether the Spanish economy could survive such a surge in immigration, especially given the limited resources of our nation.\n\n Yet as the Americans have proven, there is great strength in a strong influx of immigrants, and perhaps it could alleviate the troubles Spain has had with its minority regions of Catalonia, Basque Country and Galicia, where the immigrants would become a class of citizen in their own right, keeping the fire of separatist movements shackled. The program would also seek the creation of an economic union between the participant nations, and many Spaniards hope that the nations of the New World would expand their citizenship to their European Hispanic counterparts as well."

Alongside these political criticism, many have pointed out the king’s lack of moral integrity, and while Alfonso’s unfaithfulness to his wife Victoria Eugenie, especially with his mistress Carmen Ruiz Moragas, was a public secret, other secrets have come to light as well.\n\n During the street battles of the recent crisis, a group of Catalan separatists broke into the premises of a film studio known as Royal Films, owned by Ramón and Ricardo de Baños. Normally, such infractions would have been lost to the annals of time as Spain was gripped by a crisis of immense magnitude, but these troublemakers managed to snatch three film reels from the studio, and upon closer inspection at a local theatre, found them to be adult movies, filmed for the king Alfonso and commissioned by Count of Romanones himself. The Catalans managed to send these films to the local press organ of Estat Catala, which launched a public smearing campaign of the king. Chalked up as propaganda by the regime after the war, it has nonetheless called the moral failings of Alfonso into question once more, and by proxy, his accomplice Count of Romanones, the current de facto ruler of Spain.\n\n The studio had produced over seventy movies for Alfonso, who had among the largest pornographic collections in the world, and now this situation is on the verge of becoming headline news all over Spain, should more of these reels leak to the public.

The Mexican revolution and its consequences had left the nation broken, with thousands dead, settlements burned to the ground or abandoned by their inhabitants and the resulting lack of identity being filled with indigenous or Indianist nonsense in the view of Albiñana. To him, the Mexican hatred for all things Spanish and their hell-bent desire to fuse their people with the local natives would only lead to the loss of their most unique trait, the Hispanic legacy of the nation’s founders.\n\n Albiñana, who had started to develop his ideas of just what this Hispanic excellence composed of, became further radicalized by what he saw in Mexico, and it would lead to his hatred for all things republican and socialist even after his return to Spain. While PNE under Albiñana’s leadership has now purified Spain of these malignant tumors within the Hispanic psyche, Mexico still languishes under the iron fist of these delusional anti-Hispanists. The light of Catholicism has grown dim in the nation, with fanatics from the left and right alike seeking to destroy the influence of the Saints in the nation. \n\n Not only that, they gleefully attack anything considered even tangentially related to Spanish, seeking to eradicate the glorious legacy of Hernán Cortés and his conquistadors, who brought the Hispanic spirit to these lost lands. With the conquest of Spain complete and Albiñana’s tenure as the iron surgeon of the nation finally finalized, he now looks towards other glories, and with compassion, seeks to return to Mexico to perform the same surgical operation there as well. However, members of his inner circle, especially Manuel Delgado, see these plans as a waste of resources that could be used to improve the situation of Spain here.

Herrera was one of the central members of an organization that would come to define much of Spain’s Catholic right, the Asociación Católica de Propagandistas founded by jesuit Ángel Ayala at the start of the century, and Gil-Robles was among the most prominent monarchists among the organization even before the arrival of Accion Popular. ACdP is primarily aimed at promoting Catholicism at every level of society, and combating the pervasive elements of French-style secularism on Spanish society. It seeks to create a group of powerful and populist Catholic actors, be they political or ecclesiastical, who can mobilize Christian forces towards the goal of promoting social Catholicism.\n\n While the group was hardly uniform in ideology, with some coming from Carlism, such as Víctor Pradera, or from Basque nationalism, such as José Antonio Aguirre and yet others coming from Alfonsine monarchism or Christian democracy, such as Gil-Robles and Herrera themselves, the overall goals of the group were relatively uniform and political affiliations rarely played a part in the general ideals of the group, at least not in a negative sense. As Accion Popular now controls Spain, Herrera, who still follows the party’s trajectory mostly without intervention, has proposed full incorporation, or at least a partial collaboration, with the group, given that AP is the primary political actor of Spain now.\n\n The strength of ACdP would come not only from the leadership training its members can provide, but also from the plethora of sub-functions the party has, such as the newspaper El Debate, the student group Centro de Estudios Universitarios, the Logos publishing house and the agrarian reform group Círculo de Estudios Agrarios. However, the question remains whether the party should formally integrate ACdP, something that is likely to not cause too many protests given how the organization was moulded by AP members, or to keep the two entities separated but tightly linked in co-operation. Gil-Robles supports integration, but Fernando Martín-Sánchez Juliá, the current president of ACdP has been hesitant, citing that he prefers to keep the non-political nature of the organization to allow it to be a non-partisan actor for the furtherment of Catholic causes."

Firstly, the anarchist and socialist unions have been quite effective as siphoning members off Catholic unions, claiming that Catholic unions cannot achieve true workers’ organization and seek to merely empower the employer classes. Secondly, the various Catholic factions of Spain have never been able to truly unite the different unions, with the Carlists having their own Sindicatos Libres, the Basques with their Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna and the Alfonsists with a variety of national and federal level unions, such as Confederación Nacional Católico Agraria, the largest Catholic agrarian union in Spain.\n\n Now that Accion Popular holds absolute power, things can be different. With the help of the existing loyal unions, and those from the rebellious unions who have since seen reason, a new program has been initiated by the Ministry of Labour to see a merging of industrial unions into a singular confederation, similar to the CNCA, under the new name of Confederación Española de Sindicatos Obreros. This would allow the workers of Spain a means to ensure that they are not exploited but instead receive their fair share, but it also has the benefit of keeping the syndicalists out of workplaces. To make sure that the workers have capable unionist leaders, the brainchild of Ángel Herrera, Instituto Social Obrero, shall be put to use training the new leadership of CESO. ISO is primarily an sub-division of Asociación Católica de Propagandistas, but unlike ACdP, which seeks to train laymen in the expansion of Catholicism, ISO will train pious workers into true Christian leaders capable of teaching social Catholicism and corporatism to the masses of Spain’s proletariat.\n\n After all, as Herrera put it, ‘There can be no man of action without being a man of prayer. He who wishes to bear fruit through his action must be a man of great interior life’. As such, there can be no true worker organization without Christian ideals. However, other members of the Labour Ministry have suggested that we go beyond just the establishment of CESO, and create the Federación Española de Trabajadores, a massive union incorporating both CESO and CNCA. This is prone to overburdened bureaucracy and over-centralization without proper care put into the organization of it, but FET would likely be an even faster and stronger way to truly create a country-wide Catholic unionist movement, bringing the false shepherds of Spain’s left back to the light."

Upon seeing Spain triumph against its many enemies, Ledesma publicly renounced his past as the leader of Spain’s national syndicalists, and called for a new, truly nationalist and right-wing syndicalism to take over instead. He even went as far as to call for the rebranding of ‘national syndicalism’, saying that Mussolini, Mosley and Valois alongside their goons had perverted the true sense of class unity his original vision sought, replacing it with proletariat dominance.\n\n Upon hearing of the unification of all Spain’s Catholic unions into Federación Española de Trabajadores, he came out of hiding to appeal to the government that his organization would be allowed to join it. Many saw this as complete nonsense, as Ledesma’s organization had been part of the left-wing forces terrorizing Spain for ages, but many more saw an opportunity. A former left-wing demagogue publicly announcing his support for Catholic unionism, especially with his atheism being well-known to the public, would be a massive gain to the new unions recruitment.

sprd.264.d:0 "The small combat organization and nominal party, Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica or JCAH, under Onésimo Redondo, known by the moniker Caudillo of Castile, has long been a strong component in the combined struggle of Spanish right to quell the tide of syndicalist resistance, but the true loyalties of Redondo have always been somewhat shaky. The man claims no allegiance to the crown of Spain, and some, such as José Calvo Sotelo and Antonio Goicoechea, have even accused him of being a republican, though calling him a liberal one similar to the effeminate men in Izquierda Republicana and Partido Radical would likely earn one the full wrath of JCAH. Nonetheless, the party is a disputed one among Spain’s right, and many view it with suspicion, but one cannot deny that JCAH shares the very same Hispanist values of Acción Española.\n\n Thus, in a meeting earlier today, important members of Acción Española and JCAH met in Madrid to discuss a possible merging of the two parties into one. Redondo demanded further and heavier actions against what he called conspiratorial forces, primarily Jews, due to his deep-seated hatred for this religious group. His organization, and especially its militant wing, who participate in the infamous dawn patrols meant to hunt syndicalists, Freemasons and other enemies of state alike, would be incorporated as the primary paramilitary arm of Acción Española, as the party does not possess a proper militant arm as of now. In exchange for a place within the party, Redondo is merely expected to rescind his previous accidentalist stances and fully commit to monarchism, which he has agreed to do. It seems that one by one, the parties of Spain will be consolidated under one wing and purpose."

sprd.265.d:0 "The influence of Antonio Maura, the behemoth of Spanish Restoration era conservative politics, on José Calvo Sotelo, Spain’s new prime minister, cannot be understated. While Calvo Sotelo has since progressed towards new ideological directions, such as Maurrasisme, he started his political career as a firm follower of Maura, and his party Renovación Española, has long been divided into the more Maurist conservative wing of Antonio Goicoechea and the more totalitarian wing of Calvo Sotelo. However, despite the large number of Maurists within the party, the sons of Antonio Maura, especially Gabriel Maura Gamazo and Miguel Maura, have mostly remained aloof to it, siding more with the liberal conservative, and even at times, the republican tendencies of their father.\n\n However, thankfully the legacy of their father is not truly tarnished, for a rising star with RE is seeking to revive their father’s legacy fully and redeem Maurism as a new part of the ideology of Calvo Sotelo. Honorio Maura, the third of Antonio’s sons, has denounced the liberal tendencies of his brothers and fully committed to Spanish Maurrasisme, calling for a truly national, authentic revolution that will save Spain from liberals and syndicalists alike. The strife of last half a decade has taken its toll on the man, and while he was originally less hard on republicanism, he has lost any patience for such systems. A strong personal friend of Alfonso XIII, he has served as an important councillor to young Jaime, and he has been instrumental in diplomatic ties to the Austria-Hungarian empire thanks to his bank Banco Hispano-Austro Húngaro operating there. Outside of his party role, Maura has been an important member of the new regime’s propaganda, since his large passion has always been the creation and directing of plays.\n\n Known for his comedy theatre plays, he often depicts aristocratic and bourgeois settings through ironic, at times frivolous yet equally glamorizing portraits, simultaneously provoking the decadent nobility of Spain for their inability to keep up with the times, while also showing them in a highly idealized and propagandized tone. His greatest works have been a play depicting the fall of the monarchy in Spain, as well as a play turned into a proper film by Paramount, Susana tiene un secreto, which has been one of the first Spanish blockbusters. Some within the regime have supported Maura in seeking help from CIFESA to produce more domestic classics, yet it remains to be seen whether he takes up the offer. Nonetheless, it would appear that the despite the triumph of Calvo Sotelo and the decline of the Maurist wing within RE, a new form of Maurism is very much alive and well."

sprd.266.d:0 "The grip of José Calvo Sotelo upon Spain is starting to become unbreakable, and the ideas of Maurrasisme have been put into action, leading to a rather heavy decentralization of the regime, the implementation of true organicism and the expansion of the RE’s own combat squads, the Green Berets, who have seen an increased adoption of similar tactics and uniformity as their French Camelots du Roi counter-parts. However, everything has not gone as smoothly as many within RE may have hoped, and the introduction of localist policies within the minority regions of Spain have been a headache as many Castilians view the population of these regions with immense suspicion.\n\n Some have also criticized RE for being too aristocratic in nature and detached from the people, ruling with the Green Berets and lofty ideals but not much love for the true common people. A minority within Renovación Española have thus turned to support the ideas of Leon Degrelle, a famed Walloonian radical right-wing activist and fiery defender of Catholicism, to act as an inspiration for the new party, as his ideas are similar to those of Charles Maurras, but less defined and not as steeped in the positivism of Maurras, something that made the French ideologue less attractive as an inspiration to members of Renovación Española.\n\n They view Degrelle’s fiery populism as a great example for what RE should stand for if it truly wishes to win the hearts of Spaniards, as while Calvo Sotelo is known for being a charismatic and talented orator, his appearances before the masses have been relatively limited. Calvo Sotelo and his allies have pointed out that the difference between this Rexist thoughtform and that of Maurras is not massive, but the party is increasingly less opposed to the change in direction, simply for the sake of change."

As such, the government, previously relatively hesitant to react to the crisis due to the very controversial nature of it, has been forced into action after constant demands by Instituto de Reforma Agraria. IRA, despite its small size and low level of influence, has been bolstered as one of the last remaining bastions of republican intellectualism, given it was heavily staffed by republicans before Sanjurjada and still retains a degree of those individuals in its ranks.\n\n While the agrarian reform will be a difficult task to guide into final stages, and many controversial and difficult tasks must be undertaken to finally see Spain leave behind its primitive and inefficient form of rural organization, it is of utmost importance to the new government, and as such the second phase of reforms has been initiated in a highly rushed manner.

sprd.268.d:0 "The rule of Accion Popular right now is nigh absolute over Spain, but recently, a memory from the party’s past has been resurrected. Originally, when Ángel Herrera Oria created the party to be an extension of his interpretation for the mission of Asociación Católica de Propagandistas, the party was not known as Accion Popular but by the title Acción Nacional. This change was forced upon the party by the republicans, who banned the use of the word Nacional for political purposes and allowed it to only be used in reference to state administration and other official Spanish government purposes.\n\n After the coup of 1932, there was quite a bit of confusion in relation to whether general Sanjurjo would reinstate some form of republicanism, and only after Accion Popular was installed as the ruling party under the returned king Alfonso was this confusion answered, but by then the name of the party had mostly solidified, so in an effort to create a facade of a return towards democracy eventually, the party name was kept as Accion Popular. However, now that AP rules as the hegemon of Spain’s right, the republicans are all either assimilated under its rule or driven outside of politics and the socialists are dead or in exile, there is no reason to keep up appearances, and thus many have proposed the return of the Acción Nacional name. While not a massive change in any case, there is some division within the party in relation to this, with many so accustomed to the current name that they see no need to change it."

sprd.269.d:0 "After Partido Agrario’s rise to power and the earning of king’s favour, the party has had a hard time restructuring itself to fully fit this task. Perhaps the strongest weakness of the party remains the same as always, its crippling inability to attract mass following due to its rather elitist nature, the prominence of agrarian syndicalism and socialism in peasant politics and the rivals the party has in unions and organizations of other parties, such as the Confederación Nacional Católico-Agraria heavily controlled by Accion Popular. PAE suffers equally from possessing no union of its own, as it has never expanded into more peasant-level politics or Catholic unionism, relying solely on its supporter-base in large and medium landowners. \n\nHowever, now that the party has the king’s favour and is, at least for the time being, fully in control with its rival parties struggling to cope with their defeat, the party could attempt to rectify this issue fully. Most popular option within the party, especially among its elite, would be to absorb CNCA, as its leader, Ricardo Cortes Villasana, leads his own minor party alongside Juan Diaz Caneja called the Unión Castellana Agraria. If PAE were to propose the integration of UCA into its own party, it is likely that UCA would approve this. However, they are known to be among the few existing Castilian regionalists, and it’s highly likely that the party would demand autonomy for Castile in the event of integration. There are, thankfully, other options. While not an union per se, the employer organization Agrupación de Propietarios de Fincas Rústicas de España holds considerably sway over Spain’s agrarian matters, wields enormous monetary and material resources and is of a general conservative ideology when it comes to agrarian matters, and many members of PAE are also members of APFRE. However, this does not necessarily solve our issues with getting actual popular support, but it would increase the resources with which PAE can pursue this cause, and additionally, would allow us to get into the good graces of the remaining large landowners that are not involved with our party yet.\n\n However, the rival of APFRE may be an even more lucrative option. The nearly six decade old organization, Asociación de Agricultores de España, has long clashed with APFRE over agrarian reformism, as AAE is more clearly reformist rather than pro-status quo. AAE is more of an organization for smaller local organizations, possessing both unions, agrarian credit groups and co-operatives all over Spain, and should we be able to integrate it, it would significantly boost our popularity. However, the spread-out and decentralized nature of AAE does make it somewhat hard to fully control, and it’s likely that some of these smaller organizations would break off and become independent entities upon learning of this integration. Nonetheless, out of the options present, AAE may very well be the one with least amount of compromising needed to achieve an integration with."

Much of this criticism has been leveled at the prime minister’s relationship with his sister, as Maria de Maetzu has been allowed to continue her operations within the feminist clubs Residencia de Señoritas and Lyceum Club Femenino.\n\n Known for being far more liberal than her brother, Maria is one of the key feminists of Spain and her clubs have seen other prominent women politicians and intellectuals of the era, such as the Radical-Socialist demagogue Victoria Kent, the feminist artist Concha Méndez and the poet Zenovia Camprubí. Maria, who is known nation-wide as a strong proponent of education, and the premise of LCF and RdS is to provide women greater access to higher education, as well as facilitate the transition of women to workforce by creating daycare centres and other aides to daily life. This development was, even at the beginning of their activity in the 1920s, furiously attacked by the conservative sectors of Spain, with many claiming that this would only lead to the fracturing of traditional society and family structure.\n\n The Catholic church especially attacked the organization, and some priest went as far as to call for the women to be locked away to avoid the spreading of such dangerous ideas. However, now that Spain is utterly dominated by the right-wing conservative forces, these calls have grown even louder, and many view the prime minister’s disinterest as either a sign of weakness or even quiet approval of his sister’s measures. Some have even claimed that Ramiro de Maetzu’s past as a more progressive and even pro-syndicalist intellectual during the Weltkrieg may have resurfaced. This has caused something of a scandal within the party, and calls for a reaction to the matter grow more demanding by the day."

sprd.271.t:0 "Sanjurjo’s Proclamation"
sprd.271.d:0 "Among the Spain’s monarchist officers, general José Sanjurjo stands out for multiple reasons. Whereas most of the military minds coalescing around monarchist ideas tend to subscribe to either Alfonsist or Carlist traditionalism, neoconservative Hispanism or Catholic corporatism, Sanjurjo has remained relatively apolitical throughout his career and supported monarchism mostly out of family tradition, his father having been a Carlist. He was one of the rare Spanish army officers in the high command who did not lament the fall of Primo de Rivera and the proclamation of the republic, despite his personal friendship with the former dictator, and Sanjurjo, as a commander of Guardia Civil, did not provide his support to the dictatorship’s mellowed successor when the republicans won the municipal elections and the idea of a suppression of these results was floated around the upper echelons of Spanish society.\n\n However, when Sanjurjo couped the government in 1932, it was clearly born out dislike for the chaos the new regime had wrought, and despite the restoration of the monarchy under him, Sanjurjo did initially seem to agree to a democratic restoration under a constitutional monarchy. However, the general was not interested in serving as a second Primo de Rivera, and he delegated power to Accion Popular, who in turn eschewed the return to democracy in favour of their own idea of a corporatist Spain, something the general did not seem to object publicly. Nonetheless, it would seem that Sanjurjo, now grown tired of the AP’s floundering regime, has returned to his original ideas, as the general has promised that a return to constitutionalism and parliamentarism may be in the horizon. No deadline is given for this transition, but apparently the king has agreed upon this.\n\n However, many experts assume that the authoritarian regime is only dropped after the war clouds dispel over Europe and the anarchist groups running around Spain are decimated. Many within Unión Monárquica Nacional have protested Sanjurjo’s ideas, claiming that democracy was the reason for Spain’s downfall, but the general’s status as the war hero of Rif war and the preserver of the monarchy makes his authority nigh absolute within Spain. Those republicans who have remained in Spain despite the recent events are sceptical, though some have noted that it was Accion Popular, not the general himself, who betrayed the 1936 promises of a return to democratic rule. Still, many view this as mostly a signal of slight thawing in the regime, not a promise the Caudillo of Spain is likely to keep."

sprd.272.d:0 "When the kingdom continued its policy of authoritarianism without democratic representation, many Spanish liberals and republicans returned quickly into exile as the situation deteriorated for them, with some being captured for organizing protests or even taking part in the violent times that followed. However, among the most prominent members of the Spanish republicans to stay in Spain was Alejandro Lerroux, the caudillo of Partido Radical Republicano and the boss of Catalonia. This was not merely through his personal perseverance and interest in staying in Spain, for his friendship with general Sanjurjo, forged already in 1905 while the two men were frequenting the same nightlife events while living in Madrid and Barcelona. Lerroux is believed to have been one of the few Spanish republicans to be aware of the upcoming Sanjurjada coup through this connection, and initially it seemed that Sanjurjo may have planned to include him in the civilian government after stepping down, but the leadership of Accion Popular made it clear that they would not collaborate with a known anti-clerical such as Lerroux. \n\nHowever, the general and Lerroux seem to have remained relatively close, and during the period of unrest following the return to authoritarian rule, it was even suggested that one of the reasons Catalan anarchists did not manage to create a more effective network to resist the new government was thanks to the efforts of Lerroux and his political machine, destroying the anarchist rebellion from inside the infamous street of Paralelo where these terrorists frequented entertainment venues controlled by Lerroux and his informants. Whether this is true or not is shrouded in doubt, but for the time being, Lerroux and his goons in Catalonia remain the one bastion of true republicanism within Spain, protected not only through their extensive network of allies, vassals and informants, but also because of the good graces of the general leading Spain."

As such, issues have begun to arise where the high command of this arm of national defence is not available even during crucial decisions, and this has significantly impacted the force’s effectiveness. Due to his new role as the Caudillo of Spain, many have suggested that Sanjurjo steps down from his post as the head of Guardia Civil and installs a new leader for the group. Most likely successor is considered to be general Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer, capable leader of the Carabineros and a hero of the Rif War, though other options are also available as Cabanellas is known to hold republican sympathies and often associates with liberal and moderate conservative groups opposed to our current regime. Another option would be the long-serving general of Guardia Civil,  Federico Santiago Iglesias, who despite his advanced age could be placed at the head of the organization due to his experience and connections. Another alternative is also, coincidentally, another Sanjurjo, José Sanjurjo y Rodríguez de Arias. Having served in the Guardia Civil for quite some time, he is known for being apolitical and efficient leader of the organization, serving both the republic and the monarchy faithfully for decades"

Sanjurjo, burdened by years of steering Spain away from chaos, has announced that he will step down, and the ruling party is expected to drop out of elections due to a lack of interest in democratic processes. Those within UMN who support the return of democracy have largely gone to join the new parties stepping in to fill the void.\n\n Leading the left-most wing of the new electoral system is the behemoth of republicanism left in Spain, Alejandro Lerroux, and his Partido Radical. Known for anti-Catalanism, highly populist rhetoric and moderate liberal politics mixed in with Lerroux’s own political machine infamous for its excessive corruption, PR has become the leading liberal party in new Spain, allowed to exist solely because of Lerroux’s strength as a balancing factor in Catalonia and his warm relations with former dictator Sanjurjo. Representing a more monarchist liberal approach is Partido Provincial Agrario, first formed during Republican years and now re-emerging as a splinter of the defunct Partido Agrario Español. Tired of the dictatorship, its leader José María Cid Ruiz-Zorrilla managed to convince PAE’s leader José Martínez de Velasco to unite the remaining agrarians under one banner, and now they seek an agrarian, socially conservative yet economically liberal Kingdom.\n\n They are opposed by the party of caciques, Partido Liberal-Fusionista, ruled by the venerable oligarch Count of Romanones, with the party mixing a degree of liberal ideas with a near-invincible political machine stretching all across Spain, intended to keep their opponents out of politics in any way possible. Finally, the old king Alfonso’s favourites in Accion Popular, humbled by years under Sanjurjo’s rule, have returned to contest their opponents in elections, seeking to bring Christian democracy to Spain with an iron fist. Finally, the unexpected arrival of Partido Laborista, under Eduard Aunós Perez, claims to bring peace to Spain through a program of corporatist principles mixed with a society restructured along professions and guilds similar to those seen during medieval times, all within a singular Catholic vision, having convinced many within UMN to join their ranks."

While terrorist violence has been truly rooted out from our midst, the protests continue, and the government cannot simply crush them under heel without fears of further radicalization and the creation of martyrs for the anti-establishment forces.\n\nThe moderates within Accion Popular, led by Luis Lucia Lucia and Manuel Giménez Fernandez, have called for a return to democratic form of governance under a constitutional monarchy with a large degree of political power to placate the far-right parties. These dissidents within the largest opposition party have gathered support from the only real remaining republican force in Spain, the radicals of Alejandro Lerroux, who have increased pressure on Sanjurjo’s government as well.

However, Eduardo Aunós, one of the key ideologues of the new Unión Monárquica Nacional, has proposed a way to at least party address the issue, which he calls Leridanismo, named after his home town of Lleida. Lleida, a city in Catalonia, has always been an unique part of the region between Catalonia and Aragon, adopting an identity fully of its own from those of the two, much larger and distinct regions. The local groups sympathetic to UMN’s cause have formed Caliu Ilerdenc, a cultural club discussing gastronomy, local folklore and literature.\n\n The club boasts prominent members from all across the Catalan right-wing social sphere, such as Víctor Hellín Sol and Ramon Anery, uniting elitists of Pena Blanca with the conservative Catalans of Lliga Regionalista. In their view, Lleida is superior to the Catalan culture and a micro-culture in itself, promoting some elements of Catalan society and mixing them with unique Lleida customs in a way that does not lead to the separatist tendencies of the more Catalan supremacist movements. It is paired with the Institut d'Estudis Ilerdencs, an academic organization aimed at preserving and teaching the history of Lleida and developing its cultural peculiarities separate from the developments in Catalonia.\n\n Many may view Leridanismo as simply a small regional peculiarity, but given that all regions of Spain have some degree of sympathizers to the Madrid regime, and should these similar sub-regional organizations be promoted further, it could help break the hold of nationalist parties such as Partido Nacionalista Vasca, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya and Partido Galeguista, as these elite clubs would be the only real way to influence developments in the region. If every region develops its own version of Lleida, it’ll fragment the nationalist movements into smaller, isolationist groups of very local forums, too weak to truly resist the Madrid government. This alone will not save Spain from the nationalist hounds, but it will possibly help the matter slightly "

Without the king’s favour, his movement would likely have ended up in the dustbin of history as the greatest contribution PNE has given to the struggle of reaction in Spain has been through its paramilitary Legionaries. However, now that Albiñana has become the leader of Spain alongside young king Jaime, many former rivals and opponents of this beacon of reaction have crawled back to him, words dripping with honey as they attempt to negotiate better positions for themselves. The conservative landholders of Partido Agrario have been integrated into the fold of PNE, having long served as allies to Albiñana given their similar support for the defense of Spain’s eternal institutions, love for the rural countryside and of course, the shared backing of large landholders.\n\n However, despite the tiny size of PNE, there have been a degree of factionalism within the party, as the Legionarist wing of the party is split between those who support the more radical direction of the party’s other founder Manuel Delgado Barreto, and those who support the more traditionalist direction of Albiñana. These divisions are mostly simply differences of opinion, but they could lead to further diversions in the party’s direction should either side convince the other. The more pressing matters are the party’s possibilities of integrating other monarchist forces in Spain.\n\n Albiñana and Delgado have ruled out the integration of Accion Popular into the ranks, as there is quite a bit of bad blood between the two parties, with PNE seeing AP as little more than a group of soft bourgeois legalists and accidentalist opportunists, while AP sees Albiñana and his goons as dangerous loose cannons best ignored. Similarly, Albiñana’s populist approach clashes with the elitism and aristocracy of Renovación Española, who they view as inefficient nobles too snobby to get their hands dirty in the real world politics of PNE. However, Albiñana has been somewhat open to working with the Maurists of RE, viewing them as more pure in monarchism than most of RE, and he is also known for supporting an unification with the Carlists due to shared ideological roots.

In many ways, Delgado has always been the firebrand of the movement, as his key goal has for decades been to mobilize a violent and strong force against syndicalists, in similar vein to the Legionaries of PNE. Heavily inspired by the Italian Arditi and the post-Weltkrieg organization of Associazione Nazionalista Italiana, Delgado dreamed of creating Legion Nacional, reinforced by Maurists, members of the defunct citizen militia Unión Ciudadana and the veterans of the Rif War, who would overpower the anarchists through sheer devotion and skill. \n\nDelgado’s newspaper La Nación has long been a promoter of Italian-style Legionarism in Spain, viewing local strains of Legionarism, even the one created by his allies in PNE, as inherently too simplistic and unambitious, too heavily tied to the local traditions and especially too close to Carlism. However, Delgado has so far been unable to gather much support to his ideas, but depending the party trajectory of PNE, his ideas could win favour among the ever-restless Legionaries of Albiñana, who fear that with the ascension of their leader to the leadership of entire Spain, the movement will forget its roots and dwindle down to become yet another establishment party.

Whereas Calvo Sotelo fell in with the French monarchist theorist Charles Maurras, and started supporting his ideology over perfectly good and viable Spanish traditionalist ideas, Goicoechea retained the traditionalist outlook of the most right-flank of Antonio Maura’s successors. With his support dwindling by the day, and the party he helped found diverting further and further from the ideals of Maura into something completely unrecognizable, Goicoechea has decided to jump ship and join Partido Nacionalista, hoping that the new rulers of Spain to be open to his ideologies more than Calvo Sotelo.\n\n Much to his surprise, PNE’s leadership had already discussed opening a rift within RE by exploiting the disgruntled Maurists, and while the number of defectors from Calvo Sotelo’s organization was by no means large, it was nonetheless enough to cause a crisis of identity within RE, pending much larger reform of the movement. With perhaps the most prominent Maurist left in Spain now supporting PNE, it’s possible that others from Acción Española and Acción Popular will follow suit, leaving their dying parties to join the only organization with the will and virility to truly regenerate the ailing kingdom. Given king Jaime’s inherent bias towards traditionalism, his wholesale support of the PNE’s expansion has weighed heavily in the favour of these defections, and it will make continued resistance of other parties towards PNE much harder to organize."

However, the arrival of Manuel Delgado Barreto to the scene has caused a degree of unrest within the crowd, as the ideas of Delgado are quite a bit more radical than those of the Maurists and Carlists.\n\n Each faction within the new PNE seeks to sway the party leader towards their perceived future, but it is not a given that Albiñana would simply consolidate power around his own clique of Legionaries and ignore the calls for change from the other factions. The Maurists have proposed a traditionalist, protectionist and somewhat urban elitist model, ensuring support from many of Spain’s nobles and industrialists. The Carlists support mobilizing the peasantry and loyal minority regions such as Navarra, Aragon and Andalusia to our cause, decentralizing the regime to a great extent to ensure that the rights of local people are not crushed under the heel of a tyrannical Madrid overlord.\n\n This would be a change from the traditional stance of PNE, which has always defended the political unity of the Fatherland, but with Spain’s treacherous separatists mostly crushed and anarchists weakened considerably, the new regime can probably loosen this particular tenet of their ideology and turn towards a more Carlist-view on autonomous governance. Finally, the smallest faction by far being Delgado’s legionaries, has promised to fully transform Spain into a highly militarized, ultranationalist state, that will hound all enemies of the monarchist order to the ends of the Earth and promote a corporate state eliminating class conflict completely. Supported mainly by the Spanish Foreign Legion, hardliners such as Onésimo Redondo and Juan de Ansaldo and Hispanist such as Ramiro de Maetzu, their ability to mobilize veterans of the Rif Wars could prove useful in coming conflicts with our internal and external enemies. In the end, the decision lays on Albiñana himself"

Representing far-right mixture of non-Carlist traditionalists, legionaries, former Maurists and some militant agrarians, the party is kept together under the watchful eye of Dr. José María Albiñana, an eccentric figure whose Legionaries of Spain have been known to rough up political opponents, republicans and socialists alike. Hardly anyone saw these ruffians attempting to move to parliamentary politics, but Albiñana has announced his bid to run in the upcoming elections on a platform of bringing back a sense of pride to Spain and putting to sword those who would slander the great nation. Focusing mainly on rural farmers and Catholic workers, PNE seeks to offer an alternative to the radical anti-democratic monarchists of Renovacion Espanola and the more moderate king’s favourites in Accion Popular. Few in Spain expect PNE to be able to moderate its course, and even fewer expect them to win in the elections, but the political landscape of Spain has certainly shifted into an interesting direction."

sprd.285.d:0 "One of the most peculiar, and prestigious, vessels in the Spanish navy is the aircraft, airship and autogyro carrier Dédalo. Originally a German merchant vessel Neuenfels, it was given to Spain as compensation for the numerous Spanish vessels sunk by German U-Boats during the Weltkrieg, and while it was originally thought to simply retain the role of a merchant vessel, the Aeronáutica Naval, a new branch of the Spanish navy, had other ideas. Dédalo was converted to its new role as a carrier in the Talleres Nuevo Vulcano naval yard in Barcelona, and Wenceslao Benítez Inglott became the captain of the vessel thereafter. The carrier would first see action in the landing at Alhucemas, where its Italian-made AP balloons and SCA dirigibles provided reconnaissance, and the complement of different naval aircrafts, most notably Felixstowe F.3, Macchi M.18 and Supermarine Scarab flying boats. It was not a true carrier in the sense that the planes would take off from its deck, but instead a crane would lower these flying boats to the water and they would take off from there.\n\n The ship could carry twelve folded aircrafts on its deck, and twenty stowed to a hangar below deck, though combat operation strength varied greatly, especially after British and Italian parts became harder to source and aircraft were cannibalized for parts. After autogyros, such as the creations of Juan de Cierva, became more and more popular in Spain, Cierva was offered a possibility to attempt a landing on Dédalo, something the aviator easily achieved, and there has been plans to convert the aging warship to a full autogyro carrier to provide aerial spotting and light combat support, though as helicopters are becoming more common as well, such as the possible upcoming Cierva War Horse, some hope that Dédalo will extend its life as a helicopter carrier, continuing its streak of naval and aviation firsts. However, the sad truth of the matter is that the days of Dédalo are slowly coming to a close, and a scrapping may await this veteran of the seas unless comprehensive refurbishing is undertaken."

sprd.286.d:0 "The Rif War and especially the Disaster at Annual, where thousands of badly-trained, equipped and led metropolitan troops were slaughtered en masse by the Rif rebels of Abd el Krim, are a dark stain upon the military honour of Spain. And yet, elements of that war would go on to live in annals of history as great successes and pioneering events, and perhaps no other battle is as deserving of being lauded as an amazing success of said conflict than the landing at Alhucemas. Alhucemas was the home of Kabilas, Abd el Krim’s home tribe, and it had been an unruly region for decades, with first plans for a landing dating back more than a decade ago. Spanish forces had tried to march into Alhucemas by land, but the difficulty of maintaining supply in the difficult terrain of the Rif made such attacks into utter failures. After general Primo de Rivera came to power through a coup, he sought to cut the head of Rifian resistance by crushing Kabila tribe through a decisive landing, and after Abd el Krim foolishly picked a fight with the French nationalists in Algiers, the combined Spanish-French military might was diverted to fully decimate the young Republic.\n\n The landing was mainly a Spanish affair, involving over ten thousand soldiers sent from Melilla and Ceuta, made up of elite units such as the Spanish Legion under Francisco Franco, indigenous troops from the Regulares and protectorate forces, and battle-hardened troops from many skirmishes against Rifian rebels, led primarily by José Sanjurjo. The landing would become the first large-scale amphibious attack in history, and its nature as a multi-branch, multinational operation utilizing the massive guns of Alfonso XIII battleship, the aircraft and airship carrier Dédalo, the seaplanes of the French army and the army troops of Spain, making multiple firsts in the history of Spanish, and even international, military matters. Despite fortifications and mining efforts of the Rif rebels, the landing was a success, and the new weapons such as tanks and aircraft, made the battle an easy victory for the Spanish forces. Today, Alhucemas is widely analysed by cadets of the Spanish army, navy and air force, and the many pioneering achievements of such a massive leap forward continue to inspire commanders of all the branches of Spain’s resurgent military."

sprd.287.d:0 "The Ferrol shipyard has long been under joint Spanish-British administration, with parts of the company owned by Spanish companies and nobles, and other half by British companies such as Vickers-Armstrong and John Brown & Company. As per this agreement, the ships designed by the company Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval have always been made on the basis of British designs, and the British have supplied the Ferrol yards with ample technical and material knowledge. A small contingent of British engineers and military personnel has lived in Ferrol since the start of the agreement, but after the fall of Britain to the syndicalists, these men and women were left bereft of a cause, some deciding to return to the Unionist side, others joining their former rulers in Canada.\n\n Some, however, remained, and while the wealth of Vickers-Armstrong and John Brown company is nowhere the levels it once maintained, they have been more than able to hold onto their stake of the company. However, as years roll by, the British empire turns more and more inwards, dedicating its resources to the fledgling industries of the former colonies and dominions, it is evidently clear that the British are moving towards empire-wide restructuring. Some within the government, especially those connected to SECN and naval security, have raised concerns that this will lead to the British pulling out their assets from Ferrol to instead focus on what is likely to be an attempt at reclamation of the Home Isles.\n\n While the garrison at Ferrol has not indicated any such intentions of leaving, the ministry of naval affairs has suggested that as a precaution, the deal is cut, the stakes of British companies forcibly seized, with compensation, and possibly sold to the Germans instead, to ensure steady flow of technological and material experience from the Kaiserreich. Many view this as a drastic and costly move, but there are upsides other than simple security. The German navy has rapidly grown since the Weltkrieg, and the fresh ideas they could bring our navy are worth the risk of upsetting the British. However, it is true that we share a multi-decade partnership with the exiles, and to throw it all away on simple suspicions is hardly a fair reaction to such reliable partners."

sprd.288.d:0 "The situation in the Mediterranean hasn’t been the same since the collapse of the French Republic and the total annihilation of Italian unity, as two capable naval forces were immediately lost and divided between multiple hostile factions. Spain observed these collapses with fear, and that fear manifested most thoroughly in the Red Scare of 1920. But in terms of actual military action taken to avoid a possible Communard invasion or revolution, most action taken by the high command focused on the Pyrenean mountains. The German takeover of Malta and Crete was expected to tip the balance of naval dominance handily to anti-syndicalist forces, but as war clouds once again emerge over the European nations, many Spanish naval officers are increasingly worried that the Mediterranean will become a battlefield, and the islands of the Balearics alongside the sea at large.\n\n As such, an ambitious new program has been started to fully prepare these islands for a possible attack, with the entrances to Las Palmas harbour fortified and reinforced with heavy naval artillery. This renovation is modelled after the La Parajola battery in Cartagena, with some inspiration also taken from the British fortresses seized in Gibraltar. As in La Parajola, the new fortifications have been armed with Reinosa-forged copies of the Vickers-Armstrong 152 millimetre guns, and it is hoped that they can drive back any cruisers or destroyers from Communard fleets, or, should our relations with the French nationalists sour, from them as well. Another program of installing similar batteries to the island of Menorca is also planned, as many within the military high command fear the loyalty of Catalans in the island of Mallorca to be suspicious at best. However, for now, funding has mainly focused on Las Palmas."

While the cursed Bolivar and his cronies would sever the connection Spain had to its colonies, finally ending this massive global trade empire, the link between Spanish and their former colonial subjects would slowly return, healing over centuries of shared cultural heritage, history and shared hatred for the Americans seeking to dominate everything south of them. Now that Spain has once more returned to world politics after such a long period of licking its wounds, the time has come to set sail once more, to release the treasure fleet of Spanish merchants from Compañía Transatlántica Española and Compañía Española de Tabacos de Filipinas as well as smaller enterprises such as the fleet of the Sota family.\n\n These mighty ships will ensure that our connections to the Latin American nations may never again be cut, and while in the past we came as conquerors, today Spanish fleets bring prosperity, fraternity and above all else, security to that corner of the world that so desperately needs these things. Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval, the national naval construction company, has agreed to dedicate some of their production towards the creation of large naval cruisers, intended to cross the stormy Atlantic waters swiftly and safely, protected by the Churruca, Alava and Cervera-class warships of the Spanish navy. The republican era department of naval trade, Marina Mercante, Navegación e Industrias Marítimas, will continue to operate as the central body overseeing this trade, and already deals have been made with local companies in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay to better facilitate the transfer of goods.

sprd.305.d:0 "With Spain now firmly in the palm of Partido Agrario, the new rulers have decided to gather widespread support for this new cause by holding a congress of all agrarian parties in Spain, intent on creating a green front of rural parties that can better spread the influence of Partido Agrario all around the nation. The parties involved are the rare Castilian regionalists and moderate Christian agrarians of Unión Castellana Agraria, led by the tireless agrarian conservatives Ricardo Cortés Villasana and Juan Díaz Caneja, the paternalistic conservative agrarians of Acción Agraria Riojana led by Tomás Ortiz de Solórzano y Ortiz de la Puente, the liberal agrarians of Partido Provincial Agrario of José María Cid Ruiz-Zorrilla and the Christian democrat splinter party from Accion Popular, Derecha Regional Agrario, led by Luis Lucia Lucia. \n\nNone of these parties hold the nation-wide support of Partido Agrario, but their influence on regional level is nothing to be scoffed at, with UCA prominent in Castile, La Mancha and Asturias, PPA prominent in the province of Zamora and surrounding areas, AAR holding a considerable sway in Cantabria, Navarra and La Rioja, and DRA prolific in the regions of Valencia, Murcia and Catalonia. These regionalists are hardly as treacherous as those within the ranks of Basque, Catalan and Galician separatists, but they will require us to make concessions to regional self-governance, something PAE is not necessarily opposed to as long as it curtails the more separatist elements within Spanish society. In exchange to these compromises from the side of PAE, the regional parties are in turn expected to fall into a wider confederation of agrarian parties within Spain, the so called Agrarian Majority, to ensure that no rival parties or organizations can ever threaten the influence of PAE in Spain.\n\n The regional groups will be nominally independent, but their larger political platform besides regional matters will be made in Madrid within the wider council of agrarians, and the parties are expected to support PAE in wider national matter such as economic organization, foreign policy and political reforms. With the help of these regional groups, the moderate agrarians of Spain may finally break the hold of both agrarian syndicalists and radical firebrands such as Albiñana’s Partido Nacionalista and Accion Popular’s local groups, who seek only to exploit the local peasants and smallholders to gain political capital for their non-rural platforms"

sprd.306.d:0 "As Partido Fusionista has now consolidated itself as the sole administrator of the Spanish kingdom and the right hand of King Juan, the leadership, especially Count of Romanones, has found it rather difficult to govern certain areas. Given the rather liberal nature of the Count and his supporters, even with the new authoritarian approach they have adopted, the remnants of the old regime tend to attempt sabotage, subterfuge and full-blown insubordination in areas where the Count’s caciquists and genuine supporters hold little sway. Reactionaries from Renovación Española and Partido Nacionalista Español are always aching to hamper our rule, especially as they know the Count’s stance on the Catholic church, and thus it has been rather difficult to rule Spain to the full extent of PF’s new powers.\n\n However, despite the widespread drives to push Republicans into exile or prison, there are still a great deal of these men within our nation, and while their status is hardly better than that of a pariah, they can still benefit our reign greatly. Radicals such as those of Alejandro Lerroux and Diego Martinez-Barrio love the church even less than we do, and while they may view the good Count and his followers as little more than reactionaries masquerading as liberals, they will likely take any chance they can get to participate in the reforming of a new Spain.\n\n However, given that Partido Fusionista situation is rather shaky already, taking the liberals and republicans abroad may lead to the full-scale revolt of reactionaries, even if PF has the king’s blessing for the time being. As such, some suggest simply bolstering our ranks by recruiting rank-and-file republicans in PF, and then converting them to a monarchist mindset, especially among those republicans that are still salvageable. This would see us integrate groups such as Niceto Alcala-Zamora’s Derecha Liberal Republicana and Partido del Centro Democrático of Manuel Portela Valladares, who are noted for their pragmatism in matters such as these. This would likely not solve all our regional issues, but would at least temporarily give us better means at contesting the traditionalists, integralists and other rabble who seek to keep Spain in the middle ages for good."

The new constitution will protect the rights to religion and conscience, and will ensure that the rights of association, union membership and property are not trampled on by any governors of civil law. Wide-scale amnesty will be given to republicans as well, as the government does not want to remove partisanship from society fully, simply ensure that the monarchist order is not toppled by syndicalist rabble. As such, while PAE is committed to the rights of individuals, they are also committed to ensuring that authority is provided fully in society, so that it does not descend to anarchy.\n\n The role of government is to ensure that the ideas of citizens do not contradict the wellbeing of the Spanish society, and thus in certain circumstances the government will be given the necessary precautions to freeze parts of the rights of Spanish people to ensure social cohesion, most notably in the forcible disbanding of parties that actively call for treacherous and revolutionary actions, such as PSOE and in more minor roles, BOC. Other parties, especially the more republican remnants of Union Republicana and Izquierda Republicana, have called this a blatant support of the PAE’s landowner backers, as the new amendment is worded in a way that gives the government ability to intervene in rural land issues directly in the name of ‘defence of public order’.\n\n Given the weak situation of these republican forces, however, there is hardly much they can do to oppose the new constitution. To ensure public order and organic cooperation into society, the Cortes will be also reformed to become a bicameral institution, with the new second chamber made up of societal organizations, such as employer’s organizations, unions and other groups with vested interests in governance. The most radical change to the Constitution would be the situation of Hispanic citizens and the planned Spanishization of Latin American nationals should they set a foot on Spanish shores, as well as the invitation of Latin American representatives to the Spanish Cortes, but for the time being, these plans are pushed for a later date to ensure that the new planned constitution can be fully finalized on Spanish domestic matters.

Organizations such as Confederacion de Obreros Catolicos de Levante, a co-operative groups of tenant farmers, seasonal labourers and peasants in the Levantine regions of Iberia, has been practically left astray and integrating it into the wider PAE network would not only boost our numbers, but also help paint a picture of PAE that is far less elitist than previously may have been apparent, given that many of the members of COCL are lower class agrarians yet just as pious as those of PAE’s middle- and upper class members. Similarly, the employer’s organization of Confederación Española Patronal Agraria has collaborated with PAE in the past to ensure that the prices of grain remain competitive but not overtly burdening to the light wallets of the poor landholders. Integrating CEPA into PAE would on the other hand allow us to widen our network of allies all across Spain, and the two different organizations uniting differing socio-economical bases in Spain could work within the party of PAE to ensure that any conflicts of interests are resolved without much public outrage and needless bickering, facilitated further by enforcers of PAE working on behalf of the government. Such an integration of small organizations will hardly be an easy one, especially given that much of PAE’s influence has typically distributed around the territories of Castile and Leon, but the benefits are too lucrative to pass.

sprd.310.d:0 "Spanish monarchism has, since time immemorial, been mostly a force of tradition, hierarchy and little actual change. The move from mercantilism to capitalism in Spain was a slow and sluggish affair, and among the conservatives, it was still a strong point of contention as many viewed it as inherently liberal and exploitative of the Catholic workers, at least in the form of a laissez-faire capitalism. However, the Spanish monarchists have hardly detached themselves from capitalism, and many Spanish nobles are also important industrialists, corporation owners and venture capitalists even if they hold disdain for non-noble capitalists such as Juan March, who earned his enormous fortune through smuggling and other scrupulous avenues. However, there has always been a push among Spanish monarchists and conservatives to reform capitalism to better fit the needs of Spain, and with the rise of Renovación Española to the leadership of Spain, premier Calvo Sotelo has announced his plan to do just that.\n\n His new view is a capitalism of savings, a way to defeat the crisis of capitalism through an authoritarian form, introducing command economy, hints of corporatism through the reorganization of labour alongside these ideals, and the introduction of strong government control unto the economy to ensure that neither the employers nor employees overstep from their positions. Calvo Sotelo claims that capitalism is in a crisis that is not terminal but cyclical, and these new measures will turn it into a more humane model that can stand the test of time. Gone will be the inefficient and wasteful ideas of speculative and financial capitalism, replaced by truly authoritarian capitalism for a Spain of new age.\n\n This new form of capitalism must not be the static model of modern financial capitalism, where the ownership class will simply settle for being a rentier, but a dynamic force in constant motion, producing creations through the movement of forces within the capitalist class. This will be achieved through the creation and application of surplus created by the economy, into the economy, to ensure that stagnation or labour conflicts do not arise. The workers will get their fair share, while the capitalist class will be prodded into action to ensure that they do not become like dragons hoarding their wealth in a cave. This is Calvo Sotelo’s new vision of capitalism, aimed at avoiding the pitfalls of blaming either workers or upper class owners for the ailments of society as so many corporatists, syndicalists and other forms of ideologies often claim, and through this reform to the entire institution of economy, Calvo Sotelo aims to conquer the state and its many differing branches, ending the crisis of capitalism and the spawns of syndicalism once and for all."

But now, thanks to the swift gauntlet of justice wielded by AE and its leader Ramiro de Maetzu, alongside their allies in the Spanish army and the Guerillas de España of Juan de Ansaldo, a purification of Spanish blood may once again start. A new crusade, harking back to the glory days of the Reconquista.\n\n The new king and his fierce Hispanic ideologue shall divert the loyal sons of Spain to hound the forces of anti-Spain where ever they will try to hole up into, from the tallest peaks to the Pyrenees to the open plains of Andalusia, enemies of the monarchy and church shall never know peace. Rebellious states such as the Rif will be retaken, order will be reinstated in Equatorial Guinea and then, only then, will Spain look towards the future, into a new traditionalist state, built on the very foundations of Catholic social order, competent and confident military and total devotion to the crown of king Juan and the Bourbon lineage. The new regime is fully supported by the Spanish Catholic Church and especially Cardinal Gomá, who claims that the upcoming fight against the godless hordes is a just war according to Thomicist principles, and to him, the situation in Spain has progressed to the point that peace can only be brought to the nation by the power of a sword, until all enemies of the new order surrender."

Similarly, it is hardly likely that RE will ever be able to become a force for mass mobilization, unlike movements such as Acción Popular or the Carlists and their peasant supporter base, as RE with its leader Calvo Sotelo simply oozes upper class politics and refined politicking, not populist men of the people. However, if there is one group in Spain that is highly likely to be converted to our side, it’s the military men of the Spanish army, navy, Legion and even officers of Guardia Civil, lured in to RE’s promises of a strong, unbowed totalitarian state of Spain, unafraid to mete out swift justice to traitors of the crown.\n\n The party already has strong supporter base within the army as well, with men such as lieutenant colonel José Cruz-Conde Fustegueras and rear admiral Ramón de Carranza and Fernández Reguera, who do not currently hold actual offices within the military due to advanced age and political commitments, but who do possess a strong network within the army and navy and could help convert relatively politically uncommitted military men such as Francisco Franco, Juan Yague and Manuel Goded Llopis, who nonetheless hold monarchist or conservative sympathies. However, the high command is likely harder to convert than many of the younger officers, lieutenants, captains and even other, lower ranks, given that these men are less entrenched in the political traditionalism in Spain and are more easily lured by the promise of a strong, centralized state that idolizes the military might of Spain. Many within our Green Beret paramilitary are already members of the military, and thus we could expand their role in the army or provide benefits for military men joining their ranks, to ensure the indoctrination of army troops to our particular ideological variation of Spanish monarchism and conservatism.\n\n This is vital not only from the point of view of our party expansion, but also as it will ensure the loyalty of the military, only force left in Spain that can hope to oppose us now. Increased funding to the budget of the army for officer training, equipment acquisitions and colonial reinforcement ought to buy the loyalty of certain military men. There will of course always be firebrands within their ranks who will not approve our rather radical transformation of Spain, such as general Quiepo de Llano and Cabanellas, alongside socialist officers such as Julio Mangada Rosenörn, but we can always attempt to dislodge them from the military due to their loyalties being removed from the regime at the helm of Spain, so their resistance is bound to be short."

In the letter, Pla created  metaphora of the current state of Spanish internal affairs by comparing it to two cities. Spain under AE is on its way to construct a heavenly city of God's children, prosperous, pious, blessed and patriotic. It is contrasted by the opponents of our regime, the godless communists, socialists and anarchists who seek to build an earthen city, one that turns its back to the heroism displayed by Spain’s glorious martyrs in the past and to God himself. This new Gomorrah or Sodom, will only bring disdain, destitution and destruction to our noble lands, as was seen during the republican years and in 1936, when the Catalan terrorists, whipped into frenzy by the republican rhetoric, performed an attempted act of regicide.\n\n The glorious resurrection of Christian Spain must begin, and with the republicans and syndicalists swept aside, a Catholic social order will be built, as befits the king’s new realm. The new regime will largely empower the church to carry out matters of ‘spiritual’ regeneration, and the church has increased support to Acción Católica, a Catholic laymen’s organization, to better facilitate an approach that is close to the needs and wants of the people themselves. Rest of Spain will see infrastructure and housing projects started on the rural areas to improve these regions after the damages caused by anarchists, separatists and Carlist extremists.\n\n Same applies to loyal cities such as Sevilla, Madrid and Toledo, whereas areas rife with anti-Hispanist rabble rousers such as Basque Country, Catalonia and even Andalusia and Galicia will be taught a lesson in civility and humility. Only once these regions are properly cleansed of their anti-Castilian ideals can they join the heavenly city AE is working so hard to create. Spain will be built back on the backs of the numerous holy martyrs lost during this period of immense strife, and only the Garden of Eden or the Holy Father’s heaven can truly match this future splendour of resurgent Spain."

However, despite the nation-wide witch hunts for separatists, some regional groups have been mostly left untouched, usually groups that have collaborated against anarchists or socialists. Parties such as Dereita Galeguista and elements of the Partido Republicano Agrario have helped Guardia Civil and Guerillas units in suppressing the revolts of Galician anarchists and syndicalists from the fishermen’s unions, and in Catalonia, the Lliga Regionalista has been mostly left untouched despite the ambivalence of Francesc Cambó towards the rule of Acción Española.\n\n Recently, numerous followers of Ramiro de Maetzu and his Hispanist majority faction within AE have pointed out that the Catalan leader has personally described his ideology towards Spain as ‘Hispano-Catalanist’, claiming that Catalonia benefits more from being part of Spain and developing as a region without equal within it. This is clear reference to the situation of Catalonia as the most industrially developed region in Spain, but it has caused much uproar among Hispanists, who view this as parasitic and completely contrary to the ideals of Maetzuist Hispanism. The Catalans have earned their wealth not through honest labour and innovation like Castilians, but by utilizing their exploitative capitalist practices, as can be clearly seen in Compañía Hispano Americana de Electricidad, a Spanish-German company in which Cambó has a considerable share in.\n\n This company is based in Argentina, and is known to be rife with corruption to such a degree that it would make even Alejandro Lerroux blush. The most fanatical Hispanists want Cambó hanged for slandering the name of Hispanism with such regionalist notions, but others have pointed out that as the strongest remaining political force tied to Catalanism in the region, attacking Lliga Regionalista directly would cause more issues than a couple regionalist delusions ever could."

So far, Ramiro de Maetzu and the rest of the Hispanist clique of Acción Española has mostly viewed Hispanism as an ideology for the revitalization and unification for the people of Spain, but de Maetzu has never had a solely Iberian-focused view to the ideas he espouses. In his eyes, the resurgent right-wing Hispanism encompasses the Latin American nations that used to belong to Spain two centuries ago.\n\n In the foreign policy of AE, relations with Latin America are of utmost importance, and will be focused heavily on the dual purpose of protecting the region from American influence and ensuring that Catholicism and Hispanic culture never gets pushed out by enemies of these holy creeds. This makes AE a natural ally to paternalistic caudillos, nationalist military men and pious civilian politicians, especially the righteous men of the Peruvian army and most importantly, our most stalwart allies in the Hermandad Peruana, led by Castillo Reva-Agüero. Similarly, we have sought to establish connections to other pro-Spanish groups in the Caribbean region, such as the Puerto Rican Partido Nacionalista, and even individuals such as the Ecuadorian diplomat Julio Tobar Donoso.\n\n While our approaches to Hispanism may vary, and there is of course some degree of mistrust by the locals towards our intentions due to the colonial past, with some even claiming that the approach of AE is far too paternalistic and self-serving, many militarists and Hispanists are happy for the support given that they either need international legitimization guarantees or simply support for relatively fringe movements. For now, much of the diplomatic work has been done to create connections and networks in the New World on top of our existing ones, to better facilitate economic and political cooperation in the future, with talks between Latin American states and Spain possibly resulting in the creation of an international body called Organización de Estados Hispanoamericos, which would allow for broader approaches to diplomacy and trans-Atlantean cooperation against American influence. While these plans will take a while to be set in motion, they could become a great tool in harnessing the true potential of both Spain and its former colonies ."

sprd.316.t:0 "The National Bloc"
sprd.316.d:0 "The influence of Charles Maurras and his Action Francaise on Renovación Española cannot be understated, as many members of the party, such as the writer Álvaro Alcalá-Galiano y Osma and engineer María del Pilar Careaga Basabe, are heavily inspired by the French far-right theorist. However, perhaps the strongest turning point towards this Maurrasisme ideology was the meeting between Jose Calvo Sotelo and Maurras in 1934, during a state visit as the Spanish Kingdom and French Nationalist State expanded their mutual relations. Calvo Sotelo returned a changed man, having completely abandoned his liberal conservative and Maurist ideas for a far more radical position, and while he had shown tacit support for the Republic during the 1932 period, the man was now the staunchest enemy of the republicanism in Spain.\n\n After dislodging Antonio Goicoechea from the party’s leadership spot thanks to effective political maneuvering and the somewhat lacking political charisma of Goicoechea, Calvo Sotelo would transform the party program towards fully Maurrasian principles. The party’s militia, Green Berets, small as it was, would take more influences from the Camelots du Roi, the party itself would boot many of the Maurist conservatives and any notions of liberal conservatism would be scrubbed off from RE wholesale.\n\n The Catholic monarchy has grown to be the lynchpin in a battle against Masonry, republicanism and liberalism in Spain, and as RE seeks to create an even more organic society, the Catholic parties of the new Spain must be united under one front, a National Bloc, against forces of chaos. This is perhaps the greatest deviation of Calvo Sotelo from the thought form of Maurras, as Calvo Sotelo seeks to create a large Catholic front against the enemies of reaction. \n\nNegotiations with Partido Agrario, Partido Nacionalista and Accion Popular have already been heavily underway, and while Gil-Robles himself has refused to ally with who he considers to be dangerous fundamentalists, after some support from RE, AP’s internal dynamics have pressured Gil-Robles to abandon his position of resistance. The National Bloc will ensure that the mistakes of 1931 will never come to pass again, and the monarchist order will sustain itself through cooperation, concentration of resources and shared faith in God’s rule on Earth."

sprd.317.d:0 "The monarchist tendency known as integral nationalism, or more commonly as Maurrasisme, is not a massively influential current in our neighbouring Nationalist Spain, but the Master, as Charles Maurras is fondly known among his followers and admirers, is nonetheless a true titan of French politics and integralist thoughtforms world-wide. His ideals of France are in turn contrasted by those whom he calls Anti-France, most notably Jews and Masons. This current of thought is hardly unique either, with all Spanish right-wing parties being anti-Mason at the very least and usually attributing Judaism to syndicalism, communism or republicanism. However, Spain itself has a population of around six thousand Jews, and in the aftermath of the Sanjurjada coup and the subsequent authoritarian consolidation around Renovación Española, many Jewish citizens have fled to Tangiers, a site of about six thousand Jews as well, and further, to Latin America, Central Europe and Morocco. As such, anti-Semitic voices are growing scarcer and scarcer, but some hardliners, such as Álvaro Alcalá-Galiano y Osma and the chronicler of the Bourbon monarchy and great personal friend of Alfonso XIII, Julian Cortes Cavanillas, still insist on persecuting the few remaining stragglers. Both blame Judeo-Masonic influences for the original fall of the Bourbon monarchy, with Cortes going as far as to blame a Jewish syndicalist assassin for poisoning general Primo de Rivera during his exile. However, most of Spain’s right is far more ardent in their support for anti-Masonic causes, and see these witch hunts of prominent Jews in Spain as a waste of resources, especially given that most have left Spain to avoid persecution anyway. Calvo Sotelo and Goicoechea, the two leading members of RE, have never been particularly fervent supporters of this cause, but the party opinion is not particularly strong either way on the matter, and thus men like Cortes could convince them."

sprd.318.d:0 "Throughout Spain, monarchist and traditionalist groups resisting the effects of regionalism have popped up, usually dominated by local nobles, prominent politicians and businessmen. These organizations, clubs and parties have long fought Aranaists in Basque Country and the followers of Francesc Macia and Prat de Riba in Catalonia, crushing separatist ideas and supporting true Hispanic patriots wherever they are. Groups such as Derecha de Catalunya and Peña Blanca in Catalonia, Acción Ciudadano in Andalusia and Liga de Acción Monárquica in Basque Country have all driven the supremacy of Spanish governance in their respective territories, but after the victory of Renovación Española, Spain no longer needs to rely on such decentralized form of anti-separatist resistance. As such, given that many of these groups are chaired by members of RE as well, it is only natural that we should absorb them into our organization. However, others have noted that we could also target groups belonging to Acción Popular’s wider organization, seeking to sway them to our cause. Parts of Acción Popular in Galicia used to be run by prime minister Calvo Sotelo before his defection to RE, and we could exploit those connections, given that Galicia houses numerous groups such as Unión de Derechas y Agrarios de Lugo, Unión Regional de Derechas de La Coruña and Unión Regional de Derechas de Pontevedra. Other groups of AP may be harder to sway to our side, especially hardline legalists like Rafael Aizpún of Unión Navarra and Derecha Regional Valenciano of Luis Lucía Lucía. Nonetheless, a victory in Galicia would improve our position greatly already, especially as we integrate other regional groups. However, many hardliners of the party, such as the ardent monarchist Santiago Fuentes Pila, have pointed out that taking in some of these Galicia social Catholics would likely cause our movement to veer more towards the moderate stance AP has taken in the past. The party is split on the issue, and it’s up to Calvo Sotelo to make the call"

sprd.319.d:0 "Following the increased efforts of Acción Española to promote Hispanist ideas and Pan-Latin unity here in Spain as well as overseas in South America, there has been a distinct cultural revival in trans-Atlantic cultural sharing. Another notable development in this field has been the reopening of Raza Española, a cultural magazine seeking to highlight the good things Spain has done to the world and especially to South America, building connections between prominent Hispanists in numerous nations such as Chile and Peru and mending fences over shared history of imperial past.\n\n Described as menendezpelayista, after the historian, writer, politician and Nobel price winner Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo, the magazine puts great emphasis on the language and cultural traditions imposed to Latin America by Spain centuries ago, traditions that still remain in South America and are developed further by local intellectuals, artists and scientists. The magazine is led by the writer Blanca de los Ríos, a notable disciple of Menéndez, and it has become something of a club for former pupils of Menéndez to gather around, such as the philologist Adolfo Bonilla and the recently deceased Juan Gualberto López-Valdemoro de Quesada. The magazine was closed since 1930, when perfidious republican forces sought to disrupt such pro-monarchist and conservative safe havens, but as Blanca de los Rios has become more and more involved with the Hispanist tendencies of the new regime, she has decided to reopen the magazine with the help of her co-writers and editors. It is hoped that Raza Española will further integrate with the regime and help efforts to build bridges to South American nations."

sprd.320.d:0 "Renovación Española has, for obvious reasons, very few women among its ranks, be it the relatively low numbers of right-wing woman politicians, the socially conservative attitudes of RE’s members, or even the greater pull of Acción Popular towards women. No matter the reason, RE has nonetheless seen something of an uptick in support from women after their ascension to power, and there has been some degree of talks about starting a women’s section of the party, emulating the work done by the Carlists and their Margaritas organization for women. This task has been delegated to one of the few women in the movement, Pilar Careaga, an engineer and politician from Biscaya, who has tried to create an organization emulating the Auxilio Social organized by another far-right woman politician, Mercedes Sanz-Bachiller, wife of Onésimo Redondo, the founder of Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica.\n\n The party has sought to utilize her talents in engineering as well, given that Careaga was the first woman to graduate with a degree in mechanical, chemical and railroad engineering in Spain, and her responsibilities have partly been related to these fields as well. Careaga has utilized her connections to other prominent women politicians, intellectuals and social Catholic feminists, such as Blanca de los Ríos and María de Echarri, to seek unity between the different Catholic forces for women in Spain in the creation of an unified group for RE’s women.\n\n For this, she has sought to unify the women worker’s union Federación de Sindicatos Femeninos and Acción Católica de la Mujer, two organizations driving women’s rights from Catholic perspective, into a singular organization that could fulfill the original tenets of the Spanish Women’s Manifesto published all the way back in 1929, demanding that the state honours women’s right to vote and participation in politics, upholds their right to step up as representatives and allows for the pursuit for the ‘legitimate feminism’, contrasting the godless, liberal and socialist feminism utilized by Republican parties and politicians such as Victoria Kent and Maria de Maetzu. The reactions to these new maneuvers within right-wing women’s circles have been mixed, but given the prominence of aristocratic women within these organizations, there’s not much the more conservative sectors of Spain’s right can do."

A giant of Basque nationalism, he was a founder of the Euskalduna shipyards, one of Spain’s main shipbuilding facilities, but his influence also expanded to insurance markets through his La Polar company, railway construction and even banking through his stakes in the Banco Bilbao Biscay Argentaria. de la Sota’s participation in shipping was most notably demonstrated during the Weltkrieg, as his company’s ships suffered greatly at the hands of German submarines while leased to the British navy for service.\n\n While the British lost the war, de la Sota would be granted the title of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire by George V, for the merit of being a “a good friend of England and its people” during the last years of the Windsor’s reign on British Isles. De la Sota’s influence within Basque nationalism can also not be understated, as his pragmatic vision of nationalism steered the hegemonic Partido Nacionalista Vasco into adopting more autonomist positions when compared to the staunch separatist visions of Sabino Arana, the other key nationalist in the region. Time will tell if the passing of this venerated figure of the movement will affect PNV’s internal politics, but for now the region mourns the loss of their only Knight."

A hot air balloon carrying colonel Emilio Herrera Linares has successfully tested his new invention, the stratonautical space suit. This suit, made of vulcanized silk and multiple layers of helmet glass ,for blocking different hazards, had a metal frame with folds similar to those of the accordion, and a great deal of work had been made to create a bulky and sturdy suit which would still allow for articulate movements required to operate instruments. A cloak was attached to the suit to protect the wearer from solar and cosmic radiation. The pressurized suit was tested rigorously on the ground level, and after issues with build-up heat from the human body were fixed, the test could be performed.\n\n While still far from perfect, the stratonautical space suit seems to function well at heights normally unsuitable for human pilots, and while the technology we possess may not be capable of launching humans into space yet, the suit itself seems capable of tackling the challenge. More tests will be carried out at a later date, but news of Herrera’s achievement have sent the nation into a frenzy as people raise their eyes to the night sky and dream of once touching the marvels it possesses thanks to the pioneering new gear. The government has granted more funding towards the program, and many private citizens from wealthy backgrounds have offered to pay for the equipment and training required to fund such expeditions.

The nomination has been quite shocking, as Picasso is known for his syndicalist sympathies and has also been known to collaborate with French artists on various works. Many presume that this nomination by the Royal Court is meant to placate the left-wing Spaniards during the troubling period in Spain, and this is presumed to have been the reason for Picasso to accept the position as well, as he is known for his pacifist stance. The famed painter has recently worked on his Minotaur-period, as he calls it, relating to the numerous statues and paintings of bulls, bullfighters and related subjects present in his pieces.\n\n Along with Georges Braque, Picasso is known as the father of Cubism, a very modern and unorthodox art form making rounds among the various revolutionary (in various meanings of the word) artists of the world. The Prado Museum is one of Spain’s crown jewels, housing some of Europe’s most groundbreaking art peaces and timeless classics from hundreds of years ago. Even the powerhouses of European industry and politics envy the collection present in Prado, and the title of its president is not given out lightly, so many expect the Spanish culture circles to have a far more favourable view of the monarchy given this particular concession.

The JCAH members attacked a group of JONS members as they were exciting a public house after a rowdy gathering, and while initially the standoff was mere exchange of insults and accusations, it soon devolved into a proper fistfight, with some members on both sides even arming themselves with knives and cudgels. The Guardia Civil unit on patrol at the capital soon arrived to the scene and managed to disperse the crowd after firing a few shots in the air, but unfortunately only two jonsistas and one JCAH member were captured, the rest making their escape to the back alleys of the city.\n\n Both organizations remain highly problematic to the government, as while JCAH is not particularly opposed to our regime, they are known to have beaten up moderate members of Accion Popular for ‘collaborating with liberals, Masons and syndicalists’. JONS is far more dangerous however, as they hold ties to the Chater Totalists of the Internationale and are known to have formed an unstable but nonetheless concerning alliance with CNT-FAI.

However, he considered German and Spanish conservatism far too reactionary and compromising with the enemies of true Spanish spirit, especially in their tolerance of liberal businessmen and Jews. Redondo had organized non-syndicalist unions in the past, and this led him to adopt more corporatist ideals, taking the concept to the point where he called for the entire nation to be organized around unions, led by a government of pious, youthful and traditionalist men, capable of sheltering Spain from the contamination of liberalism and syndicalism.\n\n His organization, while small, has attracted many young radicals who struggled under the stagnated organizations of both the Carlists and Alfonsists. Redondo is a known advocate for radical Hispanism  and his ideas of the concept are heavily tied to race and religion, with him denouncing the regionalist ambitions of Basques and Catalans. Contrary to most Spanish right-wing parties, Redondo is also openly anti-semitic and has been avid reader of international anti-semitic literature, such as those circulated by Henry Ford.

The state would then create an united structure overcoming the classes of Spain, leading to the fading of class struggle that keeps the nation divided. The regime would allow for participatory, direct democracy without political parties to install their corruption and bureaucracy to shackle the people.\n\n While there are those within the movement who support the installation of Catholicism as an inherent part of Hispanism espoused by Ledesma, this wing of the movement has been sidelined after a shaky alliance with CNT-FAI was brokered. Many within Spain’s left eye jonsistas and Ledesma as dangerous totalitarian tyrants, and the movement’s violent and brutish rhetoric and actions certainly don’t help.

While not officially a member of the German economic sphere or alliance, General Sanjurjo has guided the nation towards Germany slowly but surely both economically and politically. The Germans have proven to be quite interested in visiting our warm-water ports and islands, especially the islands of Canaries and Balearics, leaving the mild weather of Central Europe to bask in the warm sun of the Mediterranean and African coastline. Spain is relatively easy to access for these upper-class German aristocrats and the advent of Zeppelin travel has made it somewhat accessible for the Reich’s bourgeoisie and middle-class clerks. While German naval strongholds such as Malta and Crete remain more popular destinations, Spain has become a lucrative location not only because of its cuisine and culture but also because Spanish prices tend to be quite a bit lower than those of the German tourist trap locations.\n\n This avalanche of visitors has not been limited to those of the Mitteleuropa, for British-Canadian and French officers and administrators are known to visit the island of Mallorca quite often, usually in secret from their commanders. This has vastly increased trade in the formerly quite forgotten island, and this development in turn has helped the economies of Valencia and Catalonia region expand to fit the needs of the tourists. However, there have been some negative changes as well, especially in relation to visitors from Entente. The deaths of multiple British officers, falling to their deaths from the numerous Mallorcan balconies while intoxicated, has been rather awkward to the reputation of the local accommodation venues, sometimes leading to wider international incidents.

The issue has struck Mallorca the hardest, with the island’s middling economy returning to its pre-boom levels in a single crash. Businesses are leaving en masse, and those that remain do so more out of the inability to leave rather than any trust in the return of prosperity.\n\n This change has been seen even in the coffers of mainland Spain, as Valencia and Catalonia suffer from the lack of tourists and the trade they brought. Even if Black Monday was fixed in the metropolitan areas in the coming months, Balearics are bound to remain stranded in financial dire straits until the Central European trade returns to its former glory, although it is not guaranteed if even that will help the small island’s economy."

In the eyes of Spain’s conservatives and republicans however, this has been seen as a step in the right direction, as the possibilist seem more committed to their cause than ever after shedding the burden of jonsista radicalism.

However, it would appear that complete collapse has been avoided, as the German film producers have reached out to CIFESA in hopes of collaboration. This has resulted in the creation of the relatively small studio Hispano-Film-Produktion, which has partnered with CIFESA to circulate Spanish films in Germany and vice versa. They have also released the first fruit of their collaboration, the film Carmen, la de Triana.\n\n The film, directed by Florian Rey, once again explores the themes of exotic Spanishness and interracial love, as the film shows a love triangle between the famed bullfighter Antonio Vargas Heredia, Guardia Civil Brigadier José and a gypsy woman named Carmen. The cast includes  Imperio Argentina, one of the rising stars of Spain’s acting scene, as well as Rafael Rivelles and Manuel Luna. The film has not reached the heights of Rey’s earlier work with Morena Clara, but it did well enough to warrant the production of more German-Spanish collaboration works, such as the upcoming La canción de Aixá and El barbero de Sevilla, coming later this year.

After the Germans emerged victorious in the Weltkrieg, their great interest in Zeppelins made them natural collaborators to Spanish experts on the field, and perhaps the greatest achievement of this collaboration was the creation of the Cadiz-Buenos Aires airship route. The Spanish company Sociedad Colón Transaérea Española partnered with the German Südamerikanische Gesellschaft Zeppelin. An agreement was made that Spain would build two airships locally, the SCA1 and 2, and the Germans would provide the Zeppelins Z121 and Z126. The smaller Spanish vessels operated the distance between mainland Spain and the Canary Islands, while the German-made Zeppelins would carry the passengers from the Isles all the way to Argentina.\n\n This agreement has generally been a massive boon for Spanish air industry, but after Black Monday German transportation needs towards South America have dwindled down, and this has hit the coffers of SCTE notably. However, many Spaniards see the route as a complete necessity, for the trade connections made to the New World during the last decades have been invaluable to the buildup of Spain’s industry.

The French and their collaborating Spanish brethren seem to have changed the film’s narration to French, and now it circulates the cinemas of France and Britain.\n\n The movie is a scathing account of the situation of Spanish countryside, depicting the supposed misery of the situation in these regions. While even the current Spanish government admits that the situation of our latifundios can be somewhat difficult, Buñuel’s account is clearly meant to be exaggerated and it is known that during the process of the filming, he purposefully caused the deaths of two animals to drive his point home. However, among the Communard circles, the revolutionaries are lapping the propaganda piece up as a masterpiece, and they’ve used it as an example of the dangers of capitalism and reactionary conservatism of the Spanish crown. The Spanish government has obviously demanded for the film to be removed from cinema schedules, but as expected, the French have declined to comply."

sprd.365.d:0 "The world-famous aviator Juan de la Cierva has announced his new project, another iteration of the legendary C-series of autogyros, starting with the humble C.1 in the early 1920s that simply mounted a rotor to the fuselage of a fixed-wing aircraft all the way to the new Cierva C.40. This new design uses the most up-to-date aerodynamic rotor developments, and utilizes the earlier Cierva C.30A as a base for its chassis. A copy of the French Salmson engine licensed from the aerial developers of the Algiers is installed to power the new machine, and it takes the design of an autogyro to a completely new level, as its three blades are attached to the rotor hub through inclined flap and drag hinges to give jump-takeoff capability, a first in the development of rotor-powered aircraft.\n\n This new development has piqued the interest of military and civilian aviators worldwide, and especially the Germans, just starting with their Focke-Achgelis copies of Cierva’s wonders, have expressed interest in the design. Cierva, restless as always to push the design further, has partnered with numerous British exile autogyro designers, and has announced that the next project, the Cierva W.11, nicknamed Air Horse, is already in initial drawing phase. According to Cierva, the lessons learned with C.40 will be added to the new design, which will ditch the autogyro set-up and instead aim to have a fully working helicopter arrangement, something only dreamed of by foreign designers. While some sceptics have expressed doubts at such an arrangement being unfeasible, Cierva remains unbothered, and expects the design to be airborne in early 1940s."

sprd.366.d:0 "Leonardo Torres Quevedo has passed away today at the age of 83, dying to a progressive illness that has taken him from his family, and Spain at large, mere ten days before his birthday. Torres Quevedo will likely be remembered as one of the geniuses of Spanish academia for centuries to come, as his advancements in the fields of aerodynamics, automation, shipbuilding and mathematics. Probably his most known achievement is the El Ajedrecista, an electromagnetic machine created in 1912 that was capable of playing limited amount of chess moves, which, while limited against experts of chess, was an excellent example in machine programming and demonstrated that machines could potentially be instructed to perform roles even beyond these relatively limited purposes. He fulfilled this idea after the construction of a typewriter-calculator in 1920, another first in the field of utilizing analytical engines.\n\n His interests weren’t only limited to the field of mathematics and automation, but Torres Quevedo also developed various aerial and naval designs, such as an airship guiding system capable of being used in ports, a two-hulled naval ship with separate engines called the Binave and the Astra-Torres airships developed with the help of the Astra company and French experts, which were the first examples of dirigible airships in Spanish service. He was also a strong supporter of the Esperanto language, and frequently spoke it even in private and public settings.\n\n A devout Catholic, he was often expressed to have had a somewhat explorative stance to his personal faith, and was known to read the catechism multiple times a day. His final words were recorded to have been ‘Memento homnia, quia pulvis eris et in pulverem reverteris’, or ‘Remember, man, you are dust and to dust you will return’ if translated from Latin. The death of Torres Quevedo has been a blow to the scientific community worldwide, and many scientists regardless of the ideological divides present today have reminisced on the life of the marvellous scientist."

The trainer, first ordered in 1934 and now finally in the phase of entering air force service, has been a welcome addition. As a monoplane trainer, it surpassed its two biplane rivals, the venerable HS.34 and  Adaro 1.E.7, bringing Spain’s domestic air production finally to the modern era by adopting a single wing. While not revolutionary in any of its characteristics, the plane has already proved itself, first in a flight from Barcelona to Agadir by pilots Ramón Torres and Carlos Coll as it demonstrated rather strong long-range capabilities.\n\n This flight was soon eclipsed as a single-seat GP-2 surpassed Torres’ and Coll’s achievement, when piloted by Lorenzo Richi, the plane managed a flight from Madrid to the Spanish Equatorial Guinea, travelling at a rather brisk speed of 187 km/h. Spanish industry still has a long way to go until domestic fighters can be manufactured, but GP-2 is sure to provide our men with a great deal of experience in the new monoplane vehicles for years to come, and whenever the transition to local monoplane fighters arrives, our pilots will be ready for the trials and tribulations it will bring with it."

Around fifteen men were taken into custody but far more managed to flee, including the leader of the group Elias Gallastegi.

sprd.369.d:0 "The advent of radio has been well-received in Spain, as these new contraptions find their way to homes and cafes countrywide, bringing much needed information to a country where literacy still struggles to reach acceptable levels. This surge in radio transmissions has been noticed by the entertainment industry as well, and numerous radio shows have been launched country-wide. One such show is from a well-known trio of songwriters and copla artists, known locally as the Quintero, Leon and Quiroga after its three leads, Manuel Quiroga, Antonio Quintero and Rafael de León.\n\n The group first met in 1932, after being hired by the famed bullfighter Antonio Márquez to perform alongside her lover and Spain’s arguably brightest copla star, Concha Piquer. Since those days, the trio has gone on to create thousands of songs, and their radio show is a bright light in the days of many Spaniards, who otherwise struggle with the harsh realities of current day Iberia. The trio, alongside Piquer, have popularized copla to such a degree that it has begun to appear in multiple films, most notably in the recent Morena Clara. The Andalusian trio has made great strides towards popularizing it in other countries as well, and especially de Leon’s aristocratic connections have helped them spread the genre into French National State, Germany and Austria.\n\n The copla genre is inherently Andalusian in origin, and it has especially reached wider audiences as many copla songs go against the grain of the conservative monarchist government, as they often detail the lives of Spain’s lowest classes, such as sailors, prostitutes and criminals. While this has riled up certain conservatives in Spain, especially the Carlists of Andalusia and members of Accion Popular’s traditionalist wing, the popularity of the trio has made them too important to be censored, and some within the government’s more liberal side have even suggested that we fund their radio show. While it would go against certain values of our party, the goodwill gained from such an investment could help AP polish its image in the eyes of the common people."

This isn’t her first tour either, as in the early 1920s Piquer toured the United States for many years until returning to her homeland. Said tour was a great success and stepping stone for her career, but the instability ailing the Americas has made such a tour impossible for now. However, as copla has been introduced to Germany and its allies through the solid successes of Spanish films, Piquer expects a very warm welcome as she begins her musical journey in Germany.\n\n The announcement has made many comedians around Spain speculate just how many luggage trunks the singer will take with her this time, as her last visit to the United States revealed a peculiar habit. Piquer tended to rent entire houses for accomodation while travelling, and thus would carry enormous amounts of baggage wherever she went, with linens, sheets, costumes and other textiles taking the vast majority of the space. Curiously, her husband carried two entire baggages simply for olive oil, as apparently the singer could not leave her homeland’s important cuisine cornerstone behind. Nonetheless, the state has sponsored part of her journey as a diplomatic mission, in hopes that this promotion of Spanish culture will bring people to visit our nation’s southern shores."

sprd.371.d:0 "To this day, property rights in Spain remain a hot topic, especially in rural areas where the large landowners dominate the market through their latifundios, massive estates where workers toil on rented property, or worse, as temporary seasonal labour. As economic hardship has engulfed Spain, proposals for alleviating it are raining in to the government in a downpour, ranging from radical transformations to moderate reforms. However, perhaps most curious has been the lobbying and debates of the Spanish Georgists, through their movement organ, the newspaper La Reforma Social, edited primarily by Baldomero Argente del Castillo. The ideology of Henry George has primarily been limited to the United States in influence, but at the start of the 20th century, a small circle of Spanish intellectuals from right- and left-wing parties organized the Liga Española para el Impuesto Único, aimed at introducing single tax system in Spain.\n\n In Seville during a period of reform in 1914, Blas Infante led a group of local members of the Liga to propose the implementation of the tax to fund the Ibero-American Exhibition, but this notion was turned down and while Georgism would still be promoted by famous figures like Infante and Joaquin Costa, it would slowly die down in relevancy. This was, until Baldomero Argente began his vacancy at the head of La Reforma Social, and in two years the paper has revitalized the ideas of Georgism due to the lack of true reforms in Spain and the political capital of Aldomero, with him being a known member of Primo de Rivera’s administration.\n\n While their political relevance remains low, many parties both on the left and right have begun to consider some of the ideas of Georgism as a possible supplement to their main ideals. Still, Georgism remains a minor force within Spanish politics, but should the political field of Spain stir from its lethargy, the ideas of Henry George could very well reach a whole new audience."

sprd.372.d:0 "Guardia Civil commander of Seville, comandante Santiago Garrigós, has reported troubling news. It would seem that the Republican-era regionalist movement, Junta Liberalista de Andalucía, has been resurrected by local regionalists, under the perfidious Blas Infante. Infante has been on the run since the restoration of the monarchy due to his republican and socialist leanings, but now it seems that he has used the chaos going on in Spain to begin promoting his  Andalusianist ideals once more. JLA was, in its infancy, a movement aimed at supporting autonomy of Andalusia similar to the proposed autonomy of Catalonia and Basque Country, and curiously enough a large part of JLA’s ideology was the creation of an uniquely Islamic-Andalusian identity, supporting the revitalizing of Andalusia’s Islamic past as one of the strongholds of Muslim rule in Iberia, while also recognizing that the region is Christian.\n\n Made up of many different ideologies, such as the more moderate agrarian socialist Infante, federalist republican Alfonso Lasso de la Vega and the radical socialist revolutionary Juan Alvarez-Ossorio, the movement is divided in most policies but united in their shared disdain for the Madrid government and their fervour in realizing the ideals of an autonomous, if not even an independent, Andalusia. While this party is far from the nationalist threat of the Basque separatists or Catalan terrorists, they are still a movement that could very well cause problems to the Spanish monarchy and thus must be monitored and suppressed if the chance to do so appears."

sprd.373.d:0 "The Spanish Protectorate of Morocco rarely interacts with movements from the mainland, but now news of such an event have reached the ears of Spanish government. The creation of Asociación Hispano-Islámica, a small group of Moorish-Andalusian and Moroccan nationalists have formed in the region around the local journalist Rodolfo Gil Benumeya. Gil, a Moorish Muslim born in Granada, has long been involved in Hispano-Moroccan relations, and served in Rif as a journalist for multiple different periodicals during the reign of Primo de Rivera.\n\n He has been able to avoid persecution from officials despite being a self-proclaimed Andalusian nationalist, as his rhetoric has often called for the inherent Spanishness of Moroccans, though with the caveat that he also thinks Spain is inherently Moroccan as well. Mostly ignored by officials before despite this eccentric view, his new group has raised eyebrows around the colonies after the AHI’s claims that Andalusia’s destiny lies in union with Morocco, not necessarily with Spain, a view Gil Benumeya has adopted from Moroccan nationalists. While he still reconciles that Andalusia is Spanish in nature, he considers the ancestral and religious ties of the Moors to the other side of the Gibraltar Strait to be far more important than the binding of Andalusia to Christian Spain that happened after the Reconquista.\n\n According to Spanish intelligence operatives, Gil Benumeya has been encouraged to adopt this more radical position after his recent trip to Cairo, where he met with other Arab and Moroccan nationalists, notably Abd el Krim, the infamous leader of the Rif rebellion a decade ago. The whereabouts of Gil Benumeya and his movement are unknown as of now, with some speculating that he has returned to Rif to rally support among local troublemakers, while others suggest that he has instead joined Blas Infante’s band of Andalusian separatists.

sprd.374.d:0 "At the famous Café Gijón, a meeting took place earlier this month, which seems to have began a new trend in Spanish poetry. These poets, who call themselves Garcilasistas, or alternatively Juventud Creadora, have met on the 400th anniversary of Garcilaso de la Vega’s death. The famous renaissance author was well-known for his exaltation of the poet soldier, and many historians consider him to be the man most important in bringing Italian renaissance style to Iberia.\n\n These new Garcilasistas, who include poets and writers Luis Rosales, Leopoldo Panero and Dionisio Ridruejo, differ notably from the earlier Generation of ‘27 poets, writers and painters in that they are markedly more conservative, and in some cases, such as with Dionisio Ridjuero, involved with radical right-wing extremists such as Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica. The group also breaks from earlier generations of artists by focusing mainly on the usage of sonnet in their style, and the central theme of Garcilasistas is a recycled and modified form of the earlier Republican-era popular neo-patriotic warrior poet, but placed in the framework of the nation, religion and Castilian supremacy, alongside more general themes of love and death.\n\n Their greatest inspiration seems to have been the chaotic and destructive situation of Spain, with all its different groups vying for power and clashing with one another, causing the Garcilasistas to yearn for a hero capable of appreciating and separating the beauty and love left in the world of chaos and violence of reality."

The colony of Rif, previously the location of the costly, if not catastrophic Rif War, is vital for Spanish economy due to the steel supplied by Minas del Rif company, but the government has continued to pilfer men and materiel from the colonial army to be used in the suppression of anarchists, socialists, Carlists and separatists back on metropolitan soil. However, while keeping order in Spain is of utmost importance, we cannot neglect the protection of the Rif as reports from our spies in Morocco and Cairo indicate that Abd el Krim has somehow made his way back to the former, and is planning to return to his native land for another uprising.\n\n Already, Riffian tribals have ramped up their attacks on our men, and there has been a good deal of desertions among the Regulares as well. While there is no conclusive evidence of Abd el Krim being in Morocco, the rebel is far too dangerous for the Spanish government to just let the possibility to intercept him slip by. As such, the government is now tasked with the possibility of finding a way to deal with the issue of reinforcing the colonies.\n\n The government could always just return the Legion troops brought to the mainland, but this would leave the defence of Spain to the hands of Guardia Civil, Carabineros and the reservists, who are basically untrained and unarmed for the most part. Another option is to enforce stricter control on the Regulares and to expand their ranks, but this would mean sending more officers into Rif to make sure that the colonial troops are not swayed by ideas of independence, leaving Spanish troops on the mainland less well-led. Finally, there is an option to hire foreign mercenaries, especially an American bomber squadron that fought in the original war, though it is dubious if these men will join our cause. "

Led by the famed globetrotter, Weltkrieg veteran and mercenary Charles Sweeny, the bomber squadron served alongside the French legion for roughly half a year, until they were forced to leave after the United States government intervened. Initially, the mercenaries were allowed to serve the French nationalists as the US government consider Abd el Krim to be a proxy of the Internationale, but as the war dragged on and the bomber squadron became involved in numerous controversies, such as bombing villages full of civilians and even targets that had surrendered, the American pilots were branded as war criminals using American bombs of Rifian babies. American media claimed that they would have supported the mercenaries’ involvement had they been fighting on the side of the Rif Republic.\n\n Following American demands for the mercenaries to leave, the French nationalists had no choice but to end the cooperation, and Escadrille Chefrienne left for their home once more. However, with America in chaos, Charles Sweeny has been looking for new opportunities abroad, and given that we have prior experience with working alongside these mercenaries, the government is presented with the opportunity of using their muscle to fight back the Rifian insurgency, no matter how low-level it may currently be. It would allow us to spare our elite troops from the Foreign Legion back here in mainland Spain, and we could simply supply the Americans with some of our older planes, such as the converted Beechcraft liaison aircraft bought from American companies."

Known as a apolitical reformer, he has worked in political roles as well, especially in relation to education, and his contributions to the history of Spanish law have earned him posts in judicial roles across the years as well, and he is known for being part of a process to create a network of courses and conferences that would make it easier for commoners and non-academic people to receive information and knowledge from the professors and doctors directly.\n\n His influence in global politics has not been massive, but whenever Altamira has worked on matters of global justice, he has often emphasized restraint, commitment to peace and dialogue between countries and alliances, a stance that got him nominated for a Nobel Peace Price in 1933.

Starting in 1912, the plan was to construct such a reservoir in the region of Benagéber, but the works only got underway in 1931, when the Republican government agreed to the construction of such a massive project. Originally, engineer Fausto Elío y Torres was supposed to lead the project, but due to clashes between the engineer and general directorate, he was replaced with Carlos Dicenta.\n\n The coup of Sanjurjada left the project unfinished, and more pressing matters meant that the reservoir was basically dead in the water, until now. To boost agrarian output in Valencia, given the lucrative properties in the region for growing oranges and grapes, the government has approved funding for the renamed Lucia Lucia reservoir after Valencian Accion Popular leader, Luis Lucia Lucia, replacing the Republican-era name ‘Blasco Ibáñez reservoir’, named after the famous Valencian Radical leader.\n\n Valencian radicals have protested the change, claiming it to be yet another insult to their founding father, who they argue was the central figure of Valencian identity, even dismissing his political standing. Their complaints have largely been ignored, and construction is expected to get underway soon, bolstered by some usage of penal labour from prisoners captured in Catalonia and Valencia, usually belonging to radical terrorist organizations such as CNT-FAI, Nosaltres Sols or Estat Catala. These prisoners are compensated with shorter sentences thanks to their contribution, and it has allowed the government to cut down immensely on construction costs. The locals have also protested the plans, as the village of Benagéber is located right in the area of the reservoir and will have to be flooded. The plans would envision relocating these villagers to three different new towns around the reservoir, but the village leaders claim that this plan would see entire families and communities shattered to different locations.

sprd.1108.d:0 "Few losses humbled Spain as much as the loss of Cuba, as the loss of our Caribbean holdings truly caused the sun to set on the Spanish empire. It had been in decline for centuries, but what little imperial glory had remained vanished as Cuba was pried from our grasp and left to the mercy of American domination. But as America spirals into chaos and destroys itself, Cuba is once more adrift, left barely over the water after American capital and industry packs its bags and heads back to the maelstrom that is the American civil war. These news have taken the intellectual and militarist circles of Madrid by storm, and a wave of imperialist fury has caused Spaniards to appeal to the crown and current government to cross the Atlantic Ocean and strike Havana, reclaiming the jewel of the Caribbean and restoring the pride lost to the barbarous Yankees. However, the long distance to the island and the long period of independence of Cuba has enjoyed have caused this imperialist movement to garner its fair share of critics, calling the colonialist dreamers naive and chauvinistic predators. As these two groups bicker over the nobility and righteousness of this colonial venture, the government must come up with its own stance on the matter and silence one of the sides in the debate."

sprd.1109.d:0 "Now that we have reclaimed Jaime’s true birthright and restored Bourbon rule over the eternal lands of France once more, just as it was meant to be, many hawkish politicians in Spain have called us to reclaim the mantle of France not just in the metropole, but throughout their former empire. The original French republic may have fallen to the syndicalist menace, and the remnant regime in Algiers become merely an impotent facade of the old order, unable to reclaim even their own lands. However, with Spain’s loyal sons triumphant over the Syndicalist vandals and terrorists, we can set to work on reclaiming France’s lost colonies in Africa and Asia. As the new Franco-Spanish identity settles between our two peoples, we can give the French part of our society back their pride as we reclaim our rightful colonies and soar to ever greater heights. The pretender regimes claiming dominion over Madagascar, Indochina, Cameroon and Gabon will be swept away, and French rule reestablished once more, governed in union with the Spanish loyalists."

As Spain and France are now united under one banner, Belgium and to some extent, Netherlands have been noted as possible future conquests. Belgium, while a nation of many different language groups, has a very large French-speaking population, which has led many to argue that it should be part of France altogether, as it should have always been simply a state of France from the beginning. Similarly, many Spaniards have echoed these sentiments, claiming that Spain holds a claim on the territory given our domination of Netherlands, and through them, Belgium, earlier in our history. While these claims are far weaker than those of our French compatriots, the irredentist sentiment has found a lot of support among our more right-wing elements of government and political parties. Organizations like Renovacion Espanola or Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica have called us to launch an immediate invasion, and whatever elements of Action Francaise, that have joined our regime that is, have generally supported this attack. However, there are others who view it as pushing the new union too far, as a war right as we are integrating the former Communard lands could give enough support for the splinter remnants of the Communards to revolt and cause significant issues."

sprd.1111.d:0 "As the Spanish nations set its sight upon the reclamation of its former colonies, many within the more radical parties have put forward rather outlandish ideas of conquest. Some firebrands with Renovacion Espanola have called for Spain to carve out its own Mittelafrika, others yet call for Spain to reclaim the South American colonies by force. Plans such as these are likely results of highly delusional minds, but as the sense of imperial grandeur begins to seep back into the minds of Spaniards, other, less diabolical, ideas have been put forward. One of these imperialist plans is the reclamation of Spanish Netherlands, an area that has not been a part of our empire since the Wars of Spanish Succession. Originally acquired by the Spanish Habsburgs after the split in the main Habsburg family in the mid 1550s, the provinces managed to slip away from Spanish grasp due to domestic weakness and exploitative neighboring powers. Many pacifist leaders, such as Julian Besteiro of PSOE and Angel Pestana of Partido Sindicalista have denounced any such ideas, but the more hawkish members of the Spanish parliament, especially among Accion Popular, Partido Nacionalista Espanola and Partido Radical have supported these ideas. While Netherlands itself is a price all of its own, situated right between the great powers of Europe and boasting a strong navy, its colonial possessions in Asia and the Americas are an even more lucrative price. Still, this venture could easily be considered ridiculous by the international audience, given that Spanish rule was highly contested by the Dutch during our almost two hundred year-long rule. Nonetheless, in this new age of imperialism, perhaps the time is ripe to revive the long-lost province of Spanish Habsburgs."

sprd.1112.d:0 "Spanish interest in the Apennines is nothing new, and for centuries we held various tributaries, protectorates and proxy states on the peninsula. Last of these was the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, headed by a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, known commonly as the Bourbon-Two Sicilies. This realm was lost during the Italian unification, but the troubles after the Weltkrieg led into the dissolution of Italian unity and the establishment of various splinter states sponsored by the dominant powers of Europe. One of these was the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, reborn as a ad hoc solution to the problem of Italian socialists gaining power. While Ferdinando III, the new king, only reluctantly accepted the position as a temporary solution, in these last two decades, circumstances have led to the kingdom becoming a mainstay of the peninsula. The instability of Spain prevented us from offering more than moral support and officer advisors, but now that Spain is finally relatively stable, we could offer more. Many within the Bourbon noble family have proposed sending an offer of alliance or even the creation of a dual monarchy with our Sicilian brothers, but should Sicilian monarchy fall, there is always the option of simply invading and annexing the tip of the peninsula."

sprd.1113.d:0 "The Spanish empire is dead, so much is clear. What once was has been lost into the maelstrom of time, and only our few colonies in the Atlantic and Africa remain. But despite our colonial legacy, a sense of brotherhood still remains among the various Spanish-speaking nations of the world, united by a roughly uniform language and cultural norms brought into the New World by the settlers after its discovery. While we may have our differences and grievances based on historical realities, as the memories of Spanish colonization fade among our South and Central American descendants, Spain is inching closer into the cultural sphere of these nations.\n\n The ease of communication brought about by the shared values and language has made Spanish companies easier clients than those of our German and Anglo rivals, and even in the deeply depressed state that the world has sunk into, many Spanish companies make profit selling products to our former colonies and vice versa. As such, movements promoting further unity between the world’s various Hispanic peoples have gained traction. Here is Spain, prominent Spanish philologist Ramón Menéndez Pidal has suggested creating a brotherly union with our former colonies, focusing on mutual cooperation and prosperity over Spanish domination of them. These ideas are not without their supporters in the New World either, as famous writers such as Uruguayan poet Juana de Ibarbourou and Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortiz Fernández have promoted Hispanism as an alternative to the United States promotion of Yankee-dominated Pan-Americanism. With our new transition to democratic governance and constitutionalism, many within the New World look up to us as an example of stability and liberty, and thus would most likely be open to an alliance uniting the Hispanic peoples under one common cause."

sprd.1120.d:0 "Ever since the Italian collapse following their defeat in the Weltkrieg, the Spanish crown has viewed the situation with concern. Our dynastic brethren in the south face increased internal pressure from republicans, syndicalists and far-right lunatics like Evola alike, mirroring the issues us Spaniards face on the daily. However, more important than the situation of Bourbon-Two Sicilies is the state of the Papal States, the seat of God’s highest representative on Earth and the very heart of the Catholic church, our strong benefactor. During the Italian collapse, many Spanish volunteers crossed the Mediterranean to fight the northern Red Horde, and partially thanks to the bravery and self-sacrificing nature of these volunteers, the Papacy was saved from those reavers and godless syndicalists.\n\n However, as the drums of war once more grow louder on the European continent, the situation of the Papacy grows more dire, and the aforementioned terrible state of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies hardly instills much confidence to the Spanish crown about their ability to defeat the syndicalists should they attempt to install their wretched rule over holy Roma. As such, right-wing conservatives all across Spain, from Christian democrats to Maurists to the traditionalists, integrists and Carlists all call for the Kingdom to take a more direct role in the matters of Rome, to protect the eternal city from atheist invaders and pillagers like we did in 1920s. However, there are also those who see intervention as a sure-fire way to earn the wrath of the Internationale, and we cannot ever hope to go against that large bloc of nations alone."

sprd.1121.d:0 "With the situation in Spain stabilizing, the Agrarians have started to look outward, over the Mediterranean once more, fired up on Africanist ambitions. Before the French and British collapse, many would-be Agrarians had harboured ideas of purchasing African territories from the French and British to fulfill Isabelline dreams of creating a truly North African colony for Spain in the Maghreb region, but especially following the French collapse, it is clear that the French National State will fight tooth and nail for every bit of sand in the Sahara it owns, and thus peaceful purchase of African land seems to be a pipe dream. However, despite the pacifist program of the Agrarians, some within the party have supported a more aggressive landgrab, arguing that the French National State is little more than a rotting old colonial outpost posing as the legitimate government, and a resurgent Spain with all the might of its armies behind it could easily destroy such a puny remnant.\n\n The French of course have the military might of the Entente on their side, but it’s debatable whether the Entente would continue a war after a collapse of the French nationalists. As such, we could finally fulfill the Isabelline ambitions of creating a colonial state ranging from the very edge of Atlas mountains in Spanish Rif to the shores of Tunisia. Some even support taking Corsica as an extra protective measure against the Communard navy, in similar vein to the Balearics which are now being built up to ensure Spanish naval dominance in this part of the Mediterranean"

sprd.1122.d:0 "With the situation in Spain stabilizing, the politicians of Accion Popular have started to look outward, over the Mediterranean once more, fired up on Africanist ambitions. The French Nationalist State was our ally in the terrible Rif War, but their situation has only deteriorated over time, and now, many Spaniards fear that the collapse of the French nationalists would either invite hordes of Arab and Berber nationalists to contest our small holdings in Rif, or allow Internationale to flood North Africa with syndicalist forces seeking to tear down the colonial order and ‘liberate’ the Maghreb region with their military might. As such, the previously ignored irredentist speeches of Ramón Serrano Suñer, a firebrand nationalist within Juventudes de Accion Popular, have started to gain traction within the party, even despite AP’s relatively non-violent and isolationist stances.\n\n Gil-Robles himself has not addressed the matter, but many within AP have increased calls to conquer Algeria and Morocco now that we actually have a chance to do so, to secure these regions so that Berbers or syndicalists cannot do the reverse and cause a much greater headache later. Of course, we would be facing the full might of the Entente, but the French nationalists have hardly any popular support in North Africa and rely on a brutal colonial order to sustain their rump state, meaning that a lightning strike launched from the Rif could likely topple the Algiers regime quickly and most likely cause the Entente to withdraw from the war. However, others argue that we cannot simply go toe-to-toe with one of the major factions of global politics, the French decline notwithstanding, and that such ambitions should just lead to the exclusion of Serrano Suñer from JAP."

sprd.1133.d:0 "As we have now joined a faction with Portugal, the national borders of Iberia have slowly started to dissolve since troop and economic movements are becoming commonplace. For both Portuguese and Spanish monarchists, this newfound close bond has rekindled an old idea of an Iberian union, an empire uniting both halves of the Pyrenean peninsula, in our case in a dual monarchy. This would allow us to better withstand the French threat, and given that such an union has historical basis in the former dual monarchy, Iberian Union, that existed between 1580 and 1640. Should we pursue this idea further and seek to propose the union to our Portuguese counterparts?"

sprd.1137.d:0 "As the Portuguese part of Iberia now stands firm as a part of the Iberian empire, a newfound sense of unity has arrived to the two peoples, so long separated by artificial differences. With Portugal and Spain now a singular entity united in cause and purpose, many citizens of these states have found it difficult to adjust to the new situation and adopt an identity that is neither Spanish nor Portuguese but Iberian. Still, a newfound sense of Iberism sweeps across the peninsula, and many new clubs, committees and parties are being set up to match the realities of this new union on all levels, be they administrative, cultural, political or just linguistic. As our cultures grow closer, the question of a proper national flag for our union has been raised. We can obviously keep the current design, uniting the colours of our two nations, but another option would be to create a wholly new design, one using the regal purple and an elaborate vine design mixed a vertical stripe of Iberia’s two halves colours. Finally, we could adopt an Austrian style flag with a double eagle to celebrate our Habsburg roots and the dual monarchy."

However, many others, especially more moderate members of the Spanish public, have urged us to set up a proper colonial administration that will handle things on a local level, without overbearing and confused Spanish middlemen causing issues there.

Obviously supporting the Internationale is out of the question, but we could trade with their enemies, either Germany’s gigantic yet highly unstable faction, Reichspakt, or Canada’s weak but highly revanchist faction, the Entente. Traditionally, Spain has had good trade relations with both, but we cannot supply both sides with meaningful material for war as their logistical needs are highly different.

Curiously enough, we have been approached by the Partito Popolare Italiano in hopes of uniting our two parties, as they view our movement more worthy of their support than the somewhat radical Accion Popular. Their ideology, Popularism, is a mixture of Catholic values and Christian democrat idealism, but refined to the point where they seek to create a society of harmonious communities, where differences in cultures between groups would not be a source of friction but of strength. Popularism is notably less focused on the individual than our movement generally is, but we could utilize their connections with the Italian rural folk to forge a new pact between the Christians of our two territories."

Interestingly enough, while the administration of his new state was being organized, many Spaniards from the ruling party PNE came across their Italian monarchist counterparts, and as part of this cultural and ideological exchange, PNE members were introduced to the concept of Neobourbonismo. While generally a rather Sicilian thing, its main tenet is utmost loyalty to the House of Bourbon and general hardliner monarchism, something which PNE has come to be known for quite well during its brief period as rulers of Spain. While this ideology is still in its infancy, many within PNE have called for us to adopt parts of it in order to better hone our own base of monarchism, and partially also to integrate the Italian monarchists into our rank easier."

sprd.1154.d:0 "As Spain has come to own the territories of the former French exiles, many within Accion Popular have approached this with great jubilation of finally achieving Spain’s Africanist vision. However, curiously, as our officers have been mingling with those Nationalist French generals who weren’t too bitter about their loss to not reply to them, they came across general Charles de Gaulle, a well-known French general and a close ally of Marshall Petain. Despite his grievances against our government, he shared many of his military views with our soldiers as many of our generals had fought alongside de Gaulle in the Rif War. Eventually talks turned to politics, and the French general shared that he considered the actions of the Accion Popular government in Spain to be quite inspirational to him in some measure. \n\nMany generals, also members of Accion Popular, wanted to know why this was, and de Gaulle shared his idea of a true French state, one built upon centralization of power, strong personality cult, limited welfare statism and some degree of democracy. As the talks between Accion Popular-aligned generals and de Gaulle continued long into the night, the next day these ideas of de Gaulle were brought to the attention of some Accion Popular politicians who had been in Algiers, creating a new colonial administration. As de Gaulle’s tenets spread among the party elites, some suggested that the party leader, “el Jefe” Gil-Robles, should adopt this ‘Gaullism’ as Accion Popular’s new way of thinking. Some find this absolutely preposterous, given how the ideology has never been put into action, but others see it as a rejuvenating force in a party that has for so long been seen as a stagnating one."

sprd.1155.d:0 "Upon the conquest of Italy, Izquierda Espanola found many former Italian republicans who approved many of our values, and this shared vision has brought the two peoples closer together. This has, obviously, also reached the Spanish academia, who have intermingled with their Italian counterparts, and as many of Izquierda Espanola’s members are educated members of various schools and universities, it was inevitable that the Italians would influence our politicians. By far the strongest influence has been that of Gaetano Salvemini, whose ideology is remarkably close to that of Manuel Azaña, promoting strong, anti-clerical republicanism as a means to curtail the radicalism of left and right-wing extremists while still enacting very radical reforms that would transform Italian society to be more equal, free and fair, without the need for tyranny or ignorance. Many have seen this similarity of ideology as worthy of integrating Salvemini’s much smaller party, Partido Democratico del Lavoro, into Izquierda Espanola, but this would obviously mean adopting some of their ideological leanings as well."

sprd.1156.d:0 "When the Communard revolution in France succeeded right after the Weltkrieg, the Spanish population was sent into a frenzy of fear, seeing syndicalist infiltrators around every corner. As CNT-FAI resistance grew bolder, many other groups also began to harbour traitorous thoughts. The Catalans had been a thorn in our side for quite some time, but the years of pistolerismo and Spain’s defeats in Rif War made their rebellion a very possible reality in Catalonia. After Primo de Rivera’s coup d’etat succeeded, one of his very first actions was to crack down on Catalan parties and regionalist organizations, even those that had previously supported Spanish rule, such as Liga Regionalista. Basque and Galician regionalists weren’t spared either, accused of being supported by the French to stir up trouble in Spain. Ironically, this persecution of Spain’s minorities drove them to accept help from the Communards, and despite our best efforts, regionalist and separatist parties are still under suspicion of sending volunteers to train in Southern France. Regionalism, especially in relation to the deeply centralist line adopted by the military after the Sanjurjada coup, has been on the rise, and even regions with relatively docile nationalist movements, such as Andalusia and Asturias, have been boldened by the rhetoric of their Basque, Catalan and Galician comrades."

sprd.1157.t:0 "Resurgence of Regionalism"
sprd.1157.d:0 "Spanish regionalism stems from the very varied demographics of our nation, with many regions of Spain having their own cultural quirks, traditions and in the case of Basques, Catalans, Galicians and Asturians, among others, their own languages. Especially with the Basques, this difference is stark, as these hardy people have lived in the Pyrenean mountains for millenia, forming a culture and language that is in many ways, completely alien to that of other European peoples. Yet despite these marked differences, Basques are among the most devout Catholics in Iberia and have taken part in various ventures of greater Spain during the centuries, and over the last century, Spanish immigrants have seriously started to become a major demographic in the Basque territories. Similar thing has happened in Catalonia, where the industrial city of Barcelona has drawn in quite a bit of Spanish immigrants, often prompting violent clashes between Spanish and Catalan nationalists. Catalans have long considered themselves separate from Spain, and as a hive of anarchism and ultranationalism, the region continues to cause grey hairs for Spanish administrators and soldiers alike. Compared to Basques and Catalans, Galicians remain a relatively aloof people, not particularly bothered with nationalism, though as the situation in Spain deteriorates, many more have been goaded into joining various nationalist Galician parties in order to abandon the sinking ship of Castile."

sprd.1158.d:0 "Basque nationalism was pioneered by Sabino Arana in the late 19th century, and his political party, Partido Nacionalista Vasco, is among the oldest parties in Spain. Promoting regionalism, Basque nationalism and traditionalism without monarchism, the party always aimed to create a free Basque republic, Euskadi, separating from Spain fully. However, after a split in the party leadership, the traditionalists and ultranationalists began to lose ground to the more moderate, Christian democratic faction, which during the republican years ditched the traditional PNV allies, Carlists, to join the left-wing republican coalition in pursuit of autonomy for the Basque country. \n\nWhile the republic died, the party was repressed and has since radicalized to adopt more of their nationalist outlooks, recruiting militants into its mountaineering organization. Basque region also houses a considerable amount of Carlists, and their stronghold, Pamplona, has long been a hive of vipers seeking to topple the rightful rule of the Alfonsists. Basque country is mainly dominated by PNV, thought Acción Nacionalista Vasca, a more left-wing party, has recently emerged to challenge PNV’s hegemony, while still remaining just as staunchly nationalistic. Cells of the Communist Party of Euskadi also remain in the territory, supported by French Jacobins, though their relevance is thankfully small."

The region houses greatest support for CNT-FAI, and while this movement has been reduced to a fraction of its former might, it still continues to plague local Carabineros and Guardia Civil officers. Catalan democratic parties, such as Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, Acció Catalana Republicana and Unión Democrática de Cataluña have also been caught promoting Catalan nationalism, and the leader of the radicalized youth section of ERC, Josep Dencàs, has even been accused of being a National Syndicalist. \n\nHowever, while the democrats are enough of a headache, they pale in comparison to the terrorists of Nosaltres Sols! and Estat Catala, two radical groups of ultranationalists engaging in political assassinations, bombings and hit and run attacks against the police. Nosaltres Sols! also contains a Sorelian wing, Moviment Nacionalista Totalitari, known for being in league with Valois and his Totalists. In addition to the ultranationalists, socialist and communist groups such as Partit Català Proletari and Unió Socialista de Catalunya have been known to organize strikes and sabotage to hamper our rule, motivated just as much by Catalan nationalism as they are by Marxist and syndicalist ideals."

In 1898, after Spain had lost its war against the United States and lost its colonies in the Caribbean and Asia, Spain attempted to sell their colony of Rio de Oro, a small strip of land in southern Morocco, to Austria-Hungarian empire. The Austrian crown was interested in this purchase, having stayed out of the scramble for Africa, but the Hungarian side of the dual monarchy blocked the purchase. Now that the situation has developed further, and Hungary has more pressing gains to be made on other matters, it could be possible to purchase this land from Spain. The price is hardly an issue, as Spain mainly intends this sale to be a show of goodwill now that they are part of our alliance, but many fear that the empire will overstretch itself if it seeks territories in Africa in addition to its considerable holdings in mainland Europe."

sprd.1161.d:0 "Compared to Catalans and Basques, the Galicians haven’t given us too much trouble just yet, though the rising nationalism of that region is troubling. Galicia never developed into a industrial powerhouse unlike Bilbao or Barcelona, and thus while the region has been active politically, it hasn’t been as radicalized by Spanish immigrants as Basques and Catalans have. However, a small group of Galician nationalists, Irmandades da Fala, started the development towards a more nationalist approach to Galicianism, and while the group still exists, it has been superceded by Partido Galeguista as the leader of Galician nationalism. \n\nWhen the republic was proclaimed in 1931, Galicians even went as far as to declare the independence of an independent Galician republic, which merely lasted a day before quietly reintegrating back into Spain proper. However, years have radicalized Galicianism, and new parties such as Vangarda Nazonalista Galega have pushed radical Galician nationalism even further. Some Galicianists advocate for an independent state, while others push for a federal union with Portugal too, given the alleged Celtic heritage of Galicians. There are even more radical followers of Galicianism too, such as Vicente Risco, a known esotericist, influenced by such extremist ideologies such as the Austrian Ariosophy. The harsh repression has pushed even moderate Galicianists, who during the republic pushed for a federalized Spain, such as ORGA party, into open defiance towards Madrid. While Galicia may not be the powder keg that Catalonia is, we must keep an eye on the developments of the region."

sprd.1162.d:0 "Asturian and Andalusian regionalists are hardly even worthy of the title, existing as fringe groups with little popular support, or so we would’ve thought before the recent Asturias rising. Workers from CNT-FAI and UGT organized a strike of great magnitude and the military response to this insubordination of national duty led the Asturians into a proper uprising.  The uprising leadership, made up of socialist Belarmino Tomás and the syndicalists Segundo Blanco and Amador Fernández, proclaimed itself the Sovereign Council of Asturias and León. While short-lived and bereft of any international support besides a small volunteer cadre from Third Internationale, it marked the first appearance for a concentrated Asturian state in the 20th century. \n\nAfter the rising, the Madrid government was quick to crack down on any sentiments of independence or even simple regionalism in the region, and institutions or individuals promoting the Asturian language were destroyed or executed for treason. However, a fire yet burns in the hearts of Asturians, and unless we act decisively against this insidious threat, they may attempt another uprising in the future."

sprd.1163.d:0 "In the future, the event known as Sanjurjada may very well be regarded as the defining moment of the 1930s in Spain, given its impact on the nation in a very similar way to the 1923 coup by Miguel Primo de Rivera. The coup, led by general Jose Sanjurjo, leader of the Guardia Civil police force, was heavily sponsored by the German Kaiserreich and French National State in Algiers, who had observed the proclamation of the republican regime with disinterest until the republicans aligned with Spain’s socialists. Fearing a socialist takeover and the inclusion of Spain into the Third Internationale, the Kaiserreich sent both material and economic support for the plotters, while the French forces were even prepared to offer direct intervention. With the red scare overtaking Spain, the leadership of Accion Popular, especially its rising star Jose Maria Gil-Robles, aligned with the coup leadership, and even the Carlists offered support in the form of their Requete militias.\n\n While the coup’s military support was rather low, its financial backing by foreign powers and a sudden endorsement by the exiled king Alfonso XIII led to a lightning success when Guardia Civil managed to overthrow government rule in Madrid. Riots broke out all over Spain and anarchist militias rose up in Catalonia, prompting even those military officers who had not been on the side of the plotters to join the fighting. With the republicans in shambles after the loss of Madrid and the rapid endorsement of Sanjurjo’s regime by both the French nationalists and Reichspakt, the Republicans could do little but escape to friendly countries. The Internationale, almost on the brink of intervention in Catalonia, was too slow to react and could only watch in horror as their potential ally in Iberia turned back towards reactionary monarchism. The coup leadership installed Accion Popular as the civilian government, though heavily controlled by the military, and Alfonso XIII was restored to the throne of Spain in a brief ceremony. The Carlists, who had hoped for the military to support their claimant instead due to the support of the Requetes during the coup, became increasingly radicalized by the betrayal, and promising talks between Carlists and Alfonsists that had happened before the coup became an impossibility once more ."

sprd.1164.t:0 "The Beaten and Battered CNT-FAI"
sprd.1164.d:0 "The anarchists of CNT-FAI managed to drum up enough support for a wide-scale battle against the military in Catalonia, but due to the quick efforts of both the ruling commander of Barcelona, Dominique Batet, and the organization of anti-anarchist militias in the form of Carlist Sindicatos Libres, the anarchists found their offense stalling, and the arrival of military reinforcements forced the CNT-FAI militants into hiding once more. Another uprising against the military would be attempted in 1934, when the miners of Asturias rose up in opposition to the government’s increasingly harsh policies towards the proletariat, and a short-lived Sovereign Council of Asturias was proclaimed. The anarchists of CNT-FAI were quick in taking advantage of this rising, and similar uprisings happened in Catalonia, Andalusia and the Biscayan coast, in addition to terror bombings, assassinations and the firebombing of military barracks and Catholic convents.\n\n  These uprisings were brutally crushed, and the resulting crackdowns almost caused CNT-FAI to fade from Spanish politics, causing the emergence of a moderate wing of the movement. These moderates, led by figures such as Salvador Segui, Ángel Pestaña and Juan López Sánchez, pushed for the abandonment of violent action, and instead advocated for continued use of strikes, even at general level, as well as the biding of time until the regime would inevitable collapse upon itself. Some, like Ángel Pestaña, even proposed that when elections would be restored, CNT-FAI should transition into a proper political parties, seeking change through political reform rather than revolutionary action. The moderates, while still a minority, are increasingly gaining ground inside CNT-FAI as the violent actions seem to only lead to more misery among its supporters after harsh reprisals, which in turn lead to increased apathy among them. Yet should our regime commit mistakes in handling the anarchists, the radical wing of CNT-FAI is still very much strong enough to start another rebellion to achieve their revolutionary ideas."

sprd.1165.t:0 "The Republican Exodus"
sprd.1165.d:0 "In the aftermath of Sanjurjada, the military issued a country-wide purge of Republican leaders, party members and military officers aligned with Republican ideas. In weeks, most of Spain’s republicans had either been killed, imprisoned or exiled, some being forced into the colonies of Rif, Sahara and Equatorial Guinea to avoid the possibility of a counter-coup. Officers known for sympathizing with the Republic’s cause, such as Gonzales Quiepo de Llano and Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer, were posted in remote places like Canary Islands or Guinea for this reason as well. Many republicans sought refuge in America, fleeing either to the United States or the republics of South and Central America.\n\n  Many Galician republicans settled in Cuba as well. The most left-leaning republicans found shelter in the Third Internationale, while for the most right-leaning members Austria, Germany or other European states turned out to be the easiest option. Global reactions to the coup varied, with many Hispanic democracies decrying it as a clear military intervention in democratic process and destruction of the Spanish dream for liberty. United States and Russia denounced the coup as reactionary installation of a dictatorship, while Reichspakt, Austria and Entente were either ambivalent or supportive of the regime and at best considered the republicans naive collaborators of the Internationale."

sprd.1001.d:0 "Seeking to put their recent technological breakthroughs to the test, Spanish aeronautical engineers working off American designs came together to create new military hardware to be tested on the frontlines here at the fringes of the Latin world. The centerpiece invention of these new shipments is the Ciera C5. These ‘hoverflies’ are unique aircraft that can take off and land vertically, and have been dubbed helicopters or advanced autogyros by the initial designers. Primarily designed to quickly ferry supplies and precious cargo in and out of rough areas and terrain, some of these helicopters have also been out-fitted with weaponry, functioning as basic light aerial gunships and bombers while also being adept at recon and supply. Looking more like something out of Da Vinci’s sketchbooks and less like a real war machine, we shall give these new helicopters and the other tech the Spanish sent us a thorough testing against the varied enemies of our alliance."

sprd.1166.d:0 "The Spanish Kingdom has finally returned to the true form without the liberal interlopers, but there is still considerable question as to what form the new monarchy would take. The right-wing parties that have frequently collaborated with the monarchy have all gathered in the Cortes, alongside the king himself and his closest advisors and aides. Few expected there to be a drastic shift in the governance of Spain as it currently stands, as Accion Popular has held the reins of power since 1932. However, the public opinion towards them has soured, and there are rumours that the king and military view the party with increased disdain for their failures to reform the state and avoid the separatist uprising.\n\n As such, while the citadel of Accion Popular suppressed the strength of other right-wing parties for nearly half a decade, it seems that the time has come for them to be replaced, though it’s just as likely that the rumours could be false and AP retains its governmental position. However, should the incumbent party be dislodged from its position, there are three likely rivals that could take its place. The most likely replacement is the Unión Monárquica Nacional, a neo-conservative party originally formed in 1930 to support the monarchy before the republican proclamation, and the party collapsed shortly after, returning after the Sanjurjada to support the military. Led by the rising stars of Spain’s right, such as Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera and Santiago Fuentes Pila, the party is outwardly monarchist but also represents the interests of the military as much of its support comes from monarchist officers and the clique of general Sanjurjo. Less likely to win but still considerably strong are the resurrected Partido Liberal-Fusionista, with the Liberal dropped from the name to appease the other parties. \n\nPartido Fusionista is little more than a collection former Restoration era liberals and moderate conservatives serving the caciquist machine of its leader, Count of Romanones Álvaro de Figueroa y Torres. Remaining as one of the last nominal liberals to align with the regime, the Count’s closeness to the old king Alfonso XIII and his family has made him invulnerable to persecution even to the anti-liberal forces currently ruling Spain. However, calling the Count a liberal is hardly accurate, as he represents the political system of the Restoration era, the festering corruption, cronyism and grift. In stark contrast to the Fusionists is the Acción Española, a cultural organization of Spanish ultra-conservatives, integralists and social Catholics who wish to create a Spain modelled somewhat after the Lusitanian model, though with a far greater emphasis on the idea of Hispanidad, the inherent nature and qualities of Spaniards, and how these contrast with the perfidious separatists. Should the king seek to replace his lackeys in Accion Popular, there are bound to be interesting times ahead for Spain as its rivals take the reins of governance."

Albiñana’s PNE doesn’t subscribe to any particularly ideology beyond supporting the traditional societal structures of Spain and incorporating a degree of progressive ideas into his movement, their strongest characteristic is the ruthless paramilitaries, the Legionaries of Albiñana, who are bound to destroy any leftovers of liberalism, syndicalism and socialism in Spain should they be let loose upon the population.\n\n Less likely to win but still considerably strong are the agrarians of Partido Agrario Español led by José Martínez de Velasco y Escolar, who represent moderate traditionalism and monarchism, still heavily supportive of the authoritarian monarchy but not particularly heavy-handed in the methods used to achieve it. Their opposite is the ultra-Catholic party of Jose Calvo Sotelo, Renovación Española, who are notably strong followers of the French nationalist figure Charles Maurras. They believe that the transformation of Spain into an integral kingdom governed through the natural organic structures within its society and the near total domination of all aspects of society by Catholic principles will save Spain from suffering a crisis of the level that rattled Spain.

sprd.1168.d:0 "As Spain has begun to take back its rightful territory in the world, it would have been too good to be true if there had been no hitch-ups or issues. One of the simplest is the lack of funds, as colonial ventures are notoriously expensive. Now, we could of course just raise taxes or simply stop expanding, but given the recent uptick in nationalist fervour, this would likely be quite unpopular, and while the colonies are expected to be profitable, these profits will take a while to start mounting up, just as they did with our colony of Rif after we captured said territory and got its iron mines up and running. But while Rif is quite profitable thanks to its iron ore, its counterpart on the other side of Morocco proper, Rio de Oro, has not been nearly as great of a venture. In fact, back in 1898, right after our humiliating defeat at the hands of the Yanks, the crown attempted to sell it Austria, but this was blocked by the other part of Austria-Hungary’s dual monarchy, the Hungarians. Now, however, reports have come in that Austrians would be willing to renegotiate this deal, and in exchange for a foothold in Africa, they would offer us funds to fuel our colonial ventures. While this would mean giving away yet another of our few colonies, it would be given to an ally of ours and quite frankly, the territory of Rio de Oro is not that important to the Spaniards. As such, the king has approved the Austrian request, but the government must approve it as well."

Bits and pieces remained here and there, such as the Islas Carolinas island chain in Micronesia, but with the loss of Philippines, the Spanish East Indies project was thoroughly dead. Humbled by its defeat and in dire straits economically due to war debts and the loss of the lucrative Cuban sugar trade, Spain was forced to sell the island chain to Germany, who had sought control of it decades earlier.\n\nHowever, the islands were first discovered by Spanish explorer Toribio Alonso de Salazar, and the islands remained under Spain for centuries, their ownership only coming to question in1885 as Germany and United Kingdom protested our rightful establishment of a local customs office. The ensuing crisis with Germany over the ownership of the islands was then resolved by the Holy See, and Germany was given access to a naval facility on the island chain to utilize as a naval base, something they never did. Even after the sale of these islands, Germany has hardly developed them at all, and the occupation of the islands by Japan and the ensuing retaking of them by the German forces at the end of the Weltkrieg did a degree of damage to local infrastructure.\n\nIt is clear that Germany holds these lands for little purpose, and with their recent economic woes, it could be possible for Spain to purchase this islands back. Islas Carolinas themselves are not particularly impressive as far as colonial holdings go, but they could serve as a starting point to our return to Asian waters, acting as a springboard towards retaking Philippines now that the Americans are falling into internal strife and disarray. However, there are those within our government who think that the money should instead be spent on improving the lives of Spanish people, not towards a colonial vanity program."

The Caroline Islands in Micronesia have recently caught the attention of the Spanish crown, as they slowly recover from the death spiral that was their nation since the 1930s. The Spanish ambassador to Berlin has proposed that the sale of these islands, originally sold by Spain to Germany in the end of the 1800s, would be reversed. Spain is offering to buy the islands back for the same sum that the German empire originally bought them for, which normally would be a laughable proposition, but the Spaniards have also offered to help defend the Pacific threat from possible Japanese threats. Seeing as Ostasien has quite a bit of territory to manage currently, the sale seems lucrative, especially considering the Islands have very little of actual value besides strategic positioning in the Micronesian region."

Now that we control Douala, the German giant is visibly bursting at seams, and it is likely that the collapse of this unstable artificial construction is at hand.

Among the many potential targets for this expansion is Portugal, long standing at the edge of Iberia, and formerly an integral part of the Kingdoms of Spain, this nation slowly drifted away from our grasp and despite attempts to reignite relations, such as the Iberian Union project, the nations of Spain and Portugal have remained separate. Yet to many, this reality is unacceptable, as the destiny of Portugal is intrinsically linked to that of Spain, and as such, many view a military conquest of this strip of land at the end of Europe to be the glorious re-entry to global politics that Spain needs. Yet the moderates within the new regime have viewed such attacks as illegitimate, as the Portuguese have been good neighbours to us and did not use our recent weakness to their advantage.

A popular suggestion drawing from the Spanish adoration for the Austrian empire is to adopt a flag in the style of Austria-Hungary, depicting the coat of arms of both nations. Another common suggestion is one merging the most striking symbols of both nations’ authoritarian monarchists, with Spain readopting the Burgundian Cross as the Carlists no longer hold any ownership over it, while the Portuguese part of the empire would be represented by the Order of Christ cross. Finally, perhaps the most extravagant suggestion is a flag combining the Burgundian Cross, merged coat of arms of Portugal and Spain, Order of Christ Cross and the Cross of Santiago on a white and blue background."

The new flag would keep the militant eagle and Cross of Santiago, strong symbols of the party, but change the dual colours of Spain for a singular mono-colour one, with a Burgundian style cross positioned behind the eagle to show the traditionalist roots of the party and its harmony with the Carlists.

As such, suggestions on how to improve the design and truly represent the magnitude of our crusade have arrived to the Royal Palace, and now, work has begun to choose a new representation of the resurgent Holy Roman Empire. The option to keep the current flag is always on the table, but should the king desire a change, another option would be to adopt a slightly modified double-headed eagle with the Holy Roman coat of arms. Many view this as too detached from its Spanish roots, and suggest adding a Burgundian cross to represent the Hispanic spirit and imperial Spanish roots, while keeping the traditional yellow of Holy Roman Empire. Others have suggested a return to truly Spanish colours by replacing the yellow with white, but perhaps the most radical departure would be to adopt the black and yellow design, to proclaim our challenge to the Austrian Habsburgs as the true successors of Holy Roman Empire."
